"'11-03-01,'0','February’s designation as Black History Month remains controversial (Why confined to a single month? Why the shortest month?), but the release of books highlighting African American history and themes is now a predictable part of the publishing and school curriculum calendars. And while they differ wildly in tone, consider two books: “Giant Steps to Change the World,” confident and inspirational; “Underground,” mournful and stark. Both seek to convey a sense of much trammeled, Obama-style hope.The achievement of  “Underground” is to summon up for young readers the spirit and emotions — desperation, fear and, ultimately, celebration — of the Underground Railroad. Infused with tension, Shane W. Evans’s nearly monochromatic paintings are intensely atmospheric (so much so that they may frighten younger readers). The eyes of crouched slaves reflect the moonlight, creating ghostlike figures. A mother shushes a wide-eyed child clutched to her breast.The text’s brevity — “The darkness,” reads the first page; another says simply, “The fear”; a third, “Some don’t make it” — chillingly evokes the suppressed voices of the slaves shown on the page. This is more a poetic invocation of slavery and freedom than a real history. Young readers will need further explanation; older readers will want it. But the triumphant smile of a father, holding a newborn aloft in the boldly yellow sunshine requires no explaining at all.“Giant Steps” likewise uses spare text to evoke grand ideas, in this case, the accomplishments of  a range of heroes and heroines, from the expected, like Jesse Owens, Mother Teresa, Langston Hughes), to the less so, like Jean-Michel Basquiat (kindergarten may not be quite the time to introduce the concept of heroin overdose).Sean Qualls (“The Baby on the Way,” “Little Cloud and Lady Wind”) offers a vibrant mix of painting, drawing and collage to depict the challenges each hero surmounted: Harriet Tubman is illustrated with a puppet shadow image of an adult reaching for a child’s hand; Albert Einstein’s tell-tale silhouette is filled in with a geometric design and his most famous mathematical equation. The accompanying introduction of Einstein — “While some may say you are crazy, wild or even selfish, you know you are just like the scientist who had a hard time learning to read, but whose theories became the basis for most of modern science” — may hearten kids stumbling over phonics. Every Spike Lee fan will easily recognize the filmmaker’s penchant for heralding the achievements of outsider figures who conquered the odds.The book opens and closes with well-chosen quotations. “Determination and perseverance move the world,” from Marva Collins, an American educator; “Keep us flying!” from the Tuskegee Airmen. But their names appear only on the endpapers.  Labels on each spread would have been helpful to younger readers, though older ones will enjoy the guessing game. Either way, these are people whom children will be eager to acquaint themselves with.'"

"'11-03-01,'0','BEIJING — China’s environment minister on Monday issued an unusually stark warning about the effects of unbridled development on the country’s air, water and soil, saying the nation’s current path could stifle long-term economic growth and feed social instability.In an essay published on the agency’s Web site, the minister, Zhou Shengxian, said the government would take a more aggressive role in determining whether development initiatives contributed to climate change through a new system of risk assessment.Ignoring such risks, Mr. Zhou said, would be perilous.“In China’s thousands of years of civilization, the conflict between humankind and nature has never been as serious as it is today,” he wrote. “The depletion, deterioration and exhaustion of resources and the worsening ecological environment have become bottlenecks and grave impediments to the nation’s economic and social development.”His comments, coupled with similar remarks by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao that were publicized in the state media on Monday, suggest that China may seek to embrace tighter environmental restrictions during legislative sessions that begin this week in Beijing. The meetings, held once a year, will include the introduction of the country’s latest five-year economic plan.On Sunday, Mr. Wen lowered the target for average gross domestic product growth, to 7 percent from 7.5 percent, and suggested that China would reconfigure the emphasis that places economic growth above all else.“We must not any longer sacrifice the environment for the sake of rapid growth and reckless roll-outs, as that would result in unsustainable growth featuring industrial overcapacity and intensive resource consumption,” said Mr. Wen in an Internet chat widely publicized by the state media.'"
"'11-03-01,'0','During my annual physical, my doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital had remarked how loud and distinct my click was. Would I consider volunteering as a “patient,” so fledgling medical students could listen and learn?I was intrigued by the chance to gain perspective on the doctor-patient interaction. Make that “Patient-Doctor II,” the intentionally reversed name of this second-year course that focuses on learning the physical examination.Now, as I sat in an open-stringed green-and-blue-print cloth gown, I began to wonder if the students realized they were examining a live human being, as opposed to a particularly sophisticated anatomical model.The fourth student who strode to my chair was a guy I remembered from a cardiology lecture I’d attended at the outset, taught by Dr. Katharine Treadway. He’d sat up front and answered her toughest questions, brimming with enthusiasm and brains. I had found myself rooting for his medical career. Now he listened, smiled at me and said, “Awesome!”That broke the ice. At last I was a person, not a prop.The next student opened with “Hi, how are you?” When she finished, she said, “Thank you very much!”In this class “listening” had more than one meaning, as Dr. Treadway had illustrated with a cautionary tale. About 10 years earlier a woman agreed to let students hear her heartbeat. She had an advanced condition called severe mitral regurgitation and needed a valve replacement.One student examined her, removed the stethoscope and blurted to the instructor, “How can she live if her heart is this bad?”“This was a student who is not uncaring or unkind,” Dr. Treadway told the class. “But in that moment she did something all of us do all the time: she was so engaged with the problem that she forgot about the person who had the problem.”As students master the intricacies of the physical exam, “the experience of that patient’s illness will be completely invisible to you, unless you consciously look for it,” she warned, adding: “At the end of every interview, say to the patient, ‘How has it been for you, being in the hospital?’ I want to bring you back to the patient.”Now the Irish physician’s group departed, and the second group trundled in. This doctor introduced me right away. He had an easy and personable way about him, and I admired his arty cuff links.Again, some of the students spoke to me, while others did not. One let his hand linger too long on my shoulder as he thanked me and turned to walk away: creepy.Another remained stony-faced as he fumblingly examined me, never saying a word: really creepy. So inept was he that I decided not to lean forward, thus making my heart more difficult for him to hear. (Doctors who don’t earn the trust of their patients, by the way, are more likely to be sued in a malpractice claim.)I didn’t become a full-fledged person until the 10th exam, this one at the hands of a student with short combed-forward hair and rectangular wire-rims.“Hi, my name is Ben,” he said with a warm, professional smile as he looked me in the eye and shook my hand. I was instantly at ease.Ben moved with natural confidence, as if he had been practicing cardiology for decades. While listening he closed his eyes, the better to hear the subtly separate click between the two heartbeats.He made such a vivid impression in person — kind, compassionate, smart, capable, intuitive — that when I later played back our exchange on my digital recorder, I was surprised that his soft voice had barely registered. At the end of the session I asked him why he wanted to be a doctor.“I had an experience in the hospital with my mom, who passed away,” he told me. “That’s when I realized what I wanted to do.”The third group seemed to have picked up a few pointers. The doctor in charge not only called me by name, but rubbed her hands and the stethoscope to warm them up, which the students mimicked. They greeted me at the start and thanked me at the end.Before beginning, they explained where they would be placing the stethoscope and why. And they listened to my heart intently, for longer stretches — one fellow for 5 minutes 25 seconds: a lot of listening.Feeling like an acknowledged human being, I was more apt to adjust my posture for them and inquire whether they had heard what they were listening for. I wanted to meet them halfway; I felt I owed them a good click.Still, it was not until the 18th student — the last — that someone bothered to ask my first name. She told me hers and shook my hand. How wonderful it felt to finally say my name, to be heard and seen.At the end, I asked if I, too, could listen to my heart. The doctor handed me her stethoscope and placed the diaphragm on my chest. I donned the headset. “Other way,” the students said in unison. I turned it so the earpieces pointed in the right direction.Like them, I had to listen silently and for a long stretch. At first I couldn’t discern the click. I leaned forward, breathed in and out, and held my breath.Then I heard it. To my ears it didn’t sound like a click so much as a rolling wave with an accent in the middle. But I heard it — my billowing valve, my flapping leaflet — and I was transfixed.A few minutes later my Mass General doctor, Diane Fingold, walked in. Dr. Fingold is helping to rewrite the Harvard Medical School curriculum.At Harvard, she explained, students don’t touch patients until the second year; some schools even delay that fundamental skill until the third. Now a move is afoot to make this happen right away, in the first year, so the connection quickly becomes natural and ingrained. Blending the mechanics of the physical exam with meaningful conversation is what Dr. Fingold calls “the unwritten curriculum.”I asked what she had learned about listening in her 20-some years as a physician.“When I was not able to help someone or not able to cure a disease,” she replied, “my personal temperament and way of coping was to talk a lot.“What I’ve learned is to shut up and listen and be comfortable with silence. Because that allows people who are not talkers to have a place and a space to speak. As the doctor who’s in a position of power, there’s this feeling that taking a medical history is something active — but you need to be an active listener.”I told her I had seen stark differences among the students. Some, like Ben, seemed to be born doctors. Others appeared to have no grasp of human connection.“We used to assume,” she said, “that people who went to medical school were all compassionate, were all good listeners — that we just needed to give them the knowledge and they would be good doctors. We now know that’s not the case.“But we don’t give up on the ones who don’t have it from the beginning. We can give feedback that helps. It won’t make a stiff lab-rat type into a palliative-care oncologist. But it can make a difference.”Dr. Treadway quietly leaned in the doorway, listening to our conversation. After a few minutes, she said: “There are some doctors who do not view you as a patient. They view you as someone with a heart murmur who they’re going to listen to.”Then she told a story about a physician who had lectured her second-year medical school class in the 1970s. He described being in intensive care for three weeks with a frightening, potentially fatal condition.“He told us that one of the things that had surprised him most about being a patient was that every single person he interacted with — be they nurse, resident, senior physician, respiratory tech, physical therapist — it was as though they had a neon sign on their forehead that said either ‘I care’ or ‘I don’t care.’ ”But what illuminates those neon signs? What are the clues that were so starkly apparent to me, even in second-year medical students?Perhaps the answer lies in the medical lexicon. Auscultation — listening to heart sounds with a stethoscope — is a required skill. But actually feeling the vibration of a murmur through the chest wall is a rarer proficiency.The students had just learned the technical term for a heart murmur that a physician can feel: a “thrill.” As any patient knows, the touchstone of a good doctor is the ability to feel one’s heart.'"
"'11-03-01,'0','GENEVA — The chief executives of BMW and PSA Peugeot Citroën warned Monday that the auto industry would have to prepare itself for permanently higher fuel prices and said they would work together to develop new hybrid propulsion systems.In what promises to be a theme of the Geneva International Auto Salon, which opens to the media on Tuesday, Norbert Reithofer, the chief executive of Bayerische Motoren Werke, said that he could imagine the price of oil remaining above $100 a barrel, or even twice that.“It will be a real challenge for the car industry,” Mr. Reithofer said.Philippe Varin, chairman of the managing board of PSA, was also braced for hefty prices. “The price of oil will not come down,” he said.Pressure to find ways to save fuel, and to shift to vehicles that draw at least some of their power from the electric grid, is prompting companies to cooperate on the huge investment in research and development that will be required.BMW and PSA said they would invest €100 million, or $138 million, initially in a new joint venture to be called BMW Peugeot Citroën Electrification. The two companies, which already cooperate on engines for smaller cars, said that the venture would allow them to share the cost of hybrid components, which combine batteries, electronic components and internal combustion engines to save fuel and cut emissions.'"
"'11-03-01,'0','If all goes as planned, within a couple of years, tourists will be rocketing into space aboard a Virgin Galactic space plane — paying $200,000 for about four minutes of weightlessness — before coming back down for a landing on a New Mexico runway.Sitting in the next seat could be a scientist working on a research experiment.Science, perhaps even more than tourism, could turn out to be big business for Virgin and other companies that are aiming to provide short rides above the 62-mile altitude that marks the official entry into outer space, eventually on a daily basis.A $200,000 ticket is prohibitively expensive except for a small slice of the wealthy, but compared with the millions of dollars that government agencies like NASA typically spend to get experiments into space, “it’s revolutionary,” said S. Alan Stern, an associate vice president of the Southwest Research Institute’s space sciences and engineering division in Boulder, Colo.He is a spirited evangelist for the science possibilities of what is known in aerospace circles as suborbital travel. Just as important as the lower cost, scientists will be able to get their experiments to space more quickly and more often, Dr. Stern said.“We’re really at the edge of something transformational,” he added.Dr. Stern’s institute announced Monday that it has signed a contract and paid the deposit to send two of its scientists up in Virgin’s SpaceShipTwo vehicle. Southwest also intends to buy six more seats — $1.6 million in tickets over all.That follows an announcement on Thursday that Southwest is buying six seats from another suborbital company, XCOR Aerospace of Mojave, Calif., which has been charging $95,000 a seat for tourists. XCOR’s Lynx space plane carries just two people — the pilot and the paying passenger — so each flight will carry an experiment and an institute scientist.“We have built, on our own dime, three payloads,” Dr. Stern said. “We’re buying tickets, before there is a government program from suborbital providers, for our own people to fly with those experiments.”One of the Southwest experiments will look at how loose soil and rocks like those that cover asteroids behave. Another will fly an ultraviolet telescope that flew on the space shuttle Discovery in 1997. The third is a biomedical harness to measure heartbeat, blood pressure and other physical parameters of the scientist during flight.When the experiments will get to space has not been set. Neither company has yet announced when commercial flights will begin, but eventually SpaceShipTwo could fly once or twice a day, and the Lynx is designed for up to four flights a day.Virgin has already performed unpowered glide tests for the six-passenger SpaceShipTwo at Spaceport America in New Mexico and will begin powered ones soon. XCOR may begin flight tests of the Lynx later this year.Two other companies — Blue Origin, created by Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, and Armadillo Aerospace — are also developing spacecraft for the tourist business. Another company, Masten Space Systems Inc., is developing a suborbital vehicle that will carry only payloads, not people.Even if only some of these companies succeed, the prospect is that in a few years, hundreds of suborbital flights could be taking off every year. Dr. Stern predicted that even though a single flight would offer only a few minutes of weightlessness, the cumulative time of the suborbital experiments could quickly overtake that of the International Space Station, which has been in orbit for more than a decade.NASA will be flying automated scientific payloads on Masten and Armadillo rockets this year, and the agency will provide more opportunities for researchers in future years, although it has not offered to buy seats for people to accompany their experiments.For scientists, that could finally provide them ready access to space.“It’s almost impossible to get research on the space station at the moment,” said Mark Shelhamer, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University medical school who would like to study people’s balance and other motor sensory abilities before and after suborbital flights.On Earth, gravity is the dominant force, and many common processes — the way that water boils, for instance, and that a flame burns — behave much differently without it. But many of the theories describing how physics should work in weightlessness have not been tested in detail.'"

Approval on these two issues paved the way for the listing to proceed.The original IPO plan called for Star to float 30 percent of its shares, with PTT’s stake cut to 25 percent and Chevron’s to 45 percent.The listing is in line with government policy to offer shares in all local refineries to the public.

"'11-03-02,'1','VERNON, Calif. — Vernon is a bleak, 5.2-square-mile sprawl of warehouses, factories, toxic chemical plants and meat processors that looks like the backdrop for “Eraserhead,” the David Lynch movie set in an industrial wasteland. It has a population of 95 — and 1,800 businesses, drawn by low taxes, lax regulations and cheap municipal power.It also has a history of corruption and public malfeasance going back nearly 50 years.But now, this industrial city two miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles is fighting for its very survival.Vernon has become the center of a vast and costly power struggle, as state officials have embarked on an extraordinary campaign to legally abolish the city and make it part of Los Angeles County. John A. Pérez, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, is the chief sponsor of legislation to disincorporate Vernon. He described it as a shell city created to enrich municipal officials and businesses at the expense of the struggling, lower-middle-class communities that surround it.“I have been frustrated with Vernon for a long time,” Mr. Pérez said, while driving the streets of this city, which is in his district. “How bad a neighbor it’s been. How shady its practices have been. And the more I looked at it, the more I realized this was really the center of tremendous corruption.”This tiny city has responded with a sophisticated, high-priced battle with the trappings of a national campaign. It has hired a fleet of some of the highest-paid lobbyists, lawyers, political consultants and communications experts in the country. Lawyers are being paid $550 an hour and lobbying firms $12,000 a month. Vernon officials argued that businesses would shut down if Vernon is disincorporated, that the Legislature has no legal standing to abolish it and that corruption here has been cleaned up.A slick two-minute advertisement promoting Vernon as a bastion of blue-collar employment will be shown in theaters in working-class neighborhoods with the opening of a new movie, “Battle: Los Angeles.” The commercial follows a $65,000-a-week television advertising campaign that began last week. The ads were produced by Chris Lehane, a notoriously tough operative who worked as a senior adviser to Al Gore, and who is at the center of this campaign.Vernon also has enlisted John Van de Kamp, a former Democratic state attorney general, to conduct an ethics audit of the city’s practices and history, aligning itself with a symbol of ethics in California just as its rivals have invoked its history of corruption. Mr. van de Kamp, who is being paid $550 an hour, said he had been assured he would have complete independence to conduct his investigation.“Everybody seems to be sincere that they want to do the right thing,” he said.On Tuesday, the city’s team of lawyers and consultants organized worker demonstrations against Mr. Pérez as he asked the Los Angeles City Council to endorse his bill and announced he had the support of majorities in the Senate and Assembly. Trucks with banners reading “John Pérez: Jobs Killer” rumbled around City Hall, horns blaring, as he spoke.“Their perception is that nobody cares,” said Martin Perez, the executive coordinator for Teamsters Local 63, which represents workers in meat-rendering companies. “Well, they are going to find out is that there are 55,000 people in Vernon who do care about their jobs. This is not going to go away. They are going to have a fight on their hands.”The battle is throwing a spotlight on an oddity of a city that is distinct to Los Angeles, one of a handful of municipalities created specifically to cater primarily to businesses. There are about 30 homes in all of Vernon, each about 900 square feet, tucked in between factories and chemical storage tanks. The houses are owned by the city and occupied, at a cost of $110 per bedroom, by City Council members and city workers, producing a small and, critics say, indentured electorate that has allowed the city to remain insulated from political challenge.“It’s a nondemocratic empire that they have there, and it’s inappropriate that it is disguised as a city,” said Gloria Molina, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which has also voted in support of eliminating Vernon. “The city has been a facade for some personal gain issues. The residents are employees of the city or major companies and consequently are controlled.”In 2006, eight people moved into a vacant building in Vernon, and three of them filed to run for office. The city responded by cutting off their power and moving to evict them as illegal squatters; a court later declared the city’s action illegal.Four of the five members of the current City Council were appointed by the council rather than elected, and there were no contested elections in Vernon from 1984 to 2006.'"
"'11-03-02,'1','Tuesday’s decision did not disturb the ruling in Bowles. Rather, it said the procedures in cases involving veterans’ disabilities warranted different treatment.“Bowles concerned an appeal from one court to another court,” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the court. Mr. Henderson’s appeal, by contrast, was from an agency determination and was filed in a specialized tribunal “as part of a unique administrative scheme,” he wrote.The first kind of appeal “has long been understood to be jurisdictional,” meaning that the deadlines for filing appeals are inflexible, Justice Alito said. But Congress did not intend to impose such a strict rule in the second setting, he said.“The solicitude of Congress for veterans is of long standing,” Justice Alito wrote.Mr. Henderson died in October, while his case was pending in the Supreme Court.The second case, Staub v. Proctor Hospital, No. 09-400, concerned the interpretation of the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination based on membership in or an obligation to perform “uniformed service.” The law is similar to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, sex and other factors.Vincent Staub, an Army reservist and a civilian technician at an Illinois hospital, sued after he was fired by the hospital, saying his military status was a motivating factor in his termination. There was evidence that two of Mr. Staub’s supervisors were hostile to him because his military duties had caused him to be absent from work one weekend a month and two or three weeks a year.But it was not clear that the human resources officer who actually fired Mr. Staub knew of or shared that animus.A jury awarded Mr. Staub about $58,000, but the federal appeals court in Chicago reversed, saying the connection between the supervisors’ hostility and the human resources official’s action was too attenuated. The question before the Supreme Court was what a plaintiff in these circumstances needs to prove when pursuing what the courts call a “cat’s paw” theory.Justice Scalia said that the appeals court’s approach was too mechanical and that companies may be held liable where one employee lays the groundwork for another’s decision to fire a worker. He left to the appeals court whether to reinstate the jury verdict in Mr. Staub’s case or order a new trial.Justice Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, wrote that he agreed with the result reached by the majority but would give employers more leeway than the majority had.Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in either decision.'"
"'11-03-02,'1','“Someone scraped the wax out of their ears and listened,” said Lewis A. Fidler, a councilman for the area.We are into the second decade of mayoral control of the public schools, and, it is safe to say, mistakes happen.Over eight years, Mr. Bloomberg has said, he raised teacher salaries by 43 percent. Now he says it’s possible that he will have to cut more than 6,000 positions, and he does not want to do it on a basis of strict seniority, which the law requires — a critical statute that was not changed even when his administration was dishing out raises. (Mr. Bloomberg did win concessions to ease seniority requirements in assignments.)Education officials spent Tuesday in Albany, arguing that the city should be allowed to lay off teachers using a rating system that currently relies heavily on the evaluation of principals. The prospect of having a principal like the one at P.S. 114 making such decisions does not make the heart leap with joy. Other principals, trying to stretch their budgets, might feel pressured to get rid of older, better-paid teachers.ABOUT 2,000 teachers would probably leave through attrition; 4,000 others would go according to a peculiar seniority system that is based not exactly on how long individuals have been in the system but on the scarcity of their teaching licenses.For instance, a reading specialist with nine years of experience might be laid off, while a science teacher with less than two years would probably escape, according to a list released by the city on Sunday. The city has to protect core courses required for high school graduation, said John White, a deputy chancellor. “You literally cannot lay off many of those teachers, or the children won’t have the courses necessary to graduate,” Mr. White said.Under the current system, layoffs would have little to do with merit, at least as it is currently defined by the city and the union. Of the 4,000 teachers on the city’s list, 63 have unsatisfactory ratings, Mr. White said.A bill passed in the State Senate on Tuesday would require the teachers’ union and the city to negotiate a new way of doing layoffs that takes into account some agreed-upon system of teacher evaluations.Mr. White said the reforms the city wanted would increase the number of unsatisfactory teachers subject to layoff to about 2,000.Ernest A. Logan, president of the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, said that whatever the merits of the city’s position, it should have taken action on the issue long ago. Recalling Mr. Bloomberg’s boast that he had raised salaries by 43 percent, he asked: “What did your money get you? What it bought was political peace, during times when people had politics on their mind, whether it was re-elections or governance. It did not necessarily buy quality education.”'"
"'11-03-02,'1','PHOENIX — Nobody disputes that Nikolaos Skokos is adept at what he does, which is keeping unruly crowds away from Celine Dion, the singer, and helping to whisk her away safely to her next engagement.Part bodyguard, part driver, Mr. Skokos is, by all accounts, an accomplished security consultant. But the Department of Homeland Security doubts he is at the very pinnacle of his profession, so accomplished the world over that Mr. Skokos, a Canadian citizen who lives in Las Vegas, merits a special visa to live permanently in the United States.The two sides faced off Tuesday before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which normally sits in San Francisco but held a special session in Phoenix. After hearing arguments in the Skokos case, a three-judge panel took the issue under advisement.There are numerous ways foreigners can petition to live in the United States, including random visa lotteries and asylum applications citing a risk of grave harm back home. Mr. Skokos is seeking to stay through a relatively small program that allows “aliens of extraordinary ability” — whether they are scientists, artists, athletes or even security consultants — to become permanent residents.The government says that extraordinary means extraordinary. It wants proof of superior standing, such as awards (like Oscars, Nobels, the more prestigious the better), recognition in trade journals and a salary that stands out.As an example of what the United States is looking for, government lawyers cited in court papers the golfer Nick Price, who is from Zimbabwe and gave evidence when he sought to stay in the United States that he was ranked 10th out of 600 professional golfers, was seventh in the world in his earnings and had won more than 20 tournaments.'"
"'11-03-02,'1','A day before the game against the Magic, Thomas sat at a cozy cafe in the Coconut Grove section of Miami, enjoying breakfast with his wife, Lynn, and a friend.Thomas had watched the Knicks record one of their best victories in years.Thomas is the coach at Florida International University and the former team president and coach of the Knicks. He watched the Heat-Knicks game but passed on going to the arena — that would have caused too much of a scene, he felt.The Knicks had beaten the Heat’s Big Three — Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and LeBron James — with a Big Three of their own in Anthony, Amar’e Stoudemire and Billups. They’ve brought a playground toughness to the Knicks.At breakfast, Thomas observed that for all the talk of Anthony’s not being a great defender, it was clear that he embraced the challenge of guarding James. And Thomas said he was not surprised. “A great defender is someone who really has the talent, the skills, the athleticism to really go out there and shut somebody down,” Thomas said.“Then there are prideful defenders — people who aren’t going to let you just score 50 points on them. I look at Carmelo, Amar’e, Chauncey — all those guys have pride in their defense, they have pride in their approach to the game. So they’re not going to let another player just have their way with them.”At least not without a fight. The Knicks did not have answers for Orlando’s Dwight Howard, who had 30 points and 16 rebounds, or Jameer Nelson, who collected 26 points, 14 in the fourth quarter. Many of them came against Billups, who was forced out of the game with a leg injury with a little more than a minute left.For many Knicks fans, especially those who dislike Thomas, the big question remains what role, if any, Thomas played in persuading Dolan, the chairman of Madison Square Garden, to authorize making Anthony a Knick and to take Billups along in the process.The answer depends on which of the numerous Knicks narratives you believe.In the weeks leading to the trade, the legions of Dolan-Thomas critics insisted that the proposed terms of the deal — giving up a lot for what the Knicks would be getting back — had to be Thomas’s handiwork.Their narrative essentially went like this: Sending three or four promising Knicks players to Denver for one great player in return did not sound like something that Walsh, the team president, would do. Walsh was too savvy, too experienced to give up all that talent. Instead, the proposed deal sounded like something Thomas would endorse.According to that narrative, it was Thomas, not Walsh, who was advising Dolan at every turn, and Walsh might even quit if the deal was made.After the trade went through and excitement took hold in New York, that narrative began to shift. All of a sudden, this was not Thomas’s idea after all, but Dolan’s and Walsh’s and D’Antoni’s.Last Wednesday, at the introductory news conference for Anthony and Billups, Dolan pointedly disputed the notion that Thomas, whom he called a “very good friend,” had a role in the deal.“He wasn’t advising me or telling me what to do in any way,” Dolan said. “And any reports that implied that he was doing that are simply untrue, and a fiction in somebody’s mind.”This appeared to be yet another Garden spin, though maybe Dolan was telling the truth, that he didn’t need Thomas to tell him that acquiring Anthony would be a great trade, regardless of the cost.For Thomas, Dolan’s statement was an embarrassing, and hurtful, blow.Thomas still clings to the hope that he will return to Madison Square Garden in some full-time capacity with the Knicks — to scout talent, to recruit free agents. After all, last summer, he was set to come back as a part-time consultant while continuing to coach in college until the N.B.A. concluded the arrangement violated league bylaws.But now, after Dolan’s statement? Maybe the Garden chairman does want a little distance between himself and Thomas.“I just want the Knicks to do well,” Thomas said at breakfast. “Anytime the Knicks do well, Jim does well. I’m even happy Donnie is doing well.”Thomas added: “When I talk about the Knicks, I talk about everybody. I don’t want anyone to be excluded.”Indeed, when the Knicks introduced Stoudemire last summer, Thomas was thanked for his help in persuading him to move to New York. And what’s not widely known is that D’Antoni, the coach, even reached out and asked Thomas to help in the recruitment process.But no one thanked Thomas last week after Anthony arrived.The Knicks now are compelling story, no matter whose version you believe about how they obtained Anthony.As for Thomas, he will continue to be unsatisfied until he finds a way to make peace with his tenure with the Knicks. He still wants back in, but considering how the Anthony trade played out, that might not happen. Dolan, at least publicly, has chosen sides, and left his friend with a steep mountain to climb.'"

"'11-03-02,'1','“To have protests in Oman, which had previously been seen as a sleepy gulf kingdom, heightens concerns that nowhere is immune from the contagion affects,” said Helima L. Croft, a director and senior geopolitical analyst at Barclays Capital. “Every day we seem to have a new country with a new problem.”Oman produces 860,000 barrels of oil daily, almost 1 percent of world supplies, and its production has been rising in recent years with investments from Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Repsol and other international companies. Its importance is magnified by the fact that its crude is of such quality that it can be blended by most refineries around the world, although most of its exports now go to China and Japan.Oman straddles the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic route through which 40 percent of the world’s oil tanker traffic crosses. On the other side of the strait lies Iran, another major producer, where there were reports on Tuesday that security forces had used tear gas to disperse protesters in Tehran. Iran, with approximately 10 percent of the world’s oil reserves, exports about 3.7 million barrels a day.The price of light sweet crude rose to $99.63 a barrel while Brent crude rose 3.24 percent to $115.42. Oil jumped above $100 a barrel in after-hours trading in New York. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline rose by nearly a penny on Tuesday to just over $3.37, which is 20 cents higher than a week ago.In testimony on Capitol Hill, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said that it would take a sustained increase in oil prices to push up consumer inflation significantly and threaten the economy. “Currently the cost pressures from higher commodity prices are being offset by the stability in unit labor costs,” he added.The rising tensions across the region sent the Saudi Arabian stock market into a tailspin, with Saudi shares suffering the biggest daily decline in more than two years despite rising oil prices. The Saudi index fell 6.8 percent, to its lowest close since July 2009. Refiners around the world have been hoping that Iraq, as violence ebbed, would again become a major oil producer, with production stabilizing at 2.3 million barrels a day. But over the weekend rebels bombed the country’s largest refinery, reducing the refinery’s capacity to refine petroleum products by 75,000 barrels a day. The attack came less than three weeks after a terrorist attack on a pipeline leading to a second refinery north of Baghdad.Greg Priddy, an oil analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said it was “highly unlikely” that output in another major producer in the region would be shut off. But he said that markets were jittery because “if the Saudis are going to make up for the shortfall in Libya, their spare capacity is thinner.”He added, “Another major country going out completely would use most of their spare capacity, and that is really what the market is worried about.”Saudi Arabia has a total production capacity of 12.5 million barrels a day, and currently produces nine million barrels after increasing its output by several hundred thousand since the beginning of the year. Saudi officials say they are ready to pump what it takes to fill any supply gap, but much of its 3.5 million barrel excess capacity contains sour crudes that do not easily replace the Libyan sweet crude European refineries in particular desire to produce diesel. In Libya, major oil operations in the eastern part of the country remained under the control of rebel forces. While foreign operators withdrew most of their foreign workers, local Libyan employees can still produce some crude. Oil experts say at least one million of the country’s 1.6 million barrels a day of production has been shut down.Little if any oil can be shipped out of Libya because most ports were closed. Meanwhile, storage tanks were filling up rapidly. Oil traders said one major oil company cargo ship was supposed to berth this week, but no one was at the port to deliver an oil shipment, and shipping companies were reluctant to send ships into the Libyan ports.Most fields in Libya are operated by a combination of the National Oil Company, which owns 50 percent of the fields, and international consortiums, which share the other half.The Arabian Gulf Oil Company, the largest subsidiary of the Libya National Oil Corporation, claims it had broken off from its mother company. It said it would honor its contracts but would divert the funds to the opposition, not to Tripoli.Arabian Gulf’s Hamada field had been shut, and output at Nafoora, Sarir and Misla had dropped to under half of maximum capacity. The company was still exporting crude at the Tobruk terminal, according to a report by PFC Energy, a consulting firm, but Arabian Gulf has stated that with only sporadic loading operations, it could reach its maximum storage capacity within two weeks, even with the drastically reduced production levels.Arabian Gulf officials “have claimed that the company’s export revenues will no longer be controlled by its parent company,” PFC Energy said in the report, “but have not been able to confirm how those revenues would be managed by the subsidiary or potentially channeled to Libya’s opposition.”Eni, the Italian oil giant and largest foreign operator in Libya, evacuated most of its employees and their families last week. The company’s fields were still producing 120,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas, about half their capacity before the revolt began. The company declined to say which fields it had shut down and which were still in operation, citing safety concerns. Eni still has 21 Italian employees in Libya, a spokesman said.'"
"'11-03-02,'1','LONDON — A report published by a British magazine on Tuesday said the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, suggested that British journalists, including the editor of The Guardian, were engaged in a Jewish-led conspiracy to smear his organization.His remarks appeared in the magazine Private Eye, in an article by its editor, Ian Hislop, who outlined a rambling phone call that Mr. Assange made on Feb. 16 to complain about the coverage of WikiLeaks.He was especially angry about a Private Eye report that Israel Shamir, an Assange associate in Russia, was a Holocaust denier. Mr. Assange complained that the article was part of a campaign by Jewish reporters in London to smear WikiLeaks.A lawyer for Mr. Assange could not immediately be reached for comment, but in a statement later released on the WikiLeaks Twitter feed, Mr. Assange said Mr. Hislop had “distorted, invented or misremembered almost every significant claim and phrase.”The Private Eye article quoted Mr. Assange as saying the conspiracy was led by The Guardian and included the newspaper’s editor, Alan Rusbridger, and investigations editor, David Leigh, as well as John Kampfner, a prominent London journalist who recently reviewed two books about WikiLeaks for The Sunday Times of London.When Mr. Hislop pointed out that Mr. Rusbridger was not Jewish, Mr. Assange countered that The Guardian’s editor was “sort of Jewish” because he and Mr. Leigh, who is Jewish, were brothers-in-law. Later, the article recounted, Mr. Assange asked Mr. Hislop to “forget the Jewish thing,” but he continued to insist there was a conspiracy against WikiLeaks based on the friendship among Mr. Rusbridger, Mr. Leigh and Mr. Kampfner.'"
"'11-03-02,'1','The Ford Motor Company, which benefited from Toyota’s troubles last February, said sales were up 10 percent; excluding Volvo, which Ford no longer owns, its sales were up 14 percent. Its midsize car, the Fusion, outsold the Honda Accord, a perennial leader in that hotly contested segment.Ford said it planned to increase production by 9 percent in the second quarter, despite widespread projections that gasoline prices could hit $4 this summer. Nationwide, gas is averaging $3.375 a gallon after rising 20 cents in the last week and 27 cents from a month ago, according to the AAA motor club.LeaseTrader.com, which helps people who want to get out of auto leases, said its analysis of the price run-up in 2008 suggested $4 was the psychological barrier that could cause consumers to change their buying behavior. But the automakers said they were confident sales would continue to rise, in part because many people put off buying a new vehicle during the recession and would need one soon.“If gas prices rise slowly, as we expect them to, we don’t expect to see a big impact, but if there is a dramatic spike that could obviously have a big impact on industry volumes,” Don Johnson, G.M.’s vice president of United States sales operations, said in a conference call with analysts and reporters. “The last one, we had a lot of people that overreacted and went into vehicles that didn’t meet their needs.”Since then, G.M., Ford and other automakers have vastly improved their lineups of small cars as well as the profit margins that those segments generate. Smaller cars are still less profitable than trucks and S.U.V.’s, but in the past the Detroit companies often sold those models at a loss simply to keep factories running.G.M. last year introduced the Chevrolet Cruze, a compact sedan, while Ford rolled out the smaller Fiesta last summer and will introduce a redesigned version of its Focus compact car this month.Still, if consumers looked to downsize again, many might continue to ignore Detroit’s offerings, said Jessica Caldwell, director of pricing and industry analysis at Edmunds.com, which provides car-buying information.“The perception of most consumers is that they don’t have fuel-efficient cars,” Ms. Caldwell said. “There’s just not as much brand awareness for a new model like the Cruze as there is for something like a Civic or a Prius,” she said, referring to popular models from Honda and Toyota, respectively.Ms. Caldwell and other analysts said cash rebates, low-interest financing and subsidized lease deals were allowing G.M. to gain market share more quickly than it would otherwise. G.M. and other automakers, particularly its Detroit-based rivals, used to rely heavily on such incentives to clear unpopular models from crowded lots, but have backed away from that strategy.G.M. executives said that the company was not falling back on one of the bad habits that helped lead it into bankruptcy protection two years ago. They noted that dealer inventories were at the lowest level in many years and, excluding deliveries to car rental companies and other so-called fleet buyers, sales to individual consumers were up 70 percent in February, the highest year-over-year gain in company history.“There is clearly a lot more going on here than a mere incentive move of a couple hundred dollars,” Mr. Johnson said. “Our disciplined approach to incentives has not changed.”Mr. Pilato, the Florida dealership manager, said incentives were helping to make sales, but so were improved vehicles and banks that had become more willing to offer financing to customers with lower credit scores.'"
"'11-03-02,'1','The new bill was the latest development in a hotly contested fight over rights for public sector workers that began in Ohio in early February. It came as unions drew their largest crowd of protesters yet to Columbus — about 8,500 people, according to the Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board, a nonpartisan government group that manages the Statehouse complex here.Another change would prohibit all public employees from striking, a right that public sector unions say is their only tool for getting a fair deal in labor disputes. The bill would impose fines and imprisonment for violators.Currently, emergency workers, like police officers and firefighters, are prohibited from striking in Ohio, while most state workers and teachers are permitted to strike. Union leaders said that if the bill passed in its current form, they would press to put the issue on the ballot this fall.“We will not support this,” said Joe Schiavoni, a Democrat on the committee. “If it’s illegal and criminal to strike, you really don’t have any collective bargaining rights at all.”Senator Bacon said that collective bargaining was reinstated because lawmakers had consulted with government administrators who argued that it was more efficient to deal with workers through collective bargaining. He said Republicans had enough votes to pass the bill out of committee on Wednesday.Referring to local governments, he said, “We’re trying to give them flexibility so in the downtimes they can make adjustments just like a business would.”Republican leaders have not linked the bill directly to a dollar figure of savings for the state budget, as those in Wisconsin have, but appear to be pressing for passage before the state budget debate begins in mid-March.Mr. Horton of the firefighters’ association said the proposed changes in Ohio seemed to run against the stated goal of many conservative groups for smaller government. “This gives government total control over collective bargaining,” he said.Jennifer Brunner, a lawyer and former Ohio secretary of state, said a post on her Facebook page this week nicely summed up what she believed was happening. “A dozen cookies are put down in front of a C.E.O., a union member and a Tea Partier,” she said. “The C.E.O. takes 11. Then he says to the Tea Partier, ‘That union guy wants yours.’ ”'"
"'11-03-02,'1','The relationship between Bonds and Anderson is at the heart of the perjury case that raises the question of whether Bonds knew Anderson — his former trainer — was giving him steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. Bonds has said that he assumed the substances Anderson gave him were legal supplements, like flaxseed oil.They did not make eye contact in the courtroom, nor did they acknowledge each other.Bonds arrived through one entrance, looking slimmer than he has in years. Anderson came in through another door, looking as bulky as ever.Illston told Anderson that his testimony would spare some of his former clients, including Colorado Rockies first baseman Jason Giambi, from testifying about their steroid use and how Anderson supplied them with those drugs. She said that Bonds’s lawyers had asked Anderson to testify, too. But Anderson — whose lawyers have said his refusal to take the stand stems from his mistrust of the prosecution — did not change his mind.Assistant United States Attorney Jeff Nedrow said the testimony of Anderson’s former clients would prove that Bonds was not “unwittingly duped into taking steroids.”Anderson’s vow of silence has weakened the government’s case against Bonds, but it has far from destroyed it. On Tuesday, the judge ruled for the prosecution on several pieces of evidence the defense had asked to be excluded.Illston said she would allow testimony of Kimberly Bell, Bonds’s former mistress, that related to the physical and psychological changes she saw in Bonds.Prosecutors said those changes would include how Bell noticed the shrinkage of Bonds’s testicles and the worsening of his sexual performance, which the government says indicate steroid use. The judge also will allow Bell to describe an incident in which she has said Bonds grabbed her by the throat and threatened her.Bonds’s lawyers raised objections to those rulings, but it was unclear if the judge would change her mind.Ted Cassman, one of Bonds’s lawyers, called the description of Bonds’s testicles and sexual performance “lurid” and said it would create a circus atmosphere at the trial. He said Bell could not properly describe those changes to Bonds’s testicles because “trained medical examiners have difficulty finding it” because “it’s not visually obtainable.”Cassman added: “That evidence is irrelevant and inadmissible. We asked the court to reconsider.”Another Bonds lawyer, Cris Arguedas, told the judge that Bell’s account of an alleged episode of domestic violence could pit some jury members against him.“They wouldn’t be fair to him anymore because they would hate that person,” she said, referring to the possibility some jurors would have strong feelings about domestic violence. “It’s going to skew their ability to be fair at this trial and to this person.”Later, Arguedas said Bell’s accusations were false and inflammatory and should not be admitted. But the government claims that Bonds’s alleged temper could be an indication of steroid rage. (The link between rage and steroid use, however, “is meager and hardly conclusive,” said Allen Ruby, another of Bonds’s lawyers.)The judge ruled for the defense relating to one aspect of Bell’s testimony. She said it could show the jury an interview Bell gave in Playboy magazine about her relationship with Bonds, but said the jurors could not be shown nude photographs of her in the magazine. The defense plans to use the interview to discredit Bell.Illston remained open to letting those photographs into evidence, but she was more forceful about her other decisions, including what she would do if Anderson showed up in court March 22 and still refused to testify. She said she would order the United States marshals to escort him to jail.Geragos, though, said he would argue that Anderson should not be jailed again.Several minutes later, Anderson walked out of the courtroom, head held high, goatee jutting from his chin. He came about a foot from Bonds, but never glanced at him. Bonds, however, appeared to swallow hard as Anderson passed him. They are likely see each other in court again in less than three weeks.'"
"'11-03-02,'1','BERLIN — In a bitter political setback for Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany’s defense minister resigned Tuesday under pressure over his admission that he had plagiarized parts of his doctoral dissertation.One of the country’s most popular politicians, the minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, 39, had faced mounting criticism from academics and his own conservative party. Resigning was the “most painful step of my life,” he told reporters in the Defense Ministry in Berlin. “I was always ready to fight, but have to admit I have reached the limit.”At a news conference later, Mrs. Merkel said she greatly regretted Mr. Guttenberg’s resignation, which she said she had accepted “with a heavy heart,” adding that she understood “his personal decision.”It was not immediately clear who would succeed him.Mr. Guttenberg has been a leading member of the Bavarian-based Christian Social Union, the sister party of Mrs. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union. He had been expected to play a major role in six important regional elections this year.Even after the scandal broke a month ago, Mrs. Merkel was expecting him to hit the campaign trail to help the party recover from a rout 10 days ago in elections in Hamburg.'"
"'11-03-02,'1','There was a moment in the San Siro on Monday night when Napoli’s coach, Walter Mazzarri, realized his team has been overachieving this season.“I would like to have stopped the game completely,” he said, “and got the side to just think about a few things for three minutes.” This came after a disputed penalty for a handball against Salvatore Aronica. The penalty was scored mercilessly by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, which broke the deadlock shortly after halftime.Timeouts are not — yet — a feature of soccer. FIFA, with its insatiable appetite for commercial opportunities, might well consider them. But as much as the Naples coach wanted a break, Milan seized its opportunity to strike while the opponents were distracted.Pato, in particular, struck. His pass offered a chance for his countryman Robinho, a chance spurned. Pato’s next astute pass was turned into the net by Kevin Prince Boateng, the substitute for the wasteful Robinho.Then, in the 79th minute, Pato’s coup de grâce. Napoli’s pressing did indeed open its defenses up to the counterattack, and Pato instinctively, beautifully exploited the situation.From near the halfway line, he began his run. He moved easily, elegantly forward, the ball ever close to his feet, the defenders retreating in front of him. Ibrahimovic moved to his left, calling for the pass, but Pato had another idea.He allowed Morgan De Sanctis, Napoli’s fine goalkeeper on this night, to come forward, and as soon as the goalie did that, Pato caressed the ball with his right foot. Like a golfer chipping onto the green, he picked his spot, and landed it.Game, and possibly championship, over. Milan, and perhaps Pato, are back where their pedigree demands that they be: on top of the charts.This has been expected ever since Milan’s owner, Silvio Berlusconi, was persuaded to spend about $30 million on Pato four years ago when the lad had played barely two handfuls of professional games in Brazil. Pato was slender and innocent then; he is still slender, still slightly boyish today.But his qualities are such that Carlo Ancelotti, the Milan coach when Pato arrived and now the coach at Chelsea, would take him to London at the drop of a hat.Pato, prone to injuries that might be growing pains, has scored nearly a goal every other game since joining Milan. He could be at the top of his game by 2014.And he might by then be reunited with Ronaldinho in the Brazil lineup.Ronaldinho, the smiling magician of years past, is still only 30. He seems older simply because he has been around for so long. His past includes a full decade in Europe — from Paris Saint-Germain to Barcelona to Milan — and his peak years made him undisputedly the world’s best player in 2004 and 2005.In those years, Ronaldinho was what Lionel Messi is now. And Messi was his understudy at Barcelona. But either fame bored Ronaldinho or partying became too big a distraction. Messi learned from him, replaced him as the idol of Barça, and with any luck will still be there — will still give and receive love from the game — in 2014. Ronaldinho? One masterfully crafted free kick to win a cup in his first month back in Brazil is no proof that he can recapture what made him great.“I feel euphoric,” he told Brazil’s news media on Sunday. “I came to Flamengo at the right time, I’m very motivated to start playing well again, and be happy again.”The instant the ball left his right foot, his celebration began. He insists that, having been left out of the World Cup last year, he wants to play in another one, on home soil in 2014. That drum is beating for all Brazilians, and for anyone who has never experienced a World Cup in Brazil in our lifetime. Who knows whether Pato will find his peak three years from now, or whether Ronaldinho will work that long to revive his genius?

"'11-03-03,'1','Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Wednesday that he supported creating a more objective evaluation system, but that he had serious reservations about a bill that did not immediately abolish the seniority policy.“Anything short of that will harm our students and jeopardize the progress that we made in the schools,” Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference. “It simply kicks the can down the road, and it will kick some of our best teachers to the curb.”Mr. Bloomberg has sought to put pressure on the state by warning that the city could be forced to lay off as many as 4,600 teachers this year because of budget cuts.The plan endorsed by Mr. Cuomo would create a new system to evaluate teachers using various factors, including student test scores and observations from principals and other teachers.The State Legislature approved the details of that system last year as part of a series of changes to education laws meant to help the state qualify for federal grants. The evaluation system was set to make its debut in the 2012-13 school year, but Mr. Cuomo said Tuesday that he would seek to put it into effect this fall.The city’s Education Department argued in a memorandum on Wednesday that the bill did not require districts and unions to agree on the details of an evaluation system on a deadline, potentially delaying its start.The memo also said that unless the seniority language was scrapped, the law would require layoffs based strictly on seniority. The state, by contrast, believes the new evaluation system would come into play if districts were required to lay off large numbers of teachers.Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, the Republican leader of the State Senate, vowed on Wednesday to include language repealing “last in, first out” in a budget resolution. The Senate passed a bill this week that would allow the city to lay off teachers based on factors including performance and disciplinary records. But the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said he would not consider it.Mr. Cuomo predicted that “entrenched interests that benefit from the status quo” would rally against his proposal. But the loudest voice of criticism on Wednesday seemed to be that of Mr. Bloomberg.The city teachers’ union, the United Federation of Teachers, which worked with the state to develop a new evaluation system, praised the governor’s efforts. “The teachers’ unions were the ones who fought to get an objective evaluation system,” said Michael Mulgrew, the union president. Of Mr. Bloomberg’s opposition, Mr. Mulgrew said: “They could do all the little ‘na-na-na’ they want. They should stop being immature and irresponsible.”Mr. Bloomberg criticized teacher tenure rules, saying years of service were no indicator of a teacher’s effectiveness.“The length of time that you have worked is irrelevant to whether or not you can do what our children need — give them the education that they need to be self-sufficient as they become adults, and to enjoy the great American dream,” he said.'"
"'11-03-03,'1','Seven decades after the last reported sighting of the Eastern cougar, the federal Fish and Wildlife Service declared it extinct Wednesday and recommended that it be removed from the nation’s endangered species list.There’s one wrinkle, though: it may not be extinct, exactly.Scientists are moving toward the conclusion that the Eastern cougar was erroneously classified as a separate subspecies in the first place. As a result of a genetic study conducted in 2000, most biologists now believe there is no real difference between the Western and Eastern branches of the cougar family.Either way, the “Eastern” cougar as such is no longer with us. Any recent sightings in the cougar’s historic range, which stretched from eastern Ontario and Michigan eastward to Maine and southward to Georgia, Tennessee and Missouri, were actually sightings of its relatives, the Fish and Wildlife Service said.“It’s extinct,” said Mark McCollough, a wildlife biologist with the agency’s offices in Maine, referring to the official determination by his agency.“But it’s not,” he confirmed. “It may well return to part of its range.”'"
"'11-03-03,'1','The State Department cable recounts how on Dec. 28, 2005, “Two military cars carrying armed personnel without clear identification illegally broke into the facility, asked the employees to leave the premises and shut down the plant.” Mutassim’s forces quickly took control of the plant after one foreign worker was injured and some equipment was destroyed.During the plant’s occupation, managers were initially allowed to enter the plant “singly or in pairs,” but later Coca-Cola employees were barred completely. Over the following weeks, company shareholders received extortion demands from “freelancers” while anonymous callers threatened the plant’s foreign workers with “political problems” or physical harm, according to the cable.“At no time did any Libyan authority offer a legal justification for the plant’s shutdown,” the cable said, recounting complaints from business officials involved.The battle reached a peak in February 2006, when men loyal to Mutassim went to Mohammed’s residence, where they abducted and assaulted one of his cousins, who is also one of Mohammed’s in-laws, in order to “send a signal to The Engineer (Mohammed),” according to the cable.Mutassim’s associates arrived at “Mohammed’s residence and began shouting for him to come out,” the cable says, quoting a witness. “Receiving no response, they left in search of one of Mohammed’s cousins, whom they stowed in the trunk of one of their cars and brought back to the residence.”One of the company’s board members received a hurried call warning him to leave Tripoli before Mutassim’s men could find him.Finally, their sister, Aisha Qaddafi, appeared to have become fed up with the fighting and brokered a deal between her brothers. According to the cable, the compromise called for Mohammed to sell his shares in the bottling operation, and in return Mutassim would call off his men and leave the company alone.One person caught in the middle of the fight told an official from the United States Embassy, according to one of the cables, that “although he had heard stories about doing business in Libya, he never imagined that what transpired was still possible here. ‘You know the movie, ‘The Godfather’? We’ve been living it for the last few months.’ ”On Wednesday, Kerry Tressler, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola at the company’s headquarters in Atlanta, acknowledged that in 2006 there had been “a period of uncertainty about the local ownership of the bottler” in Libya, but that the problem was eventually resolved.She said that production and distribution at the bottling plant have now stopped because of the protests and unrest.The State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley, said it would have no comment on the cables’ revelations.'"
"'11-03-03,'1','Mr. McClure fought to allow off-road vehicles more freedom on public lands and to stop the designation of some scenic areas as national parks, the strictest category of protection.“As a general proposition, the environmental community disagreed with him about 100 percent of the time,” Gaylord Nelson, the Wisconsin Democratic senator who became counselor for the Wilderness Society, once said of him.Conservatives took the opposite view. In 1990, Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, said of Mr. McClure, “There is no major piece of energy, public lands or natural resources legislation passed in recent years on which he has not left an imprint.”As a member of the sagebrush rebellion, Mr. McClure supported privatizing federal land that in some Western states accounted for more than half the land area. But in many cases he worked with the Reagan administration to take moderate steps in relaxing rules governing federal land.He was also credited with helping to preserve important Idaho wilderness areas like Sawtooth and Hells Canyon National Recreation Areas. But he fought for the rights of ranchers to continue to graze cattle there.On energy policy, his specialty, Mr. McClure often pushed for bipartisan agreement on issues like the strategic petroleum reserve, which he helped steer through Congress as insurance against an oil cutoff by foreign suppliers. He met regularly with leaders of oil-producing nations and drove an electric car.He also became famous on Capitol Hill for reading every word of every bill before voting on it. For many years he signed all his own mail.As a party leader, he was chairman of the Senate Republican Conference from 1981 to 1985. He lost to Bob Dole in a bid to become Senate majority leader in 1984. But he achieved as much prominence in the 1980s as the chairman of an informal group of Republican conservatives that called itself the Steering Committee. Composed of 16 of the Senate’s 41 Republicans, the group sought to press the party to promote the conservative agenda with more gusto.To further that agenda, Mr. McClure proposed that English be made the nation’s official language, pushed legislation to limit food stamps and opposed the treaty that transferred control of the Panama Canal to Panama.He received perfect or near-perfect ratings for his voting record from conservative political groups.Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Democratic leader, denounced the Steering Committee as “shadowy” and “mysterious.” In reply, Mr. McClure thanked him, saying Mr. Byrd had helped the group come out from under its “cloak of anonymity.”James Albertus McClure was born in Payette, Idaho, on Dec. 27, 1924, and served in the Navy during World War II. After graduating from the University of Idaho College of Law in 1950, he went into private practice with his father in Payette.He went on to become city attorney, then county prosecuting attorney, served three terms in the Idaho State Senate and won election to Congress in 1966. After three terms in Washington as a representative, he was elected to the Senate in 1972.In 1974, as a first-term senator, he endeared himself to conservatives when he sponsored a law to allow private citizens to own gold coins, bars and certificates. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had barred gold ownership by executive order in 1933. When courts rejected his action, Congress banned gold ownership the next year.After leaving the Senate in 1990, Mr. McClure worked as a lobbyist on energy and resource issues.He is survived by his wife, the former Louise Miller; his sons, Kenneth and David; his daughter, Marilyn Roach; six grandchildren and one great-grandchild.Mr. McClure said he decided not to seek a fourth term in the Senate because he had come to believe that Congress could no longer make a “balanced judgment on good information.” He said a new breed of legislators voted by sampling the political winds. “Wet-finger politicians,” he called them.'"

"'11-03-03,'1',', the executive director of the players union, said the findings on Probert could not be taken lightly.“Obviously, when you have a finding like this, it raises concerns and it bears serious examination,” Fehr said. “My impression is that the players want the best medical and scientific evidence that they can find so they make their decisions. They’re not looking to hide from the data. I don’t think anyone in hockey is looking to hide from the data.”When informed of the Probert finding, Bill Daly, deputy commissioner of N.H.L., said he could not comment beyond his immediate reaction:“We’re aware of what B.U. is doing, and we’ve met with them before,” Daly said. “It’s interesting science. We have interest in it. To the extent that the science itself starts to suggest certain conclusions, obviously we’re open to accepting that and addressing that moving forward. But we can’t take steps tomorrow based on what we’re finding out today.”Some of the league’s top players, including the ’ , have missed significant time this season after sustaining in the course of play. Commissioner said earlier this year that concussions resulting from fights had increased.Probert was not the average player — he reveled in extremes both on and off the ice, primarily in fighting, drinking heavily and embracing other physical risks.Probert’s posthumous autobiography, “Tough Guy,” gleefully offers details of his 3,300 career penalty minutes — fifth in N.H.L. history — and recounts so many brawls with enforcers like and that it requires 11 pages to list them all. He scored 163 goals in his career from 1985 through 2002, for the and the , but was so known for his fighting that a 2007 Hockey News poll rated him the greatest enforcer in hockey history.Probert drank heavily beginning in his youth in Windsor, , and he used cocaine to the point that he served 90 days in a prison and was suspended by the N.H.L. multiple times, including for the entire 1994-95 season. His police record included driving citations, bar fights and assaults on police officers. While boating last July 5 on Lake St. Clair, near his home in Tecumseh, Probert collapsed and died of heart failure, including an 80 percent blockage of the left coronary artery.Many athletes later found with C.T.E. — whose test for abnormal protein deposits in brain tissue can be administered only after death — presented symptoms like , impulse control and only in the years before they died, suggesting that the disease contributed to it.Probert’s case is considerably more difficult to interpret, Cantu said, because of his history. Cantu and other Boston University researchers declined to discuss any further specifics regarding Probert before publication in an academic journal.Probert’s widow, Dani, said in an interview at their home on Tuesday that the B.U. group had said that her husband’s C.T.E. was less developed than that found in most football players of similar age. She added that in his final few years, Probert exhibited some behavior uncharacteristic to him, especially and a tendency to lose his temper while driving.Cantu, while not speaking about Probert’s substance abuse specifically, also emphasized that “as of now, the medical community is not aware that any drug abuse, including alcohol, leads to” chronic traumatic encephalopathy.Dani Probert said that her husband was aware of growing concern about C.T.E. among athletes in contact sports, and that they had discussed it soon before he died after a “60 Minutes” feature on the subject.“I remember joking with him, ‘Wouldn’t your brain make a nice specimen?’ ” she said. “He started questioning whether he would have it himself. He told me that he wanted to donate his brain to the research when he died. Who would have thought that six months later it would be happening?”Chris Nowinski, a co-director of the Boston University research group, said that 10 other professional hockey players, almost all of whom played in the N.H.L., had pledged to donate their brains upon death. More than 100 professional football players have done the same, including Dave Duerson, the former star and players union official who committed suicide two weeks ago.Keith Primeau, who played with Probert in for several seasons in the early 1990s, arranged to donate his brain several months ago. Primeau sustained four documented concussions during his career but said in a telephone interview that he might have incurred others in fights that he did not recognize at the time.“I was buckled a couple of times from a blow to the chin,” said Primeau, who had 98 fights in 15 N.H.L. seasons. “I don’t think it contributed to my overall concussion situation, but I wouldn’t discount it, either.”Dani Probert said she learned of her husband’s having C.T.E. in early January but only recently became comfortable acknowledging it publicly. She said she would begin encouraging other hockey players to donate their brains, and raising awareness about the possible health risks of sports-related head trauma.“In my heart of hearts, I don’t believe fighting is what did this to Bob,” she said. “It was hockey — all the checking and hits, things like that.”She said those words just feet from a huge painting of Bob Probert that hangs in tribute to his hockey career. He is shown punching an opponent. On the canvas is scrawled a message from the artist:“Gladiator as depicted by the Romans is a professional combatant or captive who entertains the public by engaging in combat. When it’s done for your team and your city, you’re known as a hero.”'"

"'11-03-03,'1','Shares of Hudson City Bancorp dropped after it said that regulators may require it to reduce a concentration in financing.In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, the bank said it expected to receive a memorandum of understanding from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision that may require it to “reduce its level of interest-rate risk and funding concentration.”About 98 percent of Hudson City’s borrowed funds are structured “putable” borrowings, which may have to be replaced if interest rates rise significantly, according to the filing. The company would have to buy back about 26 percent of its borrowings in the next 12 months if interest rates rose three percentage points, the bank said.Hudson City, based in Paramus, N.J., can and will comply with the memorandum, it said in the filing.The regulator will conduct periodic examinations of the bank’s compliance, the filing said.The bank’s shares on Wednesday dropped 9 percent, or 98 cents, to $9.92 on the Nasdaq.'"

"'11-03-03,'1','“Of course, I’ve routinely heard hints from my patients over the years,” said Dr. Parker, “but it wasn’t until I participated in the training that I put those together with early signs of memory loss or confusion.”Red flags for investment swindles or other financial fraud can be social isolation, bereavement, alcohol or drug abuse or depression, according to the education program being introduced this year in 25 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. It is modeled after a 2008 pilot project at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas and is being paid for by the Investor Protection Trust, a nonprofit organization that is financed by fines levied against companies for financial misconduct.After spotting elderly people at risk, doctors can refer them to state securities regulators and adult services providers for help. The North American Securities Administrators Association and the National Adult Protective Services Association, the group for social workers who handle abuse cases, are backing the program, which provides medical professionals with specific resources to aid their patients.Each doctor receives a laminated four-page pocket guide listing the names and Web sites for groups including the National Center on Elder Abuse and the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys.Bilking old people is not new, said Steve Irwin, commissioner of the Pennsylvania Securities Commission, which is participating in the program. “Financial fraud is abuse, but it is less recognized and less reported.”Among the signs listed in the guide of potential financial abuse are overly protective caregivers, changes in ability to take medications, cognitive problems and being fearful, distressed or excessively suspicious.Some form of cognitive impairment afflicts one-third of people over age 71 in the United States, according to a 2008 Duke University study. Mental impairment makes people more likely to make financial errors and more willing to gamble with their money, said Dr. Robert E. Roush, director of the Texas Consortium Geriatric Education Center at the Baylor College of Medicine.“People become less risk-averse and become victims of unscrupulous family, friends, people they know from church or real estate agents,” said Dr. Roush, who spearheaded the program.Dr. Parker agreed, noting that “about half the patients referred to us are cognitively impaired. They may come across as having normal social skills, but when we look more closely, we find they have lost their executive function, or their ability to plan, organize and remember details.”That loss, according to the National Institute on Aging, can be a precursor of Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia, where thinking, memory and reasoning deteriorate.A result of the training, Dr. Parker said, is that “the first thing we now ask on our patient questionnaire is who is managing the money every day and who is paying the bills. Those are important patient signs.”In Texas, 130 doctors participated in the pilot — with a guarantee that neither they nor their patients would be identified — and found that 55 percent of their patients displayed signs of financial vulnerability and needed a follow-up by other professionals. Dr. Roush cautioned, however, that “we do not know if fraud actually occurred.”The program encourages doctors to ask patients whether they have trouble paying bills, feel confident about making big financial decisions, give loans or gifts they can not afford or believe their money is dwindling.Also, the pocket guide lists other indicative questions, like whether the patient runs out of money at the end of the month, whether he or she regrets or worries about recent financial decisions, whether the patient has been asked to change a will or sign over power of attorney to someone else. Patients are provided with a brochure listing concerns and questions to help assess themselves.While few elders like to admit they have been scammed, victims of telephone, mail or Internet schemes are numerous. An Investors Protection Trust survey last year found that one in five Americans over 65 years old had been defrauded. Nearly 40 percent said they had received phone call solicitations or letters asking for money, but only 19 percent said their adult children knew about it.Dr. Parker was among those who missed signs of financial misadventures involving his mother, Rosalee, who sent $40,000 to enter a lottery in Jamaica, at the behest of friendly phone sales representatives. He discovered the swindle just as his mother, who died last September, was about to send an additional $70,000 to receive her “prize” of a Mercedes-Benz automobile.She was furious, he noted, when he stepped in to take control of her finances.Mr. Irwin, at the Pennsylvania Securities Commission, said fraud cases involving elderly people were not uncommon, especially in his state, which has a large number of Social Security recipients.“We often step in get the cease-and-desist orders,” he said. “But now we are trying to get people alerted earlier, and this program casts the net wider.”'"
"'11-03-03,'1','“They’re strange-tasting, gummy, probably from long-term controlled storage,” said Mr. Calhoun, who would no more eat a supermarket apple than an old shoe.Mr. Calhoun is the author of a recently revised compendium of 1,800 antique apple varieties, called “Old Southern Apples.” He is also one of a cadre of collectors across the country who are passing on their own rare apples, through scions and grafted trees, to younger men and women starting nurseries or preservation orchards, or simply planting a few trees in the backyard.He has given his collection to young growers like David C. Vernon, who now sells more than 400 heirloom apple varieties at Century Farm Orchards, in Reidsville, N.C., a farm that has been in his family since 1872.“Lee taught me how to graft and provided me with most of his old varieties,” said Mr. Vernon, 40, who teaches high school chemistry.Mr. Calhoun has also planted 800 trees — two of each in his collection — at Horne Creek Living Historical Farm in Pinnacle, N.C., north of Winston-Salem, in the northwestern Piedmont. Visitors can now see the difference between a semi-dwarf, free-standing tree and a dwarf tree of the same variety, espaliered or trained against wires.Mr. Calhoun’s orchard once held all 456 of the varieties he has wrested from near-extinction over the last 30 years. But recently, he has scaled it back to 300, replacing most trees with dwarfs, planted in rows and espaliered against wires. He prunes each one to a main branch, or oblique cordon, bent at a 45-degree angle. Bending branches increases carbohydrates in the buds, which causes them to flower and fruit more productively.These dwarfs, planted two feet apart, grow to about eight feet, a good height for Mr. Calhoun, who doesn’t want to deal with ladders in his 80s.A FTER World War II, salesmen from nurseries like Stark Brothers began calling on farmers, who took a good look at their color catalogs and decided it would be easier to order trees than graft them from their own old-time varieties.Nurseries also realized they could make more money “selling six varieties, rather than 60,” said Tom Burford, 75, an apple historian in Virginia.Mr. Burford, who grew up with more than 100 varieties on his family’s former plantation near Lynchburg, once sold more than 500 kinds of apples through his family nursery, Burford Brothers, in Monroe. When he closed it in 1994, he essentially gave his collection of more than 200 heirloom apple varieties to Charlotte Shelton, whose family runs Vintage Virginia Apples in North Garden, Va.“The whole culture of the apple disappeared with Madison Avenue advertising,” Mr. Burford said, “when we started eating with our eyes instead of our mouths.”Now, according to Renewing America’s Food Traditions, or RAFT, a national alliance of local food advocates, farmers and preservationists, the American apple has plummeted from a rich diversity of 16,000 varieties in the late 1800s to about 3,000. And the few nurseries that offer those rare apples are fast disappearing.The consumer sees only about a dozen apples in the supermarket, and Red Delicious constitutes 41 percent of all apples sold. As Gary Paul Nabhan, the founder of RAFT, puts it: “That’s like thinking that all dogs are like Lassie.”The disappearance of these apples represents not only a loss of delightfully different flavors and textures, but genetic diversity, and is something Mr. Calhoun has spent a good part of his life trying to prevent.“I JUST went around in my car and talked to people,” he said. “I’d spot an apple tree in their yard or out in their pasture or behind the barn, and I’d ask them about it.”His first find, in 1982, was Magnum Bonum, a juicy, crisp dark red apple that ripens in September.Cary Fowler, an author of “Shattering: Food, Politics, and the Loss of Genetic Diversity,” had spied a bushel of the long-lost apples at a roadside stand in Fancy Gap, Va., in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Hearing that, Mr. Calhoun jumped into his car and drove 200 miles.“I found the guy, who still had two old trees, so I went back in February and got some cuttings and grafted that tree,” Mr. Calhoun said, nodding at a large well-branched specimen in his orchard.He spotted his second find the following year, while picking strawberries with his wife, Edith, who died in January, at 76. They were at a U-pick farm “run by an elderly man and his wife,” he said. “She knew exactly what it was. ‘That’s a Summer Orange my dad planted in 1910.’”Most of the apples, in fact, came with a story, like the Tommy, grown by a man named Tommy Johnson, who lived in the 1700s.“He was apparently a nobody, but people passed his name down,” Mr. Calhoun said. “And it’s a good apple.”Aunt Rachel, a great sauce apple, hails from Chatham County. “I’ve never found any written record about that apple,” Mr. Calhoun said. “It was found in this county and passed around, almost certainly by digging up root sprouts and giving them to relatives and friends.”It’s that personal connection, that little story, that makes an old apple different from a modern apple, he said.Johnny Appleseed, by the way, wasn’t the only person planting apple seeds on the frontier.“Everybody would take a pocketful of apple seeds with them, when they pulled up stakes and moved to new land,” Mr. Calhoun said. People sampled the apples and selected the trees that had the best tasting fruit.And every apple had a particular use. Some, like Blacktwig and Magnum Bonum, are good eating apples, fresh off the tree.“Blacktwig was grown from a Winesap seed, in Arkansas or Tennessee, so it’s got that Winesap twang to it,” Mr. Calhoun said. “But it’s a little bit sweeter, a little crisper, a little bit bigger, a little redder.” It’s also a good keeper.Others, like Early Strawberry, which ripens in late June, make a fabulous tart applesauce. Smokehouse, which ripens in August, has enough acid in it to make a quality pie. Still others, like Arkansas Black, aren’t worth eating until they’ve been stored for a few months.“Nobody a hundred years ago would have attempted to eat an Arkansas Black off the tree — they knew better,” Mr. Calhoun said. “It’s hard as a rock. They put them in a sack in the cellar and pulled them out after Christmas.”Once Mr. Calhoun got into collecting, the hunt itself drove him on, like Ahab looking for Moby Dick. He started writing letters to local newspapers and articles for rural magazines.Carter’s Blue, a juicy aromatic apple from Alabama with a bluish-gray tinge to the fruit and the leaves, was thought to be extinct until an apple lover in Oregon read an article Mr. Calhoun had written, listing his 10 most-wanted apples. The man sent him a letter, saying he had seen Carter’s Blue growing at the National Fruit Collection in Kent, England. Mr. Calhoun got permission to have scions shipped to this country, to graft trees for his growing collection.The Cullasaga, which probably originated from a seedling tree the Cherokee grew in their orchards, surfaced in a letter from a man in Macon County, Ga., who said his neighbors had an old, decayed tree with only a few live limbs left.“Edith and I got in the car and we were gone,” Mr. Calhoun said, setting off on a five-hour drive to Highlands. “We had to borrow a ladder to get way up to some cuttings.”Those twigs produced 30 to 40 new Cullasaga trees. And now the old tree they came from is dead.“A lot of Southerners who have an ancient tree know that tree is rare and that it’s dying fast, but they don’t know what to do about it,” Mr. Calhoun said. ""When somebody like me comes along, and says, ‘I’ll graft it for you and give you a tree and save one for my own orchard,’ they’re delighted.”And as climate change brings warmer springs to Northern apple trees, reducing the number of cold days that apples need to set bud and flower and fruit, Mr. Calhoun pointed out, nurseries may need to replace them with Southern varieties that can take more heat and set fruit with fewer chill hours. “I do think that heat-tolerant apples would be useful to plant breeders, if for nothing else,” he said.One example is Shell, an old variety named after Green Shell, the man who grew it in southern Alabama a few miles from the Florida line. It is a good eating apple, with the sweet-tart balance that most people prefer.“It was down to one or two trees, apparently, when a county agent sent me some twigs,” Mr. Calhoun said.Shell blooms early in his orchard, then often gets hit by a freeze. And nipped blossoms won’t fruit. But if a warming climate brings earlier springs, this heat-tolerant heirloom might come in handy in Pennsylvania or New York State.A S their collection grew, the Calhouns began selling heirloom trees by word of mouth, a hobby that grew until they were selling nearly 2,000 trees a year.In their search for old catalogs and books about apples, they discovered the National Agricultural Library, in Beltsville, Md., which has a little-known collection of 3,500 watercolors of apples and about 100,000 old nursery catalogs, arranged by year, in dusty cardboard boxes.They didn’t go through every box, but they found hundreds of catalogs that listed old apples and when and where they were sold, and sometimes their origins. All this knowledge called out for a book, so Mr. Calhoun began to write one, longhand, with Edith typing the pages.“Old Southern Apples,” published by McDonald & Woodward in 1995, listed 1,800 varieties, only 500 of which were known to still exist. Illustrated with hundreds of color prints from the federal Department of Agriculture Pomological Watercolor Collection, it was filled with the stories of these old apples, as well as clear descriptions, histories and uses. The book was out of print for years until January, when Chelsea Green published a revised edition that includes 200 additional varieties, discovered after the first edition was published.It came out just in time.“Edith was able to hold it in her hands and read the dedication,” Mr. Calhoun said.It was to her, of course: “For Edith: My wife, sweetheart, best friend, helpmate.”The thing is, Edith didn’t even like apples that much, though she loved to cook with them.“But if I needed somebody to ride shotgun, she was always there,” Mr. Calhoun said.EARLY spring is a good time to plant heirloom apple trees, and in many parts of the country, grafting workshops and scion exchanges are offered, in which cuttings of local heirloom apple trees can be grafted onto rootstock. A few are listed here; others may be found through agricultural extension offices or community newspapers. Most require registration.NEW YORK STATE Lee Reich will hold a grafting workshop at his farm in New Paltz in late April or early May; participants will graft their own pear and apple trees using scions from the home orchard.

"'11-03-03,'1','Many intellectuals, former politicians and ordinary citizens say that if the National Agenda had been carried out — with changes in the electoral laws, more civil rights and better economic policies — in the past five years, Jordan would not be faced with the difficult challenges of today.“We have been speaking about this National Agenda and reform for so long,” said Audeh Quawas, a former member of Parliament. “We heard about several political reforms — but the truth is we were going backwards, including in terms of civil rights.”Amid continuing protests across the region, several thousand demonstrators took to the streets of Jordan this week to press for real political, judicial and economic change. Newspapers, too, have been campaigning for comprehensive, rapid political change. A cartoon published in Al Ghad, an independent newspaper, featured a map of Jordan covered with protest banners.Jordanians on Twitter have created a “ReformJO” hashtag, a 140-character platform in which they spill their thoughts on how their country should move forward. Facebook pages like “What the Jordanian People Want” have been created. Journalists at the government-owned newspaper Al Rai staged their first protest ever, demanding higher salaries and more press freedom. A journalist standing in front of the newspaper building carried a placard that read: “You have suffocated us.”Reacting to the uprisings in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen and elsewhere, King Abdullah II has tried to head off anger by siding with the demonstrators.“When I say reform, I want real and quick reform, because without genuine reforms, the situation will remain as it was,” the king said in a speech to the heads and members of the executive, legislative and judicial authorities.After the announcement of subsidies for fuel and basic goods and pay increases for civil servants and security personnel failed to restore calm, Abdullah last month dismissed the government of Prime Minister Samir Rifai.“The king realized that it’s time to make major changes,” said Hani al-Hourani, an analyst and director at al-Urdun al-Jadid Research Center, a political science institute. “I hope that these changes will be implemented and the government that is chosen is sensitive to the needs of the people.”Steps by the government in recent weeks have included scrapping an article in the Public Assembly Law that required government consent to hold rallies and protests. But final approval is still pending in Parliament.“We have a crisis and the people of Jordan will continue protesting because obviously policies have failed in the past,” said Mohammed Sweidan, the managing editor of Al Ghad. “I am not confident this new government has the political will for serious reform because they are saying it can take three or six months. There is no need to wait that long to start the implementation process.”School teachers in Jordan had started protesting even before the Tunisian uprising, calling for better working conditions and higher salaries. This week they demanded fundamental changes in the education system and announced plans to form a union.“Prior to the regional uprisings, there were demands issued by political parties, unions and even from teachers in Jordan, but today the statements are bolder than ever,” said Hussein al-Khozahe, a sociologist and expert in developmental studies at al-Balqa Applied University in Amman.This week a group of university professors, including Towfic Shomar, an associate professor at Philadelphia University in Amman, opened a campaign for a university teachers’ union.“We think this is a very good time to establish a union because of the democratic changes in the region and we hope to have the union established in the next two or three months,” Mr. Shomar said.The government has, meanwhile, set up a committee to overhaul the electoral system, a persistent demand by demonstrators and the public. Hamzah Mansur, chief of the Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, told protesters last week: “We want immediate constitutional change to help create productive governments and a truly representative Parliament.”Some long-running grievances are also being addressed. A national housing initiative, Decent Housing for a Decent Living, introduced by Abdullah in February 2008 to build homes for poor Jordanians, has been referred to the government’s anti-corruption unit after repeated allegations of favoritism and nepotism.“I believe corruption is a big challenge for Jordan,” Mr. Hourani said. “When there are laws and nongovernmental organizations fighting corruption, yet it increases, it means there needs to be a real political will, real democracy, real Parliament, a robust media that has enough strength to fight without fear.”For a younger generation reared on the Internet and satellite television, “it’s no longer about the political will, but when,” said Mr. Khozahe, the sociologist. “You can’t silence them and you can’t beat them into submission. They see the region, they see the world and there’s no turning back this time.”'"
"'11-03-03,'1','Here, DogBook is the one to watch. Free and only for the iPhone, this is the mobile version of the DogBook service on Facebook, which lets dog owners post profiles of their pets and connect with other canine lovers.The app is promising, but flawed. You can search for Facebook friends who have also joined DogBook. But when I searched the list, very few had actually posted profiles of their dogs.The app displays the profiles of your friends’ pets, but if my friends are any indication, these profiles offer limited (and not very entertaining) information. You can also view profiles of dogs who live near you, but because they belong to strangers, the information is even less interesting.The search feature is marginally entertaining, though, because you can search for specific dog names and breeds and see how many people within a certain geographic area own animals like yours.A more useful tool for socially minded dog owners is Dog Park Finder, which puts the content of DogGoes.com into a mobile-friendly format. The free version of the iPhone app shows the location of roughly 2,600 dog parks, including those closest to you. Dog Park Finder Plus ($2) adds about 2,500 dog-friendly hiking spots and beaches. (Hey Walkies, a highly rated and free iPhone app, offers similar features, but is limited to New York City users.)What if you’re out with your dog and it eats something toxic, like, perhaps, someone’s stash of dark chocolate?Here is where PupTox and, to a greater extent, Pet First Aid come in handy. The apps can save you from a frantic trip to the veterinarian’s office.Pet First Aid offers users a list of hazardous substances for household pets and points out toxic elements you may otherwise overlook. Avocados and antifreeze, for instance, can be toxic for pets.The list includes a section on chocolate, where you can calculate the lethal dosages for dogs of certain weights. The app further differentiates between milk chocolate and pure chocolate.Pet First Aid includes a section for adding veterinary contacts and pet identifications, and lists vaccinations and other information. One of its developers is also the publisher of PetCPR.com, which offers pet health advice.Far bigger online publishers are also pushing their content to mobile phones, including AOL, which produces the free Paw Nation. This polished, useful iPhone app is technically pet-agnostic, but the information skews heavily in the direction of dogs.Users can choose from several categories of stories and videos, including pieces on animal nutrition and health, celebrity pets and question-and-answer sessions with veterinarians and specialists from the American Kennel Club.Some recent features include advice for giving dogs ibuprofen and Benadryl, tips for owners of snoring canines and guidance on why a dog’s ears can get smelly. (Tips: smelly ears can be cured with medicine, but you’re more likely to need a surgeon to get rid of snoring.)App developers haven’t built programs for your dog to play with your device, as they have done with cats. But iSqueek and Squeaky Fun Time are close, in that they can at least attract your dog’s attention.ISqueek, for instance, includes interactive photos of 18 different squeaky toys. The toys were true to life and annoying. Perhaps predictably, Pippi was quickly drawn to the sound when I tapped the toys. Squeaky Fun Time offered uninspired graphics and less sound control, but it was free and the closest thing to iSqueek that I could find on the Android platform.The app that held the most promise for me was, likewise, free. Dog Whistler emits high-pitched tones that you can tweak in various ways, especially on the iPhone version, so you can train your dog to, for instance, not threaten your sanity with incessant barking.The app receives mixed reviews, so I was prepared for the worst. (As one iTunes reviewer wrote, “It doesn’t work on the dog, but it really annoys my brother.”)I opened Dog Whistler and waited for my daughter’s school bus to unload in front of our house — a trigger for Pippi’s most frantic barking. When it did, and Pippi started growling, I pointed the iPhone at her and hit the whistle.Man, did it hurt my ears, but it didn’t keep her from barking.Pinball Deluxe, new (and free) for the Android, runs in high resolution on phones and tablets. It includes three game tables. ... Fast Web Installer, which is free from Android and allows users to download apps to their phones from the AppBrain online store, is once again available. Last year, Google disabled Installer, which works with one of the more popular Android app Web sites. ... With GeoRing, new from Phone ($2), you can set your own songs as your ring tones.'"
"'11-03-03,'1','Through Exchange, Mr. Xavier, whose business is Cornerstone Executive Development Group in Chapel Hill, N.C., links the calendars, address books and e-mail programs on his computers, BlackBerry and iPad. A change made on a calendar on any one device syncs instantly with all of the others, Mr. Xavier said. Because his large clients use Exchange, he says he believes that his using it as well “gives them the impression that I am bigger than I am.”A Google Voice phone number can be especially useful because it automatically transcribes voice mail into e-mail — creating a written, searchable record of messages. Matthew Taylor Ruggieri, owner of the Motley, a Web site based in Los Angeles that sells men’s grooming products, said Google Voice made him more efficient. “It lets me respond to a customer’s request wherever I am by voice, text or e-mail,” he said. “And if things get too crazy, I can route the calls to my sister’s phone and she helps me out.”E-MAIL AND SOCIAL MEDIA MailChimp, which Mr. Hale used to follow up with those Baby Loves Disco leads, also helps him send monthly newsletters to his clients — with the option of creating a Facebook or Twitter link version of the newsletter. MailChimp can send auto-respond e-mails as well, which Mr. Ruggieri uses to follow up after a customer makes a purchase. “A personal-looking e-mail response is triggered 10 days later asking if the product was satisfactory,” he said.As he did after the Baby Loves Disco tour, Mr. Hale puts all of his client leads and contacts into Batchbook. “I can pull up my contacts and find all my client’s information, including social media data — like their last three tweets,” he said. “This gives me something relevant to talk about in making contact with them.” It also pings him when a client’s child has a birthday coming up.ORGANIZATION Peter Sorgenfrei, founder of a product development consulting firm, Sorgenfrei L.L.C in New York, uses a Web application called Highrise to keep track of his e-mail, so he knows when he last communicated with a client and what was said. Whenever Mr. Sorgenfrei sends an e-mail, a blind copy of the message is sent to his Highrise account, where it is archived. “I come across as completely buttoned-up and in-control,” he said, “because I have all the information, files and discussions in one place and can access them before talking to the client.” Recently, when an automotive manufacturer he works with couldn’t find some legal documents it had sent him, Mr. Sorgenfrei located them in his Highrise archive. It took him just minutes to send the documents back to the client.Mr. Hale relies on OmniFocus, a Web-based task management program with an iPhone app that allows him to capture his thoughts and turn them into actionable items. “Whether it’s that I need to buy milk, call a client, write my e-mail newsletter,” he said, “it gets it out of my head and prioritized, so I know when I’ll do each thing.”Mr. Garland solves his clutter problem — the piles of papers and receipts — with Shoeboxed. “They send you a prepaid envelope and you shove everything in there,” he said. “They digitize it and create a content management system for you, then send back the originals.” Shoeboxed has an iPhone app for scanning business cards and receipts; if users send photos of those cards and receipts, Shoeboxed will extract the expense and contact data.ACCOUNTING Several business owners recommended FreshBooks, a cloud-based accounting software that is free (up to a point that suits most solo business operators). FreshBooks’ MiniBooks app for the iPhone allows business owners to record their time on the way home from a client or send an invoice when traveling. It also integrates with Shoeboxed so that digitalized expense receipts can be turned into an invoice. “It’s very easy to use and lets you send out professional-looking invoices instantly, which is very important,” Mr. Garland said.OFFLINE TOOLS AND STRATEGIES Many solo entrepreneurs rely on virtual assistants — temporary help hired as needed — who work remotely, usually from their homes. They can handle tasks like research, data entry and e-mail replies. Mr. Garland uses virtual assistants about 40 hours a month. “What’s nice is you don’t have an employee,” he said. “This is someone who bills you by the hour, so it’s an expense you can deduct.” Mr. Sorgenfrei has a membership in Regus, which enables him to find temporary office space worldwide. “I can show up at any Regus location and work there for the day, get a land line, Internet access and schedule a conference room if I have a meeting,” he said. “As a solopreneur it’s easy to get caught up in a coffee shop thinking big thoughts instead of actually getting work done.”'"
"'11-03-03,'1','PARIS — John Galliano, the talented and troubled designer who was fired by the fashion house Christian Dior for making anti-Semitic remarks in a drunken rant at a bar, will be put on trial for the offenses, the Paris prosecutors office said Wednesday.Mr. Galliano, who friends said has left France to enter a rehabilitation program, also issued an apology through his London lawyer’s office on Wednesday: ‘‘Anti-Semitism and racism have no part in our society. I unreservedly apologize for my behavior in causing any offense.’’The prosecutors office said the trial could take place between April and June this year, and that if found guilty Mr. Galliano could face as long as six months in prison and up to €22,500, or $31,000, in fines. French law makes it a crime to incite racial hatred; the statute has been used in the past to punish anti-Semitic remarks.The designer’s statement said he was ‘‘subjected to verbal harassment and an unprovoked assault when an individual tried to hit me with a chair having taken violent exception to my look and my clothing’’ during the altercation at a Paris cafe last week. He also has started legal action for defamation, his statement said.Mr. Galliano was persuaded to accept treatment for his alcohol problems by close colleagues and friends like the supermodels Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss, the sources said, asking to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the situation. While the treatment center is not known, it is likely that his destination is the Meadows, a facility in Wickenberg, Ariz., where Elton John and Donatella Versace were treated in the past.For Christian Dior, the billion-dollar company, the problems are only multiplying. The Dior autumn 2011 women’s wear show will go ahead here on Friday, according to a person at Dior who asked not to be identified.'"
"'11-03-03,'1','WASHINGTON — With rebels in Libya calling for Western airstrikes on forces supporting Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi , Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates warned Congress on Wednesday that even a more modest effort to establish a no-flight zone over Libya would have to begin with an attack on the country’s air defenses and would require “a big operation in a big country.”Mr. Gates’s caution illustrates the chasm between what the rebels and some leading members of Congress are calling for and what President Obama appears willing to do in Libya. Mr. Obama and his aides have argued that it is not yet clear that the insurgents need the help — and they have warned that the use of American airpower could fuel the arguments of those in the Middle East who see a Washington conspiracy behind homegrown uprisings.But even some members of the president’s own party sounded unconvinced on Wednesday. Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and one of the president’s chief foreign policy allies in Congress, argued that “a no-fly zone is not a long-term proposition” and warned that other nations and NATO should not be “on the sidelines” as Colonel Qaddafi’s jets begin to attack the antigovernment insurgents.“We ought to be considering a wide range of responses, and a no-fly zone ought to be an option,” Mr. Kerry said late Wednesday. “We have a number of tools, and we should not remove any of them from the table.”Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut independent, who along with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, has been calling for a no-flight zone, said Wednesday after Mr. Gates’ testimony: “Is it complicated? Yeah. Can we do it? Of course.” He noted that “we did it for a long time and quite successfully in Iraq.”But over the past day or two, American military officials, even while positioning ships off Libya, have warned that a no-flight zone would not be as antiseptic as it sounded, and that the diplomatic and international political hurdles would be difficult to overcome. It is unclear if it would require an authorization from Congress to use force, the first since the authorization to use force against Iraq passed nearly a decade ago, or authorization by the United Nations.Such authorization is missing from the United Nations Security Council resolution passed last week, and so far there is no movement in the Council to toughen that resolution.Mr. Gates, the most prominent Republican in the administration, was even blunter than usual as he approaches the end of his time in office. His testimony came days after he gave a speech warning that America should avoid another big, intractable land war like those under way in Iraq and Afghanistan. His testimony on Wednesday before the House Appropriations Committee was given just as Libyan forces loyal to Colonel Qaddafi bombed insurgents outside of Tripoli.“Let’s just call a spade a spade,” Mr. Gates said. “A no-fly zone begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses. That’s the way you do a no-fly zone. And then you can fly planes around the country and not worry about our guys being shot down. But that’s the way it starts.”Rebels in Benghazi, the Libyan city held by opponents of Colonel Qaddafi, made it clear on Wednesday that they were looking for more than just a no-flight zone. Shortly after forming an “interim national government council” led by Colonel Qaddafi’s former justice minister, Mustafa Abdel-Jalil, they called on Western powers to conduct airstrikes against the “strongholds of the mercenaries” and any equipment “used against civilians and people,” according to The Associated Press.Their call seems to indicate that the rebels, while effective so far in holding off attacks from Colonel Qaddafi’s loyalists, do not believe they can dislodge the colonel from his Tripoli redoubt.Now the White House finds itself caught between Mr. Obama’s own sense of caution, and critics on both the left and the right who believe that the president should be more forceful in aiding the rebels, protecting the population and helping engineer Colonel Qaddafi’s ouster. His aides have said that any overt American military intervention could play into Colonel Qaddafi’s narrative that the uprising is a Western-led plot to occupy Libya and seize its oil.“There’s a great temptation to stand up and say, ‘We’ll help you rid the country of a dictator,’ ” one senior administration official said, insisting on anonymity because of the delicacy of the discussions. “But the president has been clear that what’s sweeping across the Middle East is organic to the region, and as soon as we become a military player, we’re at risk of falling into the old trap that Americans are stage-managing events for their own benefit.”Thus, the administration has relied on more indirect steps — freezing $30 billion in Libyan assets, barring Libyan officials from travel and calling for Colonel Qaddafi to resign. None of those steps, White House officials concede, are likely to significantly change the situation.'"
"'11-03-03,'1','President Asif Ali Zardari told members of his governing Pakistan Peoples Party at a meeting in the southern port city of Karachi that Mr. Bhatti was a victim of a “negative mind-set and intolerance,” according to the state-run news service.But Mr. Zardari, fearful for his personal security, failed to attend the funeral of his colleague, Mr. Taseer, and the few members of his party who favored changing the blasphemy law have been sidelined in the last two months and effectively silenced. Mr. Taseer’s killer has been hailed as a hero in rallies held by conservative religious parties.Mr. Bhatti was heading for a cabinet meeting when three or four gunmen ambushed his car outside his house in a middle-class neighborhood of the capital, Islamabad, and shot him multiple times as he sat in the back seat, the police said.The killers, dressed in traditional Pakistani garb of baggy pants and long tunic, fled the scene in a white car. The hospital where Mr. Bhatti was pronounced dead said 20 bullets had been fired.A pamphlet found at the site warned against changes in the blasphemy law and was signed by militants, police officials said. It specifically named Mr. Bhatti.A spokesman for the Taliban, who is based in Punjab, later called Pakistani media and claimed responsibility for the assassination.Mr. Bhatti, worried about the death threats he received after the killing of Mr. Taseer, had asked the Interior Ministry for a bulletproof car and a larger squad of security guards, standard measures for many government ministers, Mr. Gill said.But the request was ignored, Mr. Gill said. There was no sign of a security detail as Mr. Bhatti left his house on Wednesday morning, witnesses said.In Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called the assassination “an attack not only on one man but on the values of tolerance and respect for people of all faiths and backgrounds that had been championed by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan.”Mrs. Clinton, who recently met with Mr. Bhatti during a visit he made to Washington, called him a “very impressive, courageous man” who knew the danger he faced.Shortly before his death, Mr. Bhatti said he knew extremists were after him. “I am receiving threats on speaking against the blasphemy law, but my faith gives me strength and we will not allow the handful of extremists to fulfill their agenda,” he said.The Vatican spokesman, Father Federico Lombardi, quickly issued a statement calling the murder of Mr. Bhatti a “terribly grave new act of violence” that “demonstrates that the pope’s insistent addresses regarding violence against Christians and religious freedom have been justified.”Christians make up less than 5 percent of the 180 million people in Pakistan, and are clustered in some of the poor neighborhoods on the outskirts of cities in Punjab where militant extremism is sharply increasing.A prominent liberal lawyer, Babar Sattar, said he worried the gunmen would get away “scot- free,” and criticized the government for its reaction to Mr. Taseer’s killing. “If the state had come down strongly and with an unequivocal message that this would not be tolerated after Salman Taseer’s murder perhaps these people would be stopped,” he said.The government-employed bodyguard who killed Mr. Taseer was showered with petals at his court appearances by lawyers, who several years ago were considered to be the vanguard of a more open Pakistan.By stifling discussion on the blasphemy law, the Pakistan Peoples Party was retreating from its original principles of a secular Pakistan, and giving free rein to the conservative Islam that has seeped into government circles and the military, Mr. Sattar said.After the assassination of Mr. Taseer, and the outpouring of sympathy for his killer, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani pledged in Parliament that the government had no intention of changing the blasphemy laws.A senior member of the Pakistan Peoples Party, Sherry Rehman, was told by Mr. Gilani last month to withdraw a bill she sponsored that called for reform of the law. In the charged atmosphere since Mr. Taseer’s murder, Ms. Rehman lives under the protection of armed guards at her home in Karachi, and spends much of her time fighting court cases filed against her by conservative religious leaders.Mr. Bhatti, in contrast to the wealthy, outspoken and sociable Mr. Taseer, lived modestly, was single and “married to his work,” an associate said.“Thoroughly Pakistani, a gentleman, a follower of Jinnah,” the founder of Pakistan, said Shaukat Javed, a former head of the police force in Punjab.Chosen by the Pakistan Peoples Party in 2008 to fill one of five parliamentary seats allocated to members of minority communities, Mr. Bhatti became increasing isolated in the party as its leadership bent to the pressure of conservative religious groups in the last several months.Even so Mr. Bhatti never gave up, Mr. Sattar said.When a Christian woman, Asia Bibi, was given a death sentence last year, Mr. Bhatti agreed with Mr. Taseer that she should be granted a pardon. He wrote a report for President Zardari outlining the facts of the Bibi case, emphasizing that the blasphemy law was a tool to persecute minorities.He was then asked by Mr. Zardari to head a panel of scholars, including Muslims, to review the blasphemy laws, but the members of the panel were never named because of the religious fervor unleashed by Mr. Taseer’s murder, friends of Mr. Bhatti said.Last Sunday, Mr. Bhatti was busy arranging a memorial service for Mr. Taseer in Lahore this weekend.Now, his friends said, the service will very likely be held for the two men, one quiet, one brash, who fought for the cause of a more tolerant Pakistan and lost their lives in the quest.'"
"'11-03-03,'1','Mr. Wang, cutting his teeth in the fashion world at the zenith of the bust, was the right mind at the right time. He knew that cool kids wanted a new highbrow-lowbrow haute-casual that could be worn to the prestigious day gig (modeling, interning) and would require no change whatsoever to go out dining and dancing all night (lather, rinse, repeat).Even though the floors have been covered in slabs of white marble, the redesigned space feels warm and tingly. The center holds the God-like hammock, a deep black leather couch, a brass coffee table. What distinguishes this from other retail sitting areas is that customers are actually sitting — nay, luxuriating — in it; talking, reading their phones. They even feel comfortable enough to kick their dirty old Converses right onto the fox fur, and this is the right spirit: there is permission. Nothing, it seems, is too precious to be played with, around or on.Mr. Wang has an uncanny ability to borrow references from his contemporaries without seeming to knock them over and pull their prices down. Example: unisexy cotton-poly jackets, softer than a cloth diaper, evocative of Lilies, the Rick Owens secondary line. But the cut is a shade simpler, and way less of a wallet gouge (cocoon wrap, $160).Several silhouettes I’ve grieved over since Phi closed seem to have spiritually reincarnated onto Mr. Wang’s floor: skinny racer-back tank dresses, $240; pleated harem shorts, $495; a sleeveless tuxedo jacket in ivory mesh, $645.I saw a woman who was a classic specimen of the Yamamoto tribe: neon hair, architectural glasses, a huge coat that looked like something Frank Gehry erected out of sleeping bags. I hoped she was getting back part of her lost world: honeydew- and cantaloupe-colored caftans in parachute silk with metallic tape details that would work equally well on Grace Jones or the Sun Ra Arkestra ($695); mint-green metallic disco jackets with rose gold zippers ($625).The staff is helpful, playful and very sweet.“See anything you like?” asked the manager, who looked like a Starship Enterprise crew member.“I like her,” I said, pointing at his co-worker: a lovely imp in a silky black V-neck, baggy silk-satin shorts riding low on her hips ($395), black tights and ankle booties. She skipped over. “He dressed me!” she said, spinning around. It all worked: slouchy, flattering, elegant, wholly unfussy.I wanted it all. Her whole outfit was found in my size and dispatched toward the dressing rooms.“There is quite a line,” the manager lamented. “I am so sorry!” I received three apologies from the staff members, and I really hadn’t waited long.Ready-to-wear designer fashion is, to a large extent, ridiculous. It primarily caters to that microscopic sliver of the population that can afford to buy race cars, politicians and LVAD artificial heart pumps. But every once in a while, a smart design proves cost-effective because it changes the game and reinvents its own medium.An $80 black rayon T-shirt should be a grotesque plutocratic sin. But when you put on one of Mr. Wang’s, you realize: oh. This would be equally appropriate for work, bowling, lawn darts, gnocchi fights ... and it drapes well enough to be worn as rebellious evening wear. It connects dots you hadn’t imagined were connectible before.It’s hard to give an unequivocal rave to someone so young, rich and squeaky.

"'11-03-04,'0','The N.F.L. generated nearly $9 billion in revenue last year. While both sides have amassed lockout war chests, millions of dollars will be lost if there is no new deal in March. The N.F.L. expects to lose $120 million in revenue if there is no deal by the deadline and $1 billion if there is no deal by the start of the regular season in September.The numbers go up from there: $400 million per week if games are missed. Free agents, who cannot sign contracts if there is a lockout, and players who are owed certain bonuses could forgo hundreds of millions of dollars more if no deal is struck in March.Owners are hearing from local sponsors and luxury suite holders that they do not want to renew contracts without an assurance that games will be played — troubling news for small-market teams with narrower margins and owners who have to pay enormous debt service on new or renovated stadiums. Major sponsors are likely to be reluctant to negotiate extensions without knowing what the future looks like.Players’ concerns are even more immediate. Free agent players cannot sign deals during a lockout, and few teams are willing to sign even their most prized free agents without knowing what rules will be in place under a new collective bargaining agreement.The major roadblock to a deal remains how to divide the revenue. The N.F.L. currently receives $1 billion off the top of the revenue pool, and the players receive nearly 60 percent of the rest of the money. Owners have wanted to get another $1 billion off the top, arguing that it would help reinvestment in the game, including new facilities and the NFL Network, things that owners say have the potential to generate even more revenue in the future. Players have resisted.The union wants to preserve at least a 50-50 split of revenue. A question remains: 50 percent of what figure? With more revenue from 18 games, and the shifting of money from rookies to veterans, players may not suffer a loss in real dollars. In fact, players might come out slightly ahead, even in the short term.'"
"'11-03-04,'0','WASHINGTON — As they opened negotiations with Republicans over budget cuts, the White House and Congressional Democrats on Thursday offered to trim an additional $6.5 billion from current spending, a figure far short of the Republican goal of cutting agency budgets by $61 billion.The gap between the opening Democratic bid and the cuts already approved by the new House majority illustrated the difficulty the two parties faced in reaching a compromise before the March 18 expiration of a two-week budget bill even with more participation by the White House.To test support for the competing plans and lay the groundwork for a compromise, officials said that Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, planned to allow debate and votes on the proposals next week to demonstrate that both parties would need to make concessions in any agreement on financing the government through Sept. 30.The plan to push the spending dispute onto the Senate floor emerged after a high-level meeting presided over by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The Congressional participants — Speaker John A. Boehner; Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader; Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader; and Mr. Reid — had no comment after the hourlong session, leaving it to Mr. Biden, who issued a short statement.“We had a good meeting, and the conversation will continue,” Mr. Biden said.Before the session, White House officials disclosed that they were willing to accept an additional $6.5 billion in cuts, on top of $4 billion in reductions enacted in a short-term budget bill earlier this week.Gene Sperling, the chief White House economic adviser, said, “We’ve made clear that we are willing to cut spending further if we can find common ground on cuts that we can all agree would help reduce the deficit without harming the economy in the short term or harming our long-term competitiveness.”But even before the negotiating session began, Republicans said the new figure proposed by the White House in consultation with Congressional Democrats was inadequate, particularly given the pressure Republican leaders are under from their rank and file to not give ground from the $61 billion in cuts.In assembling the proposed cuts, Democrats combed through the bill passed by the House looking for programs that had also been singled out by the White House or Democrats on Capitol Hill.Among the initiatives to lose financing under the Democratic plan, officials said, are a variety of agricultural programs, Federal Emergency Management Agency grants, a Federal Bureau of Investigation construction program, a Great Lakes restoration effort and a wildfire suppression program. The Democratic plan would also reduce spending on embassy maintenance, cut $227 million from information technology efforts at the Department of Veterans Affairs and pare back some economic development efforts.Mr. Sperling agreed in part with Republicans that cutting spending can help the economy recover by signaling that the government is getting its finances in order, even as it costs some jobs in the short term under either side’s proposed level of cuts. But the White House portrayed the Republican cuts as deep enough to threaten the economy.“There can be confidence benefits in showing that you are starting the path of getting your fiscal house in order,” Mr. Sperling said. But cuts on the scale of the House Republicans’ package, he added, would have a “negative impact for the immediate economy” that offsets any benefits.In planning to bring the competing spending bills to a vote in the Senate, party leaders expect to show that neither the Democratic plan nor the Republican plan has the support to clear the Senate, forcing both sides to give ground. The Senate vote could be particularly helpful, aides said, in showing the 87 new Republican members of the House that the $61 billion in cuts cannot survive, giving the leadership leverage in pushing for a compromise that can pass.Earlier Thursday, Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, said she welcomed a chance to vote on the House plan and discuss its wide-ranging cuts.“I think the American people need to look at what’s going on with my Republican friends who are in charge of the House of Representatives,” she said. “We all know we need to reduce the deficit, but we also know the right way to do it.”The interim spending bill passed by the Senate and signed by the president on Wednesday extends through March 18, giving Congress and the administration two weeks to strike a deal to finance the government through Sept. 30, pass another short-term measure or see parts of the government shut down.Representative Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican and the majority leader, said Thursday that if lawmakers were unable to reach a deal, House Republicans would continue to pursue cuts through temporary budget bills.“Our intention is to continue to go forward reducing spending at the rate of $2 billion a week until we can see some signal from the Senate that they are serious about cutting spending,” Mr. Cantor said.'"

"'11-03-04,'0','On Sunday night he was in Hollywood, as co-host of the Oscar telecast in black tie. At 9 the next morning, he was in a Starbucks in New Haven, hunched over a book and barely recognizable in a gray sweatshirt, but still wearing his tuxedo pants.James Franco, movie star, had rushed back on the red-eye to play his other big role: Yale doctoral student. By 9:25, he was at his seat in a seminar on medieval manuscripts. “I was surprised and delighted that he made it to class,” said Jessica Brantley, an associate professor of English. “He’s a dedicated student.”Mr. Franco seemed to shrug off the bad reviews of what many in the national news media called an inert performance at the Academy Awards show. Yet later on Monday, he pounced on The Yale Daily News for some mild criticism of his monosyllabic Twitter style, posting a message with an obscenity scrawled in red Photoshop paint.Yale has had its share of screen-star students, including Jodie Foster and Claire Danes, who have walked a delicate line between visibility and aloofness. But by all accounts, Mr. Franco, 32, who arrived last fall as a full-time student in Yale’s Ph.D. program in English, has straddled the line like no one else — at once the retiring scholar and the focus of attention.In campus interviews this week, several people said he had worked to keep his new role more of an intense character part than a lead.“He’s very good at not attracting attention to himself and blending in,” said Michael Warner, chairman of Yale’s English department, whose graduate course on Walt Whitman Mr. Franco took last semester. “He goes down in his charisma, and he looks with thoughtful attention at the people around him and doesn’t display the Hollywood wattage.”But Mr. Franco, who declined to be interviewed, has hardly escaped the glare of publicity. Student journalists chronicle his every move. Twitter messages breathlessly report sighting him in his habitual hoodie and shades. A student-generated blog, James Franco Has Fun, lampoons all things Franco, soliciting pictures of “James being a crazy dude.”And the fascination is fed by Mr. Franco himself, a self-promoting — and often self-mocking — polymath who is a film director, screenwriter, painter, author, performance artist and actor, with several film projects under way. In addition to the Yale program, which could take several years, he is on track to earn a master’s degree in film from New York University this spring. (“It’s a full-time program,” an N.Y.U. spokesman said. “You can’t do it any other way.”)Last year, Mr. Franco received a master’s degree in writing from Brooklyn College, and this semester he is co-teaching a course on film editing at Columbia College Hollywood, a private school in Los Angeles. It is called “Master Class: Editing James Franco — With James Franco.”Even at Yale, home of overachievers, he stands out. He has found time to undertake a multimedia musical production with about four dozen undergraduates that will open on campus in April. He is listed as a producer, but has worked with students on all aspects of the show, “The Stargazer,” including casting, making script revisions and acting in the film elements.“We’re all really fascinated and awed,” said Cokey Cohen, the columnist at The Yale Daily News who drew Mr. Franco’s ire. “To see someone who has what we all consider to have an ideal life — with a fun, successful career — to be voluntarily doing so much schoolwork all the time is both really admirable and something I can’t even comprehend.”Dr. Warner said the actor’s academic ambitions were impressive. “We have had experience before with students pursuing parallel degrees,” he said, “although the scale of his obligations is something that we’ve never seen before — but who has?”Among students, attitudes run the gamut, from indifference to curiosity to full-blown obsession. Ileana Lucos, 21, an environmental studies major, said she and her friends were on high alert for news of Mr. Franco’s whereabouts.“Definitely, the girls are like, ‘Oh, my God, I just saw him!’ ” she said. At Yale, she explained, “you have politically famous or otherwise famous, but not like a movie star that is Hollywood famous.”“I don’t know,” she continued. “There’s something about him that’s mysterious.”Others have had enough. “It doesn’t make a difference to my experience here,” said Stacey Diaz, 22, who has a double major, in international studies and African studies. “I think it’s weird that people are so wrapped up in following his every move.”For his part, Mr. Franco strikes a balance between staying “almost under cover,” as Dr. Warner put it, and indulging his fans. This week he posted pictures online from inside his room at the Study at Yale, a boutique hotel where he stays when not commuting to his apartment in New York.At Atticus Bookstore Café, where he stops in a few mornings a week for coffee, the general manager, Ben Gaffney, said Mr. Franco usually took a table in the back, books in tow. “He doesn’t come in to socialize,” he said. “Girls go up and blush and giggle and say, ‘Hi.’ He just smiles and nods his head.”Still, Mr. Franco is clearly not your average graduate student. Last semester, when he and Dr. Warner needed time to discuss a paper, Mr. Franco’s personal assistant helped arrange an unusual solution.“The only time we could find time to talk was during a train ride from New York to New Haven,” said Dr. Warner, who splits his time between the two. “So I met him on Metro-North.”'"
"'11-03-04,'0','A federal judge said on Thursday that he would approve the bankruptcy plan of the company that took over the bad assets shed by General Motors when it reorganized two years ago.The approval, from Judge Robert E. Gerber of United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, will allow for the distribution of stock and warrants to unsecured creditors who filed claims against the company being wound down, the Motors Liquidation Company.Motors Liquidation took over certain claims and assets from General Motors when the carmaker reorganized in bankruptcy court in June 2009.G.M. filed for bankruptcy in June 2009 and its best assets were sold to a new, stand-alone company the following month. G.M. held an initial public offering in November, selling shares for $33 each. Shares closed on Thursday at $33.03.“Motors Liquidation was pleased that the court today indicated from the bench that it will be confirming M.L.C.’s plan for reorganization and issuing a written decision as soon as feasible,” said Tim Yost, a spokesman for AlixPartners, the firm running the liquidation of Motors Liquidation.'"
"'11-03-04,'0','Stephanie Cathcart, a spokeswoman for the National Federation of Independent Business, said the uncertainty was frustrating to small businesses. “Only in Washington can you have something so universally agreed to, and yet we still cannot get it done,” Ms. Cathcart said.Under the law, businesses must file reports with the Internal Revenue Service on Form 1099 identifying most providers of goods or services to whom they pay $600 or more in a year.Tax experts said the reports would improve compliance by encouraging vendors of goods and services to pay more of the tax they owe, just as individuals are more likely to pay tax on dividends and interest if they know that such income has been reported to the I.R.S. by banks and mutual funds.But small businesses said the law would impose a huge administrative burden, requiring them to hire accountants and buy computer software to report routine purchases of office equipment, food, gasoline, lumber and thousands of other items.Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington, said: “The 1099 reporting requirement is an administrative nightmare for employers. It has the potential to devastate small businesses.”The new health care law requires most Americans to carry health insurance, starting in 2014. People with modest incomes will be eligible for subsidies, or tax credits, to help them afford the premiums. The amount of the subsidy is based on a person’s income, estimated from tax returns for prior years. People may be required to repay some or all of the tax credit if their actual incomes prove to be higher than estimated.The House bill increases the amount that people may have to repay.Democrats denounced this as a tax increase on the middle class and said that honest taxpayers might find themselves owing large sums to the I.R.S.But Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said, “Paying back money that you were not entitled to is not a tax increase.”Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, said, “If you get a subsidy you don’t deserve, you will have to pay it back.”Representative Joseph Crowley, Democrat of New York, said: “We all believe the 1099 reporting requirement needs to be repealed. We, too, want to help small business, but not on the backs of middle-class taxpayers.”To illustrate how the Republican bill would work, Mr. Crowley gave this example: A family of four with an annual income of $88,000 buys a typical family insurance policy costing $13,000. The family would have to pay $8,360 in premiums and could qualify for a federal tax credit of $4,640, which the Treasury would pay directly to the insurance company. If the breadwinner receives a $250 bonus at work, the family would become ineligible for the tax credit and would have to repay the full amount, $4,640, with its income taxes.Representative Ron Kind, Democrat of Wisconsin, described the repayment obligation as “a Republican tax trap.” Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, said it was “a tax on success” that would penalize people whose incomes had increased because of a raise, a bonus or additional hours of work.The Senate voted in February to repeal the reporting requirement. It would give the White House Office of Management and Budget broad discretion to offset the cost by refusing to spend money already appropriated by Congress.Mr. Obama strongly supports repeal of the reporting requirement, but objects to the financing used in the House and Senate bills. He has not proposed an alternative.'"
"'11-03-04,'0','In fact, Mr. Plater said that the current proposals did not go far enough and that dogs should be limited to fenced-in areas in the parks.The city of San Francisco is itself a threat to nature, according to Mr. Plater. While he does not advocate for the removal of residents and structures, he said several species of local wildlife — including mission blue butterflies and western snowy plovers — were at risk of extinction if dogs’ activities in the parks were not curtailed.Martha Walters, co-founder of the Crissy Field Dog Group, called such views “environmental extremism” and said nature, people and their pets could coexist.The debate over dogs in the national recreation area started in 1972 when the United States Department of the Interior began assuming control of the properties. In recognition of the need for public access to nature near San Francisco, the land was designated an urban “recreation area.” And rather than banning dogs off-leash, which is policy at all other national parks, the tradition of allowing dogs to romp free that predated federal management was allowed to continue.But complaints about unruly dogs and their waste, both from environmentalists and other park visitors, have grown over the years, according to the Park Service. Decades of arguments and lawsuits ensued. At one notorious 2001 public hearing, angry protesters reportedly spit on their foes.Unable to strike a compromise, the Park Service developed its own dog plan. Almost 2,000 pages long, it makes the case for leashing or banning dogs nearly everywhere. Off-leash play would be allowed in only seven relatively small areas with strict new rules: owners must maintain control and visual contact at all times.Alexandra Picavet, a spokeswoman for the Park Service, said that despite the recreation area designation, federal law required that “we’re held to the same standards” as other national parks regarding the obligation to preserve nature.Kenneth S. Weiner, a top environmental lawyer who has been hired by the Crissy Field Dog Group, disagreed. “The law requires some degree of consistency,” Mr. Weiner said, “but allows flexibility.”The proposed rules, which became public in January, are only a draft. Members of the public have until April 14 to offer their opinions online (hundreds of comments have already been submitted) or at a series of public meetings that started this week.“We will certainly be in a listening mode,” Ms. Picavet said.Experts familiar with the Park Service questioned that assessment and said that in previous cases, the preferences cited in draft reports were almost always adopted, regardless of public opinion.“The draft concerns us a lot,” said Jennifer Scarlett, a veterinarian and co-president of the San Francisco S.P.C.A. “Dog owners can be the best advocates for the outdoors and the environment.”Now, Dr. Scarlett and other dog owners are determined to persuade the Park Service to change its position. Nearly 300 attended the first public meeting Wednesday at the Tamalpais High School gym in Mill Valley.An even-larger crowd is expected Saturday at the Seven Hills Conference Center at San Francisco State University beginning at 11 a.m.Please note: except for service animals, no dogs are allowed. No spitting either.'"
"'11-03-04,'0','Mr. Levinson disappeared after a meeting on Kish with an American fugitive known as Dawud Salahuddin who had fled to Iran in 1980 after assassinating a former aide to the Shah of Iran outside his home near Washington.Both United States officials and Mr. Levinson’s family have since said that the former agent went to Iran to investigate cigarette smuggling.Mr. Levinson, who is now 62, lives in Coral Springs, Fla., 20 miles north of Fort Lauderdale. He and his wife, Christine, have seven children, most of whom are grown.Before Mr. Levinson’s retirement from the F.B.I. in 1998, he specialized in Russian organized crime, money laundering and narcotics-related cases. Most of his work as a private investigator involved product counterfeiting, though he also worked for some public advocacy groups.It was an assignment for one such organization, Global Witness, a London-based group that investigates corporate and governmental corruption that took him to Dubai in March 2007. After spending several days there, he flew to Kish for his meeting with Mr. Salahuddin.In the years since his disappearance, sporadic reports about Mr. Levinson have emerged out of Iran, including indications that he was arrested by Iranian authorities.A senior administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity said that Iranian officials had indicated several months ago that they were willing to assist in the search for the Mr. Levinson. “We are now formally asking Iran to enable Mr. Levinson to reunite with his family,” the administration official said.According to a State Department cable obtained by WikiLeaks, an Iranian dissident told United States officials in 2009 that he saw Mr. Levinson’s name scratched into the door frame of a jail cell at a secret prison near Tehran operated by the Iran’s Revolutionary Guard.Last fall, during a trip to the United States, the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said that while his government had no information about Mr. Levinson, it was willing to help American authorities investigate his case.Mrs. Clinton said in her statement Thursday: “As the government of Iran has previously offered its assistance in this matter, we respectfully request the Iranian government to undertake humanitarian efforts to safely return and reunite Bob with his family.”A statement released Thursday on a Web site operated by Mr. Levinson’s family read: “Our family is tremendously encouraged by the news Bob is alive, but remains concerned for his safety and well being.”'"
"'11-03-04,'0','“History has taught us that it is nearly impossible to determine how much of the farmland boom may be an unsustainable bubble driven by financial markets,” said Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, in testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee last month.Officials at Mr. Hoenig’s bank warn that farmers face a “huge” risk that rising interest rates, perhaps combined with falling crop prices, could undercut land values. Farmland values could drop by a third to a half in such a situation, Mr. Hoeing testified.Prices have risen so far so fast that “it’s getting scary,” said Mike Green, a real estate auctioneer. He brought the hammer down last Friday on a 118-acre farm in Yetter, Iowa, that sold for $11,000 an acre, which he said was a record for farmland in Calhoun County, in western Iowa. In December, Mr. Green said, he got oohs and ahs when a parcel went for $9,300 an acre. Last fall, similar farms were selling for less than $8,000 an acre.“It’s very hard to guess what a property will sell for these days because it seems like it’s been changing on a weekly basis,” he said.Nationwide data from the shows that inflation-adjusted farm prices passed their 1970s peak several years ago, but that includes land, especially on the coasts, whose price rose when it was sold for development. University and Federal Reserve Bank surveys, which give a more accurate picture of the value of land used for farming, show that current prices are approaching the top of the last boom when adjusted for inflation.Farmland values have been pushed up by several factors. As crops like corn, wheat and soybeans bring higher prices, the land on which they are grown becomes more valuable. Low interest rates have also contributed; they draw investors seeking an alternative to low-yielding certificates of deposit and the volatile stock market as well as create an incentive for farmers to buy more land rather than invest their profits elsewhere.“Farmland has been a favored asset class in a world where a lot of other asset classes have fallen out of favor,” said , chief economist of the .The rapid rise in agricultural land prices has raised alarms at the F.D.I.C., which insures bank deposits and monitors the industry’s financial health. The agency sent a letter to lenders in December, warning them to not let high farm land values lull them into lax lending practices. Next week, the F.D.I.C. will hold a forum in Washington to discuss its concerns.“If it were to be a bubble,” Mr. Brown said, “it would be in its formative stages.”Today’s farmland market has some crucial differences from the 1970s bubble and the housing boom of the last decade. In the 1970s, another period of low interest and high crop prices, farmers loaded up on debt, using their farms as collateral. In the housing bubble, many buyers were seduced by gimmicky , such as subprime with floating rates, that magnified risk.Today, farmers have about one-third less debt over all than they did at the peak of the last boom, according to U.S.D.A. data.But a big worry for regulators is that farmers will start taking out loans on property they already own, based on today’s elevated values, and use it to buy more property or make other purchases. That would be similar to what farmers did 30 years ago and what homeowners did in the housing boom.Jason R. Henderson, a vice president at the branch of the Kansas City Fed, said he had heard reports from bankers that such a pattern might be emerging.Mr. Freking said he and his brother had made their latest purchase using all borrowed money. Their banker lent them half of the purchase price, and the rest of the money came from refinancing and consolidating loans on other property they owned, which are worth more at current land values.He said there was some sticker shock at the price but the deal made sense because the land adjoined two other properties that the family farmed. He also got an attractive fixed interest rate of about 5 percent, although the loan must be paid off after eight years.“Everybody’s talking big on commodities, so hopefully this pays out,” Mr. Freking said.The rising prices have also brought in speculators. A survey by found that investors made a quarter of farm purchases in the state last year, a slight increase from 2009. “It’s been very aggressive as far as bidding action,” said Todd Hattermann, an auctioneer who sold a farm in Paullina, Iowa, about 30 miles from Le Mars, for $9,600 an acre last week. Investors, he said, were “running the values up. A lot of them may not be the final bidder but they’re bidding all the way through.”There is no agreement on whether a bubble is emerging.Michael D. Duffy, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University who conducts the annual land value survey, said the market appeared fundamentally sound and that land prices were responding properly to high crop prices. “If you’ve got good ground, it’s worth a lot of money,” he said.Bruce Brock, the broker who sold the farm to the Freking brothers, exudes an optimism that would sound familiar to anyone who bought a home in 2006. “If you look from the beginning of farming in the to now, the long-term trend has been up,” he said. “There will be market fluctuations where it will go down. But in 10 years, I won’t be surprised if our $10,000 land is $20,000.”'"
"'11-03-04,'0','Mr. Risser rejected the notion that Senate Republicans had the right to send law enforcement authorities after him and his colleagues with a “contempt of the Senate” finding and criticized other measures, like daily fines of $100, expected to start Friday, that the Senate Republicans have placed on the Democrats.In Indiana, where Republican leaders find themselves in a similar standoff over legislation, they approved on Thursday a still higher fine, $250-a-day, against Democrats, also missing to block votes from occurring.All along, Governor Walker has said that the cuts to the bargaining rights and benefits of public workers are desperately needed to close the state’s budget gaps. Without the savings he had assumed would be made immediately with the bill’s passage through increases in pension and health care costs for workers, Mr. Walker said Thursday that he had no choice but to begin issuing layoff warnings to unions, to be followed in 15 days by layoff notices to the 1,500 state workers.It was not clear exactly who would be likely to receive such notices, but Cullen Werwie, a spokesman for the governor, said workers at mental health institutions and correctional facilities would be exempt.The actual layoffs would not take effect for about a month, officials said. Some Democrats discounted them as an empty, needless threat — one that could be just as quickly rescinded — to increase pressure on Democratic senators to return for a vote.Around the Capitol in Madison, the fight over collective bargaining and public workers has changed over several weeks, but has grown no less intense. What had once been a scene of large-scale protests from union supporters has given way to a simmering fury and a new set of restrictions in a building that had always stood open.To the dismay of protesters, law enforcement authorities limited who could go in and out of the Capitol on Thursday, as they have for several days.On Thursday evening, a county judge ordered the state to reopen the Capitol to everyone by next week, but also ordered protesters who had been sleeping inside it for days to leave; law enforcement authorities said the group left without incident.Officials from Mr. Walker’s administration have said limits were needed for safety and security after protesters began filling the building, and chanting, drumming and staying over.On Thursday, local police and government officials reported that live ammunition — so far unexplained — had been found outside on the grounds of the Capitol and inside a nearby city and county government building. Officials said damage inside the Capitol, in part from hundreds of anti-Walker signs now taped all over the marble, was expected to be in the millions of dollars.But others have vehemently objected to the limits. As cameras rolled, several Assembly Democrats moved their desks to the Capitol lawn for “office hours.”'"
"'11-03-04,'0','FRANKFURT — German prosecutors said Thursday that they were trying to determine whether Islamic radicalism motivated a young man to open fire on an American military bus a day earlier at the Frankfurt airport, killing two United States airmen and seriously wounding two others.One of the dead men as well as the two injured men were members of a security team en route from Britain to Afghanistan, the United States Air Force said in a statement. The other man killed was the driver of the bus, who was stationed at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, the Air Force said.The police did not name the suspect, identified as a 21-year-old Kosovar who lives in Frankfurt, but his brother identified him as Arid Uka. He worked at a mail sorting center at the airport, according to Deutsche Post, the German mail service.His father, Murat Uka, said Arid had finished high school but was unable to win admission to a university. “I don’t have any explanation for what has happened yesterday,” Mr. Uka said by telephone in Frankfurt. “ He is a calm and silent boy.”The police charged the suspect with murder and attempted murder. He was expected to appear in German federal court on Thursday.“The circumstances raise suspicion that the attack had an Islamic motivation,” the federal prosecutor’s office in Karlsruhe, Germany, said in a statement on Thursday.Boris Rhein, the interior minister for the state of Hesse where the airport is located, said there was no evidence the suspect was part of a larger group. However, he said there was evidence the man had deliberately targeted the American military personnel for ideological reasons.Germany has so far been spared a catastrophic terrorist attack of the kind experienced in the United States, Britain and Spain. But three of the Sept. 11, 2001, attackers lived in Germany, and security officials acknowledge that the country remains a breeding ground for Islamic radicals.Even as the inquiry into Mr. Uka’s motivations continued, some took the attack as confirmation of the threat of terrorist strikes by people who are not part of a group or have received formal training, but are inspired by radical ideologies, like those propagated by Al Qaeda.He was “a so-called home-grown terrorist,” Bernhard Witthaut, chairman of the Federal Police Trade Union, said Thursday in a statement. “We were always concerned that the indoctrination and recruitment strategies of the Islamists would one day have a deadly outcome.”Germany, Britain, and France have been on edge since last year over warnings of the possibility of pending attacks by radicalized European citizens who might have received training in the lawless border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan. In November, the German authorities beefed up security at train stations and airports after an informant said that a group linked to Al Qaeda was planning to shoot civilians in a public place.The Associated Press, quoting the suspect’s uncle in Kosovo, said he was born and raised in Germany after his parents moved there about 40 years ago. The German police, however, said he was born in Kosovo, The A.P. said. The uncle, Rexhep Uka, said that the family was Muslim. But he also said the family was pro-American for its leadership in the NATO bombing campaign against Serb forces in 1999.Mr. Uka’s brother, Hastrit Uka, 27, said the family was distraught. In an interview, he said he believed Arid had admitted the attack, and that, “For us, the situation is like a bad dream.”He said he had no idea how the younger man got a gun. Arid played combat video games, and occasionally went to a mosque, his brother said, but was not conspicuously devout and never criticized the United States or commented on politics.The suspect worked at a large building in the airport complex that Deutsche Post uses to sort incoming and outgoing international mail, said Dirk Klasen, a spokesman for the postal service. Mr. Klasen said there was no indication the suspect had been a problem employee. He was on a temporary contract due to expire in several weeks, Mr. Klasen said.The names of the dead were being withheld pending notification of the families. The injured were being treated at Frankfurt hospitals for wounds listed as critical in one case and serious in the other, the Air Force said.“Our hearts go out to the family and friends of those Airmen who were killed and wounded in yesterday’s attack,” Gen. Mark A. Welsh III, commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe, said in a statement. “Despite this terrible tragedy, we believe Germany is a safe place for our airmen and their families to live and work.”General Welsh said the United States military was working with German authorities on the investigation.'"

"'11-03-05,'0','Johnson & Johnson said Friday that the worldwide president of its DePuy Orthopaedics division, a maker of artificial hips and knees that has struggled with product recalls and lawsuits over faulty implants, is leaving the company. The executive, David Floyd, submitted his resignation last week and will leave at the end of March, a spokeswoman said. He had been president of the unit since 2007. He is leaving to pursue interests outside the company, the spokesman, Lorie Gawreluk, said, declining to be more specific. DePuy recalled the ASR XL Acetabular hip system last August, after researchers found 13 percent of patients needed a repeat operation to fix problems with the implant. The company took a $280 million charge in the fourth quarter to pay for the recall. The company faces more than 500 lawsuits by patients who had the hip implants.'"

"'11-03-05,'0','Gazing up at the stars, he muses, “Such harmony is in immortal souls,/But whilst this muddy vesture of decay/Doth grossly enclose it, we cannot hear it.” Disharmony is the condition of fallen humanity, and even the noblest and most loving hearts are deeply flawed.Mr. Abraham’s Shylock is probably the finest I’ve seen, although the British actor Henry Goodman was terrific in a National Theater production in London some years ago. It would be coy to avoid any comparisons with Al Pacino’s exciting, savage-spirited performance for the Public Theater production in Central Park and, later, Broadway. Both Mr. Abraham and Mr. Pacino are first-rate actors, I need hardly say, but Mr. Abraham is the more rigorous classicist, phrasing the language with an attentive care for rhythm and clarity.Mr. Pacino brought intense fire and a revelatory anger to Shylock’s most famous speech (“If you prick us, do we not bleed?”). Mr. Abraham delivers it with a complicated mixture of bitterness and implacable logic. As a man who must negotiate the decorous halls of the contemporary business world, Mr. Abraham’s Shylock keeps a tighter lid on his rage, and on his humiliation, too. In flashing asides we see how the treatment he has received has stoked a fierce hatred in his heart, but on the surface he struggles to maintain a steady cool, even when he is being taunted and beaten.Mr. Abraham’s Shylock is also piercingly moving when he gives way to a desperate grief at the loss of his daughter (and, yes, the ducats on which his pride as a successful businessman in an antipathetic world rests). Speaking to Tubal of the ring he cherished as a remembrance of his wife, he breaks down in tears, and Mr. Abraham makes us feel acutely how his suffering and his thirst for revenge are tragically, inextricably linked.As Portia, Ms. MacCluggage radiates a forthright intelligence inflected with both humor and, when she has declared her love for Bassanio (Lucas Hall), a glowing warmth. Mr. Hall’s Bassanio is touching in the sincerity and simplicity of his ardor, and in his deep filial feeling for Antonio, as well. (I think the impulsive kiss in the trial scene is a mistake, however; hints of homosexuality don’t violate the word of the text, but is such literalism necessary?)Mr. Nelis’s Antonio bears himself with an upright stoicism, and his affection for Bassanio is written in gentle but true colors. We see, too, the reflexive prejudice that has him unthinkingly take out his handkerchief to wipe his hand after shaking Shylock’s. And yet it is of course Antonio, rather more than the unflinching Portia (in disguise), who grants Shylock at least a little of the mercy she so eloquently invokes in the trial scene.The smaller roles are filled equally well: Ted Schneider is a frat-boyishly funny Gratiano, Christen Simon Marabate a poised Nerissa. Melissa Miller and Mr. Nappo are unusually vivid as Shylock’s daughter, Jessica, and her beloved Lorenzo, their uneasy relations clearly haunted by the shadow of the prevalent prejudice against Jews and by her guilt at having abandoned her father.Love in Shakespeare’s plays is rarely a simple matter, but it is almost always presented as an example of humanity’s noblest impulses, the best of what man can become. Blissful unions conclude most of the great comedies.“The Merchant of Venice,” which is technically classified as a comedy, is no exception. But in this troubling play the love matches bring grief in their wake, just as the pursuit of justice — ostensibly a righteous mission — also proves an act of inhuman cruelty. Without piling on the atmospheric gloom, as Daniel Sullivan’s Broadway production sometimes did, Mr. Tresnjak’s first-rate interpretation makes these complications get under your skin in a way they rarely do. You are left with the disheartening thought that it is possible to do right and wrong at the same time.By William Shakespeare; directed by Darko Tresnjak; sets by John Lee Beatty; costumes by Linda Cho; lighting by David Weiner; music and sound by Jane Shaw; hair and wig design by Charles LaPointe; video by Matthew Myhrum; executive producer, United States tour, Arktype/Thomas O.

"'11-03-05,'0','We will return to those questions shortly. In the diagramed deal, Gawrys (South) played carefully to land his three-no-trump contract.West’s two-diamond overcall was a Michaels Cue-Bid showing at least 5-5 in the majors.West led the spade three. Declarer, after winning with his jack, knew that he had to keep East off the lead. South played a diamond to dummy’s queen, then led a heart to his ten. (He was allowing for East’s having the heart jack.) West won with the jack and shifted to his club, but Gawrys took his ace and ran the heart queen. When that held, he claimed nine tricks: one spade, two hearts, five diamonds and one club.Plus 600 gained 5 international match points for the Poles, when their score was compared with the average of all eight results.The only lead to defeat three no-trump is the heart king. This leaves declarer with eight top tricks but no way to endplay West for a ninth. If, instead, West leads a low heart, South takes the trick, cashes his club ace, runs the diamonds and plays the ace and another heart to endplay West, forcing him to lead a spade around to declarer’s king.The top two pairs met in the first round, the Poles winning by 11 imps, which converted to 41 to 19 in victory points. But the opening lead problem set earlier gave the Italians a chance. From Q-J-9-5-4-2 of hearts, Lauria led the queen, which was a disaster. Dummy had 10-7-3, his partner A-8-6 and declarer the singleton king.When Versace opted not to play his ace, Gawrys took 11 top tricks and gained 3 imps.If Lauria had led a low heart, the Italians would have won the first six tricks for down two and 11 imps.Those 14 imps would have changed the match result from 41 to 19 to the Poles into 33 to 27 to the Italians, a difference of 28 victory points.Thursday’s column misstated the number of tricks by which two no-trump by West could have been defeated. It could have gone down one, not down two.'"
"'11-03-05,'0','“Ireland, Under New Management” (editorial, March 2) succinctly describes the current political and economic situation in Ireland. In the recent election, Irish citizens, responding to the “catastrophic mismanagement of their economy,” used their voting pencils as scalpels to remove those they held responsible from the political landscape.The strength and determination of this “pencil revolution” should not be underestimated by the European Union. The exorbitant interest rates imposed on Ireland as part of its bailout must be renegotiated by the new government as a matter of urgency.You rightly identify these bailout terms as “onerous,” and correctly note that “European leaders should respond wisely” to the message sent by Irish voters. Failure to do so would entail a dire misjudgment of economic reality and could be a significant step toward the fatal weakening of the euro.The writer is an Irish member of the European Parliament.'"
"'11-03-05,'0','Losing that would take “an enormous economic toll,” said Andrea Nativi, the editor in chief of Rivista Italiana Difesa, Italy’s leading defense publication.The ties go both ways. Libya, through the Libyan Investment Authority and the Libyan Central Bank, has a 7.6 percent stake in the Italian bank UniCredit, and the central bank’s governor, Farhat Bengdara, sits on UniCredit’s board.Libyan investors also have a 2 percent stake in the Italian aerospace and defense company Finmeccanica, a less than 2 percent stake in Fiat, a stake in an offshoot of Telecom Italia and 7.5 percent of the Turin soccer club Juventus.Libya’s Banca UBAE, which handles the country’s oil and gas transactions in Europe, has its headquarters in Rome.Those ties may help explain why Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been slow to condemn Colonel Qaddafi’s bloody crackdown. When the conflict started last month, Mr. Berlusconi said he did not want to “bother” the colonel. It was only after several days that he denounced the violence. By last weekend, he said Italy no longer considered Colonel Qaddafi in control of Libya.More significantly, last week Italy announced that it had effectively suspended its 2008 “Friendship Treaty” with Libya, which Mr. Berlusconi had touted as his greatest foreign policy achievement, since Libya was in chaos.“Italy is astonished because the accord was supposed to save it, but whom does it talk to now?” said Sergio Romano, a political columnist and former ambassador. “It cannot totally disavow Qaddafi, but it can’t sustain him because he’s become unpresentable.”In the accord, which was negotiated by several Italian governments and passed with wide bipartisan support, Italy pledged Libya $5 billion over 20 years to amend for its colonial past there. In exchange, Libya gave Italy favorable treatment in lucrative energy, infrastructure and defense contracts. It also pledged to stem the flow of illegal immigrants from its shores — a key domestic issue in Italy — using means questioned by human rights groups.But the treaty also had an unusual nonaggression clause, in which Italy pledged not to use its territory for hostile acts against Libya — a clause requested by Libya, said Senator Lamberto Dini, a former Italian prime minister who helped negotiate the treaty and is now the chairman of the Italian Senate’s Foreign Affairs Committee.Analysts interpreted the treaty’s suspension as a signal by Italy that it would make its bases available in the event of military intervention. There are several United States and NATO bases in Italy, and the United States Sixth Fleet is based near Naples. Rome has said it will approve a no-flight zone only with the backing of NATO and the United Nations.The countries’ uneasy embrace goes back a century, beginning with Italy’s colonial occupation of Libya in 1911 and continuing through the establishment of a monarchy in 1951 and Colonel Qaddafi’s anticolonial dictatorship in 1969.When Mr. Berlusconi briskly kissed the colonel’s hand on a visit to Libya last March, the Godfather moment revealed more than the personal bond between two of the world’s most colorful leaders. It reflected decades of close ties.In 1986, Prime Minister Bettino Craxi saved Colonel Qaddafi’s life by warning him that the United States was about to bomb Tripoli in retaliation for the German disco bombing, Mr. Craxi’s son, Bobo Craxi, said in an interview.Perhaps the leading player in Italy’s Libya policy is Eni, the Italian energy utility, which has been operating in Libya since 1959 and is widely perceived as the second pillar of Italian foreign policy after NATO, especially after Italy gave up nuclear power in the early 1980s.Over the years, Eni “never flaunted its power, but it exercised it,” said Mr. Romano, the former ambassador. Among diplomats, the company’s chief executive is widely considered to be at least as influential as any cabinet member.Libya is Eni’s largest source of oil and gas and is home to one-fifth of the company’s developed oil fields. After the 2008 accord, Eni pledged to invest $28 billion in Libya to extend its oil and gas contracts into 2040 and develop new fields. The company said last week that Libya owned less than 2 percent of the company.Since the unrest, Eni has roughly halved it operations in Libya. Last month it evacuated almost all of its personnel and shut down its Greenstream pipeline, which runs from Libya to Sicily and carries 10 percent of Italy’s natural gas supply.“Of the companies that are exposed in Libya, Eni on a volume basis has the most at risk,” said Claudia Pessagno, an equity analyst with IHS Herald, which monitors the petroleum market.While Mr. Berlusconi has condemned Colonel Qaddafi, he does not seem to have had a perceptible impact on his erstwhile friend.In the view of Mr. Dini, Mr. Berlusconi’s sway over Colonel Qaddafi is “not necessarily very much.” He said he hoped the bilateral treaty could be reactivated in “a new Libya,” one without Colonel Qaddafi.But with the Libyan leader showing no signs of leaving, it remains unclear who will come next. “Since no one knows whom to deal with, they’re measuring their words, and waiting,” Mr. Romano said. “What else can they do?”'"
"'11-03-05,'0','“I knew I wanted to be in something safe and secure,” he said. “A long career isn’t guaranteed. I wanted to have this money for life.”Instead of trying to manage his money on his own — or worse, turn to a friend or family member — he found someone independent who could advise him and steered away from the people who promised him sky-high returns or asked him to invest in their schemes.“I’d hear, ‘I’ve got a great idea for a bar or a car dealership,’ ” he said. “I knew they sounded too good to be true.”Today, he lives in a modest townhouse in Buffalo, but does not own a car. Instead, he drives a Nissan Armada, which he gets to use in exchange for signing autographs and doing promotions at a local car dealership.But many professional players “make a lot of money and save none of it,” said Ron Carson, the founder of the Carson Wealth Management Group, who advises Mr. Posluszny and several other football players. “The athletes we work with understand that things can change quickly. This is irreplaceable capital.”The players who are the most successful at managing what Dana Hammonds, director of player services and development at the N.F.L. Players Association, called “sudden money” assume the worst. They budget, save and invest carefully — and that is something they can teach the rest of us.WHOM TO TRUST? In his first few seasons as an offensive lineman with the Arizona Cardinals, Chris Dishman said he struggled with money. “The majority of players make a lot of mistakes in their first few years, and I was no different,” he said.Mr. Dishman played eight years in the N.F.L., making $750,000 a year by the time he retired in 2004. But his first financial adviser put him heavily into technology stocks in the late 1990s and he lost money when those stocks collapsed in 2000. His finances have recovered, he said, and his plan now is to use his N.F.L. savings as a nest egg while working as a corrections officer in Lincoln, Neb.As far as financial horror stories go, Mr. Dishman got off easy. In 2001, the N.F.L. Players Association created a program to evaluate financial advisers and help players get better advice. Ms. Hammonds said the 400 advisers and accountants now in the program needed to have clean regulatory records, a minimum of five years of experience and a degree from an accredited university.“The players wanted to have a secure place to obtain access to financial advice,” she said.Some teams realized the importance of this sooner than others. Joe Bailey, the managing partner of Heidrick & Struggles’s global sports leadership advisory group, worked in the N.F.L. for 29 years — 19 of those with the Dallas Cowboys in the 1970s and ’80s. “When I negotiated contracts with a player, I’d put in a clause where we’d pay for a financial adviser,” he said. “We gave them a list of 10 advisers that we had vetted. Candidly, it worked quite well for the players.”At the time, Mr. Bailey considered this a competitive advantage for the Cowboys. “We had a vested interest in our players’ success,” he said. “We knew what happened off the field affected what happened on the field.”But Ms. Hammonds said the most recent survey of the financial adviser program showed that only 50 percent of players were participating.SAFETY PLAYS N.F.L. players are often compared with lottery winners — coming into a vast sum of money all at once — but the ones with the best financial sense are more like small-business owners. Entrepreneurs who build a company over decades know that they probably cannot make that money all over again.That was how Adam Carriker, a defensive end for the Washington Redskins, said he felt in 2007 when he received a five-year, $14.5 million contract, $9.5 million of it guaranteed.“My biggest fear is that I lost a whole lot of money and couldn’t play and couldn’t make it back,” Mr. Carriker said. “Obviously, you want it to grow, but it’s better for it to grow at a slow amount. Defense wins championships.”He said from the start that he wanted that first contract to be managed so that he and his family would not have to worry, and his adviser agreed. “We don’t need to take a lot of unnecessary risk,” said Phil McBride, Mr. Carriker’s wealth adviser at the Carson Wealth Management Group. “We want to protect the downside.”KING OR PRINCE? Unlike many highly paid people, N.F.L. players cannot count on earning their high salaries for long. The average player is in the N.F.L. for about three years, though most players hope to last 10 years.“A lot of players think the money is going to come in forever,” Mr. Carriker said. “The best line I’ve heard is, ‘Don’t live like a king for a little bit; live like a prince forever.’ ”Matt Slauson, the starting left guard for the New York Jets last season, has already scaled back. He said he feared that next season could be canceled, depending on how and when negotiations between players and team owners are resolved, and that influenced his wedding plans.“I didn’t feel comfortable having this grand wedding, which would have been great,” he said. “I’m constantly working with my budgets. I know that this week could be my last week in the N.F.L., and then I won’t have any more checks coming in.”While he has a four-year, $1.8 million contract, he still has to make the team each season because his contract is not guaranteed. That is why he, his wife and their baby are living with his parents while he waits to see what will happen next year.It may seem absurd for a person who made $390,000 last year, as Mr. Slauson did, to move back home. But it reflects a sense that the good times may not go on forever. He said his primary financial goal was to be able to buy a house, and this would help him save for it.“Going from not having money to having money is easy,” said Steve Piascik, president of Piascik & Associates, an accounting firm and registered adviser with the N.F.L. Players Association. “Going from having money to not having money is devastating.”Mr. Piascik said he made sure that his clients asked for business plans from everyone who wanted them to invest money — even family members. “If you have no experience in a restaurant, it’s going to fail,” he said.'"
"'11-03-05,'0','Ralph D. Crosby Jr., chairman of the EADS unit, said the choice came down to the lowest price and not extra features, like the Airbus plane’s more advanced avionics and its ability to carry more cargo.“I’d just say personally that I hope 25 to 50 years from now, the crews that are either operating these planes or receiving gas from these aircraft are appreciative of that approach,” he said, and then added: “But those were the rules of the competition, and it’s time to put the best interest of the war fighters first. So we’re stepping aside.”Mr. Crosby said that after the Air Force had worked through a complex formula to compare the bids and calculate the present value of the eventual cost of the planes, Boeing’s cost came in at $20.6 billion compared with $22.6 billion for EADS.Analysts have said Boeing won partly because it offered a smaller plane that would be cheaper to operate over 40 years. But they were surprised it won by such a wide margin, and that suggests Boeing was more aggressive in cutting its price.Boeing’s supporters had feared that EADS, which is partly owned by European governments, would use subsidies to lower the price of the tankers, as a panel of the World Trade Organization found that it had done with its commercial jets. But some analysts said on Friday that EADS might not have bid lower out of concern that it would intensify the subsidy debate.Mr. Crosby said the Pentagon faced greater risks in choosing Boeing and that those risks call for “vigilant oversight.” He said that EADS had done more work on tankers for other nations and that was reflected in estimates that EADS would have spent $3.5 billion on the design and engineering work for the Air Force tankers compared to $4.4 billion for Boeing.The Air Force’s pursuit of new tankers has been the Pentagon’s most politically charged contracting effort for nearly a decade. The bidding was its third effort to start replacing hundreds of tankers dating from the Eisenhower and Kennedy years.The first effort ended in a scandal involving a leasing deal with Boeing. EADS, bidding with Northrop Grumman, won the contract in 2008, but government auditors blocked the award after Boeing protested that the evaluation had been too subjective.EADS executives say they spent more than $100 million to bid alone in the final round, a sign of how much the company wants to expand in the American market. The company builds aircraft for the Army and the Coast Guard and needs to offset sharp cuts in European military spending, and Pentagon officials were pleased that it did not protest the tanker award.Lawmakers from the Gulf Coast supported EADS, which would have built a plant in Mobile, Ala., creating thousands of jobs. EADS had also planned to eventually assemble commercial freighter planes at the plant, which would have been its first aircraft factory in the United States. By winning the tanker contract, Boeing was able to dodge that threat.Boeing will have to design and build 18 tankers for $3.5 billion by 2017. It could then negotiate more contracts, worth around $30 billion, for up to 161 planes.'"
"'11-03-05,'0','Stocks fell on Friday after another spike in oil prices overshadowed a report that the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in nearly two years.Crude oil rose 2.5 percent, to $104.42 a barrel, the highest level since September 2008, after fighting in Libya escalated. Markets have been rattled over the last two weeks as higher oil prices threaten to undermine the economic recovery by increasing transportation and production costs.Higher energy prices sent stocks lower despite news that the nation’s job market was improving. The Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate fell to 8.9 percent in February from 9 percent the previous month. The rate has dropped for three consecutive months and is at its lowest level since April 2009. Employers added 192,000 jobs in February, the fastest rate in almost a year.“They’re tugging at each other, employment and oil,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank. “Oil is high enough that it has to be a concern. The longer it remains at this level the greater the chance that it upends our recovery.”The Dow Jones industrial average fell 88.32 points, or 0.72 percent, to 12,169.88. The Dow had been down as many as 178 points earlier.'"
"'11-03-05,'0','The sentiment coursed through the protest, which rivaled some of the more modest days of the 18-day Egyptian uprising. In a celebratory atmosphere that was tinged with anger and resolve, the demonstrators seized the opportunity to demand that Mr. Sharaf undertake far deeper change than the largely cosmetic reforms Egypt’s military rulers have parceled out since taking power from President Hosni Mubarak on Feb. 11.“This shows you that the power of our ideas — the idea of democracy, of people claiming their own legitimacy, of our right to choose — have come to reality,” said Mohammed Ali, a 42-year-old film director. “Freedom can do the impossible.”Protesters had described Friday’s gathering as a “day of determination,” pressing their call for the resignation of Mr. Sharaf’s predecessor, Ahmed Shafiq, whom Mr. Mubarak had appointed to lead the cabinet before resigning. But the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, with timing that appeared aimed at heading off bigger crowds, announced Mr. Shafiq’s resignation on Thursday with three terse lines on its Facebook page.A former transportation minister, Mr. Sharaf served in government only briefly, until December 2005, then became one of the higher-profile politicians to occasionally join the demonstrations in Tahrir Square, endearing him to many there.On Friday, protesters suggested that he had been their candidate to replace Mr. Shafiq, a former air force general like Mr. Mubarak, who came across as haughty at best, inept at worst.His challenges, though, remain vast, not least in choosing new figures as foreign, interior and justice ministers. Other demands — from dismantling the more odious police forces to freeing thousands of political prisoners — may be beyond his purview in a landscape where the military, in almost uncontested fashion, makes the decisions.“In a transition period, you could have a change of cabinet every few weeks,” said Samer Soliman, a political science professor at the American University in Cairo. “It’s a time of political instability.”“They,” he added, referring to the military’s Supreme Council, “are probably just trying the guy out to see if he works with the population.”Even Mr. Sharaf seemed to plead with the protesters to have patience. “I beg you, you did something great and together we will do more,” he said, as the crowd chanted “We are with you.” He added, “I have a heavy task and it will need patience.”Mr. Sharaf entered the square a little before Friday Prayer services, drawing cries from the crowd and a few surprises, as he headed toward the Mugamma, a sprawling bureaucratic fortress redolent of Soviet-era design. “The prime minister has come!” one man shouted excitedly. To which another responded, “What’s his name again?”If Mr. Sharaf meant to strike a different note on Friday, he did. He traveled with a few members of the military police in red berets and a few more men in dark sunglasses, their numbers paling before the phalanxes of security guards that usually accompany Egyptian officials.In his remarks, there was none of the stentorian paternalism of Mr. Mubarak, who addressed Egyptians as his sons and daughters in his last speech. “If you would permit me,” Mr. Sharaf repeatedly asked the crowd. Dispensing with customary formal Arabic, he spoke in Egyptian slang, standing before them in a gray jacket and white shirt, with no tie.In a way, the speech was a striking legacy of the uprising: the reimagining of power that once sought prestige though its very distance from those without it.“Sharaf is the first official that everyone wants,” said Mohamed Mostafa, a young member of the Muslim Brotherhood from the Nile Delta. “He promises to implement all our demands, and we trust him because he was protesting in Tahrir with us.”The utopian sense of Tahrir Square has long faded. Only a few people picked up trash on Friday and gone were the pharmacies, health clinics and the uprising’s equivalent of soup kitchens that cared for the tens of thousands who camped out here for days. Yet while some thought Mr. Mubarak’s resignation might dissipate the protests, Friday’s turnout represented a clear signal that the demonstrations had the vitality to continue.In fact, Mr. Shafiq’s resignation was unlikely without the continuing protests.“From here until the elections for a new parliament, the only way to voice our demands is protests,” said Ashraf Ismail, a 29-year-old engineer. “They have to go on.”A banner put it differently: “We want the overthrow of the rest of the regime.”The demands articulated Friday remain formidable — from forcing out the most loathed ministers to dismantling the nefarious State Security service. Others called for a trial of government figures, from Mr. Mubarak down, and the lifting of the Emergency Law, which has granted the government extensive powers to arrest and detain people for decades.Mr. Ali, the film director, acknowledged the difficulty in realizing those demands. But, he added, “this is the accomplishment of the revolution. There’s a tomorrow.”'"

"'11-03-06,'0','Now, as the generals steer Egypt toward a new civilian government after the fall of President Hosni Mubarak, those questions about the aid program echo a broader uneasiness, especially in the pro-democracy movement: will a military so deeply invested in a system that conferred great economic and political power be willing to let go?“It will be a very sore point in the near future, I’m sure, that the generals, the Supreme military council, is a de facto, separate government with an economy in its own right,” said Christopher Davidson, an expert on Egypt and a professor at Durham University in England.Some experts and former American military officials say the aid from Washington — roughly $40 billion since the program’s inception as part of the 1979 Camp David peace accord signed by Israel and Egypt — has served to shore up a military bureaucracy prone to insider dealing and corruption.Robert Springborg, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School who studies Egypt’s military, said that by paying for expensive weapons systems, the aid program “has enabled the Egyptian military then to use resources it has for other purposes.”In part because of concerns about diversion of funds, only a sliver of the money from the American aid program actually goes to the Egyptian military. Instead, the Pentagon directly pays American companies that it has chosen to manufacture and ship the tanks, planes, guns and ammunition to Egypt.Egyptian opposition groups have said that Mr. Mubarak and senior generals were nonetheless able to divert money. But American officials insist that the design of the program — known as Foreign Military Sales — ensures that money cannot be stolen.Edward W. Ross, a former official at the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees the sales, said he was irked by allegations that Egyptians could have pocketed money. “That money goes to the Federal Reserve,” he said, “and then it is only released to a U.S. contractor.”Even so, the United States has considerably less control over how goods are used once they arrive in Egypt. In interviews, several former American military officials said that keeping the aid flowing often seemed to trump questions of how effective it was. Some of them asked to remain anonymous because they did not want to alienate the Egyptian military. The yearly $1.3 billion, one retired colonel explained, is viewed as “an entitlement.”At times, American officials have argued with Egyptian generals over whether certain equipment was actually for military use. That was the case with the Gulfstream jets.The retired colonel, who worked at the American Embassy’s Office of Military Cooperation in Cairo, said that the Egyptians assured him the planes would be used for “mapping,” but that he was skeptical. “It was obvious to us that these were going to be used at least in part for V.I.P. travel,” the colonel said.Officers tried to block the deal, he recalled, but “our contacts at the Ministry of Defense were applying pressure” to make sure the sale went through.A former high-ranking Pentagon official said he also protested. “I remember that it was made very clear to the Egyptians that ‘You use this for military purposes and not for a luxury airline for V.I.P.’s,’ ” he said.But the Egyptian military did indeed use the Gulfstreams for the V.I.P.’s, and the luxury jets became a popular symbol of the Mubarak government’s excess.Egyptian military officials declined to comment for this article.Over the years, the Gulfstream fleet — which now totals nine jets — has cost American taxpayers $333 million, government officials said. The most recent purchase was in 2002, but the Pentagon continues to pay $10 million a year to service the planes.The Pentagon referred questions about military aid for Egypt to the State Department, which has formal jurisdiction. In an e-mail response to questions, a State Department spokesman said the aid “assists Egypt in maintaining a strong and disciplined defense force, which is imperative at this time, and critical to ensuring Egypt’s continued role as a regional leader able to act as a moderating influence.”Few Americans worked more closely with Egypt’s military than Maj. Gen. Michael A. Collings, a retired Air Force officer who was the top-ranking United States military representative in Egypt from 2006 to 2008. He served as the American Embassy’s senior defense representative and chief of the Office of Military Cooperation.General Collings said the Americans were not able to track the for-profit arm of the Egyptian military — a conglomerate that runs factories, farms and high-tech corporations. “How much goes back from the actual sale to the military so they can buy other equipment? I don’t know,” he said. “I do know that a fair amount goes back to the senior officers that are in charge of these particular factories.”While insisting that there was “no way, shape or form” that American aid money had been stolen, General Collings said he was disturbed by what he described as endemic corruption in the upper ranks of the Egyptian military. “My concern is for the Egyptian people who have suffered enough,” he said. “They deserve better.”While he was posted in Egypt, he said, senior Egyptian military officials told him of a corruption scheme in which Mr. Mubarak handed out cash to the generals leading each branch of the armed forces — army, navy, air force and air defense force. “There was a systematic process by which money was given and distributed through the top ranks of the regime,” General Collings said.A former high-ranking Egyptian officer confirmed General Collings’s account. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns for his safety.The two former American military officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they had not heard those allegations.On top of the $1.3 billion in annual military aid, the Egyptian armed forces collect millions more from a joint military exercise, called Bright Stars, held in Egypt every two years. General Collings said the United States paid dearly to local companies chosen by the Egyptian military to provide equipment.In what he called an unusual arrangement, every item is rented. “Fifty cents a chair” per day, he recalled. “A buck fifty for a table. It varied.”The retired colonel who served in Egypt recalled similar concerns. “We felt some of the charges were very high,” he said.Even with the built-in safeguards, some of the Egyptian military’s for-profit ventures have created quandaries for administrators of the Foreign Military Sales program, according to experts. In some cases, military products and for-profit goods sold to civilians are manufactured inside a single armed forces-owned complex.The Egyptian military has a joint venture with Chrysler to make Jeeps, which are common on Egypt’s desert roads and in the army. The joint venture manufactures the civilian Jeep Wrangler, for sale in Egyptian car dealerships and across the Middle East, as well as a Jeep Wrangler used by the Egyptian Army.Last year, the American military awarded two Foreign Military Sales contracts to Chrysler in Detroit. One, for $26 million, was for 750 unassembled Jeeps. The other, announced in November, was for $7 million to ship tools and spare parts for Jeep Wranglers to the Egyptian Ministry of Defense.Mr. Springborg, the expert on the Egyptian military, said he was skeptical that, in cases like this, the Egyptians could maintain a firewall between production of civilian and military items.“Who is drawing these lines?” he said, emphasizing that he was expressing his personal views, not those of the American government. “That is the great difficulty of drawing a line in a military that has emphasized so much of its economic function.”The company that manufactures Jeeps in Egypt is a joint venture between Chrysler and a subsidiary of the Egyptian military. A Chrysler spokesman denied that there was any diversion and said the model of Jeep used by the Egyptian Army was different from the commercial vehicle.“All components imported for assembly of military vehicles are strictly for use in the military vehicles and under no circumstances are they used for nonmilitary assembly,” he said in an e-mail. He said no American military funds “are used to support the production of the civilian/retail sales.”Another area to look at, Mr. Springborg said, is the production of the well-known M1A1 Abrams tank, which the Egyptian military builds under license with American-made parts. The Pentagon pays General Dynamics to ship tank kits to Egypt, where military workers assemble them.Former American officers consider the tank manufacturing plant a giant jobs program. “It’s as much about providing jobs as it is buying military hardware,” General Collings said.In 2007, the Defense Department announced the sale of 125 more unassembled tanks to Egypt, at an estimated cost of $890 million. So far, Egypt has more than 800 of the tanks.“There are two assembly lines where they make that tank,” a former senior American military official said. “They are all in the same huge building.”Next to the tank production line that receives the American aid, he said, workers are assembling an Egyptian construction vehicle for commercial sale. He said American auditors visited the plant often to ensure that aid was not diverted from the tank-production side of the building.As for the International Medical Center, repeated telephone calls to the public relations department failed to win permission for a visit, and two reporters who showed up at the front gate were turned away for lack of a permit from military security.From that distance, the six-story hospital, on a desert road about 45 minutes east of Cairo, appears to be an oasis in a mostly barren landscape. Three wings jut out from the main building, all with white walls and green glass. The glass, including large bubbles framing the end of each wing, shimmers in the bright winter sunshine as window washers — a novelty in Egypt — inch down the walls.Towering palms line the entrance drive, while inside, sprinklers shoot water across carefully trimmed trees, lawns and flower beds. Security cameras survey the outside walls.According to the State Department, the Egyptian government built the medical center with its own funds, while the American military aid program contributed $162.8 million for equipment, operations and maintenance.The former American military officials involved in Egypt said they believed that the financing was cut off five years ago.But the spigot, it turns out, has not been turned all the way off. Last summer, the Pentagon gave a sole-source, $4.6 million contract to a Florida company called TeKontrol to train hospital staff members for 13 months. Halting the financing, a contract document explained, “could potentially impact the desires of the Egyptian Ministry of Defense” to win international accreditation for the hospital.'"
"'11-03-06,'0','But it’s not only the high-profile companies that are in the news. David Hyman, who founded the subscription music and blog advertising sales network MOG in Berkeley in 2005, released MOG’s mobile app last summer. The company announced recently that Verizon would be pre-installing MOG on all 4G Android phones.The surfeit of companies makes it hard to generalize about the industry’s direction. Some are consumer-focused, like the subscription-based services Rhapsody, MOG and Rdio. Others, like the social media start-ups Bandcamp, Topspin and RootMusic, are intended to help musicians market themselves.Other kinds of companies include the file-sharing service SoundCloud, a European company that recently opened an office in San Francisco, and Ioda, also in San Francisco, a distributor of independent digital music and video.Digital-music entrepreneurship is not a new phenomenon locally. Mr. Hyman, for instance, founded his first company, Addicted to Noise, in San Francisco in the dot-com-boom days of 1994. He remembers occupying an area known as Audio Alley in the Mission district, spilling into South of Market. Mr. Hyman estimated that 20 to 30 music companies sprang up in the neighborhood at that time. Most have since folded, but they provided the foundation for today’s strong scene.The challenges are different now than when the first wave of digital-music companies opened up shop. It took a while for people to get used to uploading, creating and listening to music online, and intellectual-property issues were murky. And now, Mr. Hyman noted, smart money is betting on the cloud. Music collections on home computers are being rendered obsolete in favor of services that stream sound into people’s homes, mobile devices and cars.“The hard drive was an anomaly,” Mr. Hyman said. “It will be seen as a weird, short-lived period.”Subscription-based solutions are especially hot. A popular service in Europe, Spotify, seems poised to arrive in the United States this year, and Rdio opened its doors here last August. Created by the founders of Skype, Rdio charges roughly the same as MOG ($5 a month for streaming music on a computer, $10 with added mobile service) but has enhanced social network features, so customers can track friends’ musical tastes.According to Malthe Sigurdsson, vice president for product design at Rdio, the challenge is no longer to find music online but to sort it. “We have all the music in the world, and there’s a wide-open, blank search field,” he said.Music technology may be growing up, but it’s still a chaotic time for business owners and consumers.“The industry still has a lot of evolving to do,” said Tim Westergren, founder of Pandora.Even those with a vested interest in keeping up can become overwhelmed. “Honestly, there seem to be too many of these ventures,” said Lynne Angel, who plays in a band called Tartufi, writes online record reviews and books live music for a Mission bar.Ms. Angel said she found herself pining for an unlikely source of nostalgia. “MySpace has one of the perfect band profile setups,” she said, “but it’s so irrelevant now.”'"
"'11-03-06,'0','All very interesting, and you didn’t read it in The Times.When it comes to news about other media organizations, The Times is not so reticent. In fact, The Times is a great read for people like me who are interested in the latest developments in other media, including newspapers, broadcast and cable, the Internet and all the rest.Focusing on newspaper companies, to illustrate my point, The Times has published multiple stories in the past year on the introduction of an Internet paywall by Rupert Murdoch’s Times of London. It also covered in-depth the seamy controversy engulfing another Murdoch property in Britain, News of the World, as it contended with charges of unlawfully hacking into celebrities’ cellphone messages.On this side of the Atlantic, The Times gave ink to Mr. Murdoch’s big U.S. newspaper holding, The , as it started a Greater New York section to compete with The Times. And, yes, beyond Rupert’s world, The Times energetically covered problems at the ’s Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times — among other pieces on newspapers here and abroad.Of The Times’s own pay model for its Web site, though, all that has trickled into print is an initial story 14 months ago announcing that the plan would be carried out in a year, plus occasional subsequent references to the looming event. No significant story has been published — at least not as of my Friday evening deadline for this column.Yet the introduction of the pay model is major news for The Times, for the rest of the newspaper industry, and for Times customers and readers, some of whom have asked me why there hasn’t been coverage. Hence I think there’s a journalistic imperative for The Times to cover it energetically.John Morton, a veteran newspaper analyst, said: “People call me and ask me what I think about The Times’s new plan. I say, ‘Do you know what it is?’ ”The stakes for The Times, which like other newspaper companies has seen major declines in print advertising revenues, are enormous. I asked Mr. Morton to rate, on a scale of 1 to 10, the strategic importance of the pending pay model to the future of the organization.“For the future of The Times,” he replied, “I would say it is somewhere around 10, if not higher.”With so much riding on this, readers and others might be forgiven for wondering why The Times hasn’t covered the subject with its usual aggressiveness. I asked Bruce Headlam, The Times’s media editor, and here is his response:“We haven’t been writing much about the proposed Times paywall because, frankly, there hasn’t been much to report. We still don’t know exactly when the paywall is going up, how much it will cost readers or how many free hits readers will get before hitting the wall. Those are the critical questions we want answered — and believe me, we have asked.”He added that The Times has been working on “more than one story about the paper’s plans” but felt that “because of the high bar for stories about The Times, we needed to break some news in order to justify putting any story in the paper.” He also noted the risk of appearing “self-promotional” in publishing a story.From my own experience as an editor and publisher, it is awkward and difficult to cover your own news organization. That’s because the goals of a journalist covering the story and the goals of the company — the reporter’s employer — may be seriously in conflict. To permit honest, independent coverage, the company must refrain from exerting its business interest. Even when it does refrain, there’s no way to ensure that a skeptical audience will believe it has done so. So the risk of looking “self-promotional” is real.All that said, senior journalists and educators I talked to about this believe, as I do, that The Times has no choice but to cover itself on high-profile issues like this.“I think good newspapers such as The Times should cover themselves,” said Michael Waller, formerly top editor at The Hartford Courant and The Kansas City Star, where I worked under him, as well as publisher of The Courant and The Baltimore Sun. “The Times coverage could be part of a full-time media beat. In the Times case, it may even be worth a full-time beat.”Kelly McBride, senior faculty member for ethics at the Poynter Institute, noted that in the past The Times has done a good job covering itself in times of great journalistic stress, citing the scandal surrounding the reporter Jayson Blair in 2003. In this case, though, there’s no newsroom scandal, just a sensitive business strategy story. Ms. McBride suggests at least two ways The Times could have ensured strong coverage of the pay model.One, the company could have hired an outsider to cover the story on a contract, to be edited by someone outside the primary editing system. That’s an approach that resembles the system for the public editor, whose job is to report on The Times’s journalism, not its business development.Another approach, she suggested, would be to “overcommunicate your goals for the coverage. You tell everybody in the company, ‘We want you to cover us as if you didn’t work for us,’ and you tell your audience that, too, and hope your words will become reality.”Of these approaches, this last one seems most workable to me. In a way that’s visible internally and externally, The Times should commit the media team to covering The Times itself more aggressively. This would yield stories that readers want to read and blunt criticism that, when it comes to covering itself, The Times has a blind spot.'"

"'11-03-06,'0','Re “Why We Write About Grief” (Week in Review, Feb. 27):Meghan O’Rourke and Joyce Carol Oates highlight that grief is fraught with inherent paradoxes and dualities: a longing for a sense of coherence, meaning and order, when everything feels incomprehensible, unjust and meaningless; the feeling that one’s grief is deeply private and unspeakable, while outsiders are watching and observing as the mourner grieves; grappling with how to live fully within this world, while simultaneously living a secret and parallel internal life with the deceased; the knowledge that time keeps passing, with a simultaneous feeling that time remains frozen.And oftentimes, there are disappointed hopes and profound feelings of rage and hurt that coexist with feelings of love and tenderness. The mourner’s creation of a narrative of loss, and the listener’s receiving of that narrative without judgment or expectation, holds a place for the complexities and paradoxes of grief.It is also in the telling of the story of loss by the mourner, and the embracing of that story by the one who listens, that the deceased continues to exist in the memory, heart and mind of the mourner, and also comes to be known and endure in the minds of all who come to embrace the mourner’s narrative.The writer is a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst.'"
"'11-03-06,'0','But the article raises a serious issue: whether drilling has caused unhealthy levels of radium in our drinking water. Good reasons exist to believe the answer is no, but belief is not good enough.Pennsylvania should order all its public water systems to immediately test for radioactive pollutants. Only testing of our drinking water can resolve this question and give citizens peace of mind.The writers are, respectively, former governor of Pennsylvania and former secretary of the state’s Department of Environmental Protection.I live in Baltimore and I mostly drink tap water, because I perhaps naïvely believe that it’s safe. But your article on hydrofracking has shaken that faith.How much radium, benzene and other toxic residue wash down the Susquehanna and into my glass of water every day?I implore President Obama and the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa Jackson, to put a halt to hydrofracking until its true effects are well understood and until the industry has proved that it can drill in a way that is safe for the environment and for public health.The writer is a policy advocate for Environment Maryland.Your article criticizes Pennsylvania’s natural gas regulations, suggesting that they allow “drillers to discharge much of their waste through sewage treatment plants into rivers.”Pennsylvania’s primary disposal of wastewater is no disposal at all; the state leads the nation in recycling drilling wastewater, further reducing the environmental impact of natural gas exploration.Marcellus Shale producers reuse an average of 90 percent of this water. Many recycle 100 percent — industry’s goal.States like Pennsylvania have highly sophisticated regulations, which are getting even more protective. John H. Quigley, former secretary of Pennsylvania’s Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, has said that the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, under its former secretary, John Hanger, has “positioned Pennsylvania as the strongest state regulator of the natural gas industry.”While some of your points on water monitoring are valid and must be addressed, your claim that Pennsylvania’s regulations are “lax” is simply untrue.The writer is president and executive director of Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry trade group.Your article represents a pivotal point in the national debate about hydrofracking, a drilling method for natural gas.The gas industry has consistently tried to marginalize critics, labeling them alarmists who are citing isolated incidents. Now that an Environmental Protection Agency memo reveals that Pittsburgh residents suffered “one of the largest failures in U.S. history to supply clean drinking water” due in part to fracking wastes, industry efforts to minimize the problem are tainted beyond credibility.You can’t fix fracking by denial and trucking bottled water to victims’ homes. Industry needs to wake up to a new reality — until you can prove it can be done right, you can’t do it at all.That goes for government, too. Those in positions of power today must put clean water above defending a dirty industry.The writers are executive directors of Hudson Riverkeeper and Catskill Mountainkeeper, respectively.'"
"'11-03-06,'0','The AbleGamers Foundation estimates that about 33 million Americans with disabilities are video game players. Smith’s concern involves only sports-theme games.“There is a demographic here that hasn’t been reached,” he said.He did not intend to become another advocate. Smith was so thrilled by MLB The Show a couple of years ago that he sent a thank-you letter to the design team for giving him the chance to play baseball.“For me, that was as real as it was ever going to get,” Smith said.The design team at Sony Computer Entertainment America was moved.“This all started not because of the letter, but because of what people did about that letter,” Smith said. “If they had chosen to ignore this letter, none of this would have ever happened.”The design team invited Smith to its studio in San Diego, where he spent two days in late 2009. Smith sat in on meetings, and he was asked for suggestions to make the game better. He became sort of a consultant to the 70-member design team.“We really liked the guy,” Launchbaugh said. “Really cool kid. Really smart. He fit right in with our team. We had a great time, and it kind of became a friendship.”Eventually, it led to the A.D.V.A. mode. Launchbaugh said MLB The Show has about 70 settings that can be tailored to individuals. The A.D.V.A. default settings, set to Smith’s recommendations, can be altered.“Last year, you could have gone through all of the settings to what A.D.V.A. means today, but it would have taken you about 20 minutes,” Launchbaugh said. “And you would have had to know exactly what you were changing and what it meant. This is just a really nice way to have members of his organization say, ‘O.K., I can just start with this setting, and it’s going to be compatible with me.’ ”For Smith, a big issue was when he played the game online against other gamers. Until now, online competitors had to be on the same settings, “so the first inning they’d always be up, 6-nothing,” Smith said.The new edition allows gamers with different settings to compete. The other player simply must accept the challenge.Smith controls his wheelchair with a joystick, but the PlayStation controller has 12 buttons and 2 joysticks, demanding an array of quick-fingered combinations. During an at-bat, for example, base runners are usually controlled by several buttons while the player anticipates the pitch.“This is difficult because you need, like, four fingers to achieve this,” Launchbaugh said. “So what we’ve done is, while you’re batting, base running is automatic. Once the ball is in play, you can control your runners.”Fielding a ball usually means moving the defender into position with one joystick, then using buttons to throw. In A.D.V.A. mode, fielding the ball is automatic, but deciding where and when to throw is up to the player.“It’s not dumbing it down,” Smith said. “It’s trying to take the physical factor and remove it, so that the game becomes more of a mental competition.”Smith plans to go live with a Web site, advasports.org, on Tuesday to coincide with the release of MLB 11 The Show. He does not know where all this will lead. But in a video game world where reality is increasingly treasured, and where more game systems use motion sensors to enable players to control the action, Smith wants to help ensure that millions are not left in technology’s wake.“That kind of freaked me out — what if it got to a point where everything is motion?” Smith said. “I understand that it’s a marketing thing, and I understand that they’re trying to get people up to move. They’re trying to make video games look like a very good exercise option.“But for people like us, it’s, ‘Oh, no, what are we going to do?’ There are these people out here who can’t do the motion; they can’t be the controller. So depending on how well the A.D.V.A. does, I hope in the long run, there will be more systems and more games that do this.”'"
"'11-03-06,'0','Yes, they root for their homeland, India for most of them but not their leading bowler, Adrian Gordon. He is from Antigua and plays for the United States, which is not among the 14 nations participating in this World Cup.In four years, when the World Cup rolls around again, this time in Australia and New Zealand, only 10 nations will be included — perhaps all 10 test-playing nations or maybe a qualifier or two from the so-called associates, the secondary level of less powerful cricket nations. This highly exclusionary policy flies in the face of the soccer World Cup, which includes 32 teams and allows underdogs like Trinidad and Tobago, Slovenia or, dare we say it, Australia and New Zealand to have their moments.Just before this World Cup opened, Australia’s captain, Ricky Ponting, 36, saw fit to proclaim that only test-playing nations should be eligible for the World Cup.“I’m not sure how much a lot of the teams actually learn when they’re getting hammered like they tend to do in a lot of those contests,” Ponting said.True, some associates get hammered, act like tourists. The N.Y.U. Poly students laughed at the memory of the Bermuda player who asked the great batsman Sachin Tendulkar for his autograph in the 2007 World Cup. Now Ponting would open the World Cup only for nations that traditionally compete in lengthy test series.“He’s deadening my dream,” said Gordon, 23, a powerful man who has bowled against current World Cup players from Ireland and Canada, and knows the United States is not going to get one of the two spots for associates in the 2015 dog-in-the-manger World Cup four years hence.As they watch this World Cup, the N.Y.U. Poly cricketers identify with Ireland because they feel like outsiders themselves: college men who gave up the dream of professional glory.“We have a billion people, and every one of them plays cricket,” said Rishabh Natarajan, 25, from Mumbai. “After a while, your parents tell you, ‘Maybe you should concentrate on education.’ ”To their delight, there was a way to combine their families’ mandate of a scholastic career and their love of competitive cricket.

Starting in April, the Baseball Hall of Fame will conduct cricket exhibitions and exhibits of the common roots of the two sports. American College Cricket gave its John Bart King Award for the best American-born player to a former football player, Ian Carlin of The College of Wooster in Ohio — a Pittsburgh Steelers fan, no less.On Friday, Jodah, Gordon, Natarajan and six Indian teammates — Parth Shah and Dhaval Dharaiya from Ahmedabad, Raugarajan Sricharan of Chennai, Adviteeya Udaya Kumar of Bangalore, and Bhavesh Joshi and Sharmin Karbhari of Mumbai — gathered in the Australian Pub on West 38th Street. Another teammate, Azrab Cheema, a Pakistani-American, could not make it.A replay of the tie between England and India on Feb. 27 was playing on two large screens, with Tendulkar conducting another seminar on hand-to-eye coordination and infinite patience. Any sports fan could appreciate it as he flicked the ball where it needed to go, for 120 runs that day.Shah produced a red cricket ball with raised seams — hard enough to do damage to fielders who are not permitted to wear gloves. Gordon and his mates demonstrated the proper bowling grips for fastballs and spin balls. They agreed on the best defensive play they had ever seen: a full-speed, full-extension one-handed snag by Manish Pandey, in his white outfit and wide-brimmed black hat. Now known as the catch of the century, it took place in a trophy match in January 2010 and has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on YouTube.“Catches win matches,” Sricharan said as the others nodded.In midafternoon, the N.Y.U. Poly players took off for a few hours of study or papers or classes — the reason they are here. The next World Cup matches would be coming up overnight. You never know what can happen, particularly when they let in the riffraff, the outsiders, the associates. Ireland beat England. Did anybody mention that?'"
"'11-03-06,'0','The practical knowledge he has gleaned from coaxing potential drug ingredients out of ginger and other plants comes in handy here. “It helps me think about how to extract flavors from herbs,” Mr. Ramos says.But it is not his experience in chemical extraction alone that has helped turn the pair’s hobby into a soda start-up. Ms. Mak’s artistic inclination to make something entirely new has helped them find a niche in a haute beverage market populated by locally roasted coffees, spiced hot chocolates, craft beers and infused vodkas. Their entry is a nonalcoholic, noncaffeinated adult drink that is not so much a soda as a limited-edition carbonated juice.Ms. Mak takes the ginger cardamom flavor base off the stove, mixes it with apple juice and pours the liquid into a siphon canister for carbonation. Whereas mass-produced fruit sodas that sell in supermarkets are typically made from fizzy water and juice concentrates, she says, their handmade sodas use only fresh ingredients.“We thought there was a bit of a gap, especially in the area of nonalcoholic beverage options made from fresh fruit,” she says.The soda venture may have started as a whim: they wanted to see whether they could make their own ginger beer at home so they could serve Dark and Stormy cocktails at a party. But once they saw a potential commercial opportunity, they proceeded scientifically, using each phase of their business — from seeking initial capital to supplying restaurants — to test and refine their niche-market theory.First, they tried their soda flavors, like pure ginger and lemon, on their friends.“Our friends liked it, but we wondered if others would like it,” Mr. Ramos says. “We thought, how can we test it?”They applied for a table at the Brooklyn flea market. Then they sought seed capital of about $2,000 through kickstarter.com, a site that helps finance creative start-up businesses. “We achieved it in four days, which was stunning,” Ms. Mak says.With the money, the pair bought equipment like soda kegs. They consulted artisanal beer makers about carbonation techniques. They worked with a program at the Cornell University College of Agriculture to vet their soda recipes.On their first day at the flea market last April, they sold out by 3 p.m., Ms. Mak says. Soon after came an episode that is the foodie equivalent of a starlet being discovered at the lunch counter in Schwab’s drugstore: the chef at Blue Hill, who lives in the neighborhood, happened by the flea market and tasted the sodas. Blue Hill soon became a wholesale client.For Ms. Mak and Mr. Ramos, a second career in carbonation was born.Brooklyn Soda Works has arrived at a time when “made in Brooklyn” foods, from borough-roasted Gorilla Coffee to homemade pies from Four & Twenty Blackbirds, are having a cultural moment. In fact, two local craft beer destinations, Beer Table in Park Slope and 61 Local in Cobble Hill, have each repurposed a beer line to put Brooklyn soda on tap.But the special selling point of the sodas — fresh ingredients — is also their limitation. The sodas have the shelf life of milk, about two weeks, Ms. Mak says. And the couple have made a deliberate decision to stay with fresh ingredients, keeping the brand limited and fairly local. That means they make frequent deliveries to their bar and restaurant clients. They have no plans, as yet, to sell to chain stores, but they might consider supplying a local artisanal food store.Even so, the company made money last year, the couple says. But so far, their sodanomics are not enough to retire on.Their sodas typically sell at the wholesale level for $80 a five-gallon keg. The pair can make more than twice as much per keg at the flea market, where they sell their soda at retail for $4 a glass.NOW the challenge is to scale up production and increase the number of wholesale clients, all while maintaining quality. The company has just hired its first three employees, to help make and sell soda.And, Ms. Mak says, they have just signed a new client, Untitled, the Danny Meyer restaurant that is to open this month in the Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan. But, she says, she was quick to tell the restaurant that the soda company was not yet at a point where it could supply other Meyer restaurants, like Union Square Cafe or the Shake Shack mini-chain.At the end of an evening of soda experiments, the couple’s kitchen is perfumed in a haze of peat and citrus peel. Ms. Mak takes the canister of cardamom apple ginger soda that she has just made and conducts a taste test.“This needs more work,” she says. “The cardamom has been beaten back by the ginger and the apple.”Mr. Ramos checks on the peat-smoked fruit experiment, taking the plums and lemon peel out of the pan and sniffing them. “It’s definitely peaty,” he says, pleased.Like single-malt Scotch whiskey, the Brooklyn sodas and their unusual flavors — grapefruit jalapeno honey, strawberry hops pink peppercorn and (go figure) maple bacon — attract a certain beverage cognoscenti. That kind of chemistry between consumer and consumed is no accident.“It’s an expensive product and we are making weird flavors,” Mr. Ramos acknowledges. “You can dumb it down or you can try to understand your niche and push harder into that niche.”'"

"'11-03-06,'0','At the time, the S.E.C. said its action was intended to give issuers time to adapt to the Dodd-Frank rules and would stay in place for only six months. But on Jan. 24, the S.E.C. extended its nonenforcement stance indefinitely. Issuers are selling asset-backed securities without the ratings disclosures required under S.E.C. rules, and rating agencies are not subject to expert liability.MARTHA COAKLEY, the attorney general of Massachusetts, has brought significant mortgage securities cases against Wall Street firms — and she is disturbed by the S.E.C.’s position. Last week, she sent a letter to Mary Schapiro, the chairwoman of the S.E.C., asking why the commission was refusing to enforce its rules and was thereby defeating Congressional intent where ratings agencies’ liability is concerned.“We wanted to make clear that we see this as a problem and important enough that we would like an answer,” Ms. Coakley said in an interview last week. “They are either going to enforce this or say why they are not. As a state regulator, we don’t enforce Dodd-Frank, but we certainly deal with the fallout when it is not enforced.”An S.E.C. spokesman, John Nester, said that the agency would respond to Ms. Coakley.Meredith Cross, director of the S.E.C.’s division of corporation finance, explained the agency’s decision to stand down on the issue: “If we didn’t provide the no-action relief to issuers, then they would do their transactions in the unregistered market,” she said. “You would impede investor protection. We thought, notwithstanding the grief we would take, that it would be better to have these securities done in the registered market.”Unfortunately, the S.E.C.’s actions appear to continue the decades of special treatment bestowed upon the credit raters. Among the perquisites enjoyed by established credit raters is protection from competition, since regulators were required to approve new entrants to the business. Regulators have also sanctioned the agencies’ ratings by embedding them into the investment process: financial institutions post less capital against securities rated at or above a certain level, for example, and investment managers at insurance companies and mutual funds are allowed to buy only securities receiving certain grades.This is a recipe for disaster. Given that ratings were required and the firms had limited competition, they had little incentive to assess securities aggressively or properly. Their assessments of mortgage securities were singularly off-base, causing hundreds of billions in losses among investors who had relied on ratings.That the S.E.C.’s move strengthens the ratings agencies’ protection from investor lawsuits, which runs counter to the intention of Dodd-Frank, is also disturbing. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s have argued successfully for years that their grades are opinions and subject to the same First Amendment protections that journalists receive. This position has made lawsuits against the raters exceedingly difficult to mount, a problem that Dodd-Frank was supposed to fix.I asked Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat whose name is on the 2010 financial reform legislation, if he was concerned that the S.E.C.’s inaction was enabling ratings agencies to evade liability.Mr. Frank said he believed the S.E.C.’s move was part of a longer-term strategy to eliminate investor reliance on ratings and remove, at long last, all references to credit ratings agencies in government statutes. Indeed, the S.E.C. proposed a new rule last week that would eliminate the requirement that money market funds buy only securities with high credit ratings. If the rule goes through, fund boards would have to make their own determinations that the instruments they buy are of superior credit quality.Still, Mr. Frank said, the commission could do a better job of explaining that its nonenforcement stance is part of an effort to reduce reliance on ratings. “The message should not be lax enforcement by the S.E.C.; it should be a lack of confidence in the ratings,” he said.The problem is that it could take years to rid the investment arena of all references to ratings. In the meantime, the S.E.C. is letting the ratings agencies escape accountability once again.Moreover, investors are right to fear that the S.E.C. may be capitulating to threats by the ratings agencies to boycott the securitization market as long as they are subject to expert liability. After all, Moody’s and S.& P. have succeeded before in derailing attempts by legislators to bring accountability to asset-backed securities.Back in 2003, for example, Georgia’s legislature enacted one of the toughest predatory-lending laws in the nation. Part of the law allowed issuers of and investors in mortgage pools to be held liable if the loans were found to be abusive. Shortly after that law went into effect, the ratings agencies refused to rate mortgage securities containing Georgia loans because of this potential liability. The law was soon rewritten to eliminate the liability, allowing predatory lending to flourish.IT is certainly important that the S.E.C. work to eliminate references to ratings in the investment arena, and to reduce investor reliance on them. But Congress couldn’t have been clearer in its intent of holding the agencies accountable. That the S.E.C. is undermining that goal is absurd in the extreme.'"
"'11-03-06,'0','The shop, which dates to 1949, was bought in 1973 by Mr. Oliviero’s father, John, who ran it until his death, in 1990. The business passed to Ernest, who had trained behind the counter packing ravioli since the age of 9.Early neighborhood customers were Italian immigrants who relied on Deer Park Ravioli for Sunday family dinners, Mr. Oliviero said. The company expanded under his father, selling ravioli to local supermarkets like King Kullen. Another opportunity presented itself after the younger Mr. Oliviero took over, when restaurant chefs came into the shop to request specialty ravioli.“Dad used to make the regular cheese-and-meat ravioli, the traditional stuff,” Mr. Oliviero said. “But we started doing the specialties, and slowly it became a norm for the restaurants.”Deer Park Ravioli now offers 60 types of ravioli, including Florentine (fresh sautéed spinach and garlic) and lobster supreme (chunks of lobster and cream). All the ravioli is made with impastata ricotta, whipped for a delicate, creamy texture.Fresh cheese ravioli, frozen specialty ravioli, pasta sauces, house-made mozzarella and filled-while-you-wait cannolis are available at the retail store.Linda Villano, 45, of Sea Cliff, the owner of SerendipiTea, took a circuitous route to Long Island. Ms. Villano established a wholesale loose-leaf tea business in 1995 with her husband, Tomislav Podreka, in their apartment in Manhattan. Later, they moved it to Connecticut, and eventually they got a warehouse in Long Island City, Queens.They imported and blended premium teas from India, China, Sri Lanka, Japan and elsewhere. “We just started testing it, making tea for friends, bringing tea to the back door of restaurants, and it evolved,” Ms. Villano recalled.The couple divorced but kept working together; then Mr. Podreka died in 2004, and Ms. Villano kept going, settling into a retail tea store and production site in Manhasset four years ago.The early years were hard, she said, but when consumer interest in loose-leaf tea grew, SerendipiTea was ready to take advantage of it. “Tea is not an afterthought anymore,” Ms. Villano said. She, like the other company owners interviewed, would not disclose her sales, but the business has nine full-time employees, she said, and ships tea nationally and internationally.In the lower level of her Manhasset tea shop, Ms. Villano and her team prepare bins and barrels of more than 200 imported teas (the dried leaf of the camellia sinensis plant) and tisanes (herbal, fruit or spice infusions).SerendipiTea delivers tea in bulk to Fairway Market, makes proprietary private-label blends for Dean & DeLuca and sells loose-leaf teas to restaurants and retail customers through its Web site and retail shop. But Ms. Villano still values the flexibility she has operating a small local business.“We are a boutique operation,” she said. “We custom-blend things all the time based on customer needs. And I like the freedom of working that way.”Customer relationships are key to the success of the Hampton Coffee Company in Water Mill, said Jason Belkin, 36, of Westhampton Beach, who owns the company with his wife, Theresa. The company’s first owner, Ellen Steinlauf, opened an espresso bar and coffee roastery in 1994. Mr. Belkin took a summer job there as a college student, later returning to buy the business in 1999.Since then, he has gradually expanded, adding a full kitchen to the 40-seat coffeehouse in 2001, with a menu that includes breakfast burritos, muffins and pecan raisin scones. Mr. Belkin opened a second store in Westhampton Beach in 2005 and last year introduced the Mobile Espresso Unit, a custom-built Mercedes-Benz van with an espresso bar inside. In high summer season, he has as many as 48 employees in the company.Hampton Coffee imports raw coffee beans from more than a dozen countries, including Peru, Colombia, Ethiopia and Jamaica, roasting and selling 125,000 pounds of beans a year. A fragrant Bean Bar in Water Mill offers 17 barrels from which customers can scoop and bag freshly roasted beans.“We may be Long Island’s largest independent roaster, but we’re still small enough to really involve our customers,” said Mr. Belkin. Wholesale clients include King Kullen, Nick & Toni’s in East Hampton and the Long Island Ducks minor-league baseball team.A truck makes weekly deliveries along a route between Montauk and Manhattan. Mr. Belkin also has mail-order customers, like one in South Dakota who orders a bag of espresso beans every week.“There are a lot of people who lived here and moved away or are regular summer customers,” Mr. Belkin said. “They miss their espresso, the atmosphere and what it reminds them of — the summer, sitting outside on our patio. We’re part of their lives.”Fifty small cheese ravioli, $6.49; 12 jumbo cheese ravioli, $6.39; 12 specialty ravioli, $9.99 to $12.99. Pasta sauces, $4.69 to $5.99 a pint (pesto, $4.99 for eight ounces).Most teas are $12 for a four-ounce box; some cost up to $60 for four ounces. Sampler tins, $5 an ounce.Most coffee beans: $11.99 a pound for regular, $12.99 a pound for decaffeinated. Brewed coffee, $1.66 (10 ounces) to $2.07 (20 ounces); cappuccino, $2.85 (single) to $3.85 (double). Breakfast burrito, $9.50. Pecan raisin scone, $2.90.'"

"'11-03-06,'0','Thanks to this new accessibility, travelers are now discovering the area’s awe-inspiring biodiversity, which includes one of Southeast Asia’s largest tracts of virgin rain forest; some 60 threatened species, including the endangered Asian elephants, tigers, Siamese crocodiles and pileated gibbons; and a virtually untouched 12-island archipelago in the Gulf of Thailand, with sand beaches and crystal-clear aquamarine waters.The Koh Kong region spans 4,300 square miles, about the size of the Everglades National Park. But the charms of Cambodian rural life are readily apparent in Chi Phat, home to about 2,500 people. The village sits at the foot of the Southern Cardamom Mountains, about 10 miles inland, up the mangrove- and bamboo-lined Preak Piphot River. Wooden houses on stilts, painted mint green and baby blue and shaded by towering palms, line the main dirt road. Children wearing navy blue and white uniforms and broad smiles cycle to school on adult-size bikes, passing by toothpick-legged white egrets hanging out on the backs of water buffalo in neon green rice fields.It wasn’t always this peaceful. Chi Phat was once infamous for its abundant poachers, loggers and slash-and-burn farmers, who were forced to turn to illegal practices to make a living. That began to change in 2007, when the conservation group Wildlife Alliance started to work with the community on a project that would turn hunters — who knew the forest’s hidden gems better than anyone — into tour guides, and local families into guesthouse owners.“Chi Phat was home to the most destructive inhabitants in the whole of Koh Kong province,” said John Maloy, a spokesman for Wildlife Alliance. “By participating in the eco-tourism project, community members would not only receive income that would greatly improve their situation, they would be provided with incentives to protect the forest rather than exploit it in an unsustainable manner.”So far, the initiatives seem to be working. Last year, Chi Phat welcomed 1,228 visitors, according to the alliance, an increase of nearly 50 percent from 2009. Residents are receiving much-needed income that allows them to reside year-round in the village, allowing their children to go to school and get to health care. (When locals relied on logging and hunting, they had to spend long stretches in the forest.)Travelers, meanwhile, can leave the pressures of the developed world behind. Days begin with the rooster’s crow and end when the village’s generator goes silent at midnight. On trips organized by the Community-Based Eco-tourism office, visitors can trek through fields filled with canary yellow and electric blue butterflies to reach bat caves hidden behind curved waterfalls, or plant a tree at a reforestation nursery. Recent visitors reportedly caught a glimpse of a few of the area’s roughly 175 endangered elephants.Janet Newman, originally from England, fell for Koh Kong while documenting the province’s wildlife in 2005. Within three years, she had decided to stay for good, and opened the eco-friendly Rainbow Lodge.“I looked at many parts of the country but always had a big smile on my face when I went to Koh Kong,” Ms. Newman said. “It was just the sheer unspoiled beauty of the area.”The lodge, on 12 acres along the Tatai River about 50 miles northwest of Chi Phat, is thick with palms and brightly colored flowering bushes. The seven wooden thatched-roof bungalows have hammock-strung terraces that overlook the trees.Guests at the lodge — who recently ranged from a young Australian family of five to adventure-ready couples from Europe — can kayak to the nearby Tatai waterfall, a wide expanse that creates small bathing pools and pummeling massage spots between black rocks; head into the jungle on guided hikes, spotting and identifying birds and insects as they go; or just lounge in the wicker sofas in the open-air restaurant, whose thatched roof features a nightly display by limb-size polka-dotted geckos.If you are lucky, the spot might just live up to its name: three rainbows streaked the sky during a November visit.Ms. Newman and her boyfriend and co-manager, Gee Cartier, go to great lengths to minimize the property’s environmental impact, sourcing about 95 percent of Rainbow Lodge’s power from solar panels and supporting Cambodian-made products like biodegradable handmade soaps and locally harvested honey.Cozy as Rainbow might be, some travelers may prefer the creature comforts available at 4 Rivers Floating Lodge, which opened in November 2009 three miles downstream on a bend in the river. Bringing luxury to the untamed wilderness is the focus here, with 12 rooms housed in elaborately built tents that float on interconnected decks made of recycled wood.With perks like king beds, air-conditioning, hot water and three-course dinners, 4 Rivers caters to European honeymooners and expatriates in Phnom Penh seeking a refuge from the city.But just as eco-tourism is taking off, businesses may soon have to deal with major threats from a different sort of development. Like much of Cambodia, Koh Kong faces serious challenges as the government sells off land, including parcels of national parks, to private developers. Several Chinese-built dams have been proposed or are under construction along Koh Kong’s rivers. And given the recent government approval to build a titanium mine nearby, Chi Phat itself faces the possible loss of 11,000 acres of rain forest and and additional challenges to its eco-tourism efforts.Last year, ground was broken on a $5 billion, 25-year Chinese-financed tourism project that includes an airport, a sea port, a golf course and a large commercial development along a stretch of Koh Kong’s southern coast, now accessible only by boat. Although the roads and airport might be good for the eco-tourism efforts, the additional developments might not.The archipelago consists of a dozen islands with few inhabitants, aside from the main fishing island of Koh Sdach. A few places to stay already operate on the islands. December 2009 saw the opening of hippie-friendly Nomads Land on Koh Totang, a rugged island, and Belinda Beach Resort, opened in October on Koh Sdach, which easily qualifies as Koh Kong’s fanciest digs, with stone bungalows surrounded by bougainvilleas and plumeria trees, an infinity pool and a terrace.As in Chi Phat, positive, symbiotic relationships between businesses and residents are forming on the islands — which may be a bulwark against overdevelopment. Nomads and Belinda Beach employ islanders at their properties; tourists hire fishermen, intimately familiar with the area’s secret beaches and best swimming spots, as day-trip guides.“We felt such positive energy from the locals when we arrived,” said Benoit Trigaux, the owner of Belinda Beach. “Everything you can dream of is here.”HOW TO GET THEREKoh Kong province is roughly a five-hour drive from Phnom Penh. Public buses ($10) leave from Phnom Penh throughout the day, but hiring a private car ($70 each way; arrange through your hotel) will save time. (U.S. dollars are widely accepted in Cambodia.)Koh Sdach is best reached by a two-hour ferry ($25) from Sihanoukville that runs every other day (returning the next day); a Chinese-built road is expected to be finished this year.There are currently 11 guesthouses and 8 homestays in Chi Phat (855-92-720-925; ecoadventurecambodia.com). Accommodations are simple: foam mattress, mosquito net, shared toilets. You might have a farm animal or two under your room. Take it all in stride. Daily rates are $3 to $5 a person.The seven bungalows at family-friendly Rainbow Lodge (855-99-744-321; rainbowlodgecambodia.com) feature log-frame beds, a silk bedside lamp, fans and private balconies. Doubles, including all meals, are $65.Rooms at the 4 Rivers Floating Lodge (Tatai River; 855-97-64-34-032; ecolodges.asia) are spacious and furnished with beds and settees made of woven water hyacinth; the private verandas are lovely. Doubles, $139.At Nomads Land (Koh Totang; 855-11-91-61-71; nomadslandcambodia.com), you can stay in anything from a single room made of thatched bamboo to a two-story bungalow with stunning ocean views. There are plans to introduce yoga and meditation retreats.

"'11-03-06,'0','To outsiders, China may seem purposefully dynamic. To its own people, the same ceaseless change can seem frighteningly chaotic. During my own recent three years of living there, I was often startled by the dramatic stories told by my Chinese friends — both the terrible parts (famine, split and scattered families, trust betrayed, fortunes lost) and the astonishing rebounds (an against-all-odds admission to a university, a fearless gamble that paid off, a random kindness from a generous stranger).But China has gone through previous periods of tumultuous change, as Liel Leibovitz and Matthew Miller’s “Fortunate Sons” makes abundantly clear. Their story begins with Yung Wing, who came to America in the late 1840s. The first Chinese student admitted to Yale, he returned to his homeland in 1854, determined not to be the last. Under his tutelage, 120 Chinese boys crossed the Pacific in the 1870s, intent on learning Western skills that might help their country modernize. Yet mixed fortunes awaited them on their return to a country whose Qing-era imperial rule was crumbling, where their schooling at various colleges in New England made them both influential and, in some cases, rootless and estranged.The boys arrived in an America that was going through its own post-Civil War transformation, and Leibovitz and Miller use the newcomers’ experiences as pretexts for discourses on extraneous subjects. One such observation — “For the boys,” the story of the transcontinental railroad’s creation “could have contained many lessons about the contrasting outlooks of imperial China and the young American republic” — is followed by a lengthy discussion of the Central Pacific Railroad, ethnic tensions involving its Chinese work crews and how John Deere tractors tamed the prairie.On their return to China, many of these young men struggled to find a proper role, or even a measure of stability. One of Yung Wing’s nephews, Yung Leang, a skilled orator at Hartford High, had just enrolled in college when the exchange program was abruptly halted. Arriving back in China in the fall of 1881, he and his companions were arrested because they could no longer speak Mandarin well enough to explain their long absence. Despite being ill-suited to military life, he was sent for naval training and emerged as an improbable hero of the (losing) Battle of Foochow against French warships in 1884.Occasionally, it’s a random detail in a Chinese student’s story that resonates. Chung Mun Yew, who became coxswain of the Yale rowing team, gained a small measure of vindication years later when, back in America as a diplomat, he met a scoffing Harvard graduate who bet he had never even seen a university boat race. “It is true that I had never seen a Harvard crew row,” Chung replied. “They were always behind me.”Leibovitz and Miller, whose previous book dealt with the German wartime ballad “Lili Marlene,” are specialists in narrative history rather than Sinology, so their book will be most satisfying to readers who have had the least exposure to China and its history. Their breezily generalizing style discounts the many contradictory elements that are always at play among the country’s vast population. And they introduce a number of small but cumulatively unfortunate errors — referring, for example, to the city of Nanjing as “northern” when its name means “southern capital.” Elsewhere, they say that the “seven main languages” of China are “each as different from the other as German is from French,” which oversimplifies a complex linguistic heritage. Still, the story of these 19th-century scholars is a useful reminder of how long exchanges between our two countries have been under way, and of the risks and rewards that these connections have brought to both sides.'"
"'11-03-06,'0','It started randomly, as collaborations often do for young people with high-speed connections, limited budgets and big ideas. Back in the summer of 2009, Jacob Krupnick, an aspiring art photographer in his mid-20s, persuaded a fashion P.R. company to hire him to make a promotional video for a footwear show. He went on to recruit 50 dancers (“all skills, all ages, all bodies”) to come to a makeshift studio in the Meatpacking District one hot night in July. Payment was in pizza slices.Anne Marsen was 20 that summer, still recovering from a high-anxiety childhood in Teaneck, N.J.: competitive ballet school, performing in “ ” at and the ever-accelerating pressure to be the best and skinniest and en pointe-iest girl in class. Since dropping out of the University of the Arts in a year earlier, she had gone rogue, dance-wise, taking three or four classes a day from studios all over — jazz, modern, tap, salsa, flamenco, belly-dancing, break-­dancing, West African, pole dancing, capoeira — borrowing gestures and movements and boiling them all down into her own unique B-girl bouillabaisse. She showed up at Krupnick’s shoot that night sweaty and a little disheveled, straight out of hip-hop class, wearing sweat pants and a faded T-shirt. She handed Krupnick her , cued up to a Daft Punk song about robots yearning to be human, and then offered his camera a five-minute high-intensity freestyle that mixed pops, locks, pirouettes, cartwheels and karate kicks with sensuous hip gyrations and imaginary baton twirls.In the months that followed, as Krupnick edited the 50 dancers into one sequence, he found himself returning to Marsen’s routine. “There’s something so dynamic and confident and fluid about her movement,” he said when we talked last month in his apartment in Greenpoint, . “It has nothing in common with the pleasure of watching an amazing ballet dancer. It’s more like watching a chameleon on fast forward. She’s playing with her body movement the way a rapper might play with words.”Krupnick and Marsen both wanted to collaborate again, to make, as Krupnick put it, “something kind of gigantic.” They just didn’t know what that something might be. Then in mid-November, Girl Talk, the mash-up D.J., released his latest album, “All Day,” a stew of samples lifted from 373 songs and recombined into a chaotic, propulsive mix. As Krupnick listened to the album, it struck him that Girl Talk makes the way Anne Marsen makes dance. “I started to hyperventilate a little bit, the way you do when you get excited about something that you really want to come true,” he told me. “And then I started calling Anne.”A month later, Krupnick and Marsen were on the early-morning , along with two other dancers and Krupnick’s wife, carrying boomboxes and cameras and ducking security guards, shooting guerrilla-style test footage for “Girl Walk//All Day,” which Krupnick describes as “an epic, 71-minute-long dance-music video” in which Marsen will dance her way through the entire Girl Talk album and up the island of . By the end of the day’s shoot, they had eight solid minutes, which Krupnick cut together and tossed up on Vimeo as a kind of trailer for the full movie, to see if anyone noticed. The first day, 11 people watched. On Day 2, six did. Then on Jan. 12, Gothamist posted the video, and an hour later it appeared on The home page. By day’s end, more than 17,000 people had seen it. On Jan. 28, Krupnick put up a donation page on Kickstarter, hoping to raise $4,800 from strangers to help him and his collaborators make and distribute the complete video. They gave themselves 45 days to meet their financing goal. It took six. By , they raised $12,000, and the trailer had been seen almost 60,000 times.It is no surprise that people go nuts for the trailer. It is weird and joyous, popping with youth and energy. At first, Marsen looks more like an enthusiastic and slightly dorky amateur than a trained dance pro. She wears regular tennis shoes and worn gray cords and an oversize, multicolored jacket, and at one point she falls off the railing of an escalator. It’s not until a minute or so in, as she twirls and gyrates through the ferry’s upper level, staring down the camera with a sly smile on her face as sleepy commuters pretend not to notice, that you start to suspect that you’re watching something more than a little magical.For the past six weeks, while Marsen’s Internet celebrity grew, her physical self was in , where she is staying with strangers she meets through and taking a monthlong intensive dance class. (She plans to incorporate some Bollywood moves into the full “Girl Walk” video, which she and Krupnick will shoot in April.) We spoke last month by as she sipped chai tea, sitting with her laptop on the floor of a dance studio. “Growing up, I thought that in order to be a successful dancer, you needed to be on Broadway or you needed to be in music videos, doing other people’s work,” she said. “So this is like a dream, to be able to just do my own thing to Girl Talk.” It was often scary during the last few years, she said, charting an iconoclastic path through the New York dance world, where people sometimes get “weirded out” by her ideas and her hybrid style. But she always had faith, she said, that if she kept doing what she loved, good things would happen. “I just didn’t know specifically how to get there,” she said with a laugh. “But now it’s coming to me.”'"

"'11-03-06,'0','The AbleGamers Foundation estimates that about 33 million Americans with disabilities are video game players. Smith’s concern involves only sports-theme games.“There is a demographic here that hasn’t been reached,” he said.He did not intend to become another advocate. Smith was so thrilled by MLB The Show a couple of years ago that he sent a thank-you letter to the design team for giving him the chance to play baseball.“For me, that was as real as it was ever going to get,” Smith said.The design team at Sony Computer Entertainment America was moved.“This all started not because of the letter, but because of what people did about that letter,” Smith said. “If they had chosen to ignore this letter, none of this would have ever happened.”The design team invited Smith to its studio in San Diego, where he spent two days in late 2009. Smith sat in on meetings, and he was asked for suggestions to make the game better. He became sort of a consultant to the 70-member design team.“We really liked the guy,” Launchbaugh said. “Really cool kid. Really smart. He fit right in with our team. We had a great time, and it kind of became a friendship.”Eventually, it led to the A.D.V.A. mode. Launchbaugh said MLB The Show has about 70 settings that can be tailored to individuals. The A.D.V.A. default settings, set to Smith’s recommendations, can be altered.“Last year, you could have gone through all of the settings to what A.D.V.A. means today, but it would have taken you about 20 minutes,” Launchbaugh said. “And you would have had to know exactly what you were changing and what it meant. This is just a really nice way to have members of his organization say, ‘O.K., I can just start with this setting, and it’s going to be compatible with me.’ ”For Smith, a big issue was when he played the game online against other gamers. Until now, online competitors had to be on the same settings, “so the first inning they’d always be up, 6-nothing,” Smith said.The new edition allows gamers with different settings to compete. The other player simply must accept the challenge.Smith controls his wheelchair with a joystick, but the PlayStation controller has 12 buttons and 2 joysticks, demanding an array of quick-fingered combinations. During an at-bat, for example, base runners are usually controlled by several buttons while the player anticipates the pitch.“This is difficult because you need, like, four fingers to achieve this,” Launchbaugh said. “So what we’ve done is, while you’re batting, base running is automatic. Once the ball is in play, you can control your runners.”Fielding a ball usually means moving the defender into position with one joystick, then using buttons to throw. In A.D.V.A. mode, fielding the ball is automatic, but deciding where and when to throw is up to the player.“It’s not dumbing it down,” Smith said. “It’s trying to take the physical factor and remove it, so that the game becomes more of a mental competition.”Smith plans to go live with a Web site, advasports.org, on Tuesday to coincide with the release of MLB 11 The Show. He does not know where all this will lead. But in a video game world where reality is increasingly treasured, and where more game systems use motion sensors to enable players to control the action, Smith wants to help ensure that millions are not left in technology’s wake.“That kind of freaked me out — what if it got to a point where everything is motion?” Smith said. “I understand that it’s a marketing thing, and I understand that they’re trying to get people up to move. They’re trying to make video games look like a very good exercise option.“But for people like us, it’s, ‘Oh, no, what are we going to do?’ There are these people out here who can’t do the motion; they can’t be the controller. So depending on how well the A.D.V.A. does, I hope in the long run, there will be more systems and more games that do this.”'"
"'11-03-06,'0','The economy may still be sluggish, but it’s been a veritable boom time for novels concerning the problems of people of privilege, those particularly American tragedies where folks with money, education and nice teeth invent elaborate ways to mess up their lives. In the last year or so, we had “The Financial Lives of the Poets,” by Jess Walter; “Model Home,” by Eric Puchner; “The Privileges,” by Jonathan Dee; “Union Atlantic,” by Adam Haslett; and “Dear Money,” by Martha McPhee. Joining the pack is Carol Edgarian’s “Three Stages of Amazement,” an expansive novel (with a lamentably fussy title) about the intricate economies of the American marriage.It begins New Year’s Eve 2008. Barack Obama has just been elected president, and the “extraordinarily ordinary” Lena Rusch, an overly capable heroine in the style of a 21st-century Lily Bart, is giving a party on credit. The evening, with its modest bounty (crab and a last-minute shopping list that includes “butter, candles, ice”), is meant to be a corrective to the prior, very bad year. Ten months earlier, Lena, in her early 40s, gave birth to twins prematurely. One died, and the surviving twin, Willa, has seizures and chronic pneumonia. The doctors warn of cognitive delays: “Cerebral palsy was a term sometimes used. Lena stopped her ears.” Another mother cruelly yet evocatively calls the baby “a squash.”Lena’s husband, Charlie Pepper, is a doctor, which would be an asset to Willa’s care if he were ever home. Charlie has quit full-time doctoring to develop the appropriately named Nimbus, a robot that allows surgeons to operate from remote locations. Unfortunately, the demands of chasing Nimbus have forced Charlie to conduct his family life from a remote location, too. Beyond that, he has picked a lousy time to be a pioneer. Silicon Valley venture capital has dried up, and San Francisco, where he has moved his family in the way of countless prospectors before him, is pricey. The Rusch-Pepper clan, which includes a young son, Theo, is financially strained, emotionally exhausted and altogether amazed at the unexpected, downward turn in their fortunes. These are people who had “arrived in San Francisco ready for luck.”And then, luck finds them. Well, sort of. Cal Rusch, “one of Silicon Valley’s oldest and most savvy venture capitalists,” starts sniffing around the Nimbus. Because this is a novel, Cal is also Lena’s estranged Uncle Cal. With only a few months of financing left and no other options, Charlie has to choose between further alienating his already aggrieved wife and salvaging his business. Love or money, as the old saw goes. Of course, Charlie chooses money, both before speaking to his wife and before the money has even officially been offered. Lest you think this is a spoiler, the question in the book is never whether Charlie will take the money — Edgarian tells us by the end of Chapter 1 that he will. The question is whether Charlie and Lena’s marriage will survive this latest arrangement.Just up the hill, another marriage, another party. The couple are Cal and Ivy Rusch, who have been married for nearly 50 years, and the party is to celebrate the engagement of their 30-something daughter, Paige. While Charlie and Lena are members of the squeezed upper middle class, Cal and Ivy — both gorgeously prickly characters — are the superrich. It turns out that the superrich aren’t so different after all: Lena’s most intimate relationship is with her nanny, Glo; Ivy’s is with her butler, Paco; money can’t protect either couple from the failings of the human body, not for very long, at least.No, the superrich aren’t so very different except that they throw much better, or at least bigger, parties: “The Rusches rarely opened their doors to a crowd, but when they did, they opened them wide. The cost of the night would exceed a million dollars. Seven hundred and two guests; 10,000 passed hors d’oeuvre.” In contrast with Lena’s spread, the food at the Rusch’s gala is described for nearly a page, the lavish detail bringing to mind “The Age of Innocence,” that classic problems-of-people-of-privilege novel: “chefs from Chez Panisse, Rose’s Café and Jardinière. . . . Moroccan lamb meatballs, halibut and shrimp cakes with romesco, brioche panini with fontina and truffle oil, roasted pepper and Serrano ham, fried risotto balls, tuna tartare with chermoula on toast, fried polenta with mushroom duxelle. There was a kitchen with six Japanese chefs for sushi.”'"
"'11-03-06,'0','Now, as the generals steer Egypt toward a new civilian government after the fall of President Hosni Mubarak, those questions about the aid program echo a broader uneasiness, especially in the pro-democracy movement: will a military so deeply invested in a system that conferred great economic and political power be willing to let go?“It will be a very sore point in the near future, I’m sure, that the generals, the Supreme military council, is a de facto, separate government with an economy in its own right,” said Christopher Davidson, an expert on Egypt and a professor at Durham University in England.Some experts and former American military officials say the aid from Washington — roughly $40 billion since the program’s inception as part of the 1979 Camp David peace accord signed by Israel and Egypt — has served to shore up a military bureaucracy prone to insider dealing and corruption.Robert Springborg, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School who studies Egypt’s military, said that by paying for expensive weapons systems, the aid program “has enabled the Egyptian military then to use resources it has for other purposes.”In part because of concerns about diversion of funds, only a sliver of the money from the American aid program actually goes to the Egyptian military. Instead, the Pentagon directly pays American companies that it has chosen to manufacture and ship the tanks, planes, guns and ammunition to Egypt.Egyptian opposition groups have said that Mr. Mubarak and senior generals were nonetheless able to divert money. But American officials insist that the design of the program — known as Foreign Military Sales — ensures that money cannot be stolen.Edward W. Ross, a former official at the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees the sales, said he was irked by allegations that Egyptians could have pocketed money. “That money goes to the Federal Reserve,” he said, “and then it is only released to a U.S. contractor.”Even so, the United States has considerably less control over how goods are used once they arrive in Egypt. In interviews, several former American military officials said that keeping the aid flowing often seemed to trump questions of how effective it was. Some of them asked to remain anonymous because they did not want to alienate the Egyptian military. The yearly $1.3 billion, one retired colonel explained, is viewed as “an entitlement.”At times, American officials have argued with Egyptian generals over whether certain equipment was actually for military use. That was the case with the Gulfstream jets.The retired colonel, who worked at the American Embassy’s Office of Military Cooperation in Cairo, said that the Egyptians assured him the planes would be used for “mapping,” but that he was skeptical. “It was obvious to us that these were going to be used at least in part for V.I.P. travel,” the colonel said.Officers tried to block the deal, he recalled, but “our contacts at the Ministry of Defense were applying pressure” to make sure the sale went through.A former high-ranking Pentagon official said he also protested. “I remember that it was made very clear to the Egyptians that ‘You use this for military purposes and not for a luxury airline for V.I.P.’s,’ ” he said.But the Egyptian military did indeed use the Gulfstreams for the V.I.P.’s, and the luxury jets became a popular symbol of the Mubarak government’s excess.Egyptian military officials declined to comment for this article.Over the years, the Gulfstream fleet — which now totals nine jets — has cost American taxpayers $333 million, government officials said. The most recent purchase was in 2002, but the Pentagon continues to pay $10 million a year to service the planes.The Pentagon referred questions about military aid for Egypt to the State Department, which has formal jurisdiction. In an e-mail response to questions, a State Department spokesman said the aid “assists Egypt in maintaining a strong and disciplined defense force, which is imperative at this time, and critical to ensuring Egypt’s continued role as a regional leader able to act as a moderating influence.”Few Americans worked more closely with Egypt’s military than Maj. Gen. Michael A. Collings, a retired Air Force officer who was the top-ranking United States military representative in Egypt from 2006 to 2008. He served as the American Embassy’s senior defense representative and chief of the Office of Military Cooperation.General Collings said the Americans were not able to track the for-profit arm of the Egyptian military — a conglomerate that runs factories, farms and high-tech corporations. “How much goes back from the actual sale to the military so they can buy other equipment? I don’t know,” he said. “I do know that a fair amount goes back to the senior officers that are in charge of these particular factories.”While insisting that there was “no way, shape or form” that American aid money had been stolen, General Collings said he was disturbed by what he described as endemic corruption in the upper ranks of the Egyptian military. “My concern is for the Egyptian people who have suffered enough,” he said. “They deserve better.”While he was posted in Egypt, he said, senior Egyptian military officials told him of a corruption scheme in which Mr. Mubarak handed out cash to the generals leading each branch of the armed forces — army, navy, air force and air defense force. “There was a systematic process by which money was given and distributed through the top ranks of the regime,” General Collings said.A former high-ranking Egyptian officer confirmed General Collings’s account. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns for his safety.The two former American military officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they had not heard those allegations.On top of the $1.3 billion in annual military aid, the Egyptian armed forces collect millions more from a joint military exercise, called Bright Stars, held in Egypt every two years. General Collings said the United States paid dearly to local companies chosen by the Egyptian military to provide equipment.In what he called an unusual arrangement, every item is rented. “Fifty cents a chair” per day, he recalled. “A buck fifty for a table. It varied.”The retired colonel who served in Egypt recalled similar concerns. “We felt some of the charges were very high,” he said.Even with the built-in safeguards, some of the Egyptian military’s for-profit ventures have created quandaries for administrators of the Foreign Military Sales program, according to experts. In some cases, military products and for-profit goods sold to civilians are manufactured inside a single armed forces-owned complex.The Egyptian military has a joint venture with Chrysler to make Jeeps, which are common on Egypt’s desert roads and in the army. The joint venture manufactures the civilian Jeep Wrangler, for sale in Egyptian car dealerships and across the Middle East, as well as a Jeep Wrangler used by the Egyptian Army.Last year, the American military awarded two Foreign Military Sales contracts to Chrysler in Detroit. One, for $26 million, was for 750 unassembled Jeeps. The other, announced in November, was for $7 million to ship tools and spare parts for Jeep Wranglers to the Egyptian Ministry of Defense.Mr. Springborg, the expert on the Egyptian military, said he was skeptical that, in cases like this, the Egyptians could maintain a firewall between production of civilian and military items.“Who is drawing these lines?” he said, emphasizing that he was expressing his personal views, not those of the American government. “That is the great difficulty of drawing a line in a military that has emphasized so much of its economic function.”The company that manufactures Jeeps in Egypt is a joint venture between Chrysler and a subsidiary of the Egyptian military. A Chrysler spokesman denied that there was any diversion and said the model of Jeep used by the Egyptian Army was different from the commercial vehicle.“All components imported for assembly of military vehicles are strictly for use in the military vehicles and under no circumstances are they used for nonmilitary assembly,” he said in an e-mail. He said no American military funds “are used to support the production of the civilian/retail sales.”Another area to look at, Mr. Springborg said, is the production of the well-known M1A1 Abrams tank, which the Egyptian military builds under license with American-made parts. The Pentagon pays General Dynamics to ship tank kits to Egypt, where military workers assemble them.Former American officers consider the tank manufacturing plant a giant jobs program. “It’s as much about providing jobs as it is buying military hardware,” General Collings said.In 2007, the Defense Department announced the sale of 125 more unassembled tanks to Egypt, at an estimated cost of $890 million. So far, Egypt has more than 800 of the tanks.“There are two assembly lines where they make that tank,” a former senior American military official said. “They are all in the same huge building.”Next to the tank production line that receives the American aid, he said, workers are assembling an Egyptian construction vehicle for commercial sale. He said American auditors visited the plant often to ensure that aid was not diverted from the tank-production side of the building.As for the International Medical Center, repeated telephone calls to the public relations department failed to win permission for a visit, and two reporters who showed up at the front gate were turned away for lack of a permit from military security.From that distance, the six-story hospital, on a desert road about 45 minutes east of Cairo, appears to be an oasis in a mostly barren landscape. Three wings jut out from the main building, all with white walls and green glass. The glass, including large bubbles framing the end of each wing, shimmers in the bright winter sunshine as window washers — a novelty in Egypt — inch down the walls.Towering palms line the entrance drive, while inside, sprinklers shoot water across carefully trimmed trees, lawns and flower beds. Security cameras survey the outside walls.According to the State Department, the Egyptian government built the medical center with its own funds, while the American military aid program contributed $162.8 million for equipment, operations and maintenance.The former American military officials involved in Egypt said they believed that the financing was cut off five years ago.But the spigot, it turns out, has not been turned all the way off. Last summer, the Pentagon gave a sole-source, $4.6 million contract to a Florida company called TeKontrol to train hospital staff members for 13 months. Halting the financing, a contract document explained, “could potentially impact the desires of the Egyptian Ministry of Defense” to win international accreditation for the hospital.'"

"'11-03-06,'0','The shop, which dates to 1949, was bought in 1973 by Mr. Oliviero’s father, John, who ran it until his death, in 1990. The business passed to Ernest, who had trained behind the counter packing ravioli since the age of 9.Early neighborhood customers were Italian immigrants who relied on Deer Park Ravioli for Sunday family dinners, Mr. Oliviero said. The company expanded under his father, selling ravioli to local supermarkets like King Kullen. Another opportunity presented itself after the younger Mr. Oliviero took over, when restaurant chefs came into the shop to request specialty ravioli.“Dad used to make the regular cheese-and-meat ravioli, the traditional stuff,” Mr. Oliviero said. “But we started doing the specialties, and slowly it became a norm for the restaurants.”Deer Park Ravioli now offers 60 types of ravioli, including Florentine (fresh sautéed spinach and garlic) and lobster supreme (chunks of lobster and cream). All the ravioli is made with impastata ricotta, whipped for a delicate, creamy texture.Fresh cheese ravioli, frozen specialty ravioli, pasta sauces, house-made mozzarella and filled-while-you-wait cannolis are available at the retail store.Linda Villano, 45, of Sea Cliff, the owner of SerendipiTea, took a circuitous route to Long Island. Ms. Villano established a wholesale loose-leaf tea business in 1995 with her husband, Tomislav Podreka, in their apartment in Manhattan. Later, they moved it to Connecticut, and eventually they got a warehouse in Long Island City, Queens.They imported and blended premium teas from India, China, Sri Lanka, Japan and elsewhere. “We just started testing it, making tea for friends, bringing tea to the back door of restaurants, and it evolved,” Ms. Villano recalled.The couple divorced but kept working together; then Mr. Podreka died in 2004, and Ms. Villano kept going, settling into a retail tea store and production site in Manhasset four years ago.The early years were hard, she said, but when consumer interest in loose-leaf tea grew, SerendipiTea was ready to take advantage of it. “Tea is not an afterthought anymore,” Ms. Villano said. She, like the other company owners interviewed, would not disclose her sales, but the business has nine full-time employees, she said, and ships tea nationally and internationally.In the lower level of her Manhasset tea shop, Ms. Villano and her team prepare bins and barrels of more than 200 imported teas (the dried leaf of the camellia sinensis plant) and tisanes (herbal, fruit or spice infusions).SerendipiTea delivers tea in bulk to Fairway Market, makes proprietary private-label blends for Dean & DeLuca and sells loose-leaf teas to restaurants and retail customers through its Web site and retail shop. But Ms. Villano still values the flexibility she has operating a small local business.“We are a boutique operation,” she said. “We custom-blend things all the time based on customer needs. And I like the freedom of working that way.”Customer relationships are key to the success of the Hampton Coffee Company in Water Mill, said Jason Belkin, 36, of Westhampton Beach, who owns the company with his wife, Theresa. The company’s first owner, Ellen Steinlauf, opened an espresso bar and coffee roastery in 1994. Mr. Belkin took a summer job there as a college student, later returning to buy the business in 1999.Since then, he has gradually expanded, adding a full kitchen to the 40-seat coffeehouse in 2001, with a menu that includes breakfast burritos, muffins and pecan raisin scones. Mr. Belkin opened a second store in Westhampton Beach in 2005 and last year introduced the Mobile Espresso Unit, a custom-built Mercedes-Benz van with an espresso bar inside. In high summer season, he has as many as 48 employees in the company.Hampton Coffee imports raw coffee beans from more than a dozen countries, including Peru, Colombia, Ethiopia and Jamaica, roasting and selling 125,000 pounds of beans a year. A fragrant Bean Bar in Water Mill offers 17 barrels from which customers can scoop and bag freshly roasted beans.“We may be Long Island’s largest independent roaster, but we’re still small enough to really involve our customers,” said Mr. Belkin. Wholesale clients include King Kullen, Nick & Toni’s in East Hampton and the Long Island Ducks minor-league baseball team.A truck makes weekly deliveries along a route between Montauk and Manhattan. Mr. Belkin also has mail-order customers, like one in South Dakota who orders a bag of espresso beans every week.“There are a lot of people who lived here and moved away or are regular summer customers,” Mr. Belkin said. “They miss their espresso, the atmosphere and what it reminds them of — the summer, sitting outside on our patio. We’re part of their lives.”Fifty small cheese ravioli, $6.49; 12 jumbo cheese ravioli, $6.39; 12 specialty ravioli, $9.99 to $12.99. Pasta sauces, $4.69 to $5.99 a pint (pesto, $4.99 for eight ounces).Most teas are $12 for a four-ounce box; some cost up to $60 for four ounces.

"'11-03-06,'0','But the article raises a serious issue: whether drilling has caused unhealthy levels of radium in our drinking water. Good reasons exist to believe the answer is no, but belief is not good enough.Pennsylvania should order all its public water systems to immediately test for radioactive pollutants. Only testing of our drinking water can resolve this question and give citizens peace of mind.The writers are, respectively, former governor of Pennsylvania and former secretary of the state’s Department of Environmental Protection.I live in Baltimore and I mostly drink tap water, because I perhaps naïvely believe that it’s safe. But your article on hydrofracking has shaken that faith.How much radium, benzene and other toxic residue wash down the Susquehanna and into my glass of water every day?I implore President Obama and the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa Jackson, to put a halt to hydrofracking until its true effects are well understood and until the industry has proved that it can drill in a way that is safe for the environment and for public health.The writer is a policy advocate for Environment Maryland.Your article criticizes Pennsylvania’s natural gas regulations, suggesting that they allow “drillers to discharge much of their waste through sewage treatment plants into rivers.”Pennsylvania’s primary disposal of wastewater is no disposal at all; the state leads the nation in recycling drilling wastewater, further reducing the environmental impact of natural gas exploration.Marcellus Shale producers reuse an average of 90 percent of this water. Many recycle 100 percent — industry’s goal.States like Pennsylvania have highly sophisticated regulations, which are getting even more protective. John H. Quigley, former secretary of Pennsylvania’s Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, has said that the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, under its former secretary, John Hanger, has “positioned Pennsylvania as the strongest state regulator of the natural gas industry.”While some of your points on water monitoring are valid and must be addressed, your claim that Pennsylvania’s regulations are “lax” is simply untrue.The writer is president and executive director of Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry trade group.Your article represents a pivotal point in the national debate about hydrofracking, a drilling method for natural gas.The gas industry has consistently tried to marginalize critics, labeling them alarmists who are citing isolated incidents. Now that an Environmental Protection Agency memo reveals that Pittsburgh residents suffered “one of the largest failures in U.S. history to supply clean drinking water” due in part to fracking wastes, industry efforts to minimize the problem are tainted beyond credibility.You can’t fix fracking by denial and trucking bottled water to victims’ homes. Industry needs to wake up to a new reality — until you can prove it can be done right, you can’t do it at all.That goes for government, too.

"'11-03-06,'0','Re “Why We Write About Grief” (Week in Review, Feb. 27):Meghan O’Rourke and Joyce Carol Oates highlight that grief is fraught with inherent paradoxes and dualities: a longing for a sense of coherence, meaning and order, when everything feels incomprehensible, unjust and meaningless; the feeling that one’s grief is deeply private and unspeakable, while outsiders are watching and observing as the mourner grieves; grappling with how to live fully within this world, while simultaneously living a secret and parallel internal life with the deceased; the knowledge that time keeps passing, with a simultaneous feeling that time remains frozen.And oftentimes, there are disappointed hopes and profound feelings of rage and hurt that coexist with feelings of love and tenderness. The mourner’s creation of a narrative of loss, and the listener’s receiving of that narrative without judgment or expectation, holds a place for the complexities and paradoxes of grief.It is also in the telling of the story of loss by the mourner, and the embracing of that story by the one who listens, that the deceased continues to exist in the memory, heart and mind of the mourner, and also comes to be known and endure in the minds of all who come to embrace the mourner’s narrative.The writer is a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst.'"
"'11-03-06,'0','The practical knowledge he has gleaned from coaxing potential drug ingredients out of ginger and other plants comes in handy here. “It helps me think about how to extract flavors from herbs,” Mr. Ramos says.But it is not his experience in chemical extraction alone that has helped turn the pair’s hobby into a soda start-up. Ms. Mak’s artistic inclination to make something entirely new has helped them find a niche in a haute beverage market populated by locally roasted coffees, spiced hot chocolates, craft beers and infused vodkas. Their entry is a nonalcoholic, noncaffeinated adult drink that is not so much a soda as a limited-edition carbonated juice.Ms. Mak takes the ginger cardamom flavor base off the stove, mixes it with apple juice and pours the liquid into a siphon canister for carbonation. Whereas mass-produced fruit sodas that sell in supermarkets are typically made from fizzy water and juice concentrates, she says, their handmade sodas use only fresh ingredients.“We thought there was a bit of a gap, especially in the area of nonalcoholic beverage options made from fresh fruit,” she says.The soda venture may have started as a whim: they wanted to see whether they could make their own ginger beer at home so they could serve Dark and Stormy cocktails at a party. But once they saw a potential commercial opportunity, they proceeded scientifically, using each phase of their business — from seeking initial capital to supplying restaurants — to test and refine their niche-market theory.First, they tried their soda flavors, like pure ginger and lemon, on their friends.“Our friends liked it, but we wondered if others would like it,” Mr. Ramos says. “We thought, how can we test it?”They applied for a table at the Brooklyn flea market. Then they sought seed capital of about $2,000 through kickstarter.com, a site that helps finance creative start-up businesses. “We achieved it in four days, which was stunning,” Ms. Mak says.With the money, the pair bought equipment like soda kegs. They consulted artisanal beer makers about carbonation techniques. They worked with a program at the Cornell University College of Agriculture to vet their soda recipes.On their first day at the flea market last April, they sold out by 3 p.m., Ms. Mak says. Soon after came an episode that is the foodie equivalent of a starlet being discovered at the lunch counter in Schwab’s drugstore: the chef at Blue Hill, who lives in the neighborhood, happened by the flea market and tasted the sodas. Blue Hill soon became a wholesale client.For Ms. Mak and Mr. Ramos, a second career in carbonation was born.Brooklyn Soda Works has arrived at a time when “made in Brooklyn” foods, from borough-roasted Gorilla Coffee to homemade pies from Four & Twenty Blackbirds, are having a cultural moment. In fact, two local craft beer destinations, Beer Table in Park Slope and 61 Local in Cobble Hill, have each repurposed a beer line to put Brooklyn soda on tap.But the special selling point of the sodas — fresh ingredients — is also their limitation. The sodas have the shelf life of milk, about two weeks, Ms. Mak says. And the couple have made a deliberate decision to stay with fresh ingredients, keeping the brand limited and fairly local. That means they make frequent deliveries to their bar and restaurant clients. They have no plans, as yet, to sell to chain stores, but they might consider supplying a local artisanal food store.Even so, the company made money last year, the couple says. But so far, their sodanomics are not enough to retire on.Their sodas typically sell at the wholesale level for $80 a five-gallon keg. The pair can make more than twice as much per keg at the flea market, where they sell their soda at retail for $4 a glass.NOW the challenge is to scale up production and increase the number of wholesale clients, all while maintaining quality. The company has just hired its first three employees, to help make and sell soda.And, Ms. Mak says, they have just signed a new client, Untitled, the Danny Meyer restaurant that is to open this month in the Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan. But, she says, she was quick to tell the restaurant that the soda company was not yet at a point where it could supply other Meyer restaurants, like Union Square Cafe or the Shake Shack mini-chain.At the end of an evening of soda experiments, the couple’s kitchen is perfumed in a haze of peat and citrus peel. Ms. Mak takes the canister of cardamom apple ginger soda that she has just made and conducts a taste test.“This needs more work,” she says. “The cardamom has been beaten back by the ginger and the apple.”Mr. Ramos checks on the peat-smoked fruit experiment, taking the plums and lemon peel out of the pan and sniffing them. “It’s definitely peaty,” he says, pleased.Like single-malt Scotch whiskey, the Brooklyn sodas and their unusual flavors — grapefruit jalapeno honey, strawberry hops pink peppercorn and (go figure) maple bacon — attract a certain beverage cognoscenti. That kind of chemistry between consumer and consumed is no accident.“It’s an expensive product and we are making weird flavors,” Mr. Ramos acknowledges. “You can dumb it down or you can try to understand your niche and push harder into that niche.”'"

"'11-03-07,'0','But the fight over whether traditional gay neighborhoods should be preserved has taken on special significance here, because West Hollywood is not just a neighborhood — it is a city of 35,000 people with its own government, which repaves roads, builds public libraries and holds elections every two years.Mayor John Heilman said West Hollywood was going through an inevitable evolution as gay residents gained greater acceptance in society. The city’s gay population has aged and, he argued, its interests have changed. Gay residents are more likely to, say, have children and focus on family activities than stay out late at one of the gay clubs that dot Santa Monica Boulevard.“We still have the same number of gay people, but straight people now feel comfortable going into a gay area and socializing,” said Mr. Heilman, who is gay. “A lot of people are proud of their identity, but they’re not going out to bars all the time anymore. Their priorities have shifted as they’ve gotten older.”Don Reuter, the author of the book “Greetings from the Gayborhood,” said gay communities nationwide were experiencing the same cultural and demographic shifts — and backlashes against them — as West Hollywood has.“In every city I’ve been to, I hear people say, ‘I wish this neighborhood was what it used to be,’ ” Mr. Reuter said, adding, “But at the same time, the gay community was asking for acceptance, and what they’ve gotten is acceptance.”Since long before its founding in 1984, West Hollywood has offered a haven for social outsiders and illicit nightlife. During Prohibition, when it was a two-square-mile slice of unincorporated Los Angeles County, mobsters set up casinos and nightclubs where alcohol was served in back rooms beyond the reach of the Los Angeles police, and in the 1970s gay men started opening bars here.Today, West Hollywood, where an estimated 40 percent of residents are gay, is a boomtown. Amid a recession that has plunged so many governments into budget crises, West Hollywood has a surplus of more than $50 million. Crime rates are down drastically, and the city has embarked on a huge project to rebuild a public parking garage, a library and a park.Wendy Goldman, 58, who is straight and has lived in West Hollywood since its founding, said she was pleased with how the city had changed and was supporting the incumbents.“The city’s not what it used to be, it’s not as rough,” she said. “But thank God for that.”Yet those hoping to unseat the three incumbents argue that development has made West Hollywood less hospitable for those who have historically populated the city. Some point to a smoking ban on restaurant patios and to plans to replace a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center with a playground as evidence that the city is increasingly catering to middle-class families, rather than young people who want to let loose.“Some of the City Council members have abandoned West Hollywood as a place for adults, and are interested in attracting a more gentrified set of people to the city,” said John D’Amico, another challenger.Still, some of those who express nostalgia for the city’s wilder past hope that West Hollywood’s future can include them, as well.“There has been a shift in cultural values in the gay community,” said John Duran, a councilman who is not up for re-election this year and is supporting Mr. D’Amico. “Marriage by its nature is a conservative institution, which often brings children and monogamous relationships. But there are still glittering gay drag queens and pool-playing lesbians in this community. I’m hoping there is enough room in graying West Hollywood for both.”'"
"'11-03-07,'0','Rachael Maher, a math teacher in Charlotte, N.C., said she had experienced the difference between smaller and larger classes. She has watched her seventh-grade classes grow since her school system ran into budget trouble three years ago. Before, her classes averaged 25 students; this year they average 31.“They say it doesn’t affect whether kids get what they need, but I completely disagree,” Ms. Maher said. “If you’ve gained five kids, that’s five more papers to grade, five more kids who need makeup work if they’re absent, five more parents to contact, five more e-mails to answer. It gets overwhelming.”In Detroit, the authorities are so overwhelmed by financial troubles that they are debating a deficit-reduction proposal that would increase high school class sizes to 60 students. Michigan’s state superintendent of public instruction, Michael P. Flanagan, said that the plan was unlikely to be put into effect, but that “class sizes will be higher than you and I would like.”In New York City, average elementary class sizes have grown to 23.7 students from 21.8 since 2008, according to official data.In Utah, one of the few states that collect class size data each year, median class size has increased by several students in many grade levels since 2008. It now ranges from 22 students in kindergarten to 31 students in high school chemistry classes.“All the budget cuts have started our class sizes on that climb upward,” said Judy W. Park, associate superintendent of the State Office of Education in Utah. “During the last two years, our schools have really seen it.”Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said a number of surveys had shown that parents cared more about small classes than anything except school safety.But budget cuts are forcing schools to raise class sizes, putting those who advocate shrinking them on the defensive.Leonie Haimson, executive director of Class Size Matters, a group that presses for smaller classes in New York and nationally, said many states enacted policies limiting student numbers during the late 1980s and 1990s.“But now, in the majority of states, you’re seeing definite increases in class sizes because of the recession and budget cuts,” Ms. Haimson said. “Unfortunately we’ve also seen the rise of a narrative that’s become dominant in education reform that insists that class size doesn’t matter.”Research that convinced many policy makers of the benefits of small classes was conducted in Tennessee.Helen Bain, who served as the president of the nation’s largest teachers union in the 1970s, became a strong advocate for the idea. When she was a seventh-grade teacher early in her career, Ms. Bain recalled, her students learned quickly in classes of 15 or 20 students, but less effectively as class sizes grew.“When it got to 35, I told the principal, ‘I can’t teach this many children,’ ” she said.In the 1980s, Ms. Bain persuaded Tennessee lawmakers to finance a study comparing classes of 13 to 17 students in kindergarten through third grade with classes of 22 to 25 students. The smaller classes significantly outscored the larger classes on achievement tests.In the decades since, researchers, including the Princeton economist Alan Krueger, have conducted studies that they say confirm and strengthen the validity of the Tennessee findings.Others, including Eric Hanushek, a Stanford economist, have argued that the impact of small classes on achievement has been exaggerated and that giving students a skillful teacher is more cost-effective.Those who support that notion include Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who last Sunday told governors gathered in Washington to consider paying bonuses to the best teachers to take on extra students.Mr. Duncan said he would prefer to put his own school-age children in a classroom with 28 students led by a “fantastic teacher” than in one with 23 and a “mediocre” teacher.Bill Gates made a similar argument to the governors, portraying the movement to reduce class sizes as one of the most expensive and fruitless efforts in American education.The federal Department of Education collects nationwide class size data every few years, and the average has declined steadily for half a century. In 1961, the average elementary school class had 29 students, and the average high school class had 28. In 2007-8, the most recent year with data, the elementary school average was 20, and the high school average was 23.4.Dr. Roza, who is an adviser to Mr. Gates, said she had measured a recent decline of half a percent in the total number of employees in American public education. “That’s meant some growth,” she said, but average class sizes have not ballooned.“Maybe the national average went up one kid,” Dr. Roza said. “But I don’t think we’ve jumped to 30 kids per class.”The nationwide movement to shrink classes dates to the early 1980s, when Texas passed a law limiting class sizes, to 22 students in elementary grades. Tennessee followed with class-size reduction measures for the early grades.In 1996, California lawmakers approved a measure to reduce class sizes to 20 for kindergarten through third grade. Today, more than 30 states have some form of programs to reduce class sizes.But many have been challenged since the recession.In Texas, the state comptroller in December proposed loosening the class size limit, saying it could save $558 million in teacher salaries. That proposal has found backers in a Legislature that is weighing $10 billion in cuts from public education over two years, but teachers and parent groups are outraged.In California, which has spent about $20 billion on a class-size reduction program, state officials deferred financing for it in 2009 and reduced penalties to districts that allowed average classes to grow above the limits.In Florida, where voters in 2002 approved a ballot initiative amending the State Constitution to cap elementary classes at 18 students and high schools at 25, the authorities are struggling with those limits.“If an elementary gets a 19th student during the year, they have to hire a teacher and split the class, and that makes no sense,” said Wayne Blanton, executive director of the Florida School Boards Association.In November, a ballot initiative that asked voters to repeal class-size limits won a majority, but it fell short of the 60 percent required to overturn a constitutional amendment.As of late last year, Florida school districts had accumulated $41 million in penalties for exceeding the caps. Palm Beach County’s penalty alone totaled $16.6 million.This year districts have been appealing the penalties, and state officials have reduced many. Florida lawmakers are debating ways of giving school systems more flexibility without violating the law.'"
"'11-03-07,'0','The N.F.L.’s labor negotiations resume Monday with optimism that Commissioner Roger Goodell and the union leader, DeMaurice Smith, whose stature among wary owners has grown in recent days, are committed to making a deal and avoiding a legal fight that could imperil the regular season.But the hope that the N.F.L. might avert an all-out labor war is tempered by a dose of reality: the two sides remain so far apart on the economic issues at the core of the negotiation — how to divide annual revenue and a new rookie compensation system — that it seems unlikely a deal could be finished by the Friday deadline.The hope, say people involved in negotiations, is that enough progress could be made by the end of the week on the key elements necessary to start a new league year — what the salary cap will be, what the rules of free agency are and what the rookie compensation model will look like — that the sides could then firm up the rest of the details in another week to 10 days. The league would then resume off-season business as usual, with free agency likely to open just past mid-March.Negotiators will have to regain momentum they began to make on key issues last Wednesday and Thursday. The momentum was halted, in part, late Thursday afternoon when it was made clear that at least some people on the union side were prepared to go to court to begin the decertification process unless a 24-hour extension was immediately agreed to.But even the extensions did not come easily, with both players and owners said to be losing patience with the long, tiring process. Goodell had to twist the arms of some of the more hawkish members of the owners’ labor committee to convince them to accept one of the extensions, much as Smith has had to manage those in the union who preferred to take the fight to court.'"
"'11-03-07,'0','In “Don’t End Agricultural Subsidies. Fix Them.” (column, March 2), Mark Bittman says that if all Americans ate their recommended five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, there wouldn’t be enough to meet the need.If Americans didn’t “need” Dunkin’ Donuts or Pepsi, eventually that supply would diminish. The sad truth is that Americans demand junk food, and until nutrition trumps quick and tasty and cheap, carrots will rot while the cookie jar empties.Instead of criticizing the way subsidies are now distributed and pushing farmers to grow foods Americans don’t want, Mr. Bittman might want to focus on the economics of nutritive demand.So, our bad dietary habits are the fault of foolish government, greedy farmers and malevolent agribusiness.Is Mark Bittman myopic to the remarkable achievements of a food system that does so much for so many people for relatively little? Agriculture does have its challenges, like the need to double food production in the next 40 years to meet the needs of a world population that will rise from seven billion to nine billion. And this with less arable land, water limitations and the need to protect the environment.Will we do it by subsidizing small and medium family farms? Unlikely!'"
"'11-03-07,'0','“There have been nearly a hundred competitive tablets that have been introduced since the iPad,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “But it seems that no one has eclipsed or even matched Apple on pricing.”Analysts and industry experts point to a number of reasons. Primarily, they say, Apple’s deep pockets — a staggering $60 billion in cash reserves — have allowed it to form strategic partnerships with other companies to buy large supplies of components; for example, expensive flash memory. By doing this, the company probably secures a lower price from suppliers, ensuring a lower manufacturing cost.At the same time, they say, Apple has sidestepped high licensing fees for other items it needs, like the A4 and A5 processors within the iPads. Those parts, designed in-house at Apple by a company that Apple bought, are among the costlier components needed to make a tablet computer.Mr. Sacconaghi said Apple also could subsidize some of the cost of building iPads with the money it makes through its App Store, which generates more than a billion dollars each year. This means that Apple can take a lower profit margin on the iPad, 25 percent, than it does on, for example, the iPhone, which can yield as much as 50 percent profit.Yet another advantage is Apple’s wide net of its own global retail shops and online stores; for customers, this means they can avoid a markup from a third party like Best Buy.Although other companies have some of these factors in their favor, no one but Apple has all of them.Steven P. Jobs, chief executive of Apple, who took the stage during the Apple press event Wednesday in San Francisco to announce the iPad 2, made a not-so-discreet swipe at rivals.Is 2011, he asked, “going to be the year of the copycats?”“Most of these tablets are not even catching up to our first iPad,” he said.For example, like Apple, Samsung cuts costs for making its Galaxy Tab, a seven-inch tablet, because it builds many of the components itself. And like many other tablet makers, Samsung relies on the Android mobile operating system, which Google makes available free. Even so, the Galaxy can cost as much as $549 without a contract for cellular service.“Just because a company sources internally doesn’t ensure that they get the best pricing on components,” said Rhoda Alexander, an analyst at IHS iSuppli, a research firm. “It doesn’t necessarily guarantee efficiency from a cost perspective.”Justin Denison, vice president for strategy at Samsung, said that in the United States, the company relegates device pricing to its carrier partners, but that he was not worried that the cost of the Galaxy, which has received generally glowing reviews, might turn prospective buyers away.He said the company was “quite happy” with early sales of the device, which it pegs at two million, adding that “consumers will decide for themselves whether the price is worth it.”But adding to the challenge for Samsung and most other tablet makers is that they rely on third parties like Best Buy to sell the devices. Apple’s retail and online stores help eliminate this problem.“You don’t see a markup in the same way a retailer would mark up an item, so it reduces that particular margin,” said Shane Greenstein, a professor at Northwestern University’s graduate business school.Shelling out billions of dollars to build glossy retail stores or to make investments in chip processors is not an option for a smaller company like Motorola, which recently spun its mobile devices business into its own independent sector. Motorola’s Xoom, a tablet with a 10-inch screen, a dual processor and front- and rear-facing cameras, costs $800 in the United States without a two-year contract with a wireless carrier. That’s roughly $70 more than the equivalent 32-gigabyte iPad 2 outfitted with both Wi-Fi and 3G functions.Alain Mutricy, a senior vice president for mobile devices at Motorola, defended the pricing of the Xoom, pointing to the tablet’s extensive memory, high-resolution display and compatibility with Verizon’s 4G LTE network, to which Xoom owners will be able to upgrade free, as justification for the price tag.“The Xoom is priced exactly where it has to be,” he said.Mr. Mutricy said he did not think the company would do anything differently to trim costs.“It’s not that we are trying to lower the price and cannot,” he said. “We are pricing the Xoom based on what we are offering consumers.”But he said that Motorola was planning to expand its line of tablets in the future that would most likely include smaller, lightweight options with a lower retail cost.Huawei, a Chinese hardware manufacturer, has said it hopes to press into the United States market later this year with the S7 Slim, a svelte, rectangular machine running Android on a 7-inch display and a 1-gigahertz processor, for $300.Ross Gan, the worldwide head of corporate communications at Huawei, said the company cut costs by using a modest marketing campaign.“We didn’t set our margins based on massive advertising campaigns,” he said in a recent interview.Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst with Forrester Research, predicted that pricing would become increasingly important in the tablet market because as more options appeared — particularly cheaper, no-name Android-powered tablets — shoppers would want to pay less.“Consumers expect that over time, electronics get cheaper,” she said. “They’re seeing all these other devices in the market and not necessarily distinguishing between processor speeds. There’s a huge variation in price and power but from a distance, they all look like 7-inch touch screens.”Over time, analysts say, efficiency in production will help bring down costs for competitors.But the market will be hypercompetitive until then, said Ms. Alexander of IHS iSuppli.“The iPad may continue to own the market if competitors don’t get more realistic on their pricing,” she said. “Right now, it’s too high relative to what the iPad has for the product.”'"
"'11-03-07,'0','The recent spike in oil prices has given Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil producer, and its neighbors more scope for handouts and subsidies, part of a longstanding tradition of trading cash for domestic peace.As protests have spread across the Arab world, the Persian Gulf countries have opened their wallets more than usual.King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia last month announced $37 billion worth of pay raises, unemployment checks and other benefits. The king of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, offered 1,000 dinars, about $2,600, for each family. In January, the government of Kuwait said each citizen would receive the equivalent of $3,500. And last week the sultan of Oman decreed that anyone without a job would be eligible for a monthly stipend of $375.But in Bahrain and Oman, monetary concessions have yet to assuage protesters.More than 100,000 people — about one in five Bahraini citizens — joined a protest in Manama on Friday where many shouted “Down, Down Hamad!” The king’s family, which is Sunni, has ruled the Shiite-majority country for more than two centuries.Smaller protests have also continued in Sohar, a northern industrial city in Oman, which is ruled by Sultan Qaboos bin Said.“Poor people took the money, but are still insisting on getting political reform,” said Abdul Jalil Khalil Ebrahim, a senior member of Wefaq, the largest opposition party in Bahrain.Mr. Ebrahim says future payments in Bahrain by regional governments will be diminished by corruption and may not reach the people who need them. In addition, the cash does not address the central demands of protesters — for democracy.“They are throwing slogans to absorb the anger of people,” Mr. Ebrahim said of the government, which is controlled by Bahrain’s royal family. “But the core of this is political, not financial.”In response to e-mailed questions, Maysoon Sabkar, a spokeswoman for Bahrain’s government, said that support from the gulf countries and the initiative to create jobs at the Interior Ministry were “not aimed at ending protests in Bahrain, but they do form part of an overall program to make necessary improvements for the benefit of all.”Ms. Sabkar reiterated that the government’s main focus was a proposal for a national dialogue.The opposition has refused to negotiate until the government, led by the king’s uncle, Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, steps down. The prime minister has been in power 40 years.The opposition says it plans to ratchet up pressure on the government in the coming weeks. The protests have damaged tourism and the financial industry, said Mr. Sharif, the former banker, who now heads a secular opposition party known as Wa’ad.“We will see every week another activity that will take the momentum higher,” Mr. Sharif said in an interview on Sunday. “We are attacking peacefully all the institutions of the state.”'"

"'11-03-08,'1','The number of companies listed in the United States on Nasdaq peaked at 5,556 in 1996 but declined to about 2,852 by the end of 2009, according to the World Federation of Exchanges. On the Big Board, domestic listings fell to 2,327 by 2009 after peaking at 3,025 in 1999.So the traditional American exchanges have been diversifying into businesses beyond stocks, like trading in derivatives and supplying technology to other exchanges.In fact, trading of stocks, including revenue from trading, listings and providing data on the equity markets, accounted for 56 percent of the Big Board’s revenue in the third quarter of 2010, compared with 71 percent just five years ago, according to the Tabb Group, a market advisory group.In addition to their push overseas, the Big Board and Nasdaq are trying aggressively to steal listings from each other, in hopes of making up listing and trading fees lost to their upstart competitors. They are rolling out a range of nontrading services for the first time — and offering lucrative inducements for companies willing to switch.“Several years ago, you listed here because of the patina that this was simply the place where the biggest companies went,” said Scott Cutler, head of the Big Board’s listings. “It was like a utility. The N.Y.S.E. didn’t actually pitch as intensively. Today, that is just not sufficient. We are head to head on several deals.”Nasdaq made gains from 2005 to 2009, persuading companies like the News Corporation, Vodafone and Mattel to transfer to its exchange — bringing with them their roughly $200 billion in combined market value.That compares with $64 billion in market capitalization that went the other way, in the Big Board’s favor, during the same period, according to figures from the Issuer Advisory Group, which advises companies on where to list their shares.Last year, however, the Big Board fought back, winning $37 billion in market value to Nasdaq’s $10 billion, its biggest yearly gain since 2002. It did so by offering new clients like Charles Schwab and Knight Capital services such as Washington lobbying and public relations. It also won the first switch of 2011, persuading IMAX to move from Nasdaq.“The New York Stock Exchange is working harder than ever before, and is clearly coming up with some imaginative solutions,” said Patrick J. Healy, chief executive of the Issuer Advisory Group. “Nasdaq cleaned New York’s clock for a few years, but 2010 was a strong win for New York,” he said.During the 1990s and early 2000s, almost all switches went from Nasdaq to the Big Board, in what was seen as a sign of maturity for technology companies and others that initially went public on the Nasdaq. That changed in the middle of the last decade, when a new regulatory rule meant that companies wanting to leave the Big Board no longer had to win approval from two-thirds of their shareholders.Another rule change in 2007 meant that companies leaving the Big Board could take their prized trading symbols with them, just as cellphone customers can take their telephone number to another carrier. The Big Board had resisted that change.Bruce Aust, who has run Nasdaq’s listing business since 2003, said Nasdaq became attractive to companies as they realized that its faster electronic systems were handling more and more trading volume for shares listed on the Big Board, where trading was traditionally done by traders on the floor.That led some companies to view Nasdaq as a more liquid market, and a more lucrative one, though it has also lost some of its own volume to younger electronic exchanges trying to beat Nasdaq at its own game.As computers have taken over trading of stocks in the last few years, they have given rise to new electronic exchanges in places as diverse as Kansas City, Mo., and Jersey City, N.J. Today, stock trading has become so fragmented that neither the Big Board nor Nasdaq dominates the trading of the shares they list.Even so, where a public company is listed still matters, because the bulk of the trading for a particular company’s stock occurs on its home exchange.As part of its offensive to steal listings from others, Nasdaq began helping its clients with investor relations. It hosts webcasts for company reports and provides a newswire that companies can use to send out announcements. Another service helps companies learn more about who is buying and selling their shares.The most visible support services are focused on marketing, including publicity on Nasdaq’s big screen in Times Square. When Tesla Motors introduced its shares on Nasdaq last year, for example, it promoted its fleet of cars in front of Nasdaq’s headquarters there.“We give companies tower time when they ring the opening bell,” Mr. Aust said. He said Nasdaq was now in the business of helping companies with their branding, providing “great visibility for a public company.”For the biggest companies, the cost of listing remains higher on the Big Board than on the Nasdaq. The fee, determined by the size of the company, is capped at $500,000 annually on the Big Board and $100,000 a year on the Nasdaq, although the Big Board says about 80 percent of its listed companies pay less than $200,000.Mr. Cutler of the Big Board said his exchange’s recent turnaround had been due in part to a new focus on attracting top technology firms, a traditional stronghold of the Nasdaq. This year, for example, the exchange won the initial public offering of Demand Media, which runs Web sites like eHow and Answerbag; in 2009, it lured Juniper Networks, the network equipment maker, from the Nasdaq.Several industry analysts say it is no coincidence that before Juniper’s switch was announced, the Big Board signed a multimillion-dollar contract with Juniper for an upgrade to the exchange’s data centers, as part of its own modernization to more electronic trading.Both the Big Board and Juniper declined to comment directly, although Juniper said in a statement that the Big Board’s “brand and global presence make it a natural place for Juniper to be listed.”The Big Board is still the world’s largest stock exchange by market capitalization, with more than 2,000 listed companies in the United States alone that employ 30 million people. At the end of 2009, it had a further 1,160 in its Euronext operations in Europe. Nasdaq, by contrast, has 3,600 company listings globally that employ 12.3 million people.The Big Board is learning to exploit its size advantage. When Rosetta Stone, a provider of language-learning software, listed its shares in 2009, the Big Board sent a direct mail on the company’s behalf to all chief executives of companies it listed, extending a special offer on business software, a market that Rosetta Stone was trying to break into.'"
"'11-03-08,'1','TRIPOLI, Libya — As wealthier nations send boats and planes to rescue their citizens from the violence in Libya, a new refugee crisis is taking shape on the outskirts of Tripoli, where thousands of migrant workers from sub-Saharan Africa have been trapped with scant food and water, no international aid and little hope of escape.The migrants — many of them illegal immigrants from Ghana and Nigeria who have long constituted an impoverished underclass in Libya — live amid piles of garbage, sleep in makeshift tents of blankets strung from fences and trees, and breathe fumes from a trench of excrement dividing their camp from the parking lot of Tripoli’s airport.For dinner on Monday night two men killed a scrawny, half-plucked chicken by dunking it in water boiled on a garbage fire, then hacked it apart with a dull knife and cooked it over an open fire. Some residents of the camp are as young as Essem Ighalo, 9 days old, who arrived on his second day of life and has yet to see a doctor. Many refugees said they had seen deaths from hunger and disease every night.The airport refugees, along with tens of thousands of other African migrants lucky enough to make it across the border to Tunisia, are the most desperate contingent of a vast exodus that has already sent almost 200,000 foreigners fleeing the country since the outbreak of the popular revolt against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi nearly three weeks ago.Dark-skinned Africans say the Libyan war has caught them in a vise. The heavily armed police and militia forces loyal to Colonel Qaddafi who guard checkpoints along the roads around the capital rob them of their money, possessions and cellphone chips, the migrants say. And the Libyans who oppose Colonel Qaddafi lash out at the African migrants because they look like the dark-skinned mercenaries many here say the Libyan leader has recruited to crush the uprising.“Qaddafi has brought African soldiers to kill some of them, so if they see black people they beat them,” said Samson Adda, 31, who said residents of Zawiyah, a rebellious city, had beaten him so badly that he could no longer walk.Sub-Saharan Africans make up a vast majority of the estimated 1.5 million illegal immigrants among Libya’s population of 6.5 million, according to the International Organization for Migration. Many were desperately poor people made even more so by investments of up to $1,000 each to pay smugglers to bring them across Libya’s southern border for a chance at better work in its oil economy.Their flight has emptied the streets of thousands of day laborers who played a crucial, if largely unheralded, role in sustaining Libya’s economy. Their absence has played a role in halting construction projects that had been rising across the skyline.They are trapped in part because most lack passports or other documents necessary to board a plane or cross the border. Few can afford a plane ticket. They say they are afraid to leave the airport or try their luck on the roads to the border for fear of assaults by Libyan citizens or at militia checkpoints.They complain bitterly of betrayal by their home governments, which have failed to help evacuate them even as Egyptian, Bangladeshi and Chinese migrant workers who crowded the airport a week ago have found a way out.And international aid workers, who have raced to minister to the hundreds of thousands camped on the borders, say the migrants trapped at the airport remain beyond their reach. The Libyan government’s tight security and the threat of violence on the streets of Tripoli have apparently prevented any international aid groups from reaching the makeshift camps.“We are operating out of Benghazi,” said Jean-Philippe Chauzy of the International Organization for Migration, referring to the eastern Libyan city that is the headquarters of the rebellion. “But unfortunately because of the conditions we can’t help them out of Tripoli.”The outbreak of violence in Tripoli around Feb. 20 sent migrants of all kinds fleeing for the airport. Until recently, desperate hordes of all nationalities were sleeping packed together on the floors of the terminals or in the fields and parking lots outside. Guards with whips and clubs beat them back to clear the entrance.'"
"'11-03-08,'1','With negotiations toward a new collective bargaining agreement reopening on Monday, progress could hinge on the willingness of N.F.L. owners to share more financial information with players this week.Players have long maintained that they wanted detailed proof of why owners were seeking an additional $1 billion off the top of the revenue pool, above the $1 billion they already receive, and players’ demand for owners to open their books became a cornerstone of their negotiating strategy.Until now, the league has resisted that request, saying that players had all the information they needed to understand what owners contend is a squeeze on their bottom lines created by rising player costs and by those associated with upkeep and construction of stadiums.Owners have moved off the $1 billion demand, but the sides remain far apart on how they would divide annual revenue, with some estimates putting the difference as high as $750 million.The N.F.L. and the players union resumed negotiations Monday afternoon, meeting for about four hours, before breaking into individual sessions during the night.The sides will reconvene with the federal mediator George Cohen on Tuesday morning, the 13th day of mediated negotiations. The current deadline for the expiration of the labor deal is the end of Friday, although if progress is being made, another extension could be in the offing and is likely to be encouraged by Cohen.In addition to the revenue split, the union and owners must hammer out a new rookie compensation model. But according to one person with knowledge of the negotiations, if both sides are willing to compromise on money for the rookie pool and the salary cap, there are no other major obstacles in the way of a new deal.'"

"'11-03-08,'1','“Cheap, Ultrafast Broadband? At Least Hong Kong Has It,” by Randall Stross (Digital Domain column, Sunday Business, March 6), did not mention what Verizon offers consumers and businesses that Hong Kong Broadband Network — along with our cable competitors — does not.Unlike Hong Kong Broadband, which serves one city, Verizon delivers advanced broadband, wireless voice and data, and interactive television to thousands of markets from coast to coast.While we offer the fastest consumer broadband speeds in America with our 150-megabit service, we also deliver integrated broadband and first-of-a-kind, interactive television services that provide customers with benefits that go far beyond just “speed.”Mr. Stross’s focus on a single price point for a single service overlooks the fact that a bundle of Verizon services delivers high-value experiences that American consumers demand.Verizon has invested more than $50 billion over the past three years in 4G LTE wireless, all-fiber-optic and global IP networks. Artificially bringing “multiple competitors into the picture” and “regulatory changes,” as suggested by Mr. Stross, would discourage future investments by us and by our competitors.'"

He was 64.His death was confirmed by NASA. The cause was complications of liver cancer, according to The Houston Chronicle.Mr. Lounge, a decorated Navy pilot, joined the astronaut corps in 1980 and flew his first mission aboard the shuttle Discovery in 1985. His second came in 1988, also aboard the Discovery. It was the first shuttle mission after the Challenger blew up during launching. His last flight was on the Columbia in 1990.In all, Mr. Lounge logged 20 days in space before leaving the astronaut corps to become director of space shuttle and space station program development for Boeing-NASA Systems.John Michael Lounge was born June 28, 1946, in Denver. A 1969 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, he earned a master’s degree in astrogeophysics from the University of Colorado in 1970.Mr. Lounge flew 99 combat missions during the Vietnam War and won six Navy Air Medals.Survivors include a son, Kenneth; two daughters, Shannon and Kathy; and three grandchildren.'"
"'11-03-08,'1','“I said, ‘O.K., that girl is the real deal, someone I would like to work with,’ ” he said.This was last October, and McEnroe was getting ahead of himself. Ingrid had come from Rochester, Minn., to his academy at the Sportime club on Randalls Island, which was created last year with the goal of developing tennis players in his unorthodox image.McEnroe believes that Florida’s live-in tennis academies have created an assembly-line sameness to America’s young players and have contributed to the country’s inability to produce big winners on the men’s and women’s professional tours.In starting the academy, he envisioned talented boys and girls from not only the New York metropolitan area but also from around the country and even abroad coming with their families to “the most stimulating city in the world” to lead normal lives while learning to embrace their individuality and creativity in a sport that demands it at the very highest levels.Thus far, McEnroe’s academy has mainly attracted New York-area players. Even Ingrid Neel has a local connection. Her mother, Hildy, grew up on Long Island, a McEnroe fan and trained for college tennis (at Long Island University) at the Port Washington Tennis Academy years after the young McEnroe’s time there. One of her instructors was Claude Okin, the managing partner of Sportime New York, which teamed with McEnroe to create a stay-at-home urban alternative to Florida’s live-in tennis academies.After reading about their initiative, Hildy Neel contacted Okin, offering Ingrid’s truncated biography: took up tennis at 6; progressed quickly to the point where she was too good for girls her age; is ranked first in her section in the 18-and-under group; and recently created a stir in upper Midwest tennis circles by announcing she would compete this year against boys.“John was such the quintessential New Yorker and a tennis genius,” Hildy Neel said. “I thought that there was the potential that he and Ingrid would connect.”If being a natural iconoclast was not enough to make Ingrid Neel the dream McEnroe student, there was also the flattering disclosure that she had patterned her approach to the game after his. In an era of determined baseline slugging, Neel watched McEnroe on video and was fascinated by his knack for taking the ball on the rise, his attacking style and his contortionist’s ability to hit volleys and half-volleys of all angles.“I always laugh when he’s approaching because he does this little hop,” she said. “But I loved the way he played because my favorite part of tennis is coming to the net. When I go to Florida and other places to play and I come in, a lot of my opponents don’t expect that because they never see it.”Hildy Neel said Ingrid — who, unlike McEnroe, is right-handed — was never instructed to move forward.“How you play tennis is a reflection of your personality,” Hildy Neel said. “That’s what she would do when she was little — hit and move in. She would always play in no man’s land, and her coach would never say, ‘Back off.’ That takes a certain attitude, and that’s what she and John seem to share.”After hitting it off with McEnroe, Ingrid had a recent encore visit, accompanied by her mother and her coach, Brian Christensen. Over several days, she participated in a variety of academy programs — directed by Gilad Bloom, a former pro tour player from Israel — and attended the night of renewed rivalries at Madison Square Garden that pitted McEnroe against Ivan Lendl.Much to his disgust, McEnroe retired with an injury from the pro set while ahead, affirming the still depressing notion that athletic glory will from here on be achieved vicariously, hopefully with someone like the young and precocious Ingrid as his protégée.“It would be ironic if I coached a girl to be the best, or one of the best, whatever,” he said.Attracting sponsors (beyond Nike) to underwrite his academy has been a problem thus far, but there has been no shortage of local parents willing to have the ever-irascible McEnroe lecture their offspring about their critical first step toward the ball.Last summer, McEnroe and his staff awarded full and part-time scholarships from a field of several hundred players attending an open tryout. One of the beneficiaries, Sabrina Xiong of Queens, the 12-year-old daughter of Chinese immigrants, recently won a sectional tournament.Yet McEnroe knows that his academy will pose no threat to the brand names of tennis instruction — the IMG Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Bradenton, Fla. and the United States Tennis Association programs run by his brother Patrick — until it lands its share of the most gifted and talented players like Neel.“We have an overqualified staff right now, no question,” McEnroe said. “I guess I have to look at this as a longer-term thing, find the kids who want to come here, whose families agree with my concept, if you want to call it that.”McEnroe’s belief is that the American system has churned out baseline huggers overdosing on topspin. He said that they play too much tennis when they would be better off working harder in shorter periods of time and developing other interests, including different sports.Likewise, Hildy Neel prefers that Ingrid’s life, at this stage, not be dominated by tennis. Although Ingrid has won national and international tournaments, she plays ice hockey and piano while attending a Rochester middle school.Hildy Neel said the family focus had been less on building a national ranking and more on allowing Ingrid to experiment tactically — especially given the likelihood that she has a fair amount of growing to do. Hildy Neel is almost 5 feet 8 inches and her husband, Bryan, is 6-0.“I really believe that until you pass puberty you can’t overtrain,” Hildy Neel said. “It does more harm than good. But living in Minnesota, where the competition is not cutthroat, Ingrid was good enough to be endorsed for national events without having to only play a baseline game.”During one of Ingrid’s recent sessions with Bloom, McEnroe arrived to have another look and noticed a man sitting by the side of the court.“Are you the father?” he asked.Christensen stood up and said, “I’m the coach.”McEnroe offered a hand and said: “Good job, man. She’s beautiful to watch.”Christensen, 50, masked his excitement over meeting the man whose poster from his 2002 autobiography, “You Cannot Be Serious,” hangs in his basement.“We kind of modeled her after you,” Christensen said.“Well,” McEnroe said with a crooked smile, “now I know why you did such a good job.”It all sounded like the beginning of happily-ever-after, but it wasn’t, not yet. Hildy Neel said that although she had family in New York, moving to such an expensive city would present financial challenges to continue the comfortable lifestyle the Neels have in Minnesota.In addition, they have spent time at the Bollettieri academy, leaving Hildy Neel with the impression that her family “could live off the grounds and still have a normal life.”But what McEnroe is offering is living large — in New York as well as at the net.“They work at the net more than any other program,” Hildy Neel said. “We came back to develop a little bit more of a relationship with Gilad and John and to figure out if we did decide to come to New York what this would look like.“We do have time to make a decision, but we are going to have to make one, probably within two years. Ingrid is running out of competition in Minnesota.”McEnroe would argue that there is no more competitive and stimulating a place than New York. And that if Ingrid can make it through a session with him, she can make it anywhere.'"
"'11-03-08,'1','You know you have reached some sort of weird nadir in a season when the biggest question of the weekend is whether the Miami Heat players were crying in their locker room after Sunday’s loss.Not that epic silliness is unusual in the N.B.A., or anywhere else misguided millionaires in their 20s abound, and the Heat is a logical candidate, having become circus ring No. 1 when LeBron James drove his tent pole into the sand. But, as Dave Hyde writes in The Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, that tent pole is getting a bit shaky. Not only has the Heat lost four straight, James has had the potentially winning shot in his hand four times in the past 11 days, and missed them all. Dwyane Wade is still proclaiming solidarity, even when making clear his annoyance that James keeps taking and missing potential game-winners.Yahoo.com’s Adrian Wojnarowski believes a growing wedge between Wade and James is the most compelling part of this, but the rest of the world has fixated on the question of tears. Coach Eric Spoelstra, who apparently attended the LeBron School of Image Mismanagement, was trying to draw sympathy by describing his players in tears after the game, but succeeded in attracting ridicule, even if Israel Gutierrez of The Miami Herald writes that they truly are miserable. The flip side is the joy this has created among those rooting heartily against James’s wayward-shooting gang, which includes SI.com’s Joe Posnanski.In the West, the Lakers are enjoying the opposite experience of the Heat with a crushing victory over San Antonio, but Billy Witz writes on Foxsports.com, that they managed to make themselves less lovable in the process. There’s a lot of that going around.In golf, Rory Sabbatini is trying to move his lovable meter in the other direction. Not only did he win the Honda Classic Sunday, he took pains last week to distance himself from previous obnoxious behavior and explain why he had such a tough season in 2010 (his wife had a difficult birth of their child; he had skin cancer). It did not save him from being quickly lampooned on Twitter by his fellow pro Ian Poulter.'"
"'11-03-08,'1','“I went through all kinds of emotional stages,” Chardy told French reporters. “Thankfully there was Guy. He really helped me on the chair. It was really a difficult match. Sometimes, I had the impression that — forehands, backhands — I wasn’t too much in control of what I was doing. But today, the victory was what was important, not the manner of the victory.”Guy would be Guy Forget, the longtime French Davis Cup captain who has been oft-maligned since his team was beaten by Serbia in the final last year. His lineup selections in that match were questioned and, leading to this tie, he was called out by a key player, Gilles Simon, in an interview. Simon maintained that he had asked Forget not to talk to him about his game during matches because they had different visions of what constituted Simon’s best tennis.But despite all the downbeat patter, this turned into a reaffirming round for Forget, an animated courtside presence who managed to push just enough right buttons to get France into the quarterfinals despite the absence of its three top players: the injured Gaël Monfils, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Richard Gasquet.The best move was calling up Chardy, a former Wimbledon junior champion who reached the fourth round at the French Open in 2008 but had not won a match on tour since October and had never played a Davis Cup singles match that mattered until he upset the Austrian No. 1, Jürgen Melzer, in straight sets Friday.It was not as if Forget did not have more established options in singles, including Michaël Llodra. But Forget took his latest risk and was rewarded with attacking brilliance from Chardy on Friday and a second victory Sunday after Simon failed to hold a lead against Melzer in the first reverse singles match and ended up being beaten, 6-0, in the fifth.“The strength of French tennis is being able to count on a really large group of players,” Forget said. “A Davis Cup campaign is not won with four players but with six or seven.”Depth is indeed helpful in this injury-riddled era, giving the fortunate captains options no matter what the surface. There was a time when playing host to the Spanish on a quick indoor court would have been enough to destabilize them. But their players are all-surface terrors now, and the world No. 1, Rafael Nadal, back in action for the first time since injuring his leg at the Australian Open, felt eager enough against the Belgians indoors in Charleroi to agree to play singles Sunday after Spain had clinched victory the day before.A dead rubber — the evocative Davis Cup term for a meaningless match — is not traditional No. 1 territory, but Nadal clearly wanted playing time before flying to the United States for the Indian Wells tournament that will begin this week. And if all goes according to plan, he will fly back to the United States again after Wimbledon for Spain’s quarterfinal match in July, quite possibly in Andy Roddick’s home city, Austin, Tex.Neither Nadal nor Roddick played Davis Cup last year, but they have recommitted, and Roddick was the one who had to dig the deepest in the opening round: requiring four sets to get through both his singles matches in Chile on his least favorite surface, clay, against men ranked far below him, Nicolas Massu and Paul Capdeville. Roddick is now 12-0 when he has had an opportunity to clinch a Cup victory.United States versus Spain looks like the pick of the quarterfinals, with Serbia’s match in Sweden also promising if Novak Djokovic returns to the Serbian lineup and Robin Soderling remains in Sweden’s. France will travel to Germany, perhaps without Chardy or Simon, and Kazakhstan will travel to Argentina.This is Kazakhstan’s first year at the Davis Cup’s elite level, and it advanced by taking out Tomas Berdych and the Czech Republic on the road in Ostrava. With the Kazakhs behind, 1-2, heading into Sunday, Andrey Golubev upset Berdych with a barrage of winners, and Kukushkin then defeated Jan Hajek in four sets in the fifth match.Kukushkin, like the other three members of his team, once represented Russia but was recruited by Kazakhstan, a central Asian nation whose president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has made tennis a priority. Kukushkin and his teammates switched nationalities, in part, because they were struggling to break into the Russian Davis Cup lineup and attract sponsorship and support. But the Davis Cup works in mysterious ways, and while Kazakhstan is in the quarterfinals, Russia — without its leaders, Nikolay Davydenko and Mikhail Youzhny — could not find a way past Sweden.'"

"'11-03-09,'1','Four of the country's six largest banks are lining up to raise red flags about the planned merger of the parent companies of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, saying the country risks losing clout as a financial centre.The public opposition from some of the biggest users of the country's stock exchanges is a big blow to TMX Group Inc., which last month announced its plan to combine with the London Stock Exchange Group Plc to create the one of the world's largest exchange companies.The banks plan to lay out their concerns this week in a public letter. The wording of the letter, tentatively titled ""Let's build on a Canadian success story,"" has not been finalized, nor has the list of signatories, but sources said Tuesday that the banks that were on side as of then included Toronto-Dominion Bank, which is co-ordinating the effort, as well as Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada.TD declined to comment on its role. One bank that's notably absent is RBC, whose CEO Gord Nixon has been a public supporter of the exchange merger.Some smaller brokerage firms, including GMP Capital Inc., AltaCorp. Capital, Canaccord Financial Inc. and ITG Canada, are also being asked to sign the letter. Some may not, sources said.""Toronto's hopes to be a global financial services hub could suffer a severe and potentially irreversible setback,"" the draft of the letter is said to read.""Proponents of the proposed LSE takeover of the TMX believe this transaction represents Canada's only choice to create a globally sustainable exchange,"" the draft letter adds. ""They are wrong. The TMX is already a viable global entity.""The four big banks are united in their concerns. However there is said to be ""degrees of opposition"" among the banks, said a person familiar with the situation. For example, TD is expected to take a hard-line stance against the deal, while CIBC has said a merger could proceed with more conditions to protect Canada.The TMX-LSE plan has already run into skepticism from Canadian politicians, including Ontario Finance Minister Dwight Duncan, amid concern that it will lead to a loss of influence for Canada, and a loss of control over the country's capital markets. Ontario, along with Quebec, has a veto on the transaction. The federal government has yet to make a decision on the merger.The draft letter pushes some of the key hot buttons for politicians like Mr. Duncan, pointedly calling it a ""takeover"" of TMX by LSE rather than using the ""merger of equals,"" which the TMX and LSE favour. It likely would carry some weight with the Ontario government, which was strongly influenced by the banks in its decision to implement the harmonized sales tax.TMX shareholders would own less than half the proposed new company. TMX has argued that the company, which also owns the TSX Venture Exchange, needs to grow beyond national borders. By doing so, TMX has said, the company will be able to lower costs for exchange users and increase opportunities for companies listed on the TMX to find new investors.""With more eyes on Toronto markets, the opportunity to attract new players and new investors will also grow, creating new employment,"" TMX chief executive officer Tom Kloet told an Ontario government hearing on the merger plan last week.The opposition puts the potential signatories at odds with the one major bank CEO who has supported the deal: the Royal Bank's Mr. Nixon.""If Toronto is going to grow as a global financial centre, the benefits of a global exchange co-headquartered in Toronto likely outweigh the implications of a local exchange that will become increasingly less relevant over time as trading and exchanges globalize,"" he told The Globe last month.Mr. Nixon has a conflict of interest as his bank is advising the London exchange on the transaction. Sources at RBC said the bank was not asked to sign the letter. The last of the country's big six banks, Bank of Montreal, is advising TMX Group on the transaction, so it would be unlikely to come out against the deal.Following a speech in Toronto Tuesday where he laid out his concerns about the merger, senior CIBC executive Jim Prentice said the exchange is a key pillar of the Canadian economy. He said Canada must maintain ""regulatory control"" of the TSX.Mr. Prentice, a former federal Industry Minister who joined CIBC in November, said conditions that would enshrine Canadian regulatory oversight of the exchange would have to be put in place permanently, so that if the merged exchange was then taken over by another larger exchange, Canada wouldn't lose clout.""We have several bodies that are going to be conducting investigations into this [transaction]and I think they clearly need to turn their attention to the nature of the conditions that would be attached - which would have to be attached in a permanent way,"" Mr. Prentice said in an interview after his speech. ""So I think there's a lot of work left to be done.""'"

"'11-03-09,'1','The entrepreneurial bandleaders counter that they are part of a natural evolution, merely offering what people want.“If you really look at those people who play Mas with the younger bands, or if you talk to a visitor abroad and say: ‘Hey, have you ever heard of Trinidad Carnival? What band would you play with?’ they would call Tribe or they would call one of the younger bands,” Mr. Ackin said. “That says we are reaching out further than the traditional bands. We are reaching out to the international market.”With few exceptions, the 1.3 million people living on these twin West Indian islands believe that they do Carnival better than anyone in the world. But the generational clash has raised questions over how today’s Carnival is shaping the country.Is the reliance on mass-produced bikinis — a far cry from the elaborate, hand-crafted costumes Trinidadians had grown accustomed to — stifling the creative works that have been the hallmark of traditional Carnival, which the government of Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar has been pressing to revive since she took office last year?Or does it reflect the country’s new energy, representative of a push beyond Trinidad’s reputation for complacency in developing revenue streams beyond oil production?Carnival festivities here begin in earnest right after Christmas, but the signature parade was held on Monday and Tuesday, right before Ash Wednesday, adhering to the Catholic tradition of one final period of revelry before the start of Lent.The tradition here started with the island’s 19th-century slave masters, and was carried on by the African slaves after they were freed in 1834. To make the custom their own, former slaves took to burning sugar cane, to symbolize their freedom from the plantations here, and in later years residents began wearing costumes that both portrayed folkloric characters from Africa and mimicked their colonizers.Now the event attracts about 40,000 visitors to Trinidad annually, nearly half of them from the United States. In parades held throughout the country, as many as 300,000 people march around trucks blasting Soca music, according to government estimates. Estimates of the economic windfall from Carnival vary widely, from just over $27 million to hundreds of millions.What distinguishes Carnival here is an emphasis on getting people — even tourists — to purchase a costume from a band for as little as $200 and march. Several bands like Tribe have taken it a step further, charging $400 to $1,000 for a whirlwind experience that includes an open bar for both days, meals, security and shuttle service.Mr. Ackin said that Tribe, which has around 5,000 masqueraders each year, usually has a waiting list 2,000 people long. Several celebrities have also marched with Tribe, including the actor Idris Elba an the billionaire Richard Branson.His new band, Bliss, had just over 2,000 masqueraders this year and a long waiting list as well, he said. Over all, the market to pay hundreds of dollars to join a band, even in a tight economy, seems to be growing.Mr. Ackin, who has emerged as a quasi-celebrity here, spent years working in a bank and running a women’s fashion boutique. But he and his wife, Monique, a co-bandleader, got into the Carnival business by creating a band in 2000 for J’Ouvert, the early-morning parade that kicks off Carnival. His company now organizes five parties around Carnival time here. It also organizes parties at Carnivals in Miami, Washington and London.The transformation of Carnival bands into businesses has disrupted the social order in which bands used to consist of friends getting together to hang out, make costumes, and eat and drink together, traditionalists said.“The designers or the bandleaders of those other bands call themselves designers and artists, but I think that is fraud,” said Brian MacFarlane, whose band won large band of the year in each of the previous four years. “If you really, truly are a designer and artist, you’d be holding true to the art form and the culture.”Indeed, Trinidad’s Carnival has started to resemble that of “Brazil in a lot of ways,” said Winston Peters, the minister of arts and multiculturalism, “where you just have decorated bikinis and stuff with a headpiece. I can’t be against that because that’s what people want. At the same time, we don’t want the traditional Mas of our country to die.”Perhaps the most contentious aspect of the bikini costumes is that many bands import some of them from China. Mr. Peters has proposed putting a 2,000 percent tax on imported costumes.Mr. Ackin said that Tribe and Bliss imported about 20 percent of their costume pieces, a necessity to meet their demand and get high-quality production unavailable in Trinidad.People on both sides of the argument seem to agree that Trinidad needs to better harness the skills of people in the Carnival business — from the artisans who make the costumes to the people who manage the bands — and the country’s resources to create an exportable industry.The government is considering increasing the prize money for the bands with the best costumes, and it has started a band with which anyone can march in a homemade costume. Those efforts come after the creation of a Mas Academy that teaches and certifies people in Carnival trades.Derrick Lewis, who, along with his brother Dane, started a wildly popular band, Island People, in 2005, said it was important to find ways to marry the traditional Carnival with the new.“I think popular culture will become culture,” said Mr. Lewis, 52. “The same that happened with hip-hop. I’ve seen Kanye West performing with full orchestral violins and stuff like that. I think we need to encourage the fusion of the traditional and the contemporary.”'"
"'11-03-09,'1','Lawmakers have also asked Ms. Schapiro for details of her discussions with Mr. Becker about his Madoff account when she hired him in 2009. Ms. Schapiro missed a deadline on Monday for those responses. An S.E.C. spokesman said Ms. Schapiro declined to comment on Tuesday.“One of the things the S.E.C. does is hold companies to a very high standard with regards to transparency and disclosure,” said Representative Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas, who is one of four Republican lawmakers asking Ms. Schapiro about her dealings with Mr. Becker and his disclosures. “We think it’s important that the same integrity exists within the S.E.C., ensuring that people working there do not have conflicts of interest and that here is a process to vet those issues and make sure they are taken care of in a way that gives confidence.”Perhaps the most significant Madoff matter involving Mr. Becker is a proposed reversal of the agency’s recommendation on how to compensate victims of the scheme, according to two people briefed on the S.E.C.’s discussions who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter. While the agency had agreed on a deal that would return to investors only the money they had put into their Madoff accounts, Mr. Becker argued that the commission should change its stance to allow victims to keep some of the gains their investments had generated, since the investment would have grown somewhat over time even in a low-interest account. The Becker family would benefit from this approach.Mr. Becker did not return a call for comment.In correspondence with lawmakers late last month, Mr. Becker also said that he alerted the ethics office about his family’s Madoff investment again that May after he received a letter from a number of law firms representing Madoff victims asking that the commission change its proposed compensation formula. Among the issues are whether Madoff investors who withdrew money before the fraud was exposed must return some of their proceeds — and if so, how much — to other investors.“I recognized that it was conceivable that this issue could affect my financial interests because the issue could affect the trustee’s decision to bring clawback actions against persons like me,” Mr. Becker wrote in response to lawmakers. The ethics officer approved his participation, he said. That officer reported directly to Mr. Becker and spent only 25 minutes reviewing the matter, according to Congressional staff members briefed on the discussions who requested anonymity because they also were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.Congressional investigators want to know if Mr. Becker and Ms. Schapiro took all the necessary steps outlined in government ethics rules. Under the United States code, for example, Ms. Schapiro may have been required to make a written determination that Mr. Becker’s financial interest was not substantial enough to affect his job performance. A spokesman for the S.E.C. said that such a waiver would not be required unless Mr. Becker had been found to have a substantial financial conflict.Congress also asked Ms. Schapiro whether she discussed Mr. Becker’s Madoff account with other staff members or commissioners and if she took up the matter with officials in the federal government’s Office of Government Ethics, or the commission’s ethics counsel.“As the government official responsible for appointing Mr. Becker to his position in 2009, what steps did you take to manage the appearance of or actual conflict of interest presented by Mr. Becker’s financial interest in the Securities Investor Protection Corporation’ liquidation?” asked a March 1 letter signed by four Republican members of the House Financial Services Committee. They are Spencer Bacchus of Alabama, Jeb Hensarling of Texas, Scott Garrett of New Jersey and Mr. Neugebauer.In any Ponzi scheme, there are victims who withdraw money before the fraud is exposed. There are many such Madoff investors and determining how much they may keep is being sorted out in two places. Some investors are fighting in court to be entitled to the amount of money on their final Madoff statements, though they have been unsuccessful so far. Another battle involves how much customers can be compensated by the Madoff trustee and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a government entity that helps recover money for customers of failed brokerage firms. The S.E.C. oversees SIPC; neither matter has been decided.Mr. Becker’s late mother, Dorothy, invested $500,000 with Mr. Madoff’s company; when she died in 2004, her three sons transferred the money into a new account at the firm. The next year, the investment was worth $2.04 million and they withdrew it. Mr. Picard said that the family should be allowed to keep the original $500,000 investment but return $1.54 million — all of the gain — to compensate other victims.If the S.E.C. gets its way, Mr. Becker and his brothers would be allowed to keep more than that to compensate them for the time the money was invested with Mr. Madoff. How much more is unknown because details of the commission’s proposal have not been disclosed.Both SIPC and Mr. Picard, the trustee for the Madoff estate, have proposed that the customers who withdrew funds before the fraud was uncovered should be allowed to keep only as much money as they put in. Initially, the full commission agreed and approved that approach in early 2009, according to the two people briefed on the discussions.Mr. Becker joined the commission in February that year. By spring, he began meeting with lawyers for Madoff customers seeking a different formula. They wanted to let longer-term investors keep more money than those who had money with Mr. Madoff for shorter periods. Mr. Becker apparently dismissed arguments that investors were entitled to the amounts Mr. Madoff had listed on their final statements.In the summer of 2009, Mr. Becker did reverse the commission’s earlier decision, however. His legal staff came up with a new proposal to reflect the length of time the money was invested, and the commissioners approved it at the end of the year. Some at the agency who worked with SIPC expressed dissent about the change, according to the people briefed on the deliberations.Stephen P. Harbeck, the chief executive of SIPC, confirmed that his investor protection unit and the S.E.C. had initially agreed that victims should be able to keep only the money they had originally put into the Madoff firm. “Then they refined their opinion,” he said on Monday, referring to the S.E.C. He said that he did not know who had pushed for the change.The S.E.C.’s definition, Mr. Harbeck said, would benefit anyone who withdrew more money from their Madoff accounts than they had put in. Mr. Becker’s family would be among them.'"

"'11-03-09,'1','Often it was Mr. Rathore who guided Jeeps full of visitors. One was President Bill Clinton, who in 2000 got to see a huge male lying imperiously under a tree and a tigress stalking a deer.The tours would have been far less possible in 1969, when Mr. Rathore first came to Ranthambhore, which is named for a vast stone fortress built there about 1,000 years ago. The area had not yet been designated a national park. Villages and farms had been carved into its landscape. Perhaps 10,000 head of cattle denuded its fields. It became Mr. Rathore’s mission to reverse the encroachment.The Indian government banned tiger hunting in 1969, and three years later started Project Tiger to create the preserves. Persuading villagers to move “was one of my most difficult assignments,” Mr. Rathore told Sanctuary Asia magazine, which is published by a nongovernmental organization of the same name.“The people hugged the trees and wept,” he said. “I was crying with them because, inside me, I knew they were paying the price for something they may never understand.” The government compensated them with money and land, but there were violent confrontations. In 1981, a mob armed with clubs fractured Mr. Rathore’s skull and kneecap.His commitment was summed up in the 1993 book “Tiger-Wallahs: Encounters With the Men Who Tried to Save the Greatest of the Great Cats,” by Geoffrey C. Ward, the principal writer of PBS documentaries like “The Civil War,” and Diane Raines Ward.“The forest and all its creatures were the creation of the gods, he argued over the village fires,” the Wards wrote. “Did not the goddess Durga, the slayer of demons, herself ride a tiger? No man had a right to disturb that divine creation. The forest must be left to grow back.”It did at Ranthambhore, where tigers now number 25; there were none in the 1970s.But environmental groups estimate that the tiger population worldwide has declined to 3,000 today from 100,000 in 1900.Fateh Singh Rathore was born in a village in Rajasthan in 1938, the eldest of 10 children of Sagat and Inder Singh Rathore. His grandfather was the thakur, or feudal ruler, of the village. His father was a farmer.Besides his son, Mr. Rathore is survived by his wife, Khen; two daughters, Padmini and Jaya; four brothers; four sisters; and four grandchildren.After working as a store clerk and selling coal, Mr. Rathore was offered a job as a park ranger by an uncle who had become deputy minister of forests in Rajasthan. He found his calling after completing training at the Wildlife Institute of India in 1969.He also became a photographer, his pictures of tigers appearing in the book “Tigers: The Secret Life” (1990), with text by Valmik Thapar. They show tigers lounging at the gate of the fort, standing on the parapet of a crumbling mosque and striding among the roots of a giant banyan tree.“Both the author and his photographer-teacher profoundly want the tiger to survive,” John Seidensticker, a curator of mammals at the National Zoological Park, wrote in a 1990 review in The New York Times Book Review. “But the lingering sense running through the book is that its position is desperate.”'"
"'11-03-09,'1','Officials of Bank of America, the nation’s biggest mortgage servicer, argue that any effort to help troubled borrowers should not penalize borrowers who are underwater but have managed to make their monthly payments.“There may be as much as $1 trillion worth of mortgages that are underwater,” said Terry Laughlin, the Bank of America executive whose unit, Legacy Asset Servicing, handles mortgages that are delinquent or in default. “What do you do for those borrowers that have a job but have negative equity and have paid on time and honored their obligations?”“This is an unsolvable question,” he said. “It’s a very slippery slope.”The comments by Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Laughlin came at a daylong meeting with investors and analysts in New York, the first of its kind for Bank of America since 2007.Despite fierce criticism by regulators and political leaders that its efforts to help troubled borrowers have fallen short, Bank of America executives insist that the number of successful modifications the bank has completed is on the rise. The bank says more than 800,000 mortgages have been modified in the last three years.Writing down billions of principal now could actually retard the recovery by encouraging borrowers to default, they argue. “It’s not that we don’t want to help troubled borrowers,” Mr. Laughlin said. “It’s a moral hazard issue.”Late last week, the attorneys general presented the five biggest mortgage servicers, including Bank of America, with a 27-page proposal that would drastically reshape how they deal with homeowners facing foreclosure. It did not include a specific dollar figure, but government officials say they want to combine any overhaul of the foreclosure process with a monetary settlement that could finance more modifications for troubled borrowers.The existing modification program created by the Obama administration, known as HAMP, has helped far fewer borrowers than originally promised. It also faces fierce opposition from Republicans in the House of Representatives, who voted last week to kill the program.Mr. Moynihan believes investors who hold trillions in mortgage securities have to be involved in any settlement. It is not exactly clear what role they would play as part of the settlement with the federal government.Officials at Bank of America, as well as other large servicers, declined to comment on the specifics of the 27-page proposal, and the industry has been cautious about fighting back too aggressively, mindful of the tales of robo-signing and other abuses that prompted the investigation by the attorneys general and federal regulators last fall.What’s more, consumers and politicians are keenly aware that Bank of America and other financial giants have staged a remarkable turnaround since the government bailed out the industry after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.“I think reasonable minds will prevail on this,” Mr. Moynihan said. “We do push back and we get to reasonableness.”Still, the comments at Tuesday’s investor meeting are a preview of the arguments the industry is poised to make more forcefully in the weeks ahead as it negotiates with the attorneys general and other regulators behind closed doors. On Monday, Mr. Miller said he hoped a settlement could be reached within two months.As the huge volume of loan losses recedes and the economy improves, Mr. Moynihan said his company had the power to earn $35 billion to $40 billion a year. Bank of America lost $2.2 billion in 2010, weighed down by special charges and the lingering effects of the housing bust and the recession on consumers.He also reiterated his position that the long wave of acquisitions undertaken by his predecessors was over. “I can’t stress enough to you how much of a peace dividend we’ll get without mergers,” Mr. Moynihan said. “That peace dividend is effectively a permanent dividend.” The bank intends to resume payouts to shareholders in the second half of 2011.'"

"'11-03-09,'1','If talks end because of the dispute over the financial information, it could imperil the mediated negotiations. The sides are expected to reconvene Wednesday morning. It is unclear if the N.F.L. will offer more data. Then it may be up to the federal mediator George Cohen to keep the sides talking to try to avert an end to talks that would result in the N.F.L.’s first work stoppage since 1987.The union has pressed for fully audited financial books since DeMaurice Smith became its leader two years ago. They argued that if the league was asking for such a large give-back in revenue — the owners’ initial bid was for another $1 billion off the top of the revenue pool, although they have come down from that number — players deserved to know how much teams were being squeezed.The N.F.L. has long maintained that the financial data it is required to share under the collective bargaining agreement is more than enough for the union to make a deal. But the demand for financial transparency has become an important and widely publicized negotiating position for the union. A further concession by owners on this point could smooth progress in negotiations and give the union an important public victory.Some progress had been made late last week as both sides backed away from threats to decertify and lock out, and after the union won a critical court ruling involving whether owners could access billions of dollars in television revenue during a lockout, which swung a sizable chunk of leverage to the players.Perhaps emboldened by that victory, the union has made the financial data the key to progress this week.During a conference call with The Associated Press and NFL Network, Cleveland Browns linebacker Scott Fujita, a member of the union’s executive committee, said the information made available to players so far “hasn’t been sufficient.”He added: “It’s tough when you’ve got basically just a brief summary or a snapshot of all the information. That doesn’t satisfy what any competent business person would want to see.”The union retained an international investment bank, which it declined to identify because of confidentiality agreements, some time ago to be prepared in case owners turned over the information and to help it determine if the information being offered was useful.“We’re ready,” one union official said.The two sides have twice extended the deadline for expiration of the collective bargaining agreement. Over the weekend, there was hope that enough progress could be made on the critical parts of the deal to merit another extension that would allow owners and players time to work out details on a new agreement.'"

An S.E.C. spokesman said Ms. Schapiro declined to comment on Tuesday.“One of the things the S.E.C. does is hold companies to a very high standard with regards to transparency and disclosure,” said Representative Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas, who is one of four Republican lawmakers asking Ms. Schapiro about her dealings with Mr. Becker and his disclosures. “We think it’s important that the same integrity exists within the S.E.C., ensuring that people working there do not have conflicts of interest and that here is a process to vet those issues and make sure they are taken care of in a way that gives confidence.”Perhaps the most significant Madoff matter involving Mr. Becker is a proposed reversal of the agency’s recommendation on how to compensate victims of the scheme, according to two people briefed on the S.E.C.’s discussions who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter. While the agency had agreed on a deal that would return to investors only the money they had put into their Madoff accounts, Mr. Becker argued that the commission should change its stance to allow victims to keep some of the gains their investments had generated, since the investment would have grown somewhat over time even in a low-interest account. The Becker family would benefit from this approach.Mr. Becker did not return a call for comment.In correspondence with lawmakers late last month, Mr. Becker also said that he alerted the ethics office about his family’s Madoff investment again that May after he received a letter from a number of law firms representing Madoff victims asking that the commission change its proposed compensation formula. Among the issues are whether Madoff investors who withdrew money before the fraud was exposed must return some of their proceeds — and if so, how much — to other investors.“I recognized that it was conceivable that this issue could affect my financial interests because the issue could affect the trustee’s decision to bring clawback actions against persons like me,” Mr. Becker wrote in response to lawmakers. The ethics officer approved his participation, he said. That officer reported directly to Mr. Becker and spent only 25 minutes reviewing the matter, according to Congressional staff members briefed on the discussions who requested anonymity because they also were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.Congressional investigators want to know if Mr. Becker and Ms. Schapiro took all the necessary steps outlined in government ethics rules. Under the United States code, for example, Ms. Schapiro may have been required to make a written determination that Mr. Becker’s financial interest was not substantial enough to affect his job performance. A spokesman for the S.E.C. said that such a waiver would not be required unless Mr. Becker had been found to have a substantial financial conflict.Congress also asked Ms. Schapiro whether she discussed Mr. Becker’s Madoff account with other staff members or commissioners and if she took up the matter with officials in the federal government’s Office of Government Ethics, or the commission’s ethics counsel.“As the government official responsible for appointing Mr. Becker to his position in 2009, what steps did you take to manage the appearance of or actual conflict of interest presented by Mr. Becker’s financial interest in the Securities Investor Protection Corporation’ liquidation?” asked a March 1 letter signed by four Republican members of the House Financial Services Committee. They are Spencer Bacchus of Alabama, Jeb Hensarling of Texas, Scott Garrett of New Jersey and Mr. Neugebauer.In any Ponzi scheme, there are victims who withdraw money before the fraud is exposed. There are many such Madoff investors and determining how much they may keep is being sorted out in two places. Some investors are fighting in court to be entitled to the amount of money on their final Madoff statements, though they have been unsuccessful so far. Another battle involves how much customers can be compensated by the Madoff trustee and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a government entity that helps recover money for customers of failed brokerage firms. The S.E.C. oversees SIPC; neither matter has been decided.Mr. Becker’s late mother, Dorothy, invested $500,000 with Mr. Madoff’s company; when she died in 2004, her three sons transferred the money into a new account at the firm. The next year, the investment was worth $2.04 million and they withdrew it. Mr. Picard said that the family should be allowed to keep the original $500,000 investment but return $1.54 million — all of the gain — to compensate other victims.If the S.E.C. gets its way, Mr. Becker and his brothers would be allowed to keep more than that to compensate them for the time the money was invested with Mr. Madoff. How much more is unknown because details of the commission’s proposal have not been disclosed.Both SIPC and Mr. Picard, the trustee for the Madoff estate, have proposed that the customers who withdrew funds before the fraud was uncovered should be allowed to keep only as much money as they put in. Initially, the full commission agreed and approved that approach in early 2009, according to the two people briefed on the discussions.Mr. Becker joined the commission in February that year. By spring, he began meeting with lawyers for Madoff customers seeking a different formula. They wanted to let longer-term investors keep more money than those who had money with Mr. Madoff for shorter periods. Mr. Becker apparently dismissed arguments that investors were entitled to the amounts Mr. Madoff had listed on their final statements.In the summer of 2009, Mr. Becker did reverse the commission’s earlier decision, however. His legal staff came up with a new proposal to reflect the length of time the money was invested, and the commissioners approved it at the end of the year. Some at the agency who worked with SIPC expressed dissent about the change, according to the people briefed on the deliberations.Stephen P. Harbeck, the chief executive of SIPC, confirmed that his investor protection unit and the S.E.C. had initially agreed that victims should be able to keep only the money they had originally put into the Madoff firm. “Then they refined their opinion,” he said on Monday, referring to the S.E.C. He said that he did not know who had pushed for the change.The S.E.C.’s definition, Mr. Harbeck said, would benefit anyone who withdrew more money from their Madoff accounts than they had put in. Mr. Becker’s family would be among them.'"
"'11-03-09,'1','Your article clearly demonstrates the vast amount of uncertainty concerning the environmental impacts of natural gas drilling in the shale deposits throughout the United States. The new information presented in your article is troubling and reinforces the need for enhanced monitoring and regulation of natural gas operations.Unfortunately, as more data emerge about the threats that drilling operations could potentially have on the health and welfare of Pennsylvanians, the newly elected governor, Tom Corbett, is further weakening regulatory safeguards.The Corbett administration has repealed a policy requiring environmental assessments of Marcellus Shale natural gas wells in state parks and now is proposing to further weaken environmental protections by relaxing regulation of air pollution from natural gas drilling operations.Pennsylvania requires more air, water and waste disposal monitoring, as well as a robust permitting system that will provide transparency to regulators and citizens alike. If Pennsylvania officials are not up to the job, the Environmental Protection Agency must take action to strengthen regulation, monitoring and enforcement of natural gas drilling and extraction activities.Regarding your recent “Drilling Down” series on natural gas drilling: Pennsylvania has no historical memory. The state is handling the Marcellus Shale natural gas issue the same way it handled its badly managed coal mining problems.I was a coal mining attorney for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection from 1981 to 1987, and I saw firsthand the incredible damage done by coal mining.'"

"'11-03-09,'1','The Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change, which includes the oil company Shell, the automaker Renault and the train builder Alstom, said that meeting the more ambitious, but nonbinding, goal of cutting emissions by 25 percent would help “create the investment climate needed to give the E.U. any chance of competing in the global competition for low-carbon prosperity.” Prince Charles lends his title and support to the group but does not finance it.For others, the lack of a binding energy-efficiency target represented a fundamental flaw. And some environmental groups and lawmakers criticized the measures as insufficient to help industries better compete with Chinese manufacturing.Chris Davies, a British member of the European Parliament, said the lack of a mandatory target “amounts to a betrayal of Europe’s interests.” He warned that “European development has been condemned to stay in the slow lane, certain to be overtaken by the fast-lane Asian economies.”Ms. Hedegaard emphasized that the proposals should help Europe make a larger proportion of the reductions in emissions at home rather than through “offsetting,” or by paying developing countries to lower their emissions, in coming decades.Offsetting was likely to become more expensive, and “it is not so wise to continue to pour lots of euros — billions of euros — into our competitors through the offsetting mechanisms in China, in India, in Brazil, instead of investing in making the transition in our own society and doing it in a way that makes us more competitive at the same time,” she said.Last month, European governments reaffirmed the goal of improving efficiency by 20 percent by 2020. But they shied away from making it mandatory because of opposition from powerful industry groups.Instead, the energy commissioner, Günther Oettinger, who spoke alongside Ms. Hedegaard at a news conference Tuesday in Strasbourg, France, said the commission would present by this summer proposals for legal measures that would promote efficiency.Those measures include requiring governments to renovate a minimum of 3 percent of public buildings each year to improve their energy performance, and requiring public spending on items like appliances and services like heating and cooling that meet “high standards” of energy efficiency. Because around 12 percent of the built area in Europe is in public hands, that implies a “very, very large number of buildings that will be retrofitted,” Mr. Oettinger said.Some of the most far-reaching proposals concern energy companies. Under the plan, energy companies could be required to help customers cut energy consumption by supporting the installation of double-glazed windows and attic insulation.The commission said it would review progress on energy efficiency in 2013 and if it found too little progress it would again consider proposing legally binding national targets.'"
"'11-03-09,'1','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The top Republican on the Senate banking panel made clear Tuesday that he still opposed the nomination of the M.I.T. professor and Nobel laureate, Peter A. Diamond, to the Federal Reserve calling him an “old-fashioned” Keynesian supporter of big government.Opposition from Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama to a nomination that Republicans have already scuttled twice poses a challenge to President Obama, who must decide how much political capital he wants to spend to push for Mr. Diamond’s approval.“It is clear to many of us that he does not possess the appropriate background, experience or policy preferences to serve,” on the Fed’s board, Mr. Shelby said of Mr. Diamond.Mr. Diamond won approval from the banking panel twice last year — both on party-line 16-7 votes — but Republicans blocked his consideration by the full Senate, which is needed before he can take a seat on the seven-member board.While Democrats control the Senate, a single senator can hold up a nomination and Mr. Obama was forced to renominate Mr. Diamond earlier this year.Mr. Diamond would probably be a supporter of the Fed’s easy money policies, which have been criticized by many Republicans, and would further strengthen the prevailing consensus.'"
"'11-03-09,'1','The top court’s ruling, however, did validate the principle that creditors can contest safeguard procedures. The court sent the issue of the ownership of the building’s rental revenue and the terms of the safeguard plan back to a lower court for a ruling.“It’s good news, of course,” said Benoît Fleury, a lawyer with the firm Gibson Dunn, which represents the owner. He added that the owner should now be free to re-enter protection and restructure its debts.Nicolas Noblanc, head of the legal department at EuroTitrisation, which represents the main creditors, said his group would “proceed with a thorough analysis of these decisions and of their consequences” and would assert its interests before the lower court.Coeur Défense is in La Défense, a business district west of Paris. The biggest complex of its kind in Europe, Coeur Défense consists of two 40-story towers and three low-rise buildings and was completed in 2001.Current tenants include HSBC, which renewed its contract in 2010, and AXA Investment Managers.In 2007, Lehman Brothers and a French partner, Atemi, bought the property from the French real estate investment trust Unibail-Rodamco and Goldman Sachs’s Whitehall Funds for 2.1 billion euros ($2.9 billion). At the time, the deal was heralded as the largest single asset transaction in Europe. Lehman bought the property through HOLD, with the shares in turn owned by two Lehman entities and G.E.’s pension fund, through a holding called Dame Luxembourg.The deal was helped by a loan for 1.6 billion euros from Lehman’s German unit, which was subsequently acquired by Windermere XII, a structured finance vehicle of a type known in France as a fonds commun de titrisation, or F.C.T. That vehicle is in turn managed by EuroTitrisation, a structure owned by French lenders.EuroTitrisation financed its exposure by issuing notes, which were listed in Dublin. HOLD put up the rent owed by tenants as security on the loan and hedged for fluctuations in interest rates on the loan via contracts with Lehman Brothers units in the United States and Britain.When Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, the two Lehman units lost their eligibility to act as counterparties to the hedging transaction after their credit ratings plummeted.Windermere subsequently requested that HOLD provide new guarantees on the 1.6 billion-euro loan within 20 days or face accelerated reimbursement.HOLD went to court seeking a safeguard under a 2004 French law that grants creditor protection similar to that provided by Chapter 11 of the United States bankruptcy law. One of the few occasions when the law was tested was in 2006, when Eurotunnel, which operates the tunnel linking Britain and France, was given court protection to restructure its debts. France subsequently updated its bankruptcy provisions seeking to strengthen protections for vulnerable companies.In November 2008, the Paris Commercial Tribunal granted the safeguard proceedings to HOLD and Dame Luxembourg on the grounds that they had financial difficulties which they were unable to overcome alone and which could lead to a default.Windermere challenged this decision to the Court of Appeals, which ruled in February 2010 that neither HOLD nor Dame Luxembourg had demonstrated difficulties that would affect their operating business. As a result, the appeals court ruled that Windermere had grounds to challenge the opening of safeguard proceedings. That process was overturned by the higher court on Tuesday.'"
"'11-03-09,'1','But other countries’ wariness has meant that China now mines and refines at least 95 percent of the global supply of rare earths. And Beijing has aroused international alarm by wielding that virtual monopoly as a global trade weapon.Last September, for example, China imposed a two-month embargo on rare earth shipments to Japan during a territorial dispute, and for a short time even blocked some shipments to the United States and Europe. Beijing’s behavior, which has also included lowering the export limit on its rare earths, has helped propel world prices of the material to record highs — and sent industrial countries scrambling for alternatives.Even now, though, countries with their own rare earth ore deposits are not always eager to play host to the refineries that process them. An American company, Molycorp, plans to reopen an abandoned mine near Death Valley in California; but Molycorp must completely rebuild the adjacent refinery to address environmental concerns.All of this helps explain why a giant Australian mining company, Lynas, is hurrying to finish a $230 million rare earth refinery here, on the northern outskirts of Malaysia’s industrial port of Kuantan. The plant will refine slightly radioactive ore from the Mount Weld mine deep in the Australian desert, 2,500 miles away. The ore will be trucked to the Australian port of Fremantle and transported by container ship from there.Within two years, Lynas says, the refinery will be able to meet nearly a third of the world’s demand for rare earth materials — not counting China, which has its own abundant supplies.Nicholas Curtis, Lynas’s executive chairman, said it would cost four times as much to build and operate such a refinery in Australia, which has much higher labor and construction costs. Australia is also home to an environmentally minded and politically powerful Green party.Despite the potential hazards, the Malaysian government was eager for investment by Lynas, even offering a 12-year tax holiday. If rare earth prices stay at current lofty levels, the refinery will generate $1.7 billion a year in exports starting late next year, equal to nearly 1 percent of the entire Malaysian economy.Raja Dato Abdul Aziz bin Raja Adnan, the director general of the Malaysian Atomic Energy Licensing Board, said his country approved the Lynas project only after an interagency review indicated the imported ore and subsequent waste would have low enough levels of radioactivity to be manageable and safe.Malaysia had reason to be cautious: Its last rare earth refinery, operated by the Japanese company Mitsubishi Chemical, is now one of Asia’s largest radioactive waste cleanup sites.“We have learned we shouldn’t give anybody a free hand,” Raja Adnan said.Despite such assurances, critics are not convinced that the low-level radioactive materials at the Lynas project will be safe.“The word ‘low’ here is just a matter of perception — it’s a carcinogen,” said Dr. Jayabalan A. Thambyappa, a general practitioner physician and toxicologist. He has treated leukemia victims whose illnesses he and others have attributed to the old Mitsubishi Chemical refinery.That plant, on the other side of the Malay peninsula, closed in 1992 after years of sometimes violent demonstrations by citizens protesting its polluting effects. Now, in an engineering effort that has largely escaped the outside world’s notice, Mitsubishi is engaged in a $100 million cleanup.Rare earths, a group of 17 elements, are not radioactive themselves. But virtually every rare earth ore deposit around the world contains, in varying concentrations, a slightly radioactive element called thorium.Radiation concerns — along with low-cost Chinese competition — eventually forced the closing of all rare earth refineries in Japan. It was during this phase-out that Mitsubishi moved its refining operation to Malaysia, where old tin mines had left behind thousands of tons of semiprocessed slag that was rich in rare earth ore. It also had extremely high levels of radioactive thorium.The new Lynas refinery, with nearly two dozen interconnected buildings and 50 acres of floor space, will house the latest in pollution control equipment and radiation sensors. A signature feature will be 12 acres of interim storage pools that will be lined with dense plastic and sit atop nearly impermeable clay, to hold the slightly radioactive byproducts until they can be carted away.But carted to where? That is still an open question.Building the lined storage pools was one of the promises Lynas had made to win permission to put the refinery here, in an area already environmentally damaged by the chemical plants that line the narrow, muddy Balok River.Mr. Curtis, the Lynas chairman, insists that the new factory will be much cleaner and far safer than the old Mitsubishi plant, which “never should have been built,” he said recently, as he led a tour of the sprawling Lynas refinery construction site here.One big difference, he said, is that the ore being imported from Australia is much less radioactive. It will have only 3 to 5 percent of the thorium per ton found in the tin mine tailings that Mitsubishi had processed. And he said the Lynas factory would also process 10 times as much ore with only twice as many employees — about 450 in all — thanks to automation that will keep workers away from potentially harmful materials.But the long-term storage of the Lynas plant’s radioactive thorium waste is still unresolved.After using sulfuric acid to dissolve the rare earths out of the concentrated ore, Lynas plans to mix the radioactive part of the waste with lime. The aim is to dilute it to a thorium concentration of less than 0.05 percent — the maximum permitted under international standards to allow the material to be disposed with few restrictions.Lynas wants to turn this mixture into large concrete shapes known as tetrapods that are used to build artificial reefs for fish and as sea walls to prevent beach erosion.Local residents seem to be of two minds about the sprawling plant being built near the river. The river empties into the ocean several miles away, next to an impoverished fishing village, where on a recent evening a small group of fisherman sat at the end of a wooden dock.Muhamad Ishmail, age 56, said pollution from the chemical factories that started opening upstream in the 1990s had forced local fishing — a river industry for generations — to move primarily out to sea. Although one of his five children works in the nearby industrial district, Mr. Ishmail said he did not want Lynas or anyone else to open any more factories.“This river used to be clean, and you could catch fish right here,” he said.But Muhamad Anuar, 30, said his community needed the reliable paychecks that Lynas might offer. “I have two kids, and I don’t want them to be fishermen,” he said. “It’s a hard job.”'"

Together, the Boeing aircraft are worth about $10 billion at list prices, though purchases are often subject to undisclosed discounts.HNA Group, which is controlled by the government of Hainan Province in China, also announced orders for several business jets from Dassault Aviation and Gulfstream Aerospace.The announcements, made at an aerospace show in Hong Kong, demonstrated just how rapidly many Asian carriers are expanding and how important the region has become for manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus.

"'11-03-10,'0','Earlier Wednesday, owners offered to make available individual teams’ financial statements. They would be reviewed by a third-party auditor agreed upon with the union, according to a person briefed on the negotiations. The union would not be allowed to see the statements, but the auditor would verify to the union that the data is accurate.The union has declined to review the data that owners have offered and their profitability statements over the last five years and information about which teams have experienced changes in profits.The information, league officials said, was more than teams receive and more than the union had ever received in any negotiation.The league negotiator Jeff Pash said that the two sides did not discuss the financial information across the negotiating table Wednesday, although the sides probably discussed it separately with the mediator George Cohen.The union released a letter dated May 2009 in which Smith asked Commissioner Roger Goodell for detailed individual team information on, among other things, income, expenses, profits, cash and investment assets.A second person briefed on negotiations said that until an agreement on financial data could be reached, there could be no progress on the core issue that separates the sides: the revenue split. The sides are now about $800 million apart per year.“Just to be absolutely clear, the information that was offered wasn’t what we asked for,” Smith said Wednesday.“And according to our investment bankers and our advisers, they told us that information would be utterly meaningless in making a determination about whether to write an $800 million check to the National Football League in the first year, $800 million in the second year, $800 million in the third, $800 million in the fourth year and $800 million in the fifth year.”Owners have been steadfast in refusing to completely open their books to players, although if the battle moves to federal court they probably would not have a choice. Team financial statements will become part of the record in antitrust lawsuits that players would bring against the league, and the details that owners have tried to shield would become public.“The union knows what we’re proposing to do,” Pash said.“Has it gotten everything it wants? Evidently not. Have we offered to provide more? Absolutely. Is it a subject we’re prepared to discuss? Absolutely. We’re prepared to continue discussing all the issues we have to discuss.“The differences are significant,” he added. “No one should be mislead on that. But we’re here. We believe in this process. We believe in collective bargaining. There may be others who don’t want to engage in it, who prefer litigation, who prefer other gambits. That’s not where we are. We’re here to talk.”Most members of the owners’ labor committee are expected to join the meetings Thursday and they will face a critical decision: whether to allow enough financial data to be released to satisfy the union’s request. If they do, the sides could agree to another extension of the deadline — this one, probably lengthy — to allow the union time to examine the information before negotiations can resume.'"
"'11-03-10,'0','The Senate on Wednesday voted down the House budget bill, with its string of $61 billion in mostly political cuts through Sept. 30. That formally puts an end to the House’s grandstand play. But the Senate also rejected its Democratic leaders’ own plan to cut $6.5 billion. The government’s financing is due to run out in eight days. To prevent a shutdown, the two chambers will probably have to agree to yet another short-term financing bill.That would be politically and fiscally irresponsible. But the House Republicans will be happy to agree, as long as Democrats agree to a vigorish of $2 billion a week in cuts to vital government programs.Unless the White House and Democratic lawmakers start pushing back a lot harder — and do a better job of explaining the disastrous effects on the economy and everyday life — the Republicans will win the argument. If it keeps going on this way, they will get the $61 billion they demanded.The White House again threatened on Wednesday to veto the House bill, and said it supported the Democratic bill that did not even draw a simple majority. It has been hosting what appear to be unproductive talks among legislative leaders; Vice President Joseph Biden Jr., who is nominally in charge of the talks, is now visiting Eastern Europe and tried to mediate by telephone.President Obama has yet to take a firm public stand and make clear his bargaining limits and priorities. Understandably, he does not want the government to shut down and is hoping that quiet negotiations will produce better results than loud declarations of principle. But there is no sign that the House freshmen have an interest in compromise, or that Representative John Boehner, the House speaker, has any control of his caucus.A brief shutdown, painful as it would be, would be far less damaging than a sudden withdrawal of tens of billions in government spending from the economy, which would lead to widespread layoffs.'"
"'11-03-10,'0','The Labor Department does not adjust the city’s monthly data for the usual seasonal trends of hiring and layoffs, but Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist with a real estate investment firm in Manhattan, does. According to Ms. Denham’s calculations, the revised numbers show that the city lost a total of 141,300 jobs after the recession hit in April 2008. That was a much less severe effect than the previous estimate of 179,000 jobs lost.Since the recovery began, the city has regained 50,700 jobs, leaving it about 90,000 jobs short of the prerecession employment peak. That net loss means the city is missing about 1 of every 42 jobs it had before the recession, while the national loss since then represents 1 of every 18 jobs.The biggest gains in the city since the start of 2010 have been in restaurants, bars, employment agencies, education and health care, Ms. Denham said. The biggest losses have come in local, state and federal government, and construction, she said.Wall Street has bounced back fast, adding 8,200 jobs since the start of last year, including 2,000 jobs in January 2011, she said. But the city’s securities industry is still 20,000 jobs, or about 10 percent, shy of its peak in early 2008.“This recent pattern of steady growth is reassuring that the industry is truly recovering,” Ms. Denham said.Statewide, the unemployment rate edged up to 8.3 percent from 8.2 percent in December. The state added 95,100 jobs from the start of the economic recovery in December 2009 through December 2010, after losing 335,300 jobs during the recession.In a separate report released on Wednesday, the office of the city comptroller, John C. Liu, said that New York City’s public employees were older and better educated but paid less than counterparts in the private sector.The study, conducted by the comptroller’s chief economist, Frank Braconi, found that the pay gap between the public and private sectors was reversed for less-educated workers. City employees who did not attend college earn about 13 percent more than private-sector workers with similar educations, Mr. Braconi said. But city workers with graduate or professional degrees are paid about 16 percent less than private-sector peers, he said.Nearly half — 49 percent — of city employees have a four-year college degree, compared with just 41 percent of workers in the private sector, according to the study. But the city workers earn slightly less than $55,000 a year, on average, while the private-sector employees make an average of more than $66,000 a year.The value of health insurance plans, pensions and other benefits are often assumed to make up for the pay gap, but Mr. Braconi found that was not generally true for the city’s 306,000 employees. Over all, he said, the cost of contributing to its employees’ retirement is “roughly equivalent” to a corporation’s cost for contributing to a standard defined-contribution retirement plan.'"
"'11-03-10,'0','Tampa Bay Coach Raheem Morris spoke positively of Barber’s attempted comeback, which opens the door for speculation that Tiki could join his twin, Ronde, who recently signed a one-year contract to play his 15th season at safety for the Buccaneers.“When you’re talking about those type of great players, you’ve always got to have interest,” Morris told The St. Petersburg Times. “And if he’s got the heart and the desire and the fire, I say you do it. It’s no different than his brother. He’s one of those guys who doesn’t know when he’s going to run out of gas. It happens to all of us. It happens to the best of us. But if he’s got a little bit left, I encourage him to do it.”Barber’s agent, Mark Lepselter, has said that teams have expressed interest. Others were not so sure.“I don’t know if anybody’s going to be interested,” Casserly said. “I saw Raheem Morris’s comments, and he seemed to say some positive things. I don’t know if he’s going to sign him. There are not a lot of teams out there looking for backs, and his minimum salary is going to be high.”That is the other rub in signing Barber — he would make at least the veteran’s minimum, which under the old collective bargaining agreement would have been around $800,000. That is a high price for a situational back.Barber’s comeback has drawn some comparisons to Marcus Dupree, who was one of the biggest college stars of the 1980s, but whose initial pro career — in the United States Football League — lasted only two seasons until a major knee injury forced him out of football in 1985. Five years later, he attempted a comeback in the N.F.L. with the Rams and played part of two seasons before being cut in 1992. But the comparison is flawed because Dupree had played so little before his first retirement and because he was only 26 when he attempted to return.Ricky Williams is another prominent running back to have an interrupted career, albeit for different reasons. He retired from the Miami Dolphins in 2004 after a positive drug test for marijuana use. He returned a year later, failed another drug test in 2006 and was injured in his first game back in 2007, but he continued to play through last season, at age 33. When he rushed for 1,121 yards in 2009, he set an N.F.L. record for longest gap between 1,000-year rushing seasons at six years.But Barber is unique in returning at such a late age.“Certainly veteran backs can be third-down backs, but the question is, what are you getting with this guy?” Casserly said of Barber. “What’s he going to look like after the first hit? What’s he going to look like after the first week of practice? That’s the thought process a general manager is going to go through. It’s a long shot to say the least.”'"
"'11-03-10,'0','With Tressel missing games next season against Toledo and Akron and being docked a small percentage of his salary of about $4 million, the question raised again is whether there are real deterrents to lying and cheating in college sports.“I think the power the major conferences have over the N.C.A.A. is significant,” said Joe Gottfried, the retired athletic director at South Alabama. “Unless they send a strong message, this will continue. There is no deterrent. I think the deterrent is going to come in the form of the infractions committee.”The N.C.A.A. Committee on Infractions, which has the final say in the matter, could still deliver a strong message to Tressel. But there is a strong argument that what he did in not telling his administrators or the N.C.A.A. the information he had about his players’ illicit dealings with a local tattoo parlor is worse than what his players did in selling memorabilia. His players were suspended for five games.In a telephone interview Wednesday, Ohio State’s president, Gordon Gee, said the lesser opponents the Buckeyes will play were not considered in handing down Tressel’s suspension.“If we were playing Michigan and U.S.C. the first two games, it would have been that way, too,” Gee said. “We felt two games would be the right number.”Gee said that in mid-January he had Tressel at his house for a three-hour discussion about Tressel’s not telling the university what he knew. The meeting reaffirmed his belief that Tressel has been an ideal citizen of the university, Gee said.“This wasn’t a university president genuflecting toward a great football coach,” Gee said. “It was a mistake of the heart, not a mistake of malfeasance.”The past three months have provided another reminder of how winning in college sports can be intricately tied with cheating or blurring the rules.The teams that played for the national football title, Auburn and Oregon, have been ensnared in N.C.A.A. investigations of their recruiting practices. And Ohio State won the Sugar Bowl only after Tressel withheld information about key players that protected their eligibility.There are numerous other examples. Tennessee is doing everything possible to keep the basketball coach Bruce Pearl, whom the Southeastern Conference fined and suspended for eight games this season after he lied to the N.C.A.A. and asked a recruit to do the same. North Carolina appears set on keeping Butch Davis as its football coach after an agent scandal aborted its 2010 season. (Both Tennessee and North Carolina await the results of N.C.A.A. investigations.) And Connecticut received no harsh penalties for the actions taken when it sought a top recruit and failed to create an atmosphere of compliance in doing so.Gottfried, who was the athletic director at South Alabama for 26 years, said the Pearl situation was the one that galled him most.“I was in college athletics for almost 40 years, and it really bothers me personally,” Gottfried said. “How do you look a faculty member or a student-athlete in the eye if you’re condoning cheating or lying more than once? When you get recruits to lie, how far will you go? I would be embarrassed if I was a trustee or an alum of Tennessee.”The Big Ten commissioner, Jim Delany, said the league was not considering suspending Tressel for additional games as the SEC did with Pearl. It will wait for the N.C.A.A.’s decision on Tressel.“It’s not a positive,” Delany said in a telephone interview. “It’s a big issue. It’s a concern.”Asked about stiffer penalties, Delany said that the only one that really cuts to the bone is the death penalty, which has not been on the table for decades. He said Tressel’s punishment transcended the fine and suspension.“There’s a reputational damage,” Delany said. “Not only the financial penalty and the suspension, but reputational damage.”Delany said many of the compounding aspects of the more commercialized college sports — television, big contracts, one-and-done players — had led to some of the recent problems. But there are few silver-bullet solutions.Plenty of reputations have been affected in the past year. But as bombshell after bombshell drops, it is still reasonable to ask whether damage to one’s reputation, and perhaps the interruption of a book tour, is enough of a deterrent to cheating and winning more games.'"
"'11-03-10,'0','Owen Jacob Laster was born on Aug. 30, 1938, in Weehawken, N.J. His parents, immigrants from Poland and Ukraine, ran an embroidery factory. Owen grew up in several northern New Jersey towns along the Hudson River.After earning a bachelor’s degree from Syracuse University in 1960, he served in the Army and went to work at William Morris, encouraged by a friend who knew of his passion for film, theater and books.Mr. Laster resisted the idea at first. “I had this view of an agent as a wiry, skinny, greasy-haired person with a mustache,” he told The New York Times in 1986.Within a few months he graduated from the mailroom to the publicity department, where he sent out photos and biographies of the agency’s show-business clients to nightclubs. And soon after, he was an agent, of the nongreasy type.His career in books began a decade later when Helen M. Strauss brought him into the company’s literary department, which she had created in the 1940s. When she left William Morris two months later, he inherited several of her writers, and in 1973 he was put in charge of the literary department. In 1989 he became head of the agency’s worldwide literary operations.Mr. Laster’s client list was unusually diverse, divided almost equally between fiction and nonfiction authors and, on the fiction side, between literary writers like Ralph Ellison and Edward Albee and best-selling genre writers like Joy Fielding, Bari Wood and James Crumley. For many years he represented Dominick Dunne, Susan Isaacs and Judy Blume, as well as numerous literary estates, including those of Frank Yerby, Leon Uris and Chaim Potok.One of his quirkier successes was the novel “... And Ladies of the Club,” which made an unlikely literary star of its author, Helen Hooven Santmyer, an 88-year-old retired librarian from Ohio. When it was published by the Ohio State University Press in 1982, the novel sold only a few hundred copies, but a college classmate of Mr. Laster’s brought it to his attention, and Mr. Laster sold it to Putnam’s. After being republished in 1984, it became a main selection of the Book of the Month Club and a No. 1 best seller.In its own way, the astonishingly successful career of Mr. Michener was just as anomalous. Against the prevailing literary winds, he remained one of the most dependable writers of best-selling fiction in the United States for decade after decade and, thanks in no small part to Mr. Laster, one of the richest. “It really is amazing how long he kept the Michener flag flying,” Ed Victor, a literary agent in London, said of Mr. Laster, with whom he often traveled to the Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany.Several of Mr. Laster’s agents and assistants went on to establish important careers, notably Robert Gottlieb, who became head of the literary department and executive vice president of William Morris before starting his own company, Trident Media Group, in 2000.Mr. Laster, who leaves no immediate survivors, came up with a simple explanation for his career in his 1986 interview with The Times. “I like to read,” he said. “I like books, and I like writers.”'"
"'11-03-10,'0','Studies in rodents and monkeys have shown that exposure to anesthesia at a very young age, roughly corresponding to under age 4 in humans, is associated with brain cell death. And a new study, by the F.D.A.’s National Center for Toxicology Research, found that exposing 5-day-old rhesus monkeys to 24 hours of anesthesia resulted in poorer performance on tests of memory, attention and learning.“That brings into the picture the sort of proof of concept that these drugs can cause cognitive disturbances in juvenile animals,” Dr. Rappaport said.Because of the difficulty of doing controlled clinical trials with children, human studies have mostly examined whether children with and without learning disabilities had anesthesia when younger. Such research has weaknesses because it may not account for children’s various experiences or show whether learning deficits were coincidental.Results of several of these studies suggest developmental or behavioral risks to children exposed to anesthesia, especially those who received more than one anesthetic.“You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to say, ‘Geez, if this happens in monkeys, then there’s a high probability that something like this occurs in humans,’ ” said Dr. Randall Flick, associate professor of anesthesiology and pediatrics at the Mayo Clinic, who has done some of the research involving children and is on the F.D.A. advisory panel.But, Dr. Flick said, without definitive evidence, the issue is extremely fraught because most young children receiving anesthesia critically need surgery.“What we know is that not giving anesthesia and appropriate medication to manage a child’s pain during surgery does have long-term adverse affects on a child — physical as well as emotional,” said another committee member, Dr. Jayant Deshpande, a pediatrician and anesthesiologist who is a senior vice president at Arkansas Children’s Hospital. “So because the child needs surgery today, we are going to use the best information that we have and use the anesthetics.”To galvanize research, the F.D.A. has formed a public-private partnership with the International Anesthesia Research Society.Dr. Rappaport said questions include whether possible effects vary by anesthetic (most studies so far involved ketamine, a common anesthetic), dose, age or length of exposure. Other questions include types of cognitive effects; Dr. Flick, for example, is studying whether anesthesia exposure appears related to autism or attention deficit disorder.Dr. Nancy Glass, a pediatric anesthesiologist at Texas Children’s Hospital and president-elect of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia, wants practical answers, like “if we know that this baby needs two small procedures and two anesthetics is worse than one, then we would knock ourselves out to do it on the same day,” she said.“We’re all concerned,” Dr. Glass said, but “we don’t believe that there is data yet that says to us either that we should change our technique or that we should frighten parents about allowing us to anesthetize their children for necessary surgery.”'"
"'11-03-10,'0','Jose Caceres, 25, has been a security guard since last March with the Protection Plus Security Corporation in Manhattan. Since October, Mr. Caceres has been assigned to guard the Department of Motor Vehicles office in Peekskill. He recently completed a 47-hour armed guard training course at the Blackhawk Security School in the Bronx, and expects to get his license to carry a firearm — along with a transfer and a raise — this spring. Mr. Caceres lives with his mother (his parents are divorced) and his two sisters in the Marble Hill Houses in the Bronx.Like father: My father was in the military with the Army Rangers, and when he came back he was an armed guard at Montefiore hospital. I was about 6 then. I decided I wanted to join the military and be a security guard like him. He’s been very supportive of my plans. He’s still a guard. He protects an HSBC Bank in Buffalo.Chef by default: After I graduated from high school, I wanted to go into the military, but my family needed me more here. My professional ambition was to protect and serve, but I wound up working as a chef at Manhattan College. The training was free. I was there a year, then I got laid off. I still make penne alla vodka and chicken Alfredo.The kitchen, Part 2: I went to a temp agency and got a job at Scientific Fire Prevention. You know how the grease gets into the vents in a kitchen’s exhaust system? Well, we cleaned the exhaust systems and disposed of the waste. It was very dirty work; I wore a hazmat suit. I didn’t like it there.Standing guard: I took a test and got certified as a fire guard for Securitas at Yankee Stadium for the 2007 season. Sometimes I saw snippets of games, but mostly I didn’t do much except stand there and guard the gate. From there I went to Front-Line Security in Queens. For a year, I protected a drug clinic. I quit that to work for GSS Security in Midtown because they paid more and the assignments were better.Hotel duty: I worked at the DoubleTree hotel and at the Paramount. Mostly you deal with people who try to sneak into other people’s rooms, or people who get locked out of their rooms when inappropriately dressed. Or not dressed. And when there were altercations over bills not paid, we sometimes had to escort guests off the premises. There were security cameras everywhere, so we never had any violence. When GSS lost the contract, I was without a job for three months last year.'"
"'11-03-10,'0','Eighty-two percent of schools could miss testing targets, Mr. Duncan said, compared with 37 percent last year.Some analysts who have closely followed the workings of the law expressed skepticism about the estimates.“I find it hard to believe that the percentage would rise that much in one year,” said Jack Jennings, president of the nonpartisan Center on Education Policy in Washington. “Maybe they are right. If so, it’s certainly a mind-blower.”The No Child Left Behind Act, introduced in 2001 by President George W. Bush and passed by Congress with bipartisan support, requires that all schools bring 100 percent of their students to proficiency in math and reading by 2014. Mr. Duncan has called this requirement “utopian.”Critics of the law say it is a bit like requiring all city police forces to end certain crimes — like burglary and drug trafficking — by 2014. They have also long predicted that the law will, over time, determine that all but a handful of schools are failing — a label that would demoralize educators, lower property values and mislead parents about the instructional climates in their schools.President Obama, Mr. Duncan and many Republicans would like Congress to rewrite the testing and other much-criticized provisions of the law in a broad overhaul this year.The sprawling federal law requires all public schools to conduct annual testing of reading and math skills among students in third through eighth grades and one high school grade. They must publish the average results for all students, as well as the results broken down by ethnic groups and other subsets.When it took effect in 2002, the law required states to outline the 12-year statistical path they would follow in bringing all students to proficiency by 2014.California, for example, had only 14 percent of students proficient in reading in 2002, but it promised to raise that level in every school by a few points each year. The state vowed to have 35 percent of students proficient by 2008, 57 percent by 2010 and 100 percent by 2014.But like most other states, California has had trouble keeping up. By 2009, 39 percent of the state’s elementary schools had missed the targets; last year, 60 percent of California’s elementary schools fell short.If students in any ethnic group miss the targets, the entire school is put on probation. Schools that miss targets two years in a row are labeled “needing improvement,” and face escalating sanctions that can include staff changes or shutdowns.In virtually every state, schools designated as needing improvement include chaotic ones that may need a total overhaul but also many others where only one or two groups’ scores — perhaps the results of disabled students — have fallen short.Over the previous four years, the percentage of schools nationwide that have fallen short of the law’s testing targets has risen only gradually, from 28 percent in the 2006-7 school year to 37 percent last year.But officials said that the number of schools missing targets was reaching a tipping point, and that many schools that had worked hard to meet their targets would be unable to meet them this year.Margaret Spellings, Mr. Bush’s secretary of education, called it unwise to change the accountability system just when states were feeling the heat.“These are the achievement targets they promised,” Ms. Spellings said. “It’s been stall, stall, stall, and now what, we’re going to hit the reset button on the accountability clock?”She added: “They’re overstating the numbers to make a political point for reauthorization.""Peter Cunningham, an Education Department spokesman, said Mr. Duncan’s intention was to inform Congress of the dynamics of the law this year. “States are now facing very steep goals under the law, and they are not going to meet them,” Mr. Cunningham said. “Arne is just telling the committee that is charged with rewriting this law what’s coming.”The Obama administration’s blueprint for rewriting the law, released last year, would retain many features of the Bush-era law, including its annual testing requirements.But it proposes far-reaching changes, including replacing the pass-fail school accountability system with one that would measure individual students’ academic growth and judge schools on other indicators like graduation rates, not just test scores.The administration’s proposal would replace the 2014 goal with a new national target, raising standards so that all students who graduated from high school by 2020 were prepared to succeed in college and a career.Department officials said Mr. Duncan’s estimates were not even based on very harsh assumptions on improvement. Rather, it was assumed that all schools would improve scores this year at the rate of the fastest-improving 25 percent of schools in their state in the past four years. That assumption would probably underestimate the number of schools likely to miss the testing goals, the officials said. The department’s calculations did not take into account other possible events, however, that could reduce that number, the officials acknowledged.For instance, the law gives states considerable leeway to manipulate their testing systems to help more schools meet goals. In South Carolina, about 81 percent of elementary and middle schools missed targets in 2008. The State Legislature responded by reducing the level of achievement defined as proficient, and the next year the proportion of South Carolina schools missing targets dropped to 41 percent.'"

"'11-03-10,'0','In 2006, Colombia produced more than 12 million 132-pound bags of coffee, and set a goal of 17 million for 2014. Last year the yield was nine million bags.Brands like Maxwell, Yuban and Folgers have increased the retail prices of many grinds by 25 percent or more since the middle of last year in light of tight supply and higher wholesale prices.Profits of high-end coffee chains like Starbucks and Green Mountain have been eroded. Coffee futures of Arabica, the high-end bean that comes predominantly from Latin America, have risen more than 85 percent since last June, to $2.95 a pound, partly over concerns about supply, extreme weather and future quality, said George Kopp, an analyst at the International Futures Group in Chicago.Yet as stockpiles of some of the best coffee beans shrink, global demand is soaring as the rising middle classes of emerging economies like Brazil, India and China develop the coffee habit.“Coffee production is under threat from global warming, and the outlook for Arabica in particular is not good,” said Peter Baker, a coffee specialist with CABI, a research group in Britain that focuses on agriculture and the environment, noting that climate changes, including heavy rains and droughts, have harmed crops across many parts of Central and South America.A top coffee scientist, he has rattled trade forums by warning, Cassandra-like, of the possibility of “peak coffee,” meaning that, like oil supplies, coffee supplies might be headed for an inexorable decline unless growers make more concerted efforts to expand production globally.The Specialty Coffee Association of America warned this year, “It is not too far-fetched to begin questioning the very existence of specialty coffee.”Arabica and Robusta coffee account for virtually all consumption. With its more delicate taste and lower caffeine content, Arabica is more popular and more expensive, though generally more finicky in its weather needs. Robusta production dominates in Asia and Africa.Colombia is the No. 2 Arabica exporter after Brazil, where production is centered on larger, more mechanized farms and continues to grow.The Colombian Coffee Growers Federation says high fertilizer prices have also dented yields. But it agrees with a 2009 report from the International Coffee Organization that concluded, “Climatic variability is the main factor responsible for changes in coffee yields all over the world.”Average temperatures in Colombia’s coffee regions have risen nearly one degree in 30 years, and in some mountain areas the increase has been double that, says Cenicafé, the national coffee research center. Rain in this area was more than 25 percent above average in the last few years.At the new, higher temperatures, the plants’ buds abort or their fruit ripens too quickly for optimum quality. Heat also brings pests like coffee rust, a devastating fungus that could not survive the previously cool mountain weather. The heavy rains damage the fragile Arabica blossoms, and the two-week dry spells that prompt the plant to flower and produce beans occur less often, farmers say. Arabica beans take about seven months to mature.“Half a degree can make a big difference for coffee — it is adapted to a very specific zone,” said Néstor Riaño, a specialist in agroclimatology for Cenicafé. “If temperature rises even a bit, the growth is affected, and the plagues and diseases rise.”While climate scientists agree that the increase in temperature is a clear signal of global warming and high ocean temperatures are generally associated with more frequent storms, scientists are uncertain whether the peculiar weather patterns in the area are directly related to warming, said Stephen E. Zebiak, director general of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University.“It is hard to know whether this severe weather represents natural fluctuations or is a climate change signal, though from a risk management sense, there is good reason to consider how to cope with these extreme events,” Dr. Zebiak said.In the hope of restoring coffee output, researchers at Cenicafé’s labs are toiling on a mission that seems as pressing a priority for Colombia as curing cancer is for medical researchers.Agronomists are teaching the farmers how to control the pests that arrived with the change in the weather. Climatologists are working to provide better local weather predictions. Geneticists are breeding plants that are more resistant to diseases or that can withstand torrential rains or a hotter environment.The Coffee Growers Federation has advised farmers to switch to a newer, hardier strain of Arabica that has been developed by plant breeders at Cenicafé over the last two decades.While the federation says it tastes the same as traditional variants, farmers have resisted because they can ill afford to forgo the income of a yearly crop as they wait for new plants to mature. They have also been wary that a switch could affect flavor.Taste, quality and supply are delicate issues for an industry whose aficionados are notoriously picky. Coffee companies are “working with farmers across the region to address the impact of changing weather patterns that are a direct result of climate change,” said Lisa Magnino, a spokeswoman for Starbucks,Starbucks has already bought enough coffee to last until 2012, she added. Luis Fernando Samper, a spokesman for Colombian Coffee Growers Federation, said that the beans that do make it to breakfast tables in the United States will yield coffee that is as good as ever. The problem is for Colombian farmers, who are producing far fewer beans over all and “more defective beans” that do not meet export standards.For decades, said Luis Garzón, who started growing coffee at 7, it was dry from June 1 to Sept. 8 in Timbío. Several years ago, the perplexing weather arrived. “It can start raining at 6 a.m. and go on for 24 hours,” he said.First, yields declined. Then last year, the coffee rust fungus arrived at the Garzón farm, killing entire fields. “We learned our lesson,” he said, stroking the mottled yellowed leaves of some damaged plants. Now, the family is planting the new, hardier Arabica variant, called castillo. The coffee federation hopes that such innovation will allow growers to keep expensive Arabica coffee on American tables.Meanwhile, it is creating a “product origin” certification program for Colombian coffees, similar to the one that protects Italy’s Parmesan cheese. That way importers will not be tempted to substitute beans from Brazil or Indonesia.'"

"'11-03-11,'1','Both teams played after traveling a night earlier, and the Knicks (34-30) will receive a rare Friday off after being unable to stand up to one of the Western Conference’s best teams.If Stoudemire cannot play Sunday, the Knicks anticipate a boost with the expected return of Chauncey Billups, who sat out his sixth straight game with a deep thigh bruise sustained in a collision with Howard.“He’s close,” D’Antoni said. “On Sunday, I would think, but nothing is for sure until he can go.”Dirk Nowtizki (23 points) did not have a stellar night and Tyson Chandler was saddled with foul trouble, but the Mavericks benefited from effective performances from Shawn Marion, Rodrigue Beaubois and even Corey Brewer, who the Knicks recently waived before he made an appearance with the team.Carmelo Anthony had a season-high 42 points when he played against Dallas in one of his last games for Denver last month, but he scored 18 points on Thursday. Stoudemire rallied from a slow start and ended with 36 points and 7 rebounds.“I think they are very compatible,” D’Antoni said. “I think they enjoy it. You can see them working together and moving the ball. I think their games can blend in without one stepping on the other’s toes.”“To be honest with you, it takes the pressure off because you’ve just got to get the ball in their hands,” D’Antoni added. “It’s not like you’ve got to go draw a play up that completely frees them up. They’ll go one on one. You just want to try to get them where they need to be and try not to mess it up. Try to get them the ball and let them do what they do.”That mind-set was evident in the conclusion of Wednesday’s win in Memphis over the Grizzles. Instead of calling a timeout before their final possession, D’Antoni allowed Anthony and Stoudemire to maneuver freely. Anthony sank the game-winning shot from the baseline with half of a second left for a 110-108 victory.There were no such heroics Thursday. Stoudemire and Anthony each struggled early in separate ways. Anthony collected two quick fouls and Stoudemire missed 6 of his first 7 shots. An early Dallas run turned into a nightlong rout and Dallas scored a season-high 72 points in the first half. Despite the Knicks’ reconfiguring with last month’s blockbuster trade, the meeting between the two teams played to familiar fashion. Dallas beat the Knicks for the 17th time in 19 games.“Mavericks, Boston, we can go down the list,” D’Antoni said. “I don’t think that’s a claim to fame. I have a different team out there.”The Dallas owner Mark Cuban said he was not necessarily happy that Carmelo Anthony is out of the Western Conference because he said the Nuggets improved themselves in the deal. “I think they hit a home run,” Cuban said. In the deal, the Nuggets received Raymond Felton, Wilson Chandler, Danilo Gallinari and Timofey Mozgov from the Knicks. Denver entered Thursday at 5-2 since the trade. “That’s cool,” Anthony said when told of Cuban's remarks. “I’m pretty sure Cuban is happy that I’m out the West and I’m pretty sure if I would had came here, he would have got the better end of the deal.” ... Amar’e Stoudemire sustained a stinger in his right shoulder and left the game for about a minute in the first quarter. ... The Knicks wore “Nueva York” jerseys and Dallas donned “Los Mavs” uniforms as part of the N.B.A.’s Latin night.'"
"'11-03-11,'1','The leader of China’s quasi-legislature said Thursday that China would never embrace Western political tenets like multiparty democracy or the separation of governmental powers because loosening the Communist Party’s hold on power risked plunging the nation into “the abyss of internal disorder.” The statement by the chairman of the National People’s Congress, Wu Bangguo, echoed his statements at the legislature’s last annual meeting in March 2010, when he said that a China without absolute Communist Party control would be paralyzed by internal divisions. Mr, Wu, the party’s second-ranking official, made the remarks during a speech in which he said the government last year had completed a “socialist system of laws with Chinese characteristics based on the situation and realities in China.”'"
"'11-03-11,'1','“They either never find out or find out when it’s too late.”Though the database will be considered live as of Friday, consumers will not be able to search reports from other consumers until early April. But they will be able to file reports on the site immediately, and browse through product recalls.The reason that consumers will not be able to search the database immediately is that manufacturers have 10 days to respond before a report is posted.But even as the site goes live, manufacturers and some members of Congress are still pushing for changes.Among them is Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, who is trying to strip financing for the database until it can be revised, a move some Democrats have vowed to block.In an interview, Representative Pompeo said the database should be revised so that the commission and manufacturers could better vet reports before they are posted to ensure accuracy. The current iteration of the database, he said, would make it easy to post bogus reports that could lead consumers astray.“This is a .gov site,” he said, referring to the government’s Web domain. “This is a site where consumers would have a higher level of expectation about the data presented.”Rosario A. Palmieri, vice president for infrastructure, legal and regulatory policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, said the commission’s definition of who could file reports was too broad, allowing trial lawyers and consumer advocates among others.“We just want it fixed,” he said. “We want the information in the database to be accurate.”Scott Wolfson, spokesman for the commission, said they wanted to encourage all types of people to file reports on the database to make it as robust and informative as possible. He said people who reported must certify that the information was accurate.In addition, he said the commission screened every report to make sure it contained certain core information and that it pertained to the safety of the product, not its performance.'"
"'11-03-11,'1','THE BILL The proposal by Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, would prohibit collective bargaining by public workers for issues beyond wages, require unions to hold annual votes on whether they should remain in existence and increase workers’ contributions for pensions and health benefits.WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW The Assembly, which has a Republican majority, approved the bill on Thursday by a vote of 53 to 42. The Senate, where Republicans are also the majority party, passed a version of the bill on Wednesday with all Democratic senators remaining out of state. Protests inside and outside the Capitol delayed the vote by a few hours.WHEN IT MIGHT BE RESOLVED Mr. Walker is expected to sign the bill. It is not clear how unions will respond.THE BILLS Several measures would weaken organized labor, notably legislation that would forbid any requirement that employees in unionized, private sector workplaces pay union dues or fees.WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW All but three Democratic members of the House remain in Illinois to prevent a quorum. The Legislature was not in session Thursday, but a large protest rally was held by union members in Indianapolis.WHEN IT MIGHT BE RESOLVED Democrats say they will not return until Republicans promise not to reintroduce the union legislation this session or to seek to act on other bills they say restrict workers’ rights. The union measure is not a priority for Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican, and the House speaker said he would let it die in chamber, but did not rule out its resurrection.'"

"'11-03-11,'1','Prosecutors said over $100,000 in cash was found in a safe in his home, and some $4,000 in crisp bills was in his suit pocket.Mr. Lipsky is accused of splitting his fees with Mr. Kruger, the former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, in exchange for Mr. Kruger’s official actions on behalf of his clients: business interests as varied as the Red Apple Group, the operator of the Gristede’s groceries and hundreds of convenience stores, and a Bronx beverage distributor known as Good-O. None of the clients were accused of wrongdoing. Neither Mr. Lipsky, his lawyer, nor his son — a former business partner now working at a major law firm — responded to requests for comment.In addition to Mr. Lipsky and Mr. Kruger, the others charged in the corruption case were Assemblyman William F. Boyland Jr.; David P. Rosen, chief executive of MediSys Health Systems; the hospital executive Robert Aquino; the hospital consultant Solomon Kalish; the real estate developer Aaron Malinsky; and Dr. Michael Turano.If Mr. Lipsky was portrayed in the federal complaint as a corrupt agent for a crooked politician, for years he has occupied a different kind of middle ground, a hall-of-mirrors-like gray area of conflicted loyalties.He fought against a Fairway market in Harlem after offering to help the company with any land-use problems there. He helped the grocery workers’ union in its fight against Wal-Mart, while separately representing the owners of scores of nonunion groceries that the union said exploited workers. He fought on behalf of Dominican store owners against an East Harlem Pathmark in the 1990s, but later signed up to lobby for the much bigger East River Plaza, with stores like Target and Costco, in the same neighborhood.Mr. Lombino recalled Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s asking, at a ribbon-cutting for the East River Plaza, what the difference was between a Target, which sailed through the approvals process, and a Wal-Mart, which has met all-out resistance.“I think the answer was Richard Lipsky,” Mr. Lombino said. “There was a flexibility in his ideology that I think was becoming more apparent.”Mr. Lipsky earned a doctorate in political science from the City University of New York Graduate Center in 1979, worked as an assistant professor at Manhattanville College and wrote a book on the relationship between sports and politics in American life. He took a job as an aide to a Bronx assemblyman, Louis Nine. And in the early 1980s, he has said, he helped defeat a Pathmark long planned for Zerega Avenue.That was the first of many similar battles. Some ended in victories: a B. J.’s Wholesale Club proposed by Related was rejected in the Bronx, and the Kingsbridge Armory redevelopment, also a project by Related, was ended in 2009 after Mr. Lipsky went to work on behalf of a local grocery owner. Another fight involved his work on behalf of car-repair shop and junkyard owners who wanted to stop the city’s sweeping redevelopment of their dilapidated section of Willets Point, Queens.“He’s been fighting the cigarette wars for us with the Indians for years, and where are we? No place,” said John Catsimatidis, the chairman of Red Apple, citing other acrimonious Albany skirmishes. “He was fighting the bottle law, and he lost that one too. He’s good at communications, but we didn’t win many.”In recent years, Mr. Lipsky’s blog, full of flamboyantly written screeds and carefully argued indictments — often of Mr. Bloomberg, whom he derides as “the King” — became his most potent weapon, according to fans and foes alike, and enhanced his claims of being the one lobbyist willing to fight City Hall.“He’s got a sharp tongue,” said Michael Nieves, a political operative who worked with Mr. Lipsky on Willets Point. “The same way that Rudy Giuliani would send the message, ‘I’m the big bad U.S. attorney, and I know how to come after you,’ Richard’s message was: ‘I know how to use the press, and the pen. If you mess with me, I’ll come after you.’ ”Everyone, it seemed, was subject to his withering scrutiny. But if he sometimes burned bridges — Joseph B. Rose, Mr. Giuliani’s planning commissioner, stopping taking his calls — he seemed to outlast those he alienated.If he is proven guilty, however, it will be the politician to whom he had ingratiated himself the most who brings about Mr. Lipsky’s downfall.Mr. Catsimatidis said he got a hint of that closeness when he was thinking of running for mayor in 2009. Mr. Lipsky brought Mr. Kruger to his office, he said. “Kruger said he wanted to help me,” he said. “I guess Lipsky told Kruger he has access. But we didn’t hire Kruger’s people.”But when the subject of his hiring people tied to Mr. Kruger had been broached, Mr. Catsimatidis called a halt to the questions. “Full stop,” he said.On Monday, as agents searched his Riverside Drive home, Mr. Lipsky’s phone rang 26 times with calls from Mr. Kruger, prosecutors say. Mr. Lipsky called a political associate and asked him to tell Mr. Kruger to “stop calling me and tell him why.”'"
"'11-03-11,'1','Mr. Frey and Ms. Norris, who have redubbed their gallery Frey Norris Contemporary & Modern, are expanding the program they began in their smaller Union Square location in 2003. In addition to adding nine artists to their roster, they have created the San Francisco Artist Award, a biannual juried award that will honor an under-recognized local artist with a show and a catalog.Since its inception, Frey Norris has had a bit of a split identity. Mostly known around the Bay Area for their diverse and international lineup of emerging artists, Mr. Frey and Ms. Norris have also built a collection of works by Leonora Carrington, Ms. Varo, Dorothea Tanning and other mostly female Surrealist artists Ms. Norris describe as “marginalized and underexposed.”They have made waves with their modernist work. In 2008, Ms. Carrington showed her work at Frey Norris in her first United States exhibition in 20 years. And the gallery is lending works to museums for Surrealist exhibitions in the United States, Canada and England. Nevertheless, “the modern collection had become a stepchild,” Mr. Frey said.“Now we want to put them on an even footing,” he said.The new gallery on Jessie Street was designed by Gensler Architects to do just that. At 5,100 square feet, about double the previous space, the open floor plan includes a permanent area for the 20th-century Surrealist works. And as the new name suggests, exhibitions will always run concurrently — modern and contemporary.The two inaugural exhibitions, “Pangea: Art at the Forefront of Cultural Convergence” (through March 26) and “Exultation: Sex, Death and Madness in Eight Surrealist Masterworks” (through April 30), are emblematic of the gallery’s curatorial touch, as they seek to inspire loose, continuing connections between their artists.Within eyeshot, for instance, are two striking works from different eras: a plaster corset by Frida Kahlo, the first time this particular one has been shown in a private gallery, and an intense collection of graphite drawings of human skulls and limbs, inspired by the book of Genesis, by the contemporary Israeli artist Dana Harel.Displaying these works together is hardly a radical departure in itself. It’s standard practice in museums and many galleries — including John Berggruen Gallery and Modernism in San Francisco, to name just a few — show historical artists and run a strong contemporary program.But Frey Norris’s dual exhibition strategy stands out. “Most galleries that show contemporary are strictly contemporary,” said Patricia Maloney, editor in chief of Art Practical, a Bay Area online art publication.Mr. Frey and Ms. Norris also distinguish themselves locally with their commitment to the global contemporary art scene. They travel incessantly, exhibiting at Art Dubai and the Hong Kong Art Fair, and doing studio visits around the world, with their most recent tour to Tokyo, Beijing and Sydney.Frey Norris’s intergenerational approach stands to benefit both populations that they represent. They make museum-quality Surrealist gems visible to new audiences while buffing contemporary artists’ work through association with older masters.“So much art today is made as if those making it were unaware that such art was ever made before, as if they had just invented the paintbrush,” said Jonathon Keats, an author, art critic and conceptual artist based in San Francisco and Italy.For Whitney Chadwick, an art historian and author of the seminal book “Women Artists and the Surrealist Movement,” the work of Ms. Carrington, Ms. Varo and the other female artists loosely referred to now as Surrealists, is as relevant as ever. “They were pioneering in taking themselves as subjects, and fusing personal experience, dream and myth into strong narratives,” she said.Ms. Carrington, 94, has long been reluctant to speak about her artistic process, much less speculate about how her work might connect with younger artists. “People either accept or are inspired by other artists or not,” she said in a statement conveyed by Gabriel Weisz-Carington, her son, from Mexico.Yet there are resonances. “The Surrealists were very cosmopolitan and lived in the diaspora,” Mr. Frey said.Born in Egypt and living in Los Angeles, Ms. Guirguis, whose sculpture is in the inaugural exhibition, said she did not know a lot about the artists on the show’s Surrealist side. “But the more art I see,” she said, “the happier I am.”'"
"'11-03-11,'1','“From a strictly money-making perspective, this is a highly successful model,” Mr. Harkin said. “But from an educational perspective, from the perspective of public money and an ethical perspective, I think it’s a highly disturbing model.”Mr. Clark declined Mr. Harkin’s invitation to appear at the committee hearing, and Marianne Perez, a spokeswoman for Bridgepoint, declined to comment. But on Thursday, the company posted a Web site presenting its views on the issues raised at the hearing.Regarding the ratio of recruiters to career services staff, for example, the Web site said, “Because 74 percent of Ashford University students and graduates are already employed, traditional placement services are not necessary.” And as to the high dropout rates, the Web site explains that they include students who may have attended only the first night or week of class.The site also makes the point that for-profit colleges are actually cheaper for taxpayers than public colleges, because they receive no tax support.Many of the points on the Bridgepoint Web site have been made by the career-college groups fighting the Department of Education’s efforts to regulate the for-profit sector.For example, the Web site emphasizes that for-profit schools are essential to meeting President Obama’s goals for a better-educated work force.Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, the ranking Republican on the committee, repeated his criticisms that career colleges were being singled out for scrutiny, even though, he said, the same issues exist across higher education.“Unfortunately, by only focusing these hearings on individual examples of a problem in one sector of higher education, we have no understanding of the true extent of the problem, nor have we heard any constructive solutions for solving that problem,” Mr. Enzi said.Mr. Harkin introduced into evidence hundreds of complaints from Bridgepoint students, many saying they were deceived by the company’s recruiters, or found out after leaving that they owed the college more money.The Higher Learning Commission, the private nonprofit body that accredits Ashford University, also came under fire.Mr. Harkin was critical of the commission for its finding that everything was “basically fine” at Ashford even though 84 percent of the students were dropping out. He raised questions about the commission’s review team of one representative from a nonprofit college and two from for-profit colleges.“Was that good peer review?” the senator asked Sylvia Manning, president of the commission.Dr. Manning acknowledged that her agency had gotten “a bit behind the curve” because of the rapid growth of online distance education and groups like Warburg Pincus investing in for-profit higher education.“Because it was a new phenomenon on the face of the earth, we didn’t have the policies and procedures to deal with it,” she said.The commission has since made major policy changes and tightened its oversight of distance learning, she said.Mr. Harkin voiced skepticism that the current accreditation system was up to the challenge of overseeing multistate, billion-dollar education businesses. The for-profit higher education industry is like the subprime housing industry, he said, but worse.“The difference between the subprime and this is at least in the subprime, you could walk away from your home,” Mr. Harkin said. “These students with these debts can’t walk away from them.”'"
"'11-03-11,'1','In particular, the unions objected to the possibility that the board would consider internal communications among union members like mailers, called member-to-member communication, to be considered independent expenditures, and therefore subject to detailed disclosure.Terry Meginniss, general counsel to the Service Employees International Union Local 32BJ, did not mince words during passionate testimony, saying that if such communications were deemed to be independent expenditures, they would have a “disproportionate and adverse effect” and put a chill on political organizing.“We just think that’s awful,” he said. “You will have dealt a blow to the democratic process.”Mr. Meginniss was joined by representatives of other unions, including 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, a powerful group that claims a membership of 200,000 in New York City and Long Island, and New York’s Hotel and Motel Trades Council, which represents 30,000 workers in the city.Josh Gold, political director at the hotel union, warned that the requirements could “intimidate” workers.“Any attempt to communicate would create enhanced burdens, limiting the desire to do so and thereby stifling awareness and participation amongst our members, as well as members of organizations citywide,” he said.The five-member board did not hint at what it might do. But several members expressed concerns about mailers sent to members that looked more like pieces of campaign literature than an internal newsletter; another, meanwhile, wondered what the distinction might be between member communications and, say, the distribution of pamphlets and other information by union leaders.Given the board’s presumed desire for tougher enforcement and tighter limits, many election law experts expect the board to err on the side of more disclosure, not less, in the rules it devises. But no matter what the details, the new rules will most likely represent the most significant changes in the city’s campaign finance system since 2007, when the city capped contributions from lobbyists and others doing business with it.At the same time, the board would also be pushing, for the first time, to extend its regulatory reach beyond just candidates to include the groups that help to finance those candidates.Most people who testified at the board hearing offered guarded reactions. Laurence D. Laufer, a former lawyer for the Campaign Finance Board who is now in private practice, expressed concern that the board would not do anything to curb the influence of wealthy candidates.“Greater mischief is possible by a wealthy candidate,” he said, in a potential reference to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. “A candidate may use personal funds to make large independent expenditures in support of or opposition to other candidates and not be subject to disclosure under the charter definition.”Meanwhile, City Councilman Daniel Halloran, a Queens Republican, expressed the hope that the rules would “level the playing field” in a city thoroughly dominated by Democratic power brokers. Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, praised the board in written testimony as a “model of reform” and urged the board to require full disclosure of financing sources to independent expenditure groups in which the total contribution in an election exceeded $1,000.But in written testimony, City Councilwoman Gale Brewer, a Manhattan Democrat, expressed concerns that “although the public hears horror stories about influence peddling and lack of disclosure regarding campaign finance, there are many legitimate organizations whose voices I want heard at election time, and I want to make sure that these rules do not impede their ability to be heard.”'"
"'11-03-11,'1','KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, a former prime minister who led a popular movement to restore multiparty democracy to Nepal in 1990, died here last Friday. He was 87.The cause was multiple organ failure, said Mr. Bhattarai’s physician, Dr. Bharat Rawat.Mr. Bhattarai served as prime minister twice, beginning his first term in 1990. He served again in 1999 and 2000.After multiparty democracy was restored in 1990, he was appointed prime minister of an interim government comprising representatives from his Nepali Congress Party and several Communist parties.During his year in power, he conducted Nepal’s first free elections in 30 years and enforced a new Constitution that guaranteed democratic rights.He became prime minister again at the end of the decade after the Congress Party won elections. Feuds in that faction-ridden party, however, forced him to step down after nine months.As prime minister, Mr. Bhattarai made official visits to India, Japan and Britain, and led the Nepalese delegation to a meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation in 1990 in the Maldives. His strong stands against corruption and nepotism helped him gain popularity.'"
"'11-03-11,'1','In Texas, these concerns have led lawmakers, particularly those from the Barnett Shale region, to file a number of bills to increase oversight of the industry, spanning issues from well emissions to the safety of gas pipelines.With the state facing a $15 billion to $27 billion budget gap, gas industry executives are also wary of attempts to end a 22-year-old tax break for high-cost natural gas drilling, which includes hydraulic fracturing. Representative Lon Burnam, Democrat of Fort Worth, just introduced legislation to do so, which would bring in $2.3 billion for the state over the next two years. The tax break was intended to jump-start the industry, Mr. Burnam said, and “we don’t need it anymore.”But Mr. Blackmon, of the natural gas group, said that it would drive some planned investment out of state, adding that the industry already pays billions in taxes on the state and local levels.A century ago, in the early days of the Texas oil boom, natural gas was considered a waste product and flared or vented off. But after a giant gas field was found in the Panhandle in 1918, Texans began using the fuel to manufacture carbon black, which is used to make car tires. Eventually, Americans began using gas to heat their homes and, later, to fire power plants.Texas natural gas production rose steadily until it peaked in 1972, the year before the oil embargo. Since 2005, the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing has caused Texas gas production to begin to climb again, though production is still well below 1972 levels.Today, Texas uses most of its gas in state, according to Mr. Blackmon, who said that Texas consumes about 25 percent of the nation’s gas. About one-third of Texas homes are heated with natural gas or propane, and the Texas grid gets 38 percent of its electricity from natural gas (more than the 23 percent national average). However, the share of gas has declined slightly in recent years largely because of rapid spread of wind farms in West and South Texas. Because gas plants are easier to turn off and on than coal and nuclear plants, wind has eaten into their share — something Mr. Blackmon said he was concerned about.Gas’s share of Texas electricity production is becoming a political issue. Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst recently said he would prefer that old coal plants be replaced with natural gas over the long run. However, energy experts say this would be expensive and difficult to achieve in a deregulated market, where power plants essentially control their own fate.Meanwhile the drilling will continue, even though prices for natural gas are lingering at one-third of their highs of three years ago (the turmoil in the Middle East has so far had little impact on gas because it is domestically produced). But the controversies over drilling’s impact on water and air pollution seem poised to intensify, as drillers reach new areas in the Eagle Ford Shale.Jen Powis, the Sierra Club’s senior representative in the Texas region, said, “These big three shale plays are presenting a huge problem” for local communities, in terms of air emissions and water damage. She added that Texas regulators have been too lax in cracking down on air and water pollution, and that Texas’ problems are “sort of going unnoticed,” in contrast to the loudly aired pollution concerns in other drilling states like Pennsylvania.One major Texas case in which the federal Environmental Protection Agency accused a driller, Range Resources, of contaminating two water wells in Parker County, remains embroiled in litigation. Texas Railroad Commission examiners, conducting their own investigation, recently recommended that the commission clear Range of harming the wells.Attendees at last week’s meeting in Kenedy emerged with varying views on gas.“I think it’s a clean fuel, and I’d rather see it than the coal,” said Ed Wollny, a retired transportation-industry worker in Wilson County.But Sharon Owens, who has a cattle ranch in Wilson County, said: “I don’t think people are thinking. Would you rather be able to drink water or would you rather have gas?”'"
"'11-03-11,'1','But a comprehensive deal will be difficult to reach. The proposals under debate now have already been watered down from a more robust program of integration and monitoring first put forward by Germany, and will be subject to further negotiation before a full European Union summit meeting on March 24-25, two days before an important German state election.“There’s a common understanding that we need to help Merkel get something that looks like a victory,” said a senior European Union official, who, like other officials interviewed, was not authorized to comment by name. “And for the markets, we need to end March with a comprehensive approach.”For Mrs. Merkel, the answer is a permanent bailout fund for euro-zone governments in trouble now and in the future. The debts of the most indebted nations, like Greece and Ireland, will be covered, with room, if necessary, for Portugal and Spain.But in return for this “solidarity,” the Germans say they want “solidity” on limiting benefits and accepting monitoring. Among the measures it is pressing is an agreement to raise retirement ages closer to Germany’s, where access to government pensions begins at age 67, well above the European average. Germany would also like others to stop pegging wage increases automatically to inflation. That is a necessary step if wages are to shrink in absolute terms, which some economists argue is necessary if bitter medicine to inject some competitiveness into the economies of Europe’s southern tier.The Germans would also force private bondholders who bought the high-yielding debt of the most troubled euro-zone countries to bear part of the burden if countries defaulted or needed to restructure their debt — and not be protected by taxpayers.Since November, the Germans have been in nonstop talks with officials in Brussels and with the French, with whom they have an extraordinarily close relationship. They have been working on at least three levels for a comprehensive package.The most important is a “permanent regime” — the so-called European Stability Mechanism, which will replace the temporary bailout fund called the European Financial Stability Facility, set up during the Greek crisis last May. That fund ends in June 2013, and the Germans want a permanent fund of perhaps 500 billion euros ($695 billion) to show the markets that the euro zone is prepared for future problems.But that fund must also show Germans that private investors will not be bailed out by taxpayers, that no country will assume the debts of another and that there will be collateral offered and penalties for bad behavior.The governments are also in heated discussions about whether and how to strengthen and extend the existing temporary fund of 440 billion euros ($612 billion), intended to help Greece and Ireland, to allow it to lend the entire amount, which could then cover Portugal and Spain. But Berlin does not want the fund to be used to buy back Greek or Irish bonds.The issue that has gotten the most attention is the German-French Pact for Competitiveness, a name chosen for German ears. The intention was to lay down specific commitments to coordinate euro-zone economies — a common basis for corporate taxes for instance, or a common age for retirement — intended to unify policies across the region while raising tax revenue and reducing spending. Wage indexation was to be banned and high deficits punished.But when the pact was first broached at the European level last month, there was anger from other leaders, who had not been consulted. While the pact might help in the future, it would do nothing to solve the current problems of Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Nor, critics argue, does it deal with a looming problem for Germany and the euro zone — huge private debt and shaky banks, including some German state banks. Berlin has resisted serious stress tests of its banks.Still, on Friday, euro-zone leaders are expected to approve a watered-down version of the pact, negotiated by the European Council president, Herman Van Rompuy, that eliminates fixed pension ages and wage indexation and gives states more latitude to reach objectives, with monitoring of compliance left unclear. The main fight is about whether to align corporate tax systems, and if so, how to do so.But German officials contend that commitments remaining in the pact are important, that retirement ages and benefit systems should be adjusted to fiscal and demographic realities and that each country must find a way to make debt limits binding, as Berlin has done.Mrs. Merkel is insisting that all three levels represent a package, and that there will be no increase even in the temporary bailout fund unless there is a deal on the pact.A senior French official said: “The Germans have moved far in the last months from their initial position, but they knew they had our support. The face-saving aspect is very important for Germany. A lot of countries are infuriated with Berlin but can’t say so, because they need Germany, so in a way they’re hostages and have to go along.”But it will still be a difficult case for Mrs. Merkel to sell domestically. By the end of the month, another senior European Union official said, “Merkel will have to swallow” an increase in the temporary fund to allow it to lend fully; a non-German as head of the European Central Bank, probably an Italian, Mario Draghi; and a two-sentence change in the Lisbon Treaty that will not produce the binding criteria and penalties Berlin wanted to reinforce fiscal discipline.The euro crisis will not be over, said Henrik Enderlein, a political economist at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. “The result will be a watered-down package that won’t change a lot and won’t end the crisis,” he said.Jean Pisani-Ferry, the director of Bruegel, a Brussels-based economic research institution, said the steps under discussion now were necessary, but were likely to prove insufficient. There still must be an intense effort to create competitiveness in the euro zone, to help the lagging nations of southern Europe liberalize their economies and labor markets, to bring down manufacturing costs and to produce growth.“Even if we do all the right things, how fast will southern Europe catch up?” Mr. Pisani-Ferry asked. “Because it must. If not, these countries will find themselves in permanent unemployment and not growing, and then you will need real transfers to keep the euro zone together.”'"
"'11-03-11,'1','BEIRUT, Lebanon — Saudi police officers opened fire at a protest march in a restive, oil-rich province on Thursday, wounding at least three people, according to witnesses and a Saudi government official. The crackdown came a day before a planned “day of rage” throughout the country that officials have said they will not tolerate.Witnesses described the small protest march in the eastern city of Qatif as peaceful, but an Interior Ministry spokesman said demonstrators had attacked the police before the officers began firing, Reuters reported. The spokesman said that the police fired over the protesters’ heads, but that three people were injured in the melee, including a police officer.Some residents agreed that the police had shot above people’s heads.The clash with protesters in Qatif, located in a heavily Shiite region, underscored longstanding tensions in Saudi society: there is a sense among the Shiite minority that it is discriminated against by a government practicing a zealous form of Sunni orthodoxy. Mohammad Zaki al-Khabbaz, a human rights activist in Qatif who was reached by telephone, said that security forces fired tear gas and shot in the air trying to disperse the crowd.He said an official at a nearby hospital reported that two protesters had been wounded, one in the leg and one in the arm. Mr. Khabbaz said he was told that they were not allowed to receive any visitors.Another resident in Qatif who watched the march, Abdulwahab al-Oraid, said it was not clear why the police opened fire at what appeared to be a peaceful demonstration that started with 100 people and later grew to about 300.'"
"'11-03-11,'1','Adding to the mystery, Renault’s own security officials, who — with the aid of a contact in Algeria — carried out the company’s internal investigation after the men were anonymously denounced, have refused to divulge to either French intelligence or the company their source for the account data.Le Canard Enchaîné, a weekly French publication, reported Wednesday that the company had paid that source 250,000 euros ($345,000) for the initial information, a fact confirmed by the company. Renault said it did not know whom the funds were intended for.Jean Reinhart, a Renault lawyer, said Wednesday on France Inter radio that he expected the investigation to conclude by the end of March.Xavier Thouvenin, a lawyer for one of the accused men, said the latest revelations suggested that Renault had fallen for a con artist who played on the company’s fears. “Whoever was behind it got a little greedy,” Mr. Thouvenin said. “He went after three guys who didn’t just lie down. They said, ‘We’re going to fight this till the end; we’re innocent.’ ”He added: “Now Renault is claiming they’re the victim, but they’re also basically saying they never had any documents, no evidence. They had nothing. Can you imagine firing someone for something like this and not even checking?”Renault filed a criminal complaint for “organized industrial espionage, corruption, breach of trust, theft and concealment.” At the time, a member of the French Parliament spoke of a “Chinese lead” in the case — drawing a chilly response from Beijing — and called for stronger measures to protect national corporate secrets.The espionage was supposedly aimed at the company’s electric car program, an area where Renault and its Japanese ally, Nissan Motor, are seeking to establish themselves as the global leader.But there were signs of problems with the case. To begin with, French government officials, who have a major voice in the company because the state still owns 15 percent of its shares, were furious that Renault had not alerted them or the domestic intelligence service to the case until the automaker had already suspended the three men on Jan. 3. Further, intelligence officials expressed doubt that Renault had the resources at its disposal to investigate in just a few months the complex web of international money transfers through offshore financial centers that it claimed to have discovered.And all of the men strongly maintained their innocence, taking their case to the media and filing defamation suits against the unknown party that had accused them. The three are Michel Balthazard, a member of the management committee and a veteran of more than 30 years with Renault; Bertrand Rochette, Mr. Balthazard’s assistant; and Matthieu Tenenbaum, a former deputy director of the electric car program.Mr. Pélata, No. 2 behind Mr. Ghosn, said during an interview last week with Le Figaro that he would resign if the accusations proved to be false. But Mr. Ghosn’s position could also be in jeopardy. Though he is one of the few chief executives of a French company with worldwide name recognition, he is also among the highest paid, and the French government has not been completely happy with what it sees as Mr. Ghosn’s emphasis on producing overseas.Caroline de Gézelle, a company spokeswoman, said neither Mr. Ghosn nor Mr. Pélata was currently available for interviews. “We’re waiting for the prosecutor to conclude his investigation,” she said. “Justice will be done. If indeed these people are innocent, the company could offer them to be reintegrated. It is too soon to say; there are a lot of possibilities that need to be discussed.”Mr. Tenenbaum said during an interview in January that he wanted nothing more than to return to his job at Renault.But Mr. Balthazard told Le Figaro this week that the experience had been “horrible.”“I saw from this affair the total lack of confidence management had in me,” Mr. Balthazard added. “And to go back to a place where people all wrote me off as guilty is simply unimaginable. There’s no going back to Renault.”'"
"'11-03-11,'1','“It did not strike me a mother’s account closed years ago would present a conflict of interest,” Ms. Schapiro told a subcommittee of the House committee on Oversight and Government Reform. She said that she did not advise Mr. Becker on how to handle the situation, but that she expected Mr. Becker, as a lawyer who had previously worked at the S.E.C., to know that he would need to disclose the situation to the agency’s ethics officer and to follow his advice.She would act differently today, she said, given what she knows now about how the investigation has progressed into the Madoff affair and the recovery of money. “Knowing the things I know now, I wish Mr. Becker had recused himself, absolutely,” she said.As general counsel of the S.E.C., Mr. Becker advised the agency on how to respond to claims of victims of the Madoff scandal who were seeking to get back the money they invested and the additional money they thought they had in their accounts.“On matters like these, I have to be looking around the next corner, looking beyond the horizon, and thinking above and beyond what may be appropriate advice from ethics counsel to make sure nothing occurs that would raise questions about the commission’s missions or processes,” Ms. Schapiro said..She asked the recently appointed ethics counsel of the S.E.C. to conduct a “top-to-bottom review” of its ethics procedures, she said, adding: “We will learn from this experience and will take all actions necessary to earn the trust that the public places in us.”Mr. Becker’s mother invested $500,000 with Mr. Madoff in 2000. She died in 2004, and in 2006 her three sons divided the proceeds of her estate, which included $2 million that was withdrawn from the Madoff account.The hearing had been expected to generate fireworks from the often-combative chairman of the committee, Representative Darrell E. Issa, a California Republican, and other Republicans on the panel. But it was mostly a subdued affair, with no revelations of a smoking gun implicating anyone at the S.E.C. with wrongdoing.In part, that could be because a formal investigation into the situation has only begun. Ms. Schapiro has asked H. David Kotz, the agency’s inspector general, to begin an inquiry, and he is gathering documents and interviewing S.E.C. employees.Ms. Schapiro said specifically that she was unable to consult any notes, e-mails or memos that might pertain to the matter because she had asked the inspector general to begin gathering relevant materials, and therefore her testimony was based only on her memory about the encounters with Mr. Becker.Separately, the S.E.C. released on Thursday a consultant’s report that recommended changes in the agency’s organizational structure and governance to allow it to keep up with rapidly evolving securities markets and the uncertainties caused by the Congressional appropriations process.The agency should strengthen its oversight of self-regulatory organizations in the securities industry and delegate more tasks to those groups, the report said. In addition, the S.E.C. should reconsider its regional model, which leaves some but not all enforcement and oversight functions in regional offices rather than at S.E.C. headquarters.The 263-page organizational study of the S.E.C. by the Boston Consulting Group was mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, the regulatory overhaul passed in July that was a response to the financial crisis. The study also recommends that Congress decide whether it wants to relax constraints on the agency’s funding to allow it to fulfill the missions it has given the S.E.C. or whether it wants to change the S.E.C.’s role to fit the available funding.'"
"'11-03-11,'1','WASHINGTON — One week after President Obama demanded that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi cede power in Libya, the president’s top intelligence official predicted on Thursday, “over the longer term, that the regime will prevail” in Libya’s civil war, an assessment that cast significant doubt on efforts so far by the NATO allies to drive him from power.James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that Colonel Qaddafi has a potentially decisive advantage in arms and equipment that would make itself felt as the conflict wore on.The statements by Mr. Clapper, a retired Air Force general who oversees America’s 16 intelligence services, could limit the Obama administration’s options. So far, only France has recognized the provisional government set up by the rebels, called the Libyan National Council. Mr. Clapper’s assessment that the Libyan leader is unlikely to be dislodged by the rebels — which presumably reflects the briefings Mr. Obama and his top national security advisers have been receiving in recent days — would appear to diminish the chances that that the United States and other NATO allies would follow suit.While Mr. Obama and his aides have spoken of military options, including imposing a no-flight zone over Libya, they have so far limited their concrete actions to imposing new sanctions, freezing assets and monitoring Libyan military communications traffic. They have stopped short of direct military action, even the jamming of communications lines, and Mr. Clapper’s assessment may push both American officials and some allies to the conclusion that efforts to terminate Col. Qaddafi’s 41-year rule in Libya are futile.Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton did say on Thursday that she would planned to meet with Libyan rebel leaders, perhaps during her travel to Tunisia and Egypt next week to press for democratic changes in those countries, or perhaps in Paris or back in Washington.'"
"'11-03-11,'1','A surge in oil prices helped push imports up at the fastest pace in 18 years in January, giving the country the largest trade deficit in six months.The Commerce Department said Thursday that the January deficit increased 15.1 percent to $46.3 billion. Exports rose 2.7 percent to a high of $167.7 billion. But imports rose at a 5.2 percent pace, to $214.1 billion. That reflected a big jump in America’s oil bill, underscoring concerns that surging oil prices could slow the recovery.A widening trade deficit hurts the United States economy. When imports outpace exports, more jobs go to foreign workers than to American workers.The politically sensitive deficit with China rose 12.5 percent to $23.5 billion in January, the largest with any country. Last year, the deficit with China rose to a record $273.1 billion, increasing political pressure in this country to take a tougher line on what critics see as China’s unfair trading practices, like manipulating its currency to gain trade advantages.China, which typically runs huge trade surpluses with the rest of the world, reported a surprise deficit of $7.3 billion for February as surging prices for oil and other commodities pushed imports up 19.4 percent while its exports dropped 2.4 percent.The export decline reflected the fact that Chinese businesses were idled for the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday. Analysts said the rare trade deficit for China was likely to be temporary.'"
"'11-03-11,'1','Mr. Ammann spoke only briefly, saying that investors would see “absolutely more of the same” from G.M. under his guidance.Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group, said he expected Mr. Ammann to continue Mr. Liddell’s focus on eliminating debt, funding its pensions and paving the way for the federal government to sell its stake.Mr. Colas, who worked closely with Mr. Ammann at the investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston in the late 1990s, said he was “as hard working, thorough and honest a guy as I have met covering this industry.” Mr. Amman’s background in covering the automotive industry and his knowledge of its cyclical nature would be an asset, Mr. Colas said. “I’m not crazy about all these changes,” he added, “but at least the right people are getting the right jobs, and there’s some new blood and some new energy in the organization, which it historically hasn’t had.”Mr. Ammann, 38, advised G.M. during its bankruptcy reorganization and played a large role in selling G.M. to investors ahead of the November stock offering, which allowed the Treasury Department to cut its ownership by more than half.Like Mr. Liddell, he is a native of New Zealand, where he was raised on a dairy farm. He joined G.M. a year ago, working out of the company’s New York office, from the investment firm Morgan Stanley, where he was managing director and head of industrials investment banking.“Dan’s depth of knowledge of the financial community and our business will be instrumental as we continue to earn the trust of global investors and customers,” Mr. Akerson said in a statement.Mr. Liddell, 52, who had no automotive experience when he became financial officer in January 2010, helped G.M. earn $4.7 billion last year — its first annual profit since 2004 — and eliminate about $11 billion in debt, beyond the tens of billions that had been wiped out in bankruptcy. Executives also said last month that the company had resolved weaknesses in its financial reporting process, a longstanding concern.Mr. Liddell’s resignation seemed as much of a surprise as his decision to join G.M. The company’s future was murky when he arrived, and he had recently quit as Microsoft’s chief financial officer with aspirations of holding the top job at another technology company.“I don’t think there’s a perfect time to do these sort of things, but I think having a C.F.O. like Dan who’s committed to the long term for the company, for the next five years, is great,” Mr. Liddell said. “He’s ready for the job. I’ve been working with him over the last year with the expectation that this day would come.”Mr. Liddell said he now had “a couple of ideas I’ve been working on” but no specific plans of what he will do next.“I don’t want to be a C.F.O. again,” he said. “I’ve been C.F.O. now of a few public companies, and I really feel like I’ve achieved all I could achieve in the role.”Shares of G.M. fell 2.6 percent Thursday to $31.42, its lowest close since returning to the New York Stock Exchange in November with a share price of $33.“We believe investors had a positive perception of Liddell as C.F.O. and viewed him as a potential C.E.O. candidate in the coming years,” Adam Jonas, an automotive analyst with Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to clients. “This move could also reignite concerns about potential instability in G.M.’s management ranks.”But Mr. Jonas said he thought highly of Mr. Ammann, who “knows the company very well.”'"
"'11-03-11,'1','The hearing room was tiny and crowded, and the drama restrained: at the slightest hint of audience reaction, Mr. King warned that outbursts would not be tolerated. But the hallways bustled with a sideshow of roaming television cameramen and onlookers, from women dressed in to a couple of retirees holding a sign that said “Respect all Religion — Live With Love.”Representative Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who is Muslim, wept as he recounted the story of Mohammed Salman Hamdani, a 23-year-old volunteer medical technician who rushed to help when the World Trade Center was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001 — and died in the building’s collapse. Mr. Ellison barely finished his testimony, breaking down as he described how, when Mr. Hamdani disappeared, his religion fueled suspicions that he was part of the plot — rumors put to rest by the discovery of his remains.But two other witnesses — Melvin Bledsoe, a businessman, and Abdirizak Bihi of the Somali Education and Social Advocacy Center in — offered their own compelling narratives of how their relatives embraced Islamic extremism.“Our children are in danger,” Mr. Bledsoe warned, as he told lawmakers of how his son Carlos had converted to Islam in college and traveled to , where he was “trained and programmed” to kill. After returning to the , he opened fire on a military recruiting center in Little Rock, Ark., killing one soldier and wounding another. Mr. Bihi’s nephew was recruited to , where he died.“It seems to me that Americans are sitting around doing nothing about radical extremists,” Mr. Bledsoe said, adding, “This is a big elephant in the room.”For Mr. King, who convened the hearings after months of planning — and amid intense criticism — the session offered a public forum, as well as a chance to defend himself against religious leaders, civil right advocates and others who have been pressing him to broaden the scope of the effort. He has repeatedly said he would not, and on Thursday, he was defiant.“I’m more convinced than ever that they were appropriate,” he told reporters afterward, adding that he hoped the session would help do away with the “mindless hysteria” of the news media and his detractors.Among those detractors was Representative , a Democrat from , who went after the Republicans’ star witness, Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser, a doctor who, as founder of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, has been deeply critical of fellow Muslims.It was Dr. Jasser who used the cancer analogy; in his testimony, he complained that too often, Muslim leaders counsel Muslims against speaking to law enforcement officials without a lawyer.“The right to have an attorney present when speaking to law enforcement is a specific principle of American civil liberty,” Ms. Sanchez said sharply, adding, “So by what legal principle do you assert that any minority in America should waive that American principle?”Dr. Jasser, who described himself as a devout Muslim, sought to draw a distinction between spiritual Islam and what he called “political Islam” — the notion that a government or country should be run according to principles of Islamic law. He said there was an inherent contradiction between that notion and the American tenet of separation of church and state.But some of his declarations — like his assertion that American Muslim organizations are “circling the wagons” — rankled fellow Muslims, who were also irritated that his nascent organization got the spotlight when better established Muslim groups were passed over.“We’ve been working on this issue even prior to 9/11,” said Haris Tarin, director of the Washington office for the Muslim Public Affairs Council. Mr. Tarin said his group’s leaders recently participated in a seminar for law enforcement agents on countering Islamic radicalization — a point Sheriff Baca brought up.If Dr. Jasser was the Republicans’ star, the sheriff was the Democrats’. He said Muslims often cooperated as individuals, “without the cover” of organizations. “The truth is that Muslims are just as independent, just as feisty, just as concerned about safety,” he said. “They certainly don’t want their homes or their mosques blown up.”Before the proceedings ended, a group of Christian, Jewish and Muslim religious leaders gathered in a room downstairs to denounce them as counterproductive for singling out Muslims. But at the same time, they said they were pleased with testimony that focused on how much Muslims do cooperate with law enforcement.“We do believe there’s an element targeting our youth and our communities,” said Imam Mohamed Hagmagid Ali, president of the Islamic Society of North America. “But we are saying Muslims are really engaged in this fight.”Mr. King intends to hold additional sessions over the next year and a half, he said, on issues including radicalization in American prisons and the flow of foreign money into mosques.As Thursday’s session wound down, one attendee, Laurie Jagh, who works for a nonprofit group and lives in the Northern Virginia suburbs, home to a large Muslim population, said she was left with one overarching impression.“I was struck,” she said, “by how divided we are as a country.”'"

"'11-03-12,'0','We are happy to hear that President Obama has decided to restart a pilot program that will allow Mexican trucks to carry goods across the United States. We hope the announcement, which was made last week during a Washington visit by President Felipe Calderón of Mexico, puts an end to Washington’s breach of its obligations under the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement.Nafta promised to open shipping between the United States and Mexico to carriers from both countries, starting with the border states in 1995 and expanding to the entire country in 2000. The Teamsters union — fearing the competition — immediately objected that Mexican trucks are unsafe. President Bill Clinton, bowing to the union’s power, refused to implement that part of the deal — stopping the Department of Transportation from processing applications from Mexican truckers.In 2007, President George W. Bush finally started a pilot program to allow some Mexican truckers through and monitor their performance. The Transportation Department found that Mexican trucks and drivers operating here had fewer safety violations than their American counterparts. But soon after taking office, President Obama nixed the program. Mexico retaliated with $2.4 billion in punitive tariffs on American exports.Suddenly, the Teamsters weren’t the only ones with an opinion. Senator Patty Murray of Washington — apples from her state were on the tariff list — took the side of Mexican truckers. So did American pork producers, big equipment companies and other affected industries.The deal announced by President Obama is not yet fully done. The terms are similar to those in 2007: Mexican carriers whose trucks and drivers meet certain safety requirements will be allowed to transport goods from Mexico across the United States. But the two countries are still working to define exact safety criteria, as well as the statistical standards to determine when it can be made permanent. Then the administration must submit the deal for public comment before it is formalized.Not surprisingly, the Mexican government remains cautious. It will only lift half the tariffs when the deal is signed. The other half will come off when the first Mexican trucker is allowed into the United States.'"

"'11-03-12,'0','Hard-pressed Americans are understandably concerned about rising gasoline prices. Republicans predictably are trying to use that anxiety to promote their drill-anywhere-and-everywhere agenda. At his press conference on Friday, President Obama wisely chose not to pander to the appetite for quick or destructive fixes.He resisted calls to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, saying he would do so only when oil supplies were genuinely threatened. He delivered instead a measured tutorial on this country’s need to make itself less dependent on foreign oil, while reminding Americans that a nation that consumes one-quarter of the world’s oil while owning 2 percent of its reserves cannot drill its way to energy independence.This is what leaders do — seize a moment when something like a spike in prices at the pump has grabbed public attention and use it to instruct on larger issues, in this case the need for a saner energy policy and a cleaner energy future. Mr. Obama is good at that.But there is another thing that leaders do, and that is to push and pull and knock heads and do whatever else is required to make sure those goals are achieved. And on this score, Mr. Obama often falls short, especially on important energy issues.Case in point: the climate debate last year, which he framed beautifully in his speeches but then tiptoed away from. A few outgunned senators were left to try to get an actual bill passed and, unfortunately, failed.'"
"'11-03-12,'0','This is a fair question, to which another might be added: Why it is necessary to pay between $1.5 million and $2 million annually in salary to Mr. Rosen, and proportionally robust salaries to his top assistants?He is the chief executive of Jamaica Hospital, Flushing Hospital, Brookdale Hospital, and of MediSys, a management company that oversees hospitals. The hospitals are private, but supported heavily or entirely by public financing.By comparison, the head of the city hospital system is paid $351,000. Mr. Rosen’s salary was approved by the hospital boards after a compensation firm evaluated the appropriate levels, a spokesman for MediSys said on Friday. Mr. Rosen has been working in health care since 1970, which has included periods of rapid escalation in executive salaries.Nevertheless, New York State, which pays nearly every dime of Mr. Rosen’s wages, has nothing to say about his compensation. That would not change even after an overhaul of the Medicaid system recommended by a task force working for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.The question of bribes to politicians by hospital executives surfaced in 2008, with the arrest of Anthony Seminerio, a member of the Assembly from Queens who had been paid more than $400,000 by Mr. Rosen as a consultant.From that point on, the hospitals under Mr. Rosen hired teams of criminal defense lawyers to represent various executives and the boards. Much of that cost has been covered through director and officer insurance — bought, of course, with taxpayer money — as well as more than $1 million in fees directly paid by the hospital. In 2009, a year into the criminal investigation, the in-house counsel for the hospitals, Margo Johnson, became concerned that the interests of the hospital were not being served by a lawyer who was reporting to Mr. Rosen on the investigation. She was fired, and has since sued.Mr. Morvillo said that her case had no merit, and that it was natural for the board and its criminal lawyer to consult with Mr. Rosen about the progress of the investigation, since they all believed that no charges were warranted. He has asked that her suit be dismissed.However, Ms. Johnson said in an e-mail that her lawsuit “will shine a light on the culture of corruption that exists in Albany and its detrimental effect on health care in New York City.”A larger question, she wrote, “is about corporate governance, the fiduciary responsibility of not-for-profit boards, and the steps individuals will take to block transparency in an effort to protect their self-interest.”The announcement of the charges against Mr. Kruger, Mr. Rosen and others has led to calls for Governor Cuomo to seize the moment and demand more ethics reform. More ethics is always good, probably, but we should not count on grafters to suddenly start listing “bribes” under “other income” on financial-disclosure forms.The Kruger case involves $1 million or so in bribes; the legal fees are several times that. The wages of sin apparently are pretty good. But poverty is a business that pays even better.'"
"'11-03-12,'0','Parents in a wealthy suburban Kansas City school district cannot seek to raise property taxes above a state limit because it could bring down the state’s entire school financing system, a federal judge ruled Friday. Parents in the Shawnee Mission district claimed in a lawsuit that state school financing was inadequate; they sought a temporary injunction that would allow the district to ask voters for a local tax increase. But Judge John W.

The local option tax is capped so wealthy districts do not have an unfair advantage over poorer ones.'"
"'11-03-12,'0','The House speaker, John A. Boehner, who has led Congressional Republicans in using the recent price increases to ratchet up political criticism of the president’s energy policies, accused the administration of blocking new oil and gas production by slowing the granting of offshore permits and declaring some public lands off-limits to drilling.“While the Obama administration claims to be committed to American energy production, the facts and its own actions say otherwise,” Mr. Boehner said after the president spoke.Mr. Obama’s response to the oil price spike echoed what he said during the 2008 presidential campaign, when prices rose even higher than they are today: that the nation alternates between shock and trance on energy policy, depending on the price of a gallon of gasoline.“We’ve been having this conversation for nearly four decades now,” Mr. Obama said Friday. “Every few years, gas prices go up; politicians pull out the same old political playbook, and then nothing changes. When prices go back down, we slip back into a trance. And then when prices go up, suddenly we’re shocked. I think the American people are tired of that. I think they’re tired of talk.”Mr. Obama also tried to calm oil and financial markets that have been spooked in recent weeks by unrest in Egypt, Libya and elsewhere in the Middle East. He said that he was working with other oil-producing nations to ensure a steady supply of oil so that economic growth is not slowed by higher prices.The president said he was prepared to open the spigot on the 727-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve if there were a sudden and more severe supply disruption than has occurred to date. But he declined to specify what price gas would have to hit before the government would tap the reserve.He cited the 1970s oil embargo and the refinery shutdowns caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 as appropriate thresholds for using the reserve.“If we see significant disruptions or shifts in the market that are so disconcerting to people that we think a Strategic Petroleum Reserve release might be appropriate, then we’ll take that step,” he said. He added that a potential release is “teed up,” so that it would take only a few days to start the oil flowing if he decided to take that step.As gas prices have climbed in recent weeks, Republicans in Congress and oil industry executives have grown increasingly vocal in their complaints about the drilling policy, saying that the Interior Department overreacted to the Deepwater Horizon explosion and subsequent oil spill by temporarily halting all new offshore drilling.Oil production in the gulf is projected to decline this year and next, partly as a result of the moratorium.But Mr. Obama said Friday that the department had granted 37 new permits for wells in shallow water and recently approved one new deepwater permit as companies have come into compliance with tougher new safety and environmental rules. Officials have said they are prepared to act quickly on a half-dozen other pending permit applications as soon as oil companies demonstrate they have the capability of responding to a major accident.“We are encouraging offshore exploration and production,” Mr. Obama said. “We’re just doing it responsibly. I don’t think anybody has forgotten that we’re only a few months removed from the worst oil spill in our history. So what we’ve done is to put in place common-sense standards like proving that companies can actually contain an underwater spill.”The president also noted that oil companies have unused leases on millions of acres of public land.'"
"'11-03-12,'0','Mark your calendars and place your bets: The producers of Broadway’s “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” have picked a new date, June 14, for their opening night, which has now been delayed six times.The $65-million-and-counting musical will end up having more than 180 preview performances — the most in history — under the new schedule.The producers, Michael Cohl and Jeremiah J. Harris, announced on Friday evening that “Spider-Man” is also canceling about three weeks of performances, from April 19 through May 11, to provide time for their newly hired creative team to rehearse “significant and exciting revisions” to the musical.The producers have barely begun mapping out the precise revisions, though a new script doctor, the playwright and comic-book writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, has been working on rewrites since February.The June 14 opening night would be two days after the 2011 Tony Awards. That usually is the biggest media event of the year for Broadway, but now the ceremony will have to compete with — and risk being overshadowed by — the continuing “Spider-Man” saga.'"
"'11-03-12,'0','The United States took a strident tone with China this week, chastising it over the wave of detentions.“The United States is increasingly concerned by the apparent extralegal detention and enforced disappearance of some of China’s most well-known lawyers and activists, many of whom have been missing since mid-February,” Philip J. Crowley, the State Department spokesman, said at a news conference on Tuesday. “We have expressed our concern to the Chinese government over the use of extralegal punishments against these and other human rights activists.”Chinese officials have avoided questions about the detentions and specific detainees. The overseas edition of People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, said in an editorial about China and the Middle East uprisings on Thursday: “A number of people with ulterior motives both inside and outside China are conspiring to divert the troubled waters toward China. They have used the Internet to fan the flames, hoping to whip up ‘street politics’ in China and thereby sow chaos in China.”China Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group, said Friday that 17 Chinese had been detained in connection with the calls for a so-called Jasmine Revolution (a term borrowed from the Tunisia uprising) and were being investigated for crimes. Among them is Ran Yunfei, a writer and blogger from Sichuan Province. Such investigations often result in criminal prosecution.The group has also documented scores of other detentions and disappearances across China. Some people are missing, and some are under “soft detention” in their homes, an increasingly common form of confinement.Zhang Jiannan, the founder of a popular Internet forum who was active on Twitter, was detained last week and put under criminal investigation, a friend of his said Friday. The forum, 1984bbs.com, was shuttered last fall. It was not clear why he was seized or of what crime he was suspected.Among those who have “been disappeared” into an extralegal vacuum, as liberal Chinese describe it, are six lawyers who often take on rights cases. They are Tang Jitian, Jiang Tianyong and Mr. Teng from Beijing; Liu Shihui and Tang Jinglin from Guangzhou; and Li Tiantian from Shanghai. Mr. Tang was taken away on Feb. 16, and Mr. Jiang and Mr. Teng both vanished on Feb. 19. Gu Chuan, an activist writer in Beijing, also disappeared during that period. That round of detentions took place after a group of lawyers and rights advocates met in Beijing on Feb. 16 to discuss the case of Chen Guangcheng, a blind lawyer under strict house arrest in rural Shandong Province.The detainees have probably been kept so long because the calls for a Jasmine Revolution began percolating on the Internet that same week, and then the meetings of the National People’s Congress and consultative legislature opened on March 5.Relatives and supporters say they hope the detainees will be released after the legislative sessions end Monday, but scholars say that the use of extralegal detention has been widening, in conjunction with a rollback of legal rights, and that the long disappearances could be a new status quo. The targets are often the tiny fraction of China’s 170,000 lawyers who push for legal reform and enforcement of the Constitution.“What’s disturbing with some of these lawyers or ex-lawyers, the government seems to be increasingly treating them lawlessly,” said Jerome A. Cohen, a professor at New York University who studies China’s legal system.“I think it’s all part of the accelerating trend,” he added. “It started with the 17th Party Congress in fall of 2007. You had a new party line, one that was much tighter. They’re looking for a comprehensive method of social management. There’s a new formula.”Eva Pils, an associate professor of law at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that the long silences were unusual and that “there’s a very great concern about the treatment during their period of enforced disappearance.”Perhaps the most serious recent case is that of Gao Zhisheng, a rights lawyer who spoke of being pummeled with electric batons and burned with cigarettes during one round of detention in 2007. He has since been subjected to further enforced disappearances, the latest beginning in April 2010.Mr. Teng, the Beijing lawyer, wrote an essay in December about being beaten during a brief detention that month. At one point, he said, a plainclothes officer said to a policeman: “Why waste words on this sort of person? Let’s beat him to death and dig a hole to bury him in and be done with it.”'"

"'11-03-12,'0','Asked when that might occur, he said, “it could be next year, it could be in 10 years.”The Russian press on Friday reported Mr. Putin’s proposal as top news from Mr. Biden’s visit, shifting the focus from coverage of the vice president’s public criticism of Russia’s legal and political systems. One report the next day suggested the prime minister had succeeded in disarming his visitor.In the daily newspaper Kommersant, a reporter, Andrei Kolesnikov, took some liberties with the moment, telling readers: “ ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Biden, quickly writing something in his notebook (either Mr. Putin’s idea, or some phrase like, ‘Joe, get ahold of yourself! Give him a good answer! You are the vice president of a great country!’)”Dmitri V. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said Mr. Putin’s suggestion was probably aimed at dominating Friday’s news cycle. He described it as a “successful operation.”“As a way to attract attention, yes, it worked,” Mr. Trenin said. “As a way to knock someone off course, maybe it also worked.”Interactions between Mr. Putin and foreign leaders are scrutinized here as an especially revealing type of political theater. It was 10 years ago that President George W. Bush remarked warmly, after one of his first meetings with a still little-known Mr. Putin, “I looked the man in the eye. I was able to get a sense of his soul.”When President Obama visited Russia in July 2009, his breakfast with Mr. Putin ran for two hours, the first of which was largely an uninterrupted monologue by Mr. Putin, aides said afterward.After, Mr. Putin and Mr. Biden met privately for 15 minutes in Mr. Putin’s office. On Thursday, a senior American administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described the meeting as “a serious discussion about serious issues,” including cooperation on missile defense, accession to the World Trade Organization, Georgia, Afghanistan and energy.On Friday, Mr. Biden continued to Moldova, a former Soviet republic where a pro-Western coalition took power in 2009, displacing an old-guard Communist leadership. Addressing an overflow crowd in Opera House Square in the capital, Chisnau, where young demonstrators gathered two years ago in what became known as the “Twitter Revolution,” Mr. Biden linked Moldova’s transition to the uprisings that have upended North Africa and the Middle East.He said he was glad “to be here at this transformative moment in your history, and quite frankly in the history of the world. Freedom is in the air, and democracy is emerging in countries that for generations have known nothing but authoritarian rule.”'"
"'11-03-12,'0','For a third time this season, the Knicks’ Amar’e Stoudemire received a reprieve from the N.B.A. when it reviewed and expunged his latest technical foul. The decision Friday will allow him to play Sunday against the Indiana Pacers.If it had stood, the technical foul he received in the second quarter of Thursday’s loss to the Dallas Mavericks would have been his 16th of the season, earning him an automatic one-game suspension. Stoudemire and Brendan Haywood received double-technicals from the official Bennett Salvatore when they became tangled beneath the basket. Haywood also had his technical expunged.Knicks Coach Mike D’Antoni drew a technical for arguing in Stoudemire’s defense, but soon after, Stoudemire, Haywood and Salvatore laughed together. After the game, Stoudemire said that Haywood was a close friend and that neither had ill intent on the play.The last technical that Stoudemire received that still stands came Feb. 23, in Carmelo Anthony’s first game as a Knick. Stoudemire has attributed the bulk of his technical foul issues to the league’s new policy of giving quicker technical fouls in an effort to dissuade players from bickering with officials over calls.Players receive a one-game suspension at their 16th technical and sit out another game for every two technicals afterward.They are also docked $5,000 for every technical received after their 15th.Orlando’s Dwight Howard became the first player to reach the threshold, and sat out Monday’s loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. Anthony has 12 technical fouls this season.'"
"'11-03-12,'0','Mr. Awad said Thursday’s hearing, called by Mr. King, was “political theater” intended to score points, not to elucidate facts. “No one is more concerned about terrorism in the United States than we are,” Mr. Awad said. This is in part because Muslim Americans face a backlash every time a Muslim is accused of plotting or carrying out terrorism in the United States.“We have nothing to do with radicalizing young men,” he said.Indeed, some of the statements about CAIR at the hearing were oversimplified at best. Mr. King noted, for example, that CAIR was listed as an “unindicted co-conspirator or joint venturer” in a terrorism financing case against a charity, the Holy Land Foundation — but so were more than 200 other groups and individuals. CAIR was not accused of a crime.Mr. Wolf mentioned that a poster declaring “Build a wall of resistance — Don’t talk to the F.B.I.” had appeared on the Web site of the group’s California chapter. But the poster had been created by non-Muslim activists in the 1970s, and CAIR officials took it down after a few days, saying it did not represent the group’s policy.CAIR has had a tense relationship with the F.B.I. and on occasion has urged Muslims not to talk to law enforcement officials without a lawyer present, a caution Mr. Awad said was very much in keeping with the American system of justice. “As a civil rights organization,” he said, “we have the difficult job of encouraging constitutionally informed cooperation with law enforcement.”CAIR, along with other advocacy groups, has complained about the F.B.I.’s use of informers who pose as militants from Al Qaeda or similar groups, saying the government uses them in effect to draw young Muslim men into militancy.Last month, the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, said that the bureau had no “formal relationship” with CAIR, but that the organization’s officials and chapters regularly worked with F.B.I. officials on investigations and related matters. This included a news conference held on Thursday in Sacramento to announce an arrest in a mosque vandalism case.CAIR officials also note that they went immediately to the F.B.I. in 2009 when they were approached by the parents of five young Muslim men in Virginia who had disappeared. The men turned up in Pakistan, where they were reportedly trying to join the fight against American troops in Afghanistan.Founded in 1994, CAIR has 34 chapters around the country and has focused on combating discrimination and violence against Muslims. It has been dogged by accusations that some of its leaders, including Mr. Awad, have old connections to Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, or the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group founded in Egypt that advocates for Islamic government.But especially when hostility to Muslims has flared, after the Sept. 11 attacks or during last year’s controversy over plans for an Islamic center near ground zero in Manhattan, CAIR has thrived, said Akbar S. Ahmed, chairman of Islamic studies at American University and author of “Journey into America: The Challenge of Islam.”“Especially after 9/11, Muslims in this country felt very much under siege, and they saw CAIR as their champion,” Mr. Ahmed said. He dismissed efforts by the group’s critics to link it to terrorism. “Everyone can be linked by the seventh degree to someone who’s an extremist,” he said.But he faulted CAIR for its energetic attacks on Mr. King and his hearing, saying that like the Republican congressman, the group used the conflict over the hearing to rally its own political base.“My criticism is that CAIR could have helped bring down the temperature,” Mr. Ahmed said. “It shouldn’t present such a starkly polarized picture. That just widens the gap between Muslims and non-Muslims.”'"
"'11-03-12,'0','Squeezed among the United Nations Palace, the U.S. and Italian diplomatic missions and the city’s Botanical Gardens, whose staff tends its grounds, Château de Penthes occupies a prize location in a city in which good real estate is scarce, real estate values have soared and zoning laws are strict.The site has about nine hectares, or 22 acres, of tree-dotted land, open to the public, offering panoramic views over Lake Léman and of Mont Blanc. For many residents, the domain’s gardens offer bucolic relief in an increasingly crowded city. It is particularly popular with dog walkers and, in the summer, with families. The site was bought by the canton in 1972 from Louis Birkigt, whose father had created an industrial empire in Spain around the turn of the last century. Previously it had passed between noble local families with names rooted in the city’s past, like de Sacconey, de Charrière and Sarasin.The grounds have been run by the Foundation for the History of the Swiss Abroad since 1981, when it was awarded the 30-year, rent-free lease. Soon after that, the museum opened.The foundation depends on the canton, generous benefactors and income from the restaurant. The museum has about 6,000 visitors a year, a figure that it is seeking to increase through investment, and generates about 2 million Swiss francs, or $2.1 million, in revenue annually. It estimates that it has poured about 10 million francs into the buildings.Benedict von Tscharner, the foundation’s president, and his backers say they have been trying to get a response from the canton on its plans since 2008. Last May, the canton established a group to study the options, promising a report by the end of last year.But Mr. von Tscharner is still waiting. The museum needs stability for three or four years to plan exhibitions, some of which are now postponed, to work on the buildings and to raise necessary funds.“Initially we had a relatively positive response, but something happened — there was a reflection about the site and the role that it could play for ‘international Geneva.’ Now we don’t know where we stand,” said Mr. von Tscharner, a former Swiss ambassador to the European Union and France. “We really need a decision. There’s been a frustrating repetition of delayed reactions and withheld information. We might be dead by the time they come up with a decision.”Mr. Coutau of the canton said plans for the site would fall together in the coming months, probably after a formal call for bids, and a decision would be made by the canton’s cabinet by the end of this year.There has been another potential complication: the recent publication in the local media of a damning audit from the canton’s finance inspection department, which disclosed that the government had been leasing some of its prime properties to former politicians or civil servants for a fraction of their market value.This has brought a stinging political and media response given the extreme housing shortage and the high rents in Geneva, and has thrown the spotlight on how the government manages its properties. Le Temps, a French-language Swiss newspaper, said that the scandal “shocks, irritates and has set tongues wagging” in a canton weighed down by a real estate crisis.Geneva already is home to 165 diplomatic missions, 23 international organizations and 250 nongovernmental organizations. An estimated 30,000 people work for nongovernmental organizations and diplomatic missions in the city. The local government extends incentives for international and diplomatic missions, including waiving rents and arranging favorable financing.Yet that may not be enough. A message is filtering down from the top that Geneva needs to become more competitive to retain its place as an attractive location for international organizations, faced with competition from the Middle East and Asia and worries that the strong Swiss franc and the scarcity of real estate might drive away prized international guests.During a speech in October, the Swiss foreign minister, Micheline Calmy-Rey, who is the president this year, said it was “worrying” that Geneva was being held back from a more important global role by the shortage of local infrastructure. She called on the local authorities to react. And the museum might be an early victim of this push.Mr. Coutau said Geneva lacked a location where diplomats and experts could discuss “the issues” in a relaxed, private space. “There is no place where these people can sit and talk about their priorities for the next five years,” he said. “The idea would be to create a kind of permanent workshop, a kind of think tank.”The thinking appears to be based in part on Wilton Park, an agency of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office that serves as a retreat for off-the-record diplomatic discussions on global themes.Mr. Coutau said a number of international partners were interested in developing the site. He would not name them, but he said some were in the private sector. Public access to the site and a restaurant would be retained, he added.The foundation could develop its own proposals for the site with or without partners, he said, and would “not necessarily” have to leave the site. “I think local people are proud of Geneva’s international vocation,” he said.That may be true, but there are complaints.“They’re nibbling away at us,” a women walking her dog in the domain on a recent morning said of the local government. “We have the U.N. and the other organizations. It’s for the prestige of Geneva. But it’s the locals who get squeezed out. The city’s losing its soul.” She requested anonymity because she did not want to compromise her son, a civil servant.Mr. von Tscharner said the foundation’s options were to stay and try to share the site, to relocate the museum or close it and retain a foundation. The foundation has collected 2,500 signatures of support, won backing from local lawmakers who “invited” the government to keep the museum on the site, and found a nongovernment partner, the Media21 Global Journalism Network Geneva, willing to develop the site in tandem.But it remains in the dark, unsure of what will happen to the museum, which is backed by donors like the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, which manages Rolex’s philanthropic activities.The museum’s permanent collection includes original documents, paintings and a host of relics that form part of Switzerland’s international heritage from the 15th century. It focuses on early Swiss diplomacy in Europe; the mercenaries who served Britain, France, the Netherlands and the Italian city states; the Company of the Hundred Swiss, who guarded the French monarchy; and the Pontifical Swiss Guards.Temporary exhibitions have included the carmaker Louis Chevrolet; Albert Gallatin, the U.S. Treasury secretary under President Thomas Jefferson; and the clown Grock.“We want the museum to stay as a bridge between Switzerland and the international community” Mr. von Tscharner said. “International Geneva shouldn’t be a gated community.”'"
"'11-03-12,'0','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Retail sales in February posted the largest gain in four months, but a slump in consumer confidence in early March on rising gasoline prices raised concerns that spending would decline.Sales rose 1.0 percent, in an eighth consecutive month of gains, as shoppers stepped up purchases of autos, clothes and other goods even as they spent more for gasoline, the Commerce Department said on Friday.But rising gasoline prices sent consumer confidence tumbling to a five-month low in early March, a separate report showed.“The last few weeks have been difficult for consumers. We are likely going to see weaker spending in March,” said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pa. “High gas prices will impede the recovery, but won’t derail it. It’s a speed bump.”While consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the nation’s economic activity, was expected to moderate after growing at a 4.1 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, economists said rising gasoline prices could cause a much bigger pullback than had been anticipated.'"
"'11-03-12,'0','Cargo shippers reported that major Japanese ports were closed, though the shutdowns may be precautionary. The country’s major seaports, most of them south of Tokyo, play a crucial role in Japan’s export-driven economy. Japanese exports — chiefly automobiles, machinery and manufactured goods — rose by almost 25 percent in 2010, the first increase in three years, and a lengthy shutdown could create costly delays up and down the global supply chain. Several airports, including Tokyo’s Narita, had been closed.Carl Weinberg, chief economist at the New York-based research firm, High Frequency Economics, said the damage to the world’s third-largest economy would have consequences beyond Japan’s shores.“There is no way to assess even the direct damage to Japan’s economy, or to the global economy, that this will cause,” Mr. Weinberg said. Damage in Japan “will impact the people and businesses to whom money is owed, regardless of where they may be — in Japan or in New York City.”The Japanese central bank said on its Web site that it would continue to assess any possible fallout on financial operations, and stood “ready to take action as necessary.”Over all though, the bulk of industrial Japan appeared to have been spared, said an economist in Hong Kong, who had been in touch with his colleagues in Japan but asked not to be identified as he was not authorized by his bank to talk about Japan.One concern was the Cosmo Oil refinery near Tokyo, which had been burning out of control with 100-foot flames whipping into the sky, according to media reports. At least four refineries capable of refining 950,000 barrels a day have suffered damages or are not fully functioning, but experts say it is hard to know how long they will be out.Many power generating operations reported disruptions and several nuclear power stations were shut down. The Japanese government declared an “atomic power emergency” at a nuclear plant in northern Japan and evacuated nearby residents. No radiation leaks had been reported and officials described the evacuation as precautionary.Automakers reported damage to some factories and offices, and Honda said one employee was killed at a research and development center in Tochigi, north of Tokyo, when a wall collapsed.More than 30 Honda employees and 2 Nissan employees in Tochigi were injured. Honda’s assembly plant in Sayama will be closed through Monday, but a plant in Suzuka remained open. Nissan has suspended operations in Japan through at least Sunday.Toyota, which reported no casualties, said its Japanese plants had resumed production after a brief stoppage but that four subsidiary plants were closed while their workers were evacuated.All three companies build a large percentage of the vehicles they sell to American customers in the United States, though some parts are exported from Japan.Honda and Nissan said they did not anticipate any immediate effects on their North American businesses. Honda, in a statement, said the “vast majority of our parts for these operations are produced in America as well,” but that it needed to assess any long-term effects.The popular Toyota Prius hybrid car is built only in Japan, and some Corolla compact cars come from Japan, though it also is assembled in Canada.A representative for Sony, based in Tokyo, said the company had shut down its six northern plants, which make Lithium-ion batteries and Blu-Ray parts.Other companies, including Fuji Heavy Industries, Bridgestone and several steel mills, reported production halts, while Reuters said that the electronics company, Fujitsu, reported some damage to a facility.In a statement, Joe Adachi, chief executive of Canon U.S.A., said there had “been a limited amount of injuries at our Utsunomiya Office, located in Tochigi prefecture, and there has been a limited amount of damage to our facilities.”Initial reports, however, suggested that Tokyo, the financial center, had not been badly damaged.“We have 1,800 employees in Tokyo, and they were all safely evacuated. Our initial assessment of our buildings in Tokyo reveals only minor damage. There has also been no damage to the Firm’s local data centers,” two Morgan Stanley senior executives, James P. Gorman and Paul J. Taubman, wrote in a note to employees.In a note to employees, senior management at Credit Suisse said no injuries had been reported among its employees and that “damage to our Tokyo offices is superficial.” Goldman Sachs also reported no injuries among its employees.The firms, however, said that were still assessing the situation and things could change.Pat Sloan at the Omnicom Group advertising company, said “People were in the offices when it happened. Some managed to get home but some still are in their offices as transportation is difficult.”Miyagi, the prefecture that is home to Sendai and the areas most affected by the quake, accounts for 1.7 percent of the Japanese population and the same proportion of gross domestic product, while the region of Tohoku as a whole is about 8 percent of G.D.P., Richard Jerram, chief Asia economist at Macquarie, wrote in a research note.“Inevitably there will be microeconomic disruptions, as there were after Kobe and even Chuetsu,” Mr. Jerram wrote, referring to other powerful earthquakes that had hit Japan in recent years. “However, many firms reportedly diversified supply chains in the wake of Kobe, so the impact should be lower.”The region hit by the tsunami is known for growing rice, and other rice-growing areas around the Pacific Rim may see coastal flooding at a time of already rising world food prices.Ben Savage, the managing director for rice at Jackson Son & Company in London, one of the world’s oldest rice brokerage houses, said that the tsunami was unlikely to have much of an effect on global rice prices because rice tends to be fairly tolerant of the temporary ingress of salt water into paddies.Christopher Gerteis, an expert in contemporary Japan at the School of Oriental and Asian Studies in London, said the region largely depended on local fisheries for their food, and that the cost of reconstruction would include reclaiming the fishing fleet.'"
"'11-03-12,'0','And since China is now a major engine of global growth — and the world’s second-largest economy — any slowdown is likely to be felt in the rest of the world.Aware that soaring food and housing prices are creating anxiety at home, the government has made fighting inflation a priority and set a target to keep the rate at 4 percent.Last year, when the economy grew at an annual rate of 10.3 percent, China’s consumer price index rose by 3.3 percent. But in the final three months of last year, the index rose sharply, to 5.1 percent in November, a 28-month high.This year, the Chinese government lowered its economic growth target to 7 percent. To tame inflation, the government has ordered state banks to restrain lending and to raise interest rates. China has also offered aid and subsidies to farmers.But slowing inflation has proved difficult, partly because inflation is tied to rising oil and commodity prices. Economists say they expect food and commodity prices to continue to climb early this year.“Inflation remains at an elevated level and it has not peaked yet,” Wang Qing, a Hong Kong-based economist at Morgan Stanley, said. “We think inflation will rebound in April or May and peak midyear.”Mr. Wang says, however, that the government’s effort to fight inflation may begin to pay off in the latter part of the year, and eventually bring the annual inflation rate down to 4.5 percent.But for now, the public is anxious about food and housing prices that are often rising faster than incomes. And with saving deposit rates in China kept unusually low by state-run banks, many people are seeing the value of their savings erode by what are essentially negative returns.For instance, inflation rose 3.3 percent last year, according to the consumer price index. But during much of the year state banks were paying rates of 2 percent or less for money held in one-year deposits.Coping with inflation is just one of the many challenges facing economic planners in Beijing. To encourage more sustainable growth, the government is trying to rebalance the economy by moving away from heavy reliance on investment and exports and toward more domestic consumption.Encouraging consumption is part of a broader effort aimed at improving the livelihoods of common people and shrinking the widening gap from rich to poor.The government, for example, recently promised to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build affordable housing, while contributing large sums of money to health and welfare programs and also raising minimum wage standards.But for China, restructuring the economy also means coping with growing complaints from its major trading partners, who say the renminbi, the Chinese currency, is undervalued, which gives China an unfair advantage.Chinese authorities insist the renminbi is not significantly undervalued and that any adjustments must be gradual because a sharp rise in the value of the renminbi could bankrupt coastal factories that employ tens of millions of workers.Lately, though, Chinese officials have begun to hint that the nation’s huge trade surplus — which was about $183 billion last year — will diminish this year. On Thursday, the government reported a rare monthly trade deficit of $7.3 billion for February. Many analysts, though, say the deficit was an aberration linked to volatile early-year shipments that were disrupted by the Chinese New Year holiday.The government’s chief worry, though, seems to be containing inflation and managing growth. Analysts say if inflationary pressure rises too sharply, or growth slows too sharply, public sentiment could turn against the leadership.“Inflation will continue to be a problem, but it won’t do the economy in,” said Pieter P. Bottelier, an adjunct professor of China Studies at Johns Hopkins University. “But it worsens already huge social inequalities and housing affordability problems. This could breed so much resentment. I’m worried about the social implications.”'"

"'11-03-13,'0','AS our government teeters on the brink of a shutdown, and Congress and the president haggle over spending cuts, the Pentagon budget should be scoured for places where significant reductions may be made. Not the handful of trims alluded to by Defense Secretary Robert Gates — $78 billion over the next five years, with these savings simply used to shore up spending on other acquisitions — but major cuts to systems that don’t work very well or that are not really going to be needed for decades to come.Unworkable or unnecessary systems tend to have something in common: their costs are often uncontrollable. A 2009 Government Accountability Office study of 96 major defense acquisition programs found that almost two-thirds of them suffered major cost overruns — 40 percent above contract prices, over all — with average delays of nearly two years. Those overruns totaled close to $300 billion, about the amount of President Bill Clinton’s last full defense budget request a decade ago.Listed below is just a sampling of what systems could be ended without endangering America; indeed, abandoning some of them might actually enhance national security. These cuts would generate only small savings initially — perhaps just several billion this fiscal year, as contracts would have to be wound down. But savings would swiftly rise to more than $50 billion annually thereafter.And there’s plenty more where these came from.— JOHN ARQUILLA, professor of defense analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School and author of “Worst Enemy: The Reluctant Transformation of the American Military”'"

"'11-03-13,'0','As gasoline prices race toward $4 a gallon, jumping 37 cents in the last two weeks, Chicago’s Department of Fleet Management is benefiting from forward contracts that locked in some of the city’s unleaded and diesel purchases before prices spiked.All together, the city could be in a position to save $1.3 million on fuel purchases in 2011 if prices follow projections made by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a CNC analysis shows. If prices were to hit $4 a gallon on April 1 and not fall back through year end, the savings would top $1.8 million, or 5 percent of the total fuel bill, had the city not locked in prices.For March through June, the city has locked in 50 percent of unleaded gas at $3.242 per gallon and diesel at $3.52. The city also has contracts for July through December to buy 25 percent of its unleaded gas at $3.028 per gallon and diesel at $3.35 — the same prices paid in January and February under identical deals.Contracts like these, said Eileen Joyce, an assistant commissioner at Fleet Management, are a part of efforts to protect budgets against rising gas prices.The city in 2004 began switching its fleet of 12,400 vehicles toward more that run on E85, a blended fuel of up to 85 percent ethanol that reduces carbon dioxide emissions. It is ahead of plan on both vehicle and E85 fuel purchases. But unlike gas and diesel, there is no forward contracting for E85 fuel, Ms. Joyce said. That leaves all E85 purchases vulnerable to a steep rise in prices.'"
"'11-03-13,'0','“It’s not like this is Vermont or Minnesota,” Ms. Canary added.The new law, which went into effect on Jan. 1, in the middle of the race to succeed Mayor Richard M. Daley, capped donations in Illinois campaigns for the first time. But the mayoral campaign exposed some of the reform effort’s shortcomings.In the case of Mr. Chico and the Puigs, campaign-finance reports show that Mr. Chico, a former school board president, received $5,000 from each of four Puig-run businesses at a building on the Near North Side. A fifth $5,000 came from a Puig company that the Chico campaign listed at an address in Lincolnwood, though state records place the business in the same building as the other four companies, on West Willow Street. The sixth $5,000 donation on Feb. 3 came from a Puig company at another address on the Near North Side.Luis Puig Jr. said he and other family members jointly own all six of the entities that made the donations. He said he was unaware of the new state law and had not structured the donations to get around the limits.“Our bank accounts were not that big, so we took a little from each company” and gave it to Mr. Chico, Mr. Puig said. “He is our attorney, when people owe us money. His daughter and our daughter went to school together in Edgebrook.”Ms. Canary said the Puigs’ donations appeared to be legal because the authors of the new law had not drafted language that clearly addressed situations in which closely related companies make multiple donations to the same candidate. The contributions from the Puig companies “violate the spirit of what we were trying to do,” she said, adding, “We need to figure out how to address that.”Until the law changed, Illinois was among the few states that placed no limits on the size of contributions, a situation that many reformers tied to the state’s sordid political culture.“Illinois is one of the only places in America where literally anyone can walk in the door and spend whatever they want to influence the outcome of an election,” according to a 2007 report from the Brennan Center for Justice and New York University School of Law. “The system is almost an open invitation to corruption.”After Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich was accused of trading official favors for big donations, state lawmakers with great fanfare passed the measure imposing limits with great fanfare. Signing the bill in December 2009, Gov. Pat Quinn heralded a “crucial and important move in the right direction,” and good-government groups applauded.“The goal is to eliminate the perception of pay-to-play politics,” said David Morrison, the deputy director of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform. “Outsized donations cause corruption or create the perception of corruption. It’s very important to have these kinds of standards.”In the final weeks of the Chicago mayoral race, the Puigs were not the only contributors to circumvent the limits. Some of Carol Moseley Braun’s top supporters also found a way to do so.On Jan. 31, three co-chairmen of Ms. Braun’s campaign finance committee — Elzie Higginbottom, Cecil Butler and Leon Finney Jr. — formed a political group called United Communities of Chicago Inc. The group soon reported accepting checks from donors who already had given the maximum amount permitted under the new law to the Carol for Chicago fund, Ms. Braun’s campaign committee, according to state records.Mr. Finney and another prominent Braun supporter, John W. Rogers Jr., head of Ariel Investments, had contributed $5,000 each to Carol for Chicago on Jan. 19. Mr. Rogers gave another $5,000 to United Communities of Chicago on Feb. 8, and Mr. Finney donated a total of $8,500 to the group before the election.While neither the Braun campaign nor United Communities of Chicago has reported the expenditure to the state, United Communities of Chicago paid for a radio ad on behalf of the campaign last month. The spot featured Representative Danny K. Davis, Democrat of Chicago, urging blacks to vote for Ms. Braun, who had been chosen by Mr. Davis and other black leaders as the “consensus” black candidate. When he was a child, Mr. Davis said in the ad, “my father would tell us that the Bible says any man who will not support his own house is worse than an infidel.”Mr. Higginbottom and Mr. Finney did not return calls seeking comment. Mr. Rogers said Friday that he had donated to United Communities of Chicago at Mr. Finney’s urging, because the group helped not only Ms. Braun but also black candidates for the City Council.“There is a great need in our community, and so few pockets,” Mr. Rogers said. “I was just trying to be supportive of all of the candidates that they were helping.”Another situation that arose in the mayoral race involved 10 people affiliated with the Jimmy John’s restaurant chain, each of whom contributed $5,000 to Rahm Emanuel’s campaign less than two weeks before Mr. Emanuel won the election. When Crain’s Chicago Business asked Mr. Emanuel’s aides about those donations, a spokesman for the campaign said the $50,000 from those donors had been returned “out of an abundance of caution and to avoid even the suggestion of impropriety.”As with the checks from the Puigs and the Braun donors, however, there appeared to be no violation of the new law, provided that the Jimmy John’s employees made the donations out of their own pockets. Ms. Canary said she saw no breach of the rules unless the employees had been forced to make the contributions as a condition of continued employment or the company had reimbursed them for the donations.State officials have not yet determined exactly how the new statute will work in practice, said Rupert Borgsmiller, the executive director of the Illinois State Board of Elections.“This is the break-in period for the new law,” Mr. Borgsmiller said, adding that the exact application of the statute would depend on election board rulings on specific cases that could arise.A task force appointed by the governor will also review the rules and fine-tune them.“The ink is still wet on the regulations,” Mr. Morrison said, adding, “This 2011 municipal election has been the guinea pig.”'"
"'11-03-13,'0','Ross Ramsey, the managing editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a regular column.There will be blood. It’s undeniable, especially when the governor goes out of his way to say that he doesn’t have any on his hands.Rick Perry, watching over a legislative session that threatens (at this point) to cut $9.3 billion or more from state spending on public education, said this week that it would not be the state’s fault if any public school teachers lost their jobs. “The lieutenant governor, the speaker and their colleagues aren’t going to hire or fire one teacher, as best I can tell,” he said. “That is a local decision that will be made at the local districts.”House Speaker Joe Straus, Republican of San Antonio, said a day later that the governor was “technically correct,” in that the teachers don’t work directly for the state and the state won’t be doing the firing. They may be cutting off the food supply to the kitchen, but it’s the cooks who decide which diners will be fed.All this talk preceded a weekend education rally at the state Capitol, and it accompanies a rising chorus from Republican lawmakers who think the current budget-balancing proposals cut too deeply into education and health and human services.Relocating the blame isn’t going to be an easy sales job. The school districts are simultaneously losing money from both their main sources of revenue: state financing and revenue from local property taxes. And while many have money in the bank, their immediate financial futures aren’t promising. Some have responded by declaring “financial exigency,” a way of saying they’ve got budgets so tight they need to lay some people off. Once that has been declared, a district can send notices to employees who won’t be employees after the current school year. Others are marshaling the arguments for tax increases.Local property values around the state dropped 1.8 percent last year. The state comptroller estimates they will drop 2.23 percent this year and then rise 0.52 percent next year. That’s the base against which the school districts levy taxes, and the biggest source of nonstate financing for the schools. Those numbers are bigger than they look.'"
"'11-03-13,'0','A sign outside Mr. Yu’s office advertises the Mohegan Sun bus trip with Chinese characters that translate roughly as “Go with the wind, be prosperous.”“Life is fragile,” Mr. Yu said, struggling to keep back tears. “It was supposed to be a happy trip.” He added that ticket sales had dropped on Saturday: “The whole day, it’s been slow.”As recently as late February, federal regulators had flagged World Wide Travel for a higher-than-average number of crashes and several cases of driver fatigue. The company was given 35 violations for various mechanical and driver safety problems in the past year, records show.A bus operated by the company was involved in a collision last year in Perth Amboy, N.J., that resulted in at least one injury; another collision, also causing an injury, was recorded in Westchester County in 2009, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.The driver of the crashed bus, Ophadell Williams, was hospitalized on Saturday with chest pains and a fractured hip. He told the authorities that he believed a tractor-trailer cut him off and clipped the front of the bus.His wife, Holly Williams, said her husband is a veteran driver who makes the casino route daily and has worked for World Wide Travel for six months.An all-night excursion — for gamblers and bus drivers alike — is almost always part of the casino package offered by bus operators in the region. Academy Bus, based in Hoboken, N.J., advertises a round trip that leaves the Bronx at 8:45 p.m. and arrives at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut by 11:15 p.m.Six hours later, passengers reboard as late as 5:15 a.m. The fare: $24, including a $15 food voucher and $15 of slots play.“It doesn’t surprise me that they would be on the road at 5 in the morning,” said Marvin Steinberg, executive director of the Connecticut Council on Problem Gambling, an occasional consultant to Foxwoods. He said he had seen buses coming and going from the Mohegan Sun casino at all hours, prompting concerns about driver fatigue.“I don’t know whether that bus driver slept while folks gambled, or didn’t sleep at all,” he said.In interviews, discount bus drivers said they often try to sneak in naps — sometimes curling up in an empty seat — while their passengers gamble.Marvin Ha, 45, of Brooklyn, a driver for the Sky Express bus lines, was picking up Foxwoods-bound passengers on the Bowery on Saturday afternoon. He said he stays alert on late-night trips with soda, tea, and the Parliament cigarettes he keeps tucked in the dashboard.“Tractor-trailers are our biggest problem,” Mr. Ha said. “When the rear of the truck slides toward you, you have to stay calm because if you steer too hard to avoid it, you might flip.”Anthony J. Emanuel, a lawyer in Garden City, N.Y., once represented a passenger who was injured on a World Wide Travel bus in 2009 during a late-night return trip from Atlantic City. Drivers on those trips, Mr. Emanuel said, are often overworked.“It’s a long day,” Mr. Emanuel said. The drivers “are up 20, 22 hours; you’re not surprised sometimes to see that.”'"
"'11-03-13,'0','Matt Kornguth, the founder of RunYourPool.com, a bracket-hosting site, said 95 percent of the users who contacted him did not want the first-round games to be included in pools, so they will not be.“For people who’ve been running their pool for a long time, any kind of change is difficult,” Kornguth said. “And trying to communicate the changes to the pool members can be problematic.”But Tim Hilby, a software engineer from Des Moines, said he planned to include the first-round games in his pool, which usually receives about 50 entries.“Previously, I hadn’t cared about the play-in game on Tuesday,” Hilby said. “But it just seems like with the last four at-large teams playing, those are teams people will care about, and I think they’re going to have more meaning, so I wanted to put them in.”Hilby will not exclude entrants who miss the Tuesday deadline; they will just miss four chances to accumulate points.“My dad never gets his bracket in on time anyway,” Hilby said.The first-round games will be omitted from the online contests run by The New York Times, ESPN, Yahoo Sports and CBS Sports, mainly because moving up the deadline would reduce the number of entrants.Participants can submit their picks after the four first-round games; those who fill out their brackets earlier can amend them. Entries usually rise rapidly from Wednesday night into Thursday morning, so an earlier deadline could have surprised those who were unaware of the tournament’s changes.“We want to make sure we’re giving people as much time to fill out their brackets as possible,” said Jason Waram, ESPN’s vice president for fantasy games and social media, “and we think leaving it the way it was is the best way to do that.”Last year, ESPN.com received nearly 5.4 million entries for its Tournament Challenge. The site has another contest for round-by-round selections that will include the first-round games.Although online contests aim to attract as many entries as possible, numbers may not be as great a concern in more intimate pencil-and-paper pools among friends, so a Tuesday deadline might be more feasible. Based on the success rates of low-seeded teams, the first-round games could be meaningful.A 12 seed has upset a 5 seed in 20 of the past 22 seasons, and a double-digit seed has reached the regional semifinals in 24 of the past 26. Last year, No. 12 Cornell was one of three teams seeded 10 or lower to advance to the third round.“One of those 11 or 12 seeds is going to knock off a 5 or a 6 because they’ve already got a tournament game under their belt,” said Fran Fraschilla, a former Manhattan and St. John’s coach who is now an ESPN analyst. “You get the kinks and the nervousness out and have an N.C.A.A. win to your credit, and it actually may turn out to be detrimental to the higher seed.”Waram said ESPN would gauge user feedback and consider changes to its bracket format for next year. The sense lingers that the tournament will eventually mushroom to 96 teams, muddying the pool and creating a bracket with more branches than an oak tree.“A 96-team bracket is possible from a technical standpoint,” Hilby said. “But personally, I just don’t think it would be right.”'"

Commissioner Don Garber held a one-hour conference call with the news media on Friday, a few days before the start of the league’s 16th season, which opens Tuesday night when the Los Angeles Galaxy plays at the Seattle Sounders.Garber a native of Bayside, Queens, not far from Shea Stadium, has had a long relationship with the Wilpon family. The Wilpons, the owners of the Mets, were once mentioned as possible owners or partners in a second M.L.S. team in the New York area. Jeff Wilpon, the son of the team co-owner Fred Wilpon, is believed to be a fan, and the area around the team’s Citi Field is a promising spot for a new soccer stadium. But the Wilpons’ financial situation — most notably a lawsuit filed by the trustee for the victims of Bernard L. Madoff’s huge Ponzi scheme — could preclude the Wilpons’ involvement in M.L.S.“I’ve been talking with them for a number of years,” Garber said. “Our view of the success of our league is in the core values of ownership groups. They fit very well with our owners, and I really hope they get through their issues quickly. I don’t believe the full story has been told. I’m supportive personally and professionally. They would be great owners in M.L.S. and have a good site for a soccer stadium.” JACK BELLARGENTINA NAMES SQUAD Forwards Carlos Tévez and Sergio Agüero were been left off an Argentina squad for friendlies this month against the United States and Costa Rica.Coach Sergio Batista also excluded Tévez and Agüero from a team that defeated Portugal, 2-1, last month, preferring to try younger players ahead of the Copa América — the continental championship — which Argentina will host this year. In the case of Tévez, however, Argentina officials were also critical of him for bowing out of a friendly late last year against Brazil.Reports have also suggested Tévez, who plays for Manchester City, is not comfortable on the bench in the role as a backup.The star forward Lionel Messi of the Spanish club Barcelona was selected to the squad Friday, along with the experienced players Javier Zanetti, Javier Mascherano and Esteban Cambiasso.Argentina faces the Untied States on March 26 in East Rutherford, N.J., and plays Costa Rica on March 29 in San Jose, Calif.

"'11-03-13,'0','The Panamanian dictator, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, was reported to have stashed $5.8 million in denominations of 10s, 20s, 50s and 100s in a file cabinet behind a desk at his home. United States authorities seized the money during the invasion of Panama in 1989.In 1997, shortly before the forces of Laurent Kabila took power in Congo, formerly called Zaire, aides close to former President Mobutu Sese Seko smuggled crates of diamonds and more than $40 million in cash out of the country on a jet chartered by the South African government, according to The Sunday Independent, a South African newspaper.Then, in 2003, in the hours before American bombs began falling on Baghdad, one of President Saddam Hussein’s sons, Qusay Saddam Hussein, was said by officials to carry off nearly $1 billion in cash from the vaults of the country’s Central Bank.The volume of cash was so great — some $900 million in American $100 bills and as much as $100 million worth of euros — that a team of workers took two hours to load the money on three tractor-trailers.Which raises the question: What does a mountain of cash worth tens of billions of dollars actually look like?According to the United States Bureau of Engraving and Printing, all dollar notes have the same dimensions: 2.61 inches by 6.14 inches by 0.0043 inches. Each note weighs approximately one gram.That is true for all notes in circulation — $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100. (Notes worth more than this value — 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 — were taken out of official circulation in 1969, according to a bureau spokeswoman, Darlene Anderson, though some still circulate, and Colonel Qaddafi could possibly have some of those.)Ten billion dollars in, say, 100-dollar notes, stacked one on top of the other would weigh about 110 tons and take up about 100 large storage pallets. According to Jack Weatherford, an anthropologist and the author of “The History of Money,” the difficulties of securely storing large stockpiles of money were evident from the beginning of civilization.Some of the first metal coins, a mixture of silver and gold, were minted during the reign of Croesus, who ruled Lydia in modern Turkey from 560-546 B.C. But as Croesus’s wealth piled up in his palace in the capital, Sardis, “it attracted the interest of the Persians right next door and all the money was taken,” said Professor Weatherford.In the 20th century, Sultan Said bin Taimur of Oman, father of Oman’s current leader, encountered yet another problem.There was no developed banking system he trusted, when his country began to earn lucrative oil revenues. He piled up hard currency like British pounds in his palace in Muscat, but rats began to gnaw at it, Mr. Weatherford said.Seeing the family legacy diminishing may have been a reason his son, the current sultan, precipitated a coup and toppled his father in 1970.“That is a problem you have with paper money,” Mr. Weatherford said. “Insects, rats and other animals gnaw at it.”'"
"'11-03-13,'0','“DO you know what Spring Pilgrimage is?” asked Brenda Caradine, the chairwoman of the Tennessee Williams Birthday Celebration in Columbus, Miss. “It’s when you Yankees come down South to see our antebellum homes and we take back your money.”By turns coquettish and tender, Ms. Caradine, who also runs the Amzi Love Home, a restored 1848 home that now functions as a B&B, is just one of many personalities in the playwright’s hometown who might as well have been created by Williams himself.Williams would have turned 100 this month, and towns and cities around the country are hosting fetes in his honor, but none more fittingly than Columbus, the playwright’s birthplace and his home until age 7. This year, the birthday celebration (March 24 to 27) coincides in part with the town’s Spring Pilgrimage (March 28 to April 9), the event that Ms. Caradine referred to, which is traditionally held during the azalea bloom.Williams-themed festivities will include an exhibition of playbill and movie paraphernalia related to his stage and screen work at the Columbus-Lowndes Library (317 Seventh Street North); tours of St. Paul’s Episcopal (318 College Street), where his grandfather preached (don’t miss the stained-glass windows mentioned in “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof”); and performances of one of his more obscure plays, “Strangest Kind of Romance,” at the Rosensweig Arts Center (501 Main Street).But the centennial’s key event will be the unveiling of Williams-related plaques around town on March 26, closing with a cake and punch reception at the newly renovated Tennessee Williams Home (300 Main Street), which the town spent $450,000 to restore. The yellow-and-green gingerbread Victorian, outfitted with copper piping, heart-pinewood floors and a red tin roof, is slowly filling up with Williams paraphernalia, including a laurel wreath salvaged from his funeral and a collection of early photographs with his sister Rose, and his nursemaid, Ozzie.About four hours south of Columbus, New Orleans will play host to the CenTENNial (March 23 to 27; tennesseewilliams.net), the biggest of the Williams festivals. The playwright claimed his “first contact with a free society” in the city’s French Quarter, whose misfit transients inspired characters like Stanley and Stella from “A Streetcar Named Desire.” (The couple will be immortalized in the festival’s Stanley and Stella Shouting Contest in Jackson Square on March 27.)'"

"'11-03-13,'0','Shawn McLearen, the Artspace project manager, says this kind of development differs from “traditional affordable housing” because it serves “multiple agendas at the same time,” including economic development and arts and culture.The building was designed with a huge lobby; each floor has a large communal area and eight-foot-wide hallways, for “tenants to use as exhibition space,” Mr. McLearen said. “We want to facilitate their work.”Rental prices range from $817 to $1,470, depending on the unit size and tenant’s income; utilities are covered, except for electricity. So far, 14 apartments have been leased and another three tenants approved, Mr. McLearen said. Applications are accepted online at www.artspace.org/properties/patchogue.Besides qualifying financially, prospective tenants are interviewed by an “artist selection committee.” They present a portfolio and are quizzed on their willingness to live in a “cooperative environment.”When there is a gallery opening, for instance, tenants can take part by opening their doors. “It’s a huge art crawl where people are walking around,” Mr. McLearen said. The idea is “to make sure this isn’t just a place where people come and go, but want to stay.”The project took root several years ago, when Mayor Paul V. Pontieri Jr., looking for a way to give Patchogue a new identity, contacted Artspace. His idea was to bolster the 1999 rebirth of the Patchogue Theater for the Performing Arts, which started out in 1921 as a vaudeville house.“We have a $7 million theater,” Mr. Pontieri said he had reasoned. “We have to tie it to something else.” The site for Artspace, donated by the village, was a block from the theater: two underutilized municipal parking lots and a blighted house. The plan will also involve recreating the alleyway between the two as a “fine arts alleyway.”Another of the loft’s new tenants is Cheryl Frey, 33, a visual artist, who with her husband and two children is paying $1,565 a month for a three-bedroom duplex with an oak staircase and a soaring living-room ceiling.Ms. Frey teaches mosaic-making classes in libraries and after-school programs. She said she “liked the idea of being in an area where they encourage creativity, where it’s O.K. to get paint on the wall.” Unable to afford a separate studio, she is eagerly splitting the downstairs into eating, living and studio areas. “I can put a large canvas down,” she said. “I like to work big.”Dana Flaherty, 34, a social worker and photographer, recently moved with her 6-year-old daughter into a two-bedroom unit. Ms. Flaherty says she, too, hopes to work and network with neighboring artists. With its new galleries, a wine bar, a brewery and restaurants nearby, she said, Patchogue is being transformed. Looking out her window, she added, “I feel like I’m in Brooklyn or Manhattan.”Mr. Varney, for his part, is raring to get started. “Whatever they are willing to let me do,” he said, “I want to show as much of my work as I can.”One opportunity will be at the C2 Fine Art Gallery, where he showed two paintings last year, and which is relocating from Main Street to one of Artspace’s two street-level retail sites. Charlie Baker, the owner and treasurer of the Patchogue Arts Council, said he planned to “give priority” to resident artists next year. The gallery’s first show at Artspace is scheduled for April 1.“Some of it is fine art and some music or poetry,” he said, explaining that those disciplines would be incorporated at gallery openings. “We want to work synergistically.”'"
"'11-03-13,'0','Every few years, there appear in most countries books that reveal the dirty truth about the national readership. France has recently given us “The Kindly Ones” and “The Elegance of the Hedgehog” — the first distasteful, the other pretentious, and both eagerly embraced by a readership keen to be chastened for its middle-class pieties. Americans, meanwhile, have rhapsodized about and then violently rejected a series of fake memoirs, suggesting we find greater cultural currency in creative misbehavior than in literary skill, or at best seriously conflate the two.The English vice, in a literary sense, has lately been to mistake perfectly standard genre fiction for art. Thus the adequate police procedural “Child 44,” deriving gravitas from its setting in Stalin’s Soviet Union, was in the running for two of Britain’s most important literary awards. Now England has seen the rise of “Mr. Chartwell,” a humorous and amiable novel about which such extravagant claims have been made — for its prose, psychological insight and emotional depth — that one might imagine a work to rival Robert Burton’s “Anatomy of Melancholy” instead of what is, in fact, well-packaged chick lit.Like “Child 44,” “Mr. Chartwell” benefits from the reassuring aura of history. One of the three main characters is Winston Churchill; another, Esther, is a library clerk at the House of Commons. The third, her lodger, is an oversize talking dog.Introducing himself first as Mr. Chartwell, he is mostly called Black Pat, and he is an embodiment of depression — a condition that Churchill, like Dr. Johnson, called the “black dog.” By taking this description literally, the debut novelist Rebecca Hunt finds an appealing and inventive conceit on which to build her story. Unfortunately, like most conceits, it quickly tires. Depression is not, in any real sense, like a talking dog. Black Pat lies on his victims so they can’t move, or eats loudly so they can’t concentrate; he ruins Esther’s home by scratching the carpet and leaving fur about the place; he tells bad jokes. In short, he is an outside force. He takes his victims hostage physically, but never ­really confronts them emotionally.For this reason, Mr. Chartwell’s true hostage is the author herself, who never quite finds a way to make him work. Since Black Pat represents depression, he naturally can’t develop as a character, and the scenes in which he features quickly assume a formidable similarity. Hunt struggles bravely on, just as Churchill, occasionally channeling Sydney Greenstreet, encourages Esther to do in her own encounter with Black Pat.Esther’s challenge is to find the courage to pursue her colleague, the goofy Mr. Corkbowl, despite having experienced a romantic loss two years before. Hunt’s own challenge is to make this story seem more literary — whether through strained prose (“Light made a pair of tennis shorts over the bedroom wall”) or through unnecessary historical detail imparted in implausible dialogue (“I say this as both a sprightly 61-year-old and, as I always like to remind every­one, the only prime minister to have played first-class cricket”).'"
"'11-03-13,'0','Members of the Composure Class spend much of their adult lives going into rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. This effect is only magnified by the fact that they are sincere, modest, and nice. Nothing gives them greater pleasure than inviting you out to their weekend place. This involves meeting them Friday afternoon at some private airport. They arrive with their belongings in a tote bag because when you have your own plane you don't need luggage that actually closes.It's best to tuck away a few granola bars if you go on one of these jaunts because the sumptuary code of this new gentry means that they will semi-starve you all weekend. This code involves lavish spending on durables and spartan spending on consumables. They'll give you a ride on a multimillion-dollar Gulfstream 5, and serve a naked turkey slice sandwich on stale bread from the Safeway. They will have a nine-bedroom weekend mansion, but they brag that the furniture is from Ikea, and on Saturday they'll offer you one of those Hunger Strike Lunches — four lettuce shards and three grams of tuna salad — because they think everybody eats as healthily as they do.It has become fashionable in these circles to have dogs a third as tall as the ceiling heights, so members of the Composure Class have these gigantic bearlike hounds named after Jane Austen characters. The dogs are crossbreeds between Saint Bernards and velociraptors, and they will gently lay their giant muzzles on tabletops or Range Rover roofs, whichever is higher. The weekend itself will consist of long bouts of strenuous activity interrupted by short surveys of the global economic situation and bright stories about their closest friends — Rupert, Warren, Colin, Sergey, Bono, and the Dalai Lama. In the evenings they will traipse down to a resort community for ice cream and a stroll. Spontaneous applause may erupt on the sidewalks as they parade their immaculate selves down the avenues, licking their interesting gelatos. People will actually choose to vacation in these places just to bathe in the aura of human perfection.It was in one of those precincts that, one summer's day, a man and a woman met for the first time. These young people, in their late twenties, would go on to be the parents of Harold, one of the heroes of this story. And the first thing you should know about these soon-to-be parents is that they were both good-hearted, but sort of shallow — even though their son would go on to be intellectually ambitious and sort of profound. They had been drawn to this resort community by the gravitational pull of Composure Class success, which they someday hoped to join. They were staying in group homes with other aspiring young professionals, and a blind lunch date had been arranged by a mutual friend.Their names were Rob and Julia, and they got their first glimpse of each other in front of a Barnes & Noble. Rob and Julia smiled broadly at each other as they approached, and a deep, primeval process kicked in. Each saw different things. Rob, being a certain sort of man, took in most of what he wanted to know through his eyes. His male Pleistocene ancestors were confronted with the puzzling fact that human females do not exhibit any physical signals when they're ovulating, unlike many other animals. So the early hunters made do with the closest markers of fertility available.And so Rob looked for the traits almost all heterosexual men look for in a woman. David Buss surveyed over ten thousand people in thirty-seven different societies and found that standards of female beauty are pretty much the same around the globe. Men everywhere value clear skin, full lips, long lustrous hair, symmetrical features, shorter distances between the mouth and chin and between the nose and chin, and a waist-to-hip ratio of about 0.7. A study of painting going back thousands of years found that most of the women depicted had this ratio. Playboy bunnies tend to have this ratio, though their overall fleshiness can change with the fashions. Even the famously thin supermodel Twiggy had exactly a 0.73 percent waist-to-hip ratio.Rob liked what he saw. He was struck by a vague and alluring sense that Julia carried herself well, for there is nothing that so enhances beauty as self-confidence. He enjoyed the smile that spread across her face, and unconsciously noted that the end of her eyebrows dipped down. The orbicularis oculi muscle, which controls this part of the eyebrow, cannot be consciously controlled, so when the tip of the eyebrow dips, that means the smile is genuine not fake.Rob registered her overall level of attractiveness, subliminally aware that attractive people generally earn significantly higher incomes.Rob also liked the curve he instantly discerned under her blouse, and followed its line with an appreciation that went to the core of his being. Somewhere in the back of his brain, he knew that a breast is merely an organ, a mass of skin and fat. And yet, he was incapable of thinking in that way. He went through his days constantly noting their presence around him. The line of a breast on a piece of paper was enough to arrest his attention. The use of the word ""boob"" was a source of subliminal annoyance to him, because that undignified word did not deserve to be used in connection with so holy a form, and he sensed it was used, mostly by women, to mock his deep fixation.And of course breasts exist in the form they do precisely to arouse this reaction. There is no other reason human breasts should be so much larger than the breasts of other primates. Apes are flat-chested. Larger human breasts do not produce more milk than smaller ones. They serve no nutritional purpose, but they do serve as signaling devices and set off primitive light shows in the male brain. Men consistently rate women with attractive bodies and unattractive faces more highly than women with attractive faces and unattractive bodies. Nature does not go in for art for art's sake, but it does produce art.Julia had a much more muted reaction upon seeing her eventual life mate. This is not because she was unimpressed by the indisputable hotness of the man in front of her. Women are sexually attracted to men with larger pupils. Women everywhere prefer men who have symmetrical features and are slightly older, taller, and stronger than they are. By these and other measures, Harold's future father passed the test.It's just that she was, by nature and upbringing, guarded and slow to trust. She, like 89 percent of all people, did not believe in love at first sight. Moreover, she was compelled to care less about looks than her future husband was. Women, in general, are less visually aroused than men, a trait that has nearly cut the market for pornography in half.That's because while Pleistocene men could pick their mates on the basis of fertility cues they could discern at a glance, Pleistocene women faced a more vexing problem. Human babies require years to become self-sufficient, and a single woman in a prehistoric environment could not gather enough calories to provide for a family. She was compelled to choose a man not only for insemination, but for companionship and continued support. And to this day, when a woman sets her eyes upon a potential mate, her time frame is different from his.That's why men will leap into bed more quickly than women. Various research teams have conducted a simple study. They pay an attractive woman to go up to college men and ask them to sleep with her. Seventy-five percent of men say yes to this proposition, in study after study. Then they have an attractive man approach college women with the same offer. Zero percent say yes.Women have good reasons to be careful. While most men are fertile, there is wide variation among the hairier sex when it comes to stability. Men are much more likely to have drug and alcohol addictions. They are much more likely to murder than women, and much, much more likely to abandon their children. There are more lemons in the male population than in the female population, and women have found that it pays to trade off a few points in the first-impression department in exchange for reliability and social intelligence down the road.So while Rob was looking at cleavage, Julia was looking for signs of trustworthiness. She didn't need to do this consciously — thousands of years of genetics and culture had honed her trusting sensor.Marion Eals and Irwin Silverman of York University have conducted studies that suggest women are on average 60 to 70 percent more proficient than men at remembering details from a scene and the locations of objects placed in a room. Over the past few years, Julia had used her powers of observation to discard entire categories of men as potential partners, and some of her choices were idiosyncratic. She rejected men who wore Burberry, because she couldn't see herself looking at the same damn pattern on scarves and raincoats for the rest of her life. Somehow she was able to discern poor spellers just by looking at them, and they made her heart wither. She viewed fragranced men the way Churchill viewed the Germans — they were either at your feet or at your throat. She would have nothing to do with men who wore sports-related jewelry because her boyfriend should not love Derek Jeter more than her. And though there had recently been a fad for men who can cook, she was unwilling to have a serious relationship with anybody who could dice better than she could or who would surprise her with smugly unpretentious Gruyère grilled cheese sandwiches as a makeup present after a fight. It was simply too manipulative.She looked furtively at Rob as he approached across the sidewalk. Janine Willis and Alexander Todorov of Princeton have found that people can make snap judgments about a person's trustworthiness, competence, aggressiveness and likability within the first tenth of a second. These sorts of first glimpses are astonishingly accurate in predicting how people will feel about each other months later. People rarely revise their first impression, they just become more confident that they are right. In other research, Todorov gave his subjects microsecond glimpses of the faces of competing politicians. His research subjects could predict, with 70 percent accuracy, who would win the election between the two candidates.Using her own powers of instant evaluation, Julia noticed Rob was good-looking, but he was not one of those men who are so good-looking that they don't need to be interesting. While Rob was mentally undressing her, she was mentally dressing him. At the moment, he was wearing brown corduroy slacks, which did credit to Western civilization, and a deep purplish/maroonish pullover, so that altogether he looked like an elegant eggplant. He had firm but not ferretlike cheeks, suggesting he would age well and some day become the most handsome man in his continuing-care retirement facility.He was tall, and since one study estimated that each inch of height corresponds to $6,000 of annual salary in contemporary America, that matters. He also radiated a sort of inner calm, which would make him infuriating to argue with. He seemed, to her quick judging eye, to be one of those creatures blessed by fate, who has no deep calluses running through his psyche, no wounds to cover or be wary of.But just as the positive judgments began to pile up, Julia's frame of mind flipped. Julia knew that one of her least-attractive features was that she had a hypercritical inner smart-ass. She'd be enjoying the company of some normal guy, and suddenly she would begin with the scrutiny. Before it was over, she was Dorothy Parker and the guy was a pool of metaphorical blood on the floor.Julia's inner smart-ass noticed that Rob was one of those guys who believes nobody really cares if your shoes are shined. His fingernails were uneven. Moreover, he was a bachelor. Julia distrusted bachelors as somehow unserious, and since she would never date a married man, this cut down the pool of men she could uncritically fall in love with.'"

"'11-03-14,'0','“In stark contrast to the scenarios contemplated for oil spills and hurricanes, there is no specificity for emergency coordination and command in place for a response to a nuclear disaster,” Mr. Markey said in a statement.Nuclear power provides about 20 percent of the nation’s electricity, and there are 104 reactors licensed to operate in 31 states, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A majority are so-called pressurized water reactors, different from the General Electric boiling water reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. There are 35 G.E. boiling water reactors in the United States, with 31 of them early “Mark 1” or “Mark 2” designs, the type used at Fukushima.Beyond the age of the plant, the relative safety of any one design over another — and perhaps more importantly, the ability to minimize the impact of any emergency on surrounding populations — depends on a wide array of variables, regulators and nuclear experts say.Although the exact sequence of events at the Fukushima plant is still unclear, early assessments suggested that the containment structures weathered last week’s earthquake, but that power from the electric grid was cut off.Nearly all nuclear facilities use backup diesel generators in such situations to maintain control over a reactor, prevent it from overheating by circulating a cooling agent and begin shutting it down.But in this case, the subsequent tsunami may have damaged those generators and other components, forcing the use of another layer of backup, battery power.However, batteries are designed to last only four to eight hours in most cases, just long enough to allow technicians to restore grid or generator power. If there is trouble restoring those power sources, as appears to be the case in Japan, the strategies for cooling the reactor become much more difficult.All nuclear facilities in the United States deploy similar backup strategies, and in a statement Saturday, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that the nation’s nuclear power plants were built to withstand environmental hazards, including earthquakes and tsunamis.“Even those plants that are located outside of areas with extensive seismic activity are designed for safety in the event of such a natural disaster,” the agency said. “The N.R.C. requires that safety-significant structures, systems and components be designed to take into account the most severe natural phenomena historically estimated for the site and surrounding area.”Two nuclear power plants operate in quake-prone California: the two-reactor Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo, operated by Pacific Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison’s San Onofre plant near Long Beach, which also has two reactors. Both plants use pressurized water reactors.Diablo Canyon has been embroiled in a bitter battle with local opponents seeking new seismic studies ahead of a decision to extend the plant’s operating license, which is due to expire in about 15 years. Opponents point in part to the discovery of a previously unknown fault about a mile offshore.But Paul Flake, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric, said that geological studies —both historical and projected — placed the maximum seismic strength of an earthquake near the plant at 6.1 to 6.5, and that the plant is designed to withstand a quake of up to 7.5 in magnitude. The quake off the coast of Japan measured 8.9.Mr. Lochbaum added that other potential problems exist in nearly every region. “The Midwest has tornadoes, parts of the gulf experience hurricanes. There are places in the North where severe ice has caused problems. They all share the common thread of Mother Nature challenging the plants.”Anthony R. Pietrangelo, a senior vice president and chief nuclear officer with the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group representing the nuclear power industry, said that the industry was keenly watching the Japanese situation and would readily revisit its own emergency procedures as new information and potential lessons emerged.But he also said the combination of an enormous earthquake and immense tsunami was of historic proportions, and that the odds of it happening in the United States were small.“It’s not impossible, he said, “but it’s extremely remote.”'"
"'11-03-14,'0','In interviews with investigators, witnesses to the gruesome bus crash that killed 14 people in the Bronx over the weekend said the bus had repeatedly veered off Interstate 95 and onto the shoulder of the highway before the accident, a law enforcement official said on Sunday.The witnesses, some of them passengers, provided descriptions of the bus’s movements, according to the official, who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. The driver, Ophadell Williams, told the police that a truck had clipped the bus he was driving, for World Wide Tours, causing him to lose control.The bus had just crossed into the Bronx from Westchester County about 5:30 a.m. on Saturday when it flipped onto its right side and careered into a sign post. The pole, which stood about 480 feet from where the bus hit the guardrail, sliced through the upper half of the bus, leaving a tangle of bodies, metal and shattered glass.The witnesses said the bus strayed onto the rumble strips, which alert drivers that they are nearing the edge of the pavement, the law enforcement official said. It was not clear exactly how many times it had happened: “It varies with different people’s recollections,” the official said.Federal investigators and the State Police spent Sunday studying the wreckage of the bus and the stretch of I-95 where the vehicle flipped and skidded nearly 500 feet into the signpost. They interviewed some of the 17 passengers who survived the crash to check Mr. Williams’s explanation. An official of the National Transportation Safety Board, Christopher Hart, said Sunday evening that the driver of the truck had voluntarily contacted the State Police after the crash. Mr. Hart described the trucker and his employer, whom he did not identify, as very cooperative.'"
"'11-03-14,'0','Washington had “hypothetical plots” for worst-case plume dispersal within hours of the start of the crisis, a senior official said Sunday. The aim, the official added, was “more to help Japan” than the United States, since few experts foresaw high levels of radiation reaching the West Coast.For now, the prevailing winds over Japan were blowing eastward across the Pacific. If they continue to do so, international stations for radioactive tracking at Wake or Midway Islands might detect radiation later this week, said Annika Thunborg, a spokeswoman for an arm of the United Nations in Vienna that monitors the planet for spikes in radioactivity.“At this point, we have not picked up anything” in detectors midway between Japan and Hawaii, Ms. Thunborg said in an interview on Sunday. “We’re talking a couple of days — nothing before Tuesday — in terms of picking something up.”Agencies involved in the tracking efforts include the World Meteorological Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, which runs a global network of more than 60 stations that sniff the air for radiation spikes.In the United States, the Departments of Defense and Energy maintain large facilities and cadres of specialists for tracking airborne releases of radiation, both civilian and military.On Sunday, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it expected no “harmful levels of radioactivity” to move on the winds to Hawaii, Alaska or the West Coast from the reactors in Japan, “given the thousands of miles between the two countries.”In interviews, some private nuclear experts called a windborne threat unlikely. Others urged caution.“We’re all worrying about it,” said Robert Alvarez, a nuclear expert who, from 1993 to 1999, was a policy adviser to the secretary of energy, who runs the nation’s nuclear complex.“It’s going to be very important,” he added, “for the Japanese and U.S. authorities to inform the public about the nature of the plumes and any need for precautionary measures.”The plume issue has arisen before. In 1986, radiation spewing from the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine was spread around the globe on winds and reached the West Coast in 10 days. It was judged more of a curiosity than a threat.Since then, scientists have refined their abilities to monitor such atmospheric releases. The advances are rooted in the development of new networks of radiation detectors, flotillas of imaging satellites and the advent of supercomputers that can model the subtle complexities of the wind to draw up advanced forecasts.With the Japanese crisis, popular apprehension has also soared.“Concern has been raised about a massive radioactive cloud escaping and sweeping over the West Coast,” said a recent blog, recommending whole grains and health foods for fighting radiation poisoning.On another blog, someone asked, “Should I take iodine now?” That referred to pills that can prevent poisoning from the atmospheric release of iodine-131, a radioactive byproduct of nuclear plants that the Japanese authorities have identified as escaping into the atmosphere.While federal officials expected little danger in the United States from Japanese plumes, they were taking no chances. On Sunday, Energy Department officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the agency was working on three fronts.One main player is the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. Officials said they had activated its National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center, which draws on meteorologists, nuclear scientists and computer scientists to forecast plume dispersal.Separately, energy officials said the agency was readying plans to deploy two-person monitoring and sampling teams, if necessary. The teams would travel to consulates, military installations and Navy ships to sample the air in a coordinated effort to improve plume tracking.Finally, the department was preparing what it calls its Aerial Measuring System. Its detectors and analytical equipment can be mounted on a variety of aircraft. Officials said the equipment and monitoring team are staged out of the department’s Remote Sensing Laboratory at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, and are on two-hour call.“We’re on top of this,” a department official said.'"
"'11-03-14,'0','Truth be told, Rivera does not need much work. Every spring, Rivera adheres to his own program, a concession to his age (41) and the 1,2892/3 innings logged by his right arm over 16 seasons, including playoffs. He does not throw in the off-season, he just stays in cardiovascular shape.When he arrives at spring training, Rivera long-tosses every other day, then eases into the same schedule followed by other pitchers.When Rivera missed the first few days of camp to tend to his sick children, Girardi cracked that he could have stayed home easily another week without affecting his preparation. Last spring, Rivera pitched six innings, one fewer than the year before, and he will probably throw a similar amount this year.Unlike other relievers, Rivera throws only two pitches, his repertory as obvious as it is lethal: a cutter and, as Kubel saw, an occasional sinker. Russell Martin, catching Rivera for the first time, met him at the mound anyway to go over the signs. Their conversation was brief.“He was like, ‘Go behind there,’ ” Martin said, referring to the plate. “I was like, ‘All right, see you later.’ If he shakes more than twice, I’m putting down the wrong signs.”Martin, who batted against Rivera once, last June 27 at Dodger Stadium, said: “You can’t compare. When you’re in the box, it’s a nightmare. When you’re behind the plate, it’s the complete opposite.”Martin compared the experience of catching Rivera to working with another control freak, Greg Maddux, in Los Angeles. Some games with Maddux, Martin said, he never called a pitch. He just set up four inches off either corner, stuck out his glove and waited for the ball.On Sunday, Martin called for cutter after cutter, marveling at its wicked movement each time.“There’s no sidespin,” Martin said. “It just cuts. I don’t know how he does it.”Over the years, Rivera has passed along his grip to several pitchers, even those on other teams, but no one has mastered it the way he has.“You get older, you get wiser,” Rivera said. “You’re just trying to throw the least pitches you can and just make sure you work on those spots. That’s what I do.”A poor start by Freddy Garcia on Sunday spiced up the Yankees’ rotation competition, but it hardly dropped him behind Ivan Nova, Bartolo Colon and Sergio Mitre. Garcia, scheduled to pitch four innings, was pulled with two outs in the third inning after throwing 68 pitches and allowing 6 hits and 4 runs, his first blemish in three outings. Joe Girardi reiterated that the Yankees’ evaluations for the two vacant starting spots would be based on a variety of factors and not solely on spring training results. ... The most disorienting moment of the game came in the fourth inning, when Derek Jeter dropped a pop-up. “It’s not the first pop-up I’ve dropped, and I’m pretty sure it won’t be the last one,” Jeter said. ... The Yankees cut 11 players from major league camp, including the right-handed pitching prospects Adam Warren, David Phelps and Hector Noesi.'"
"'11-03-14,'0','While Coinstar, which converts $3 billion in coins annually, has offered the fee-free option from some retailers for as long as five years, the company had until recently never advertised the option. While Mr. Saez declined to say how many customers opted for no-fee gift certificates, he said that “the ratio is inordinately high” for cash vouchers.“We haven’t told anyone about it,” Mr. Saez said. “For all intents and purposes it’s been the best kept secret out there.”But now Coinstar is trying to change that. Late last year, in publications including People and The New York Times, Coinstar advertised a program where several retail outlets, including iTunes, Borders and Regal Cinemas, went beyond shouldering the fee to offer gift cards that exceeded the value of a $40 minimum coin exchange by $10, meaning that $40 in coins could be redeemed for a $50 gift certificate.After that promotion ended on Jan. 1, iTunes made the same bonus offer for the 30 days that ended March 6, while another company, Rixty, is offering a $30 gift certificate in return for cashing in $25 in coins from March 25 through April 17.Rixty enables consumers who lack credit cards to make cash-based purchases online, primarily for virtual goods in games like Farmville and on social networks like Facebook. When the company first started selling credits to consumers in 2009, it began by offering fee-free credit exclusively to Coinstar users.“When we launched they were our first partner, and the great thing was on Day 1 we were live on 10,000 kiosks across the country,” said Ted C. Sorom, chief executive of Rixty. (Today there are about 17,000 Coinstar machines in the United States.)While most Rixty consumers are adults, many are adolescents who earn cash baby-sitting and mowing lawns, but lack credit cards.“When they go to their parents and say, ‘Can I borrow a credit card to buy a pair of virtual pants in a virtual world that you’ve never really heard of?’ the results are not positive,” Mr. Sorom said.While his company today has numerous ways to use cash for online purchases, including Rixty gift cards available at retailers like Kmart and J. C. Penney, Mr. Sorom is partial to the freewheeling nature of Coinstar consumers.“It is found money,” he said of their transactions. “It doesn’t come from a wallet or bank account, and people are much more willing to spend it on something on the edge of their budget, something they couldn’t justify spending money on before.”Coinstar, which says it has kiosks within five miles of 95 percent of the United States population, says it has an average coin transaction of $38 and about 76 million transactions annually.The largest coin exchange on record for the company involved Edmond Knowles of Flomaton, Ala., who in 2005 cashed in $13,084.59 — all in pennies. Coinstar sent an armored truck to Mr. Knowles’s home to retrieve the pennies.Amazon, which has offered fee-free gift certificates through Coinstar since 2005, says spending among Coinstar users increases every year, though the online retailer declined to give specifics.“We know there’s a segment out there that doesn’t have access to credit cards, and we also see a lot of college students who don’t have credit cards,” said Marcell King, senior manager at ACI Gift Cards, the issuer of Amazon gift cards.More than eight million consumers stopped using credit cards in the last year, a nearly 11 percent increase in the number of consumers who forgo them, according to a recent report from TransUnion, a credit rating agency.The latest effort by Coinstar, in pilot programs under way at both the Albertsons and Stop & Shop supermarket chains, entails a first for the company: offering no-fee gift cards at the very store where shoppers are exchanging coins.Stop & Shop is running its pilot program for a six-month period through May at 50 stores, most of them in Massachusetts, and promoting it through newspaper circular advertisements and billboards — by Eleven Inc. in San Francisco — and in-store radio announcements.“What we’re hearing from our customers is that they like it and they’re happy with it,” said Mark McGowan, president of the Northeast division of Stop & Shop, who declined to provide preliminary data from the pilot program.Mr. Saez, of Coinstar, said such in-store programs had enormous potential — and should have been initiated long ago.“We’re trying to appeal to those consumers who are fee-averse by putting a product in front of them that we know is highly, highly relevant to them,” he said. “To convert coins into a grocery store gift card — that one was a no-brainer that skipped over a lot of brains here for many years.”'"
"'11-03-14,'0','Fox is forgoing its planned preview this spring of “Terra Nova,” an ambitious drama involving time travel. The network said Friday that “Terra Nova” would have its premiere in the fall rather than in May, as it had been planned. The May premiere was intended to be a preview of the show, but the special effects will not be ready in time, Fox’s president of entertainment, Kevin Reilly, said in a statement. The visual effects are “essential,” he said, “so we are pushing back the special early preview date to give the visual effects team the time needed for their groundbreaking work.” The “Terra Nova” story starts in 2149, when Earth is dying and scientists must find a way to send a family back to a prehistoric, dinosaur-era version of the planet. In the place of “Terra Nova” on May 23 and 24, Fox will show the season finales of “The Chicago Code” and “Glee.”'"
"'11-03-14,'0','“The sorts of numbers I’m seeing are not the sort that could be linked with radiological symptoms,” Dr. Brenner said.Inside the plant, however, the three workers with radiation sickness were presumably exposed to much more radiation.“The medical consequences depend entirely on how much radioactive material is released,” Dr. Brenner said.The duration of exposure also matters.High levels of exposure can cause severe radiation sickness and death. Symptoms can include nausea, fatigue, vomiting, hair loss, diarrhea and hemorrhaging.Even high doses generally take several weeks to cause death.“It’s normally due to what we call ‘gut death,’ ” Dr. Brenner said. “The lining of the gut gets depleted.”Radiation interferes with the cells’ ability to divide and reproduce, and cells in the intestine are usually replaced frequently. For the same reason, the blood-forming cells in bone marrow are also sensitive to radiation. “What you really die of in the end is infection,” Dr. Brenner said.The more likely risk for the public is that of low-level exposures, which can increase the risk of cancer many years later. Again, the danger depends on the length of exposure and what types of radioactive materials to which one is exposed.Some radioactive materials are readily absorbed by the body and linger there. Iodine, for example, goes to the thyroid gland, and strontium to bone, and they emit radiation inside the body that over time can lead to cancer or leukemia. Other radioactive materials, like tritium, pass quickly through the body.The Japanese government is handing out iodine pills to flood the thyroid gland with ordinary iodine in hopes of preventing it from taking up the radioactive form.Dr. Brenner said the iodine pills were protective, but were “a bit of a myth” because their use is based on the belief that the risk is from inhaling radioactive iodine. Actually, he said, 98 percent of people’s exposure comes from milk and other dairy products.“The way radioactive iodine gets into human beings is an indirect route,” he said. “It falls to the ground, cows eat it and make milk with radioactive iodine, and you get it from drinking the milk. You get very little from inhaling it. The way to prevent it is just to stop people from drinking the milk.” He said that the epidemic of thyroid cancer around Chernobyl could have been prevented if the government had immediately stopped people from drinking milk.Crops can also be contaminated. “I wouldn’t be eating an apple from a tree close to the plant,” Dr. Brenner said.Children, and fetuses, are more vulnerable to radiation than are adults. Scientists estimate that about 5 percent of the population is genetically more susceptible to radiation than the rest.The radioactive elements released from the reactor form clouds that are carried off by the prevailing winds. Again, the risk depends on how much is released. “As it’s being blown away, to some extent it’s being dispersed,” Dr. Brenner said. “And some of it falls on the ground.”One way of measuring radiation exposure is in a unit called the rem. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, most people in the United States receive 0.3 rem per year just from normal, background radiation. Flying for 12 hours at 39,000 feet exposes a person to 0.006 rem. At 5 to 10 rem, lab tests can pick up changes in blood chemistry. Nausea starts after 50 rem, hemorrhaging at 100 rem. At 500 rem, half of people exposed will die within 30 days. At 2,000 rem, a person can die within hours or days. So far, one employee at a nuclear plant in Japan has been reported to have had an exposure of 10 rem, not enough to produce obvious symptoms. The annual dose limit for workers at nuclear plants in the United States is 5 rem.People are so afraid of radiation that any threat of exposure can cause what Dr. Brenner called psychophysical consequences. He cited an incident in 1987 in Goiania, Brazil, in which people were exposed to radioactive material stolen from a hospital. Fearing contamination, about 125,000 sought medical exams. Thousands reported symptoms of radiation sickness, like vomiting and rashes. Ultimately, only 249 turned out to have any signs of contamination.'"
"'11-03-14,'0','The dark, strange imagination of Jill Sigman is a theatrical phenomenon unto itself. In “Fowl Play: Some Dances About Civilization,” performed at the 92nd Street Y on Friday night, Ms. Sigman offered three pieces that clearly belonged to the same oddly coherent universe. It’s one in which human and animal behaviors are simultaneously visible, in which hallucinatory landscapes are conjured and dispelled with dreamlike elisions, and in which movement surges in uneasy fits and starts through the dancers’ bodies.In the first piece, “Fowl Play,” bleached bones of different sizes are laid in neat lines along the perimeter of the performance space. A woman in black (Jennifer Sydor) crouches over them as a man (Andre Koslowski) walks stiffly forward, using a wooden crook and balancing on huge platform shoes.The effect is of a child trying out high heels, and that childlike atmosphere is sustained as they crawl on all fours with loping, unfurling catlike arms; move with jerky hip bumps to a techno beat; or issue commands to each other. (“Sit!” “Dance!” “Down!”) Later they gather the larger bones and place them in a circle and scoot on their backs along the floor, detailing the physical sensations with yoga-class sincerity. (“We’re moving through the knee, the lower leg, into the left foot. ...”)A quartet, “Split Stitch,” created for GroundWorks Dance Theater, showed Ms. Sigman in equally strange but more formally compositional mode. We’re inhabiting a different dream here; it is one in which sculptural, slow-moving groupings mutate into ballet sequences, collapse into stylized poses and expressions, then abruptly switch to dance-club abandon. At the end a woman stands stiffly in a ballet retiré position, trying to balance as she says, over and over, “It’s lovely ... it’s nice ... gently ... lovely.”Like a section in “Fowl Play,” in which the dancers hawk bones to the audience, this feels like a slightly false note, suggesting that there is a message to be understood, which dulls the satisfyingly inchoate sensations evoked by the dance. There was something of that didactism too in a final solo, “Brain Song,” performed by Ms. Sigman. It opened with an instruction to take out our cellphones, then to dial a number written on a board onstage.The theatrical effect — dozens of lighted cellphones in the darkened theater, the soft murmuring echo of the recorded voice as we listened — was mesmerizing. Then the voice summoned us up to the stage, where we watched Ms. Sigman painstakingly wrap raw calves’ brains in tape (this took quite a long time), cradle them to her chest and move on the spot with subtle disconnections between her bending legs and undulating upper body.Too soon the lights went down. What did it mean? What did we feel? At the very least Ms. Sigman has us asking the questions.'"
"'11-03-14,'0','A Toyota spokeswoman in New York, Mira Sleilati, said all of its plants in Japan would be closed Monday but that no information was available about supplies of the Prius or other Japanese-built models. Besides the nearly 141,000 Priuses exported and sold in the United States last year, Toyota sold more than 229,000 Lexuses, which were mostly built in Japan.Earl Stewart, the owner of Earl Stewart Toyota in North Palm Beach, Fla., said demand for the Prius had surged so much that he recently sold out. He worries that Toyota might not be able to get many more to his dealership any time soon.“I put used Priuses on my showroom floor because we don’t have any new ones,” Mr. Stewart said. “The timing could not be worse. I don’t know how long it will take to get the roads and ports cleaned up and get Priuses back on the ships.”Toyota had planned to start building the Prius in the United States starting in 2010 but canceled those plans during the recession; instead it is readying a plant in Mississippi to assemble the Corolla, a compact sedan.Other affected models are the Toyota Yaris, a subcompact, and the Scion xB and xD, which are small hatchbacks sold at Toyota dealerships.Two plants that build the Yaris and Scion models are among four operated by Toyota subsidiaries that were damaged and had to be shut down. The plant that builds the Yaris was opened less than a month ago in Miyagi, an area north of Tokyo that suffered substantial damage.Nissan built 1.13 million vehicles in Japan last year and Honda made fewer than a million, slightly more than a quarter of the vehicles they sell worldwide.Honda said some plants would remain closed at least through Monday. Its dealers in the United States get more than 80 percent of their cars and trucks from North American plants. Several Honda hybrid models, including the Insight and CR-Z, and the Acura RL and TSX are made in Japan.A Honda research and development center in Tochigi was damaged, causing the death of an employee, and it had to be closed.Reuters reported that operations at the five assembly and parts plants for Subaru vehicles had also been halted.Nissan said all of its plants in Japan would remain closed on Monday but that most appeared to have avoided major damage. Officials were evaluating the facilities and had not made a decision about when they would reopen. Nissan dealers are not expected to experience any immediate effects, but there could be supply problems for Infiniti, Nissan’s luxury brand, which is built in Japan.The tsunami destroyed 1,300 Nissan vehicles at the Port of Hitachi awaiting export to American dealers as well as 1,000 vehicles at a service center in Miyagi, said a spokeswoman in the United States, Katherine Zachary.Cordy Cerami, the general manager at Infiniti of Montclair, a dealership outside Los Angeles, said: “We were assured that the plants were intact, but the suppliers were unsure. We should know something Monday or Tuesday.”Despite the uncertainty for his dealership, Mr. Cerami said, “Our concern is for the people of Japan first and foremost.”'"
"'11-03-14,'0','The White House issued a statement on Sunday that said the United States strongly condemned violence that had occurred in Bahrain and Yemen, and added, “We urge the government of Bahrain to pursue a peaceful and meaningful dialogue with the opposition rather than resorting to the use of force.”Bahrain, a kingdom on the Persian Gulf, is home to the United States Navy’s Fifth Fleet and is a crucial American ally. The Obama administration has supported the Khalifa family through the unrest, unlike the policy it adopted in seeking to remove the leaders of Libya and, to a lesser extent, Egypt. But the White House has tried to push Bahrain’s government to meet many of the protesters’ demands, worried that Iran, which is overwhelmingly Shiite, could exploit the unhappiness of Shiites in Bahrain.“I expressed the view that we had no evidence that suggested that Iran started any of these popular revolutions or demonstrations across the region,” Mr. Gates told reporters after his visit on Saturday. “But there is clear evidence that as the process is protracted, particularly in Bahrain, that the Iranians are looking for ways to exploit it and create problems.”He added, “Time is not our friend.”The demonstrations on Sunday occurred on King Faisal Highway at the entrance to Manama’s financial district. In a statement, the government said the violence began when “a group of protesters attacked unarmed police officers, resulting in one police officer being stabbed and another sustaining a serious head injury.”“Police then sought to disperse approximately 350 protesters by using tear gas in order to clear the road,” the government said. “The Ministry of Interior is currently undergoing operations to reopen the King Faisal Highway.”By Sunday evening, witnesses said, the highway remained essentially closed to traffic and was in the hands of demonstrators.“It is like a ghost town with the highway closed and the financial district closed,” Hussein Muhammad, a bookstore owner and activist, said by telephone. “Thousands of people came all morning, and hundreds were injured.” Two demonstrators suffered serious head injuries, witnesses said.Last month, Obama administration officials said that Bahrain’s king, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, listened when President Obama asked him to pull back his security forces after seven people were killed at the start of the protests.The demonstrators have grown frustrated that they have been allowed to hold on to Pearl Square, a traffic circle, but have not achieved their political goals. That is why, they said, they chose to move on the financial center in a country that prizes its business-friendly policies. And there is growing concern that the pro-democracy movement is deteriorating into a Sunni-Shiite split.“We want a new constitution, fair and free elections and a government elected directly by the people,” Mohammad Mattar, an engineer and member of the Waad pro-reform movement, said by telephone. “These are not sectarian demands, but political ones. We want a constitutional monarchy, a clear relationship between the ruling family and society. But the security forces are trying to create a sectarian divide.”Bahrain’s crown prince, Sheik Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, meanwhile, renewed a call for national dialogue on Sunday, promising that the talks would address proposals to increase the power of Parliament, Reuters reported.“We have worked actively to establish contacts to learn the views of various sides,” he said in a statement that was read on Bahrain TV, “which shows our commitment to a comprehensive and inclusive national dialogue.""Mr. Gates said on Saturday that he told the king and crown prince that change “could be led or it could be imposed.”He added, “Obviously, leading reform and being responsive is the way we’d like to see this move forward.”'"
"'11-03-14,'0','HONG KONG — The Japanese stock market plunged Monday morning as investors struggled to assess the impact of the huge earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan on Friday.The Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo was down 4.53 percent at 9,800 points at the midday break, with industrial and manufacturing stocks particularly hurt. Worries remained about the extent of the damage and continuing aftershocks as well as the systematic rolling blackouts that began Monday and their effect on production.The broader Topix, or Tokyo Stock Price index, was down 5.85 percent at the midday break.Nissan was down 8.5 percent and Toyota fell 7.2 percent by midday. Sony slumped 7.7 percent, Canon dropped 5.8 percent and Panasonic was down 6.9 percent.The country’s central bank, meanwhile, began pumping extra liquidity into the banking system in a bid to help stabilize markets. The bank offered a record 15 trillion yen, or $183.8 billion, toward this effort.The Bank of Japan holds its monetary policy meeting later Monday. With interest rates in Japan already near zero, it cannot lower rates further to help support the economy, though it could announce additional asset purchase steps, credit programs and lending facilities, economists said.'"

The key index in Australia was 2.1 percent lower, Singapore fell 2.8 percent, and the Sensex in India declined 1.5 percent. In mainland China, the Shanghai composite index dropped 1.4 percent.In Europe, the DAX index in Frankfurt, one of the region’s strongest performers last year, had shed 4.9 percent in afternoon trading, while the Euro Stoxx 50, an index of euro zone blue chips, had given up 4.1 percent.Analysts said investors were fleeing risky assets like equities and commodities and switching into safer cash and bonds. Volumes were much higher than normal. Yields on German bunds, French government bonds and United States Treasuries declined as prices rallied. The yield on the benchmark 10-year United States Treasury issue fell by 10 basis points in London.Spain sold €5.5 billion, or $7.7 billion in Treasury bills Tuesday at lower rates than a month ago.Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis in Brussels, said the selling in Europe was a “knee jerk” reaction to events in Japan. But he added, ""if this continues it could become a real problem.”“I’m worried,” he added, “the equity markets have come up so far, so fast, with only minor corrections that the market is vulnerable.”In addition, he said, policy makers have limited scope to handle major economic shocks, given the high level of budget deficits in the West and the fact that monetary policy options are almost exhausted.Declines in Japanese and other Asian stock markets accelerated after Kyodo news agency quoted the Tokyo metropolitan government as saying that “minute levels” of radiation have been detected in the Japanese capital.“People have gotten very nervous,” Tohru Sasaki, a foreign exchange strategist at JPMorgan Chase, said. “We don’t know if we’ll be able to make it to work tomorrow.”He noted that officials had been saying that the radiation risk was low, but “when they say it’s a problem for our health, that will be too late.”Analysts at Credit Suisse and Barclays Capital have estimated the damage figure in Japan from the quake and tsunami at up to 15 trillion yen, or $183.5 billion. Mr. Sasaki said that while the damage had been “very large,” in the long run, the stock market should reflect the prospect for corporate earnings. “But right now there’s no arguing with panic,” he said.Emil Wolter, head of Asian strategy at RBS in Singapore, concurred. “My feeling is that the markets may be overreacting and panicking a bit,” he said.Investors also kept an eye on fast-moving events in the Middle East. On Tuesday, Iran denounced as unacceptable the arrival of Saudi troops in Bahrain as protests against the country’s monarchy continue. The United States urged its nationals to leave the country, which hosts the Navy’s Fifth Fleet.Like equities, commodities are perceived as being a risky asset and hence investors have been looking to reduce their exposure to oil, which has been surging in recent weeks.In London, the benchmark Brent crude oil futures contract was down $3.10 at $110.57 a barrel.“Sentiment has turned more risk averse,” Benjamin Schröder and Peggy Jäger at Commerzbank said in a research note.The International Energy Agency said in a report Tuesday that global oil demand would be lower than previously forecast in 2011 as high oil prices begin to have a toll on the global economy.In a bid to quell the growing concerns, the Japanese central bank continued pumping liquidity into the financial system on Tuesday, adding to record amounts already injected on Monday.At the end of a policy meeting on Monday, the Bank of Japan had also announced that it would double an existing program to purchase government and corporate bonds and other financial assets, to 10 trillion yen.“They have done the right thing — in fact, it’s pretty much the only thing they can do right now,” said Beat Lenherr of LGT Capital Management. In the medium term, he added, the authorities “will have to discuss a new fiscal package, and fiscal consolidation will have to go out the window for the time being,” because of the cost of the earthquake.Mr. Wolter of RBS said the authorities in Japan had already introduced substantial supportive measures, both for the disaster relief and the financial markets, and more stimulus efforts are likely to follow.“They are dealing with a disaster on an unprecedented scale; the response to date has been pretty formidable,” he said.The response also has helped prevent a more marked surge in the yen. The Japanese currency has come under upward pressure, rising in the wake of the quake on Friday as companies and insurance companies repatriated cash to help pay for the reconstruction costs. The Japanese currency was trading at 81.5 yen per U.S. dollar in London before midday, compared to about 83 yen before the quake hit on Friday.Currencies that are closely correlated with movements in commodities — like the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar — declined. The Swiss franc, seen as a stable unit, was stronger.Kyohei Morita, chief economist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo, said he had extrapolated from the experience of the 1995 Kobe earthquake, which cost about 2 percent of gross domestic product, to estimate the current rebuilding cost at around 15 trillion yen, or 3 percent of G.D.P.“We have to reallocate money from other areas, like the new child care allowance,” he said. “But the government hasn’t been talking about that yet; maybe they’re too busy.”'"
"'11-03-15,'0','Assistant coaches, scouts and even Coach Rex Ryan and General Manager Mike Tannenbaum — while still doing essential work like preparing for the draft — are doing so at 75 percent of their normal salary. If no preseason games are lost, the Jets will repay the lost wages.The greatest sense of paralysis probably is being felt by Tannenbaum and his staff. The Jets have 15 expiring contracts, including those of key players like Cromartie and wide receivers Santonio Holmes and Braylon Edwards.Tannenbaum, under the terms of the lockout, can do nothing about securing their services for the future — for next year or beyond.In recent seasons, Tannenbaum had earned the nickname Trader Mike, plugging holes by swapping players for draft picks. He added Cromartie and defensive tackle Kris Jenkins in trades, but he also added them early into off-seasons, allowing them time to adjust to new systems, coaches and teammates. The longer the lockout lasts, the less likely it will be that Tannenbaum can consummate similar trades. And any players he may acquire will have less time to learn the Jets’ system.As a result, Tannenbaum could alter his draft philosophy. Most seasons, he selects the most talented player available, regardless of need or position. In this season of the lockout, with needs on the defensive line and at safety, and with three key receivers potentially free agents, he could elect to draft players for specific positions.The players, for their part, face their own challenges and confusions. During the lockout, players must conduct workouts on their own. Cornerback Darrelle Revis has said he will host the rest of the team’s defensive backs in Arizona, where he trains. But whether they will take him up on the offer remains unclear. Five members of the Jets’ secondary are free agents, and if any are injured, their careers could be damaged without the resources of a team in place to finance and oversee their recovery.For younger players, the issue with workouts is not security, but effectiveness. Members of last year’s draft class — Kyle Wilson, Vladimir Ducasse, John Conner and Joe McKnight — will not receive any instruction from their coaches. All were expected to play larger roles in 2011.Of course, many of these issues could become moot if, as the players have sought, a federal judge in Minnesota grants an injunction barring the owners from continuing to implement the lockout.Then, in many ways, business as usual would resume, at least for as long as the injunction lasted.“It may take longer than we all had hoped, but New York Jets fans should know that a deal will get done, and I remain confident that there will be football in 2011,” the Jets’ owner, Woody Johnson, said recently in a statement.Until then, the Jets and the rest of their N.F.L. counterparts will try to continue normal operations under unusual circumstances.'"
"'11-03-15,'0','A state judge on Long Island has upheld the takeover of Nassau County’s finances by a fiscal control board, rejecting the county’s contention that the action by the board was an unconstitutional overreach.In January, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, which was set up by the Legislature in 2000 to address the county’s last major fiscal crisis and continued to play an oversight role, declared a control period, saying the county had failed to balance its $2.7 billion budget despite months of warnings and a downgrade of its debt.The county executive, Edward P. Mangano, sued and mounted a public relations offensive in which he accused the control board of playing politics and of secretly wanting to raise property tax rates.Mr. Mangano, a Republican, argued that the six-member board — its chairman and two other members are Democrats — had been more lenient with his Democratic predecessor.In a ruling circulated on Monday, Justice Arthur M. Diamond of State Supreme Court in Mineola rejected the county’s request for a preliminary injunction blocking the takeover, bluntly dismissing most of its arguments.Justice Diamond said that “NIFA’s review appears to have become more stringent this year in comparison to the past,” but that its actions appeared to be justified. The judge allowed for a hearing on the county’s contention that the board’s action was “arbitrary and capricious.”In a statement, Mr. Mangano called the ruling “disturbing news” but invited the authority members to his offices on Wednesday to “enter into a collaborative process.” He also proposed a summit with county union leaders next week to seek labor concessions.'"
"'11-03-15,'0','An appeals court voted unanimously on Monday to reopen a criminal case into charges of the sexual abuse of minors by the Rev. Fernando Karadima, a Roman Catholic priest. A Vatican investigation found Father Karadima guilty last month of abusing minors and ordered him to retire to a “life of prayer and penitence.” A judge in Santiago closed a criminal case late last year, ruling there was not enough evidence to charge him. The appeals court ruled that the case should be reopened because the “events, time and circumstances of the punishable acts had not been sufficiently investigated.”'"
"'11-03-15,'0','Consequently, pressure on Portuguese 10-year bonds eased only slightly on Monday, with interest rates sticking close to the 7.4 percent at which they have traded for the last few weeks. Greek bonds rallied on the interest rate deal, but Irish bonds made only the smallest move as they did not receive a break on their interest rate. Spanish yields fell to 5.2 percent, still close to their high of 5.4 percent.“What we have now falls short of what is required, which is a way to bring interest rates down,” said Dirk Hoffman-Becking, a banking analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in London.Mr. Hoffman-Becking argued that these persistently high rates only recycled fear and uncertainty via higher financing costs for banks and, ultimately, lower economic growth. He added that unless the stability facility stepped into the secondary market to buy a large amount of bonds, rates would remain high. That is because private investors remain unwilling to buy, given the risk of default and the risk that austerity programs will undermine economic recovery.Again, the example of Portugal is relevant. On Friday, the government in Lisbon promised more spending cuts and revenue-raising measures to make good on its promise to bring the budget deficit down to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product from 7.4 percent this year. But with Portugal having one of the lowest growth rates in Europe, an uncompetitive export industry and public debt at 80 percent of G.D.P., investors see little upside in buying its bonds now, even at such wide spreads to comparable German bonds.For the most part, the European Central Bank has been unwilling to step in aggressively — it has bought only 77 billion euros in peripheral-country bonds so far. On Monday, the bank reported that it had not bought any bonds last week for the second week in a row.Thus, the lack of a big buyer is expected to keep rates high and continue to feed market unease. And that in many ways remains the unsolved root of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.Euro zone governments and the I.M.F. are asking that investors take a leap of faith and accept that the bone-crunching austerity programs in Greece, Ireland and Portugal, underpinned by tax increases and sharp wage reductions, will reduce deficits and, ultimately, high levels of debt.But as a comprehensive new report on the origins of Europe’s debt crisis by the investment bank Nomura points out, what is more likely to happen is that the debt of countries like Greece and Ireland will merely increase in what economists call a snowball effect, as the interest rate on the government’s debt grows faster than the stagnating economies.That problem will only be compounded when the European Central Bank increases interest rates, as it has warned it will do.The result is that the faster and deeper these countries cut, the more slowly they grow, with the perverse effect that their debt ends up increasing instead of decreasing.“In the short term, this problem is inevitable — your debt will continue to increase as long as your growth rate is below the interest rate you are paying,” said Peter Westaway, European economist at Nomura in London and one of the authors of the report.In 2013, for example, Greece’s debt will have increased to almost 160 percent of G.D.P. from 127 percent of G.D.P. And while the country was quick to hail its improved terms, the bottom line still remains that by 2014 it must begin paying interest equivalent to about 8 percent of its G.D.P. — a huge amount by any measure.For now, Greece has time. But with growth expected to shrink again this year, by 3.4 percent, and with unemployment now at about 15 percent, how long the Greek government, or any government for that matter, can continue to expect so much public sacrifice to pay off its bankers remains to be seen.'"
"'11-03-15,'0','The prime minister partly blamed international factors for the soaring costs, among them spiking oil prices because of the unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. He also pointed to looser monetary policy in the United States, where the Federal Reserve had expanded monetary supply in recent months — a policy known as quantitative easing — in an effort to assist the economy.But Mr. Wen also said China must continue to “mop up excess liquidity” at home if it is to hold prices in check. China has repeatedly ordered banks to issue less credit to curtail the money supply.Figures issued Monday suggested that the restrictions could be taking hold. Compared with the same period a year ago, bank lending slowed in February, as did the growth in the money supply, as broadly measured by a yardstick known as M2.Besides tightening monetary policy, Mr. Wen said, the government will hold local officials more strictly accountable for curbing housing prices and food prices. “Inflation is like a tiger,” he said. “Once set free, it will be very difficult to put the tiger back in its cage. We must not take this issue lightly.”Economists have urged China to allow the renminbi to appreciate in value to help curb inflation. But internationally, critics say that China artificially holds down the value of the renminbi against the dollar and other currencies to increase its exports. American officials also argue that this keeps the cost of American goods high and so limits China’s imports.Mr. Wen promised that the increase in the renminbi’s value would continue. But he added: “It should be a gradual process because we must bear in mind its impact on Chinese businesses and the employment situation.”He stressed that China’s five-year target of a 7 percent annual rise in the gross domestic product should not be considered low, insisting, “it will not be easy for us to achieve.” That is a drop, however, from the 7.5 percent goal of the past five years, which was ludicrously low: the economy grew an average of more than 11 percent annually during that period.Mr. Wen reiterated his position that a lack of political reform could threaten China’s economic advances, singling out corruption as the Communist Party’s single biggest threat. He praised the development of village and local elections, saying, “If we are to address the people’s grievances and meet their wishes, we must create conditions for people to criticize and supervise the government.”But Mr. Wen, who mentioned the need to reform China’s political system just once in the annual work report he submitted to the legislature, was no less circumspect at the news conference.He stressed that any change must take place under the leadership of the Communist Party. “It requires a stable and harmonious social environment, and it needs to be taken forward in an orderly way,” he said.'"
"'11-03-15,'0','Among the pioneers is Aubrey H. Fine, psychotherapist and professor at the California State Polytechnic University in Pomona, whose extensive successful use of therapy animals in treating children is documented in “The Handbook on Animal Assisted Therapy” (Elsevier/Academic Press, 2010).As Dr. Fine describes one of his first and most inspiring cases, 5-year-old Diane was brought to him because she recoiled in fright from strangers, and though she spoke at home, she refused to speak to anyone else, including her kindergarten teacher.A trained therapy dog named Puppy eventually broke the back of her selective mutism. Diane was petting Puppy, smiling and content, when Dr. Fine gave the dog a signal to walk away. Diane was crestfallen, and seeing the girl’s distress, Dr. Fine told her that all she had to do to get the dog back was to say, “Puppy, come.” Softly, the child said, “Puppy, come, please come, Puppy.” That incident became the bridge Dr. Fine needed to help the child overcome her socially disabling problem.He tells of another troubled child who finally began to speak about being physically abused when Dr. Fine told him that the misshapen therapy animal he was playing with had been rescued from an abusive home where it had been seriously injured. In another case in which a child was told where — and where not — to touch the therapy animal, the child opened up about being inappropriately touched, sexually abused, by a family member.“Children are more likely to reveal inner thoughts to the therapist because the animal is right next to them and helps them express themselves,” Dr. Fine said in an interview.In early work in a social skills program for hyperactive children, Dr. Fine found that they could be more easily taught how to behave calmly if allowed to handle his pet gerbil. “I realized this approach can have a tremendous impact in teaching because it helps to change how we relate to other beings,” he said.Although the field of animal-assisted therapy has grown a lot in the last four decades, experts readily acknowledge that it suffers from a lack of well-designed research that can establish guidelines for safety and effectiveness in various situations. For example, although using dolphins to treat autistic children has received considerable media attention, at least two studies found no evidence of benefit and considerable risk of harm to the animals and to the children, said James A. Griffin of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.The International Association of Human-Animal Interaction Organizations insists that members limit service and therapy animals to domestic species trained for the job. And the Delta Society, which provides training programs for the animals, will not certify wild or exotic animals like snakes, ferrets, lizards and wolf-hybrids. However, the Delta Society says it “is constantly expanding the range of species included in the Pet Partners program” when there is adequate research to document the safety of their use.To help give the field a firmer scientific footing, the Mars company, a leading producer of pet foods, initiated a research partnership with the national institute branch of which Dr. Griffin is deputy director. Among continuing studies:¶The effects of therapeutic horseback riding on children and adolescents with autism. If safe and effective, riding is less invasive than medications used to treat common symptoms like irritability and hyperactivity.¶A large epidemiological study to document the overall public health effects on children and adolescents of living with dogs and cats.¶A study to determine whether therapy animals can help children with behavior disturbances attributed to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder develop better self-regulation, self-esteem and social behavior.¶Studies using survey and genetic tools to help select the most effective cats or cat breeds to work with autistic children.Dr. Griffin acknowledged in an interview how difficult it can be to design a scientifically valid study using animals because “it can’t be a blind study — you know if the patient has a therapy dog.” But he described one recent study in which the patient, a young boy with autism, served as his own control. When he was with the therapy dog, levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the child dropped; the levels rose when the dog was taken away, and dropped again when the dog was returned. The next step would be to coordinate biochemical changes with behavioral effects — is the child calmer and easier to handle when with a therapy animal?Dr. Fine emphasized the challenges of working with therapy animals as well as documenting its effectiveness. He said, “You can’t just bring in any animal to a therapy setting. The animal has to be very well trained, reliable, obedient and have the right temperament. It can’t be overly anxious or easily startled. And the therapist has to know how to use it as a therapy adjunct, in combination with good psychotherapy. The animal is there to help support what I’m doing, to act as a catalyst and not a distraction. And, of course, animal-assisted interventions have to be safe for everyone involved — the patient and the animal.”'"
"'11-03-15,'0','In a welcome turn for the rebels, who have asked for military assistance, including airstrikes, from Western powers, Secretary of State met with unnamed opposition leaders in a Paris hotel room after a meeting of the foreign ministers of the countries in the — the first such high-level meeting.In Benghazi, the vice chairman of the interim opposition ruling council, Abdul Hafidh Ghoga, said a rebel representative would use the meeting with Mrs. Clinton to demand quicker intervention. Inaction, Mr. Ghoga warned, “would have negative results on our future relations with the West.”Apparently seeking to undermine the rebels’ determination to continue their fight, government authorities on Monday repeated an offer of amnesty for combatants who give up their weapons, Reuters said, quoting state television. The response was not immediately clear.West of Tripoli, loyalists appeared to be tightening their siege of other rebel-held areas, following a brutal week of battle in which they recaptured — and nearly demolished — the strategically important town of Zawiyah. The legacy of that battle haunted the residents of Zuwarah, a Berber town of about 40,000 people.“We know what happened in Zawiyah, and we think that the same thing is going to happen here soon,” one resident said, speaking anonymously to protect himself and his family from retribution.“They say that if you take down the flag, we will let you live,” he added. “Maybe we will fight, but we will have a lot of casualties.”On the eastern front, amid conflicting claims by the rebels and loyalist forces, the battle lines were hard to locate. The government said on state television that its troops controlled Brega, The Associated Press reported. At the same time, Mr. Ghoga said that rebel soldiers were still fighting in the city, particularly at night, and that on Sunday they had captured more than two dozen loyalist fighters there. But he did not provide any proof of that claim.As the fighting nears Benghazi, ’s second-largest city, rebel leaders, reacting to criticism of their battlefield performance, have contended that they may still have a chance: Colonel Qaddafi’s forces, they contend, are overextending their lines as they push rebels back and might be running short of fuel. Mr. Ghoga said the rebels were not facing a similar fuel shortage.And in an interview on Sunday evening, Gen. Abdul Fattah Younes, the country’s former interior minister and now the head of the rebel army, said the rebels still retained a sizable fighting force, though he said a no-flight zone was still a necessity. General Younes, the former commander of the special forces, said thousands of officers from that unit were now being recalled and mobilized. He said the rebels also had about 100 working tanks that had not yet been deployed. “The time will come,” he said.There was an eerie calm in Ajdabiya, a strategic town about 100 miles south of Benghazi that has braced for an attack by forces loyal to Colonel Qaddafi. Some lines formed at bakeries, and a few cars were seen transporting residents out of the city.Soviet-made warplanes struck a military barracks at the edge of Ajdabiya that has housed the rebels, who seem, at least anecdotally, to be making an effort to bring discipline to their unruly ranks. One blast struck a guard post at the barracks, spraying shards of green glass around the entrance. The other detonated just feet away from a pile of ammunition and rocket-propelled grenades, which did not go off.Hospital officials said five people were wounded, one of them seriously.At the entrance to Ajdabiya, marked by two metal arches, rebels have built dirt fortifications and filled hundreds of sandbags. Ammunition boxes scattered around a courtyard were moved inside or toward fighting near Brega. Rebel leaders repeatedly urged the civilians to leave the entrance, where reporters’ access was limited.“If he takes Ajdabiya, he will win,” said Yunes Mohammed, an oil safety official milling about with a crowd at the town’s edge, where strong winds swept up sand.“His people can go from here to Benghazi. But the people of Ajdabiya will fight because we know that if he takes the area, he will kill us all, and we know he has done this before.”'"

"'11-03-16,'0','Like virtually every serious painter at the time, he started out under the potent influence of Abstract Expressionism and set out to be an abstract painter, encouraged and advised by Willem De Kooning, whom he befriended in Provincetown.He enrolled in Brooklyn College, where he studied with Ad Reinhardt, Mark Rothko and Alfred Russell, among others. The school was, he later said, “a hotbed of abstract painting radicalism,” with an emphasis on discovering new pictorial ideas, drawn from unlikely sources, that would generate fresh work.After graduating from Brooklyn College in 1952, he studied Asian art and 14th-century Italian art for a year at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University before serving in the Army. In 1957 he earned a master’s degree in fine arts from Cornell.His artistic conversion took place while he studied in Italy on a Fulbright scholarship in the early 1960s. After seeing the work of artists like Signorelli and Mantegna, he wrote in “Unconventional Realists,” he began “searching for believable representation rather than the different brand of abstract manipulation I was involved in before.”He had exhibited engravings and intaglios at Tanager, one of the earliest of the cooperative galleries on 10th Street in Manhattan, but in 1962 he began showing at the Schoelkopf Gallery, which represented him until the death of its owner, Robert Schoelkopf, in 1991. Thereafter he showed at the Tatistcheff Gallery.John Canaday, reviewing a show of his cityscapes for The New York Times in 1964, noted their dry, dispassionate stillness, adding that “if a section of a city could be taken like a spray of leaves or a blossom and pressed and dried between the pages of a book, it would come out like these paintings — with most of the color and all of the juice gone, but with a new clarity in the flattened version of a pattern originally supplied by life.”Mr. Laderman soon began turning to still life painting, depicting bottles, vases and jars in a cool, crystalline manner.In the mid-1980s, he embarked on a new body of work that plumbed the mysterious territory of sex, death and the psychodrama of the family. In his ambiguous tableaus, rendered in a visual style reminiscent of de Chirico or Balthus, with a wild palette of acidic oranges and yellows, horrible events have just taken place, or seem about to happen.In the three-canvas work “Murder and Its Consequences,” a clothed man argues with a nude woman, then strangles her on a bed. In the third canvas, she is gone and he lies in deathlike repose, eyes closed and hands clasped over his belt.In his ambitious “The House of Death and Life,” a murder mystery told in six panels, the action unfolds in the rooms of a cutaway dollhouse, where somnambulistic figures dream or sleepwalk as a life is taken.Mr. Laderman taught at Pratt Institute and, for many years, at Queens College.In addition to his son Raphael, of San Francisco, he is survived by another son, Michael, of Manhattan, and a brother, Ezra, of New Haven. His wife, Carol, an anthropologist, died in 2010.A retrospective exhibition, “Gabriel Laderman: Unconventional Realist,” traveled to four university museums and the New York Academy of Art in 2008 and 2009.'"
"'11-03-16,'0','Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said Tuesday that the fatal beating of an 18-year-old man in Queens early Saturday “falls into the category of a hate crime.”The victim, Anthony Collao, was at a party at a house in Woodhaven when five gate-crashers, none older than 17, pushed their way inside, Mr. Kelly said. Once indoors, they began “making homophobic remarks” and writing messages on the wall in red markers, said Mr. Kelly, who was asked about the case after a City Council hearing.As Mr. Collao, who the police said was at the party with a girlfriend, left about 1 a.m., he encountered the same group outside the house, on 90th Street. One of the teenagers had a metal bat and another had a cane, according to a criminal complaint.With a shout of “this is my hood,” the teenagers chased Mr. Collao down 90th Street and set upon him in a storm of punches, kicks and blows from “an object that appeared to be a stick,” according to the complaint.Mr. Collao was taken to Jamaica Hospital and died late Monday after he was taken off life support, Mr. Kelly said. The attack and the death were reported by The Daily News on Tuesday.When the police arrested one of those suspected in the attack, Christopher Lozada, he had an Atlanta Braves cap that belonged to Mr. Collao, according to the complaint. The police also discovered blood on Mr. Lozada’s clothing and on the sneakers of a second person arrested in the case, according to the complaint, which said that a metal pipe with blood on it was recovered from the crime scene.'"
"'11-03-16,'0','Netflix may be on the verge of acquiring its first original television series, “House of Cards,” a drama to be directed by David Fincher.The negotiations were first reported Tuesday afternoon by Deadline.com, which said that the two-season, 26-episode commitment would be valued at more than $100 million.An executive close to the negotiations confirmed the report that Netflix had entered the bidding for the show. There was still considerable uncertainty Tuesday about the terms of the potential deal, and a Netflix spokesman declined to comment.A second executive close to the negotiations dismissed the $100 million estimate, noting that there was no deal between the parties yet, and that in the event a deal is struck, it would cost Netflix significantly less. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized by their bosses to speak about the negotiations.Picking up the exclusive rights to a television show would effectively make Netflix a network similar to ABC or HBO and would underscore just how disruptive the company has become to the media business.'"

"'11-03-16,'0','Amid growing concerns that the nation’s infrastructure is deteriorating, a group of Democrats, Republicans, and labor and business leaders called Tuesday for the creation of a national infrastructure bank to help finance the construction of things like roads, bridges, water systems and power grids.The proposal — sponsored by Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas — would establish an independent bank to provide loans and loan guarantees for projects of regional or national significance. The idea is to attract more infrastructure investment from the private sector: by creating an infrastructure bank with $10 billion now, they say, they could spur up to $640 billion worth of infrastructure spending over the next decade.“We have a choice,” Mr. Kerry said at a news conference in Washington. “We can either build, and compete, and create jobs for our people, or we can fold up, and let everybody else win. I don’t think that’s America. I don’t believe anybody wants to do that.”To underscore the need for better infrastructure, two frequent rivals were on hand at the news conference: Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the main business lobby. With a nod to the strange-bedfellows experience of having a labor leader as an ally, Mr. Donohue said, “He and I are going to take our show on the road as the new ‘Odd Couple.’ ”But the proposal may not have clear sailing. While Senators Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, and Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat, will undoubtedly support the measure, Senate officials said the outlook for such a program is dim, given the current fiscal constraints. And Congress, like state governments, has been hesitant to cede control of choosing which projects to finance, even as their spending priorities have often been questioned.President Obama has called for establishing an infrastructure bank since his 2010 campaign. His budget calls for establishing one — and gives it the catchier name I-Bank — that would work somewhat differently: it would create a $30 billion bank that would invest in transportation projects alone, and that would provide grants as well as loans.With an expanded reach that includes water and energy projects, the bank being proposed in the Senate would be able to spur investment from more types of private funds, and back projects in a wider swath of the nation, said Michael B. Likosky, the author of “Obama’s Bank: Financing a Durable New Deal.”'"
"'11-03-16,'0','Speaking for the central bank, Mr. Trichet told the finance ministers, “We continue to think that the improvement in governance that is presently envisaged is in our opinion insufficient to draw the lessons from the crisis.”He added that the debt crisis had revealed weaknesses that would not be “fully corrected, in our opinion, by what is presently envisaged.”Other officials later played down his comments, pointing out that the central bank had, through many months of discussions, sought to toughen proposals to bring more rigor to euro zone finances.“We know the position of the E.C.B,” said Amadeu Altafaj-Tardio, a spokesman for Mr. Rehn. “The E.C.B. considers the legislative package was the minimum level of commitment.”Officials hope the legislation will be agreed on by June with the European Parliament, where numerous amendments have been proposed, so Mr. Trichet’s comments may have been intended to influence the debate.The latest issue is the extent to which countries will, if they have enough allies, be able to avoid sanctions if they breach fiscal rules. Under the plan, countries would be forced to make deposits that would be converted to fines in the event of repeated noncompliance.The issue is a delicate one because France and Germany, the euro zone’s largest economies, flouted the Stability and Growth Pact in 2003 but did not face any consequences, undermining the authority of the agreement.Last year, as the proposals for tightening the euro zone’s rules evolved, France managed to qualify a provision that sanctions on offending countries be applied semiautomatically. The accord reached on Tuesday represented a compromise.Mr. Rehn, who had been pushing for tough measures, said he was “reasonably satisfied with this outcome.”The finance ministers will meet again Monday to resolve issues remaining with another part of the campaign to restore confidence in the euro: the bailout fund for struggling member states.On Saturday, the leaders of the euro zone countries agreed to increase the lending capacity of the bailout fund and to allow the fund to buy government bonds on the primary market — that is, when they are issued by governments. They also offered Greece a reduction on the interest rate it is paying on the loans that it received in its bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.The euro zone left several issues unresolved, including how, technically, to raise the effective lending capacity of the bailout fund. The finance ministers will address those issues before they meet again on March 24 and 25.'"
"'11-03-16,'0','Meanwhile, the continuing political unrest in the Middle East is likely to constrain oil supplies.In Libya, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi appears to have gained some momentum in battling a rebellion that took over much of the eastern part of the country.Still, whatever the outcome of the fighting, many specialists contend that there is little chance for a quick resumption of Libyan oil exports, which have been interrupted for a month.Even if Colonel Qaddafi’s forces were to prevail, it might be a year before the government exports oil again, and even then it will most likely face the prospect of international sanctions.Tensions also flared again in the Persian Gulf as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates sent troops into Bahrain on Monday in an unprecedented move to suppress protests led by the Shiite majority against the Sunni monarchy. The sudden militarization of the crisis in Bahrain is likely to stoke fears about stability in the Persian Gulf at a time of rising Sunni-Shiite tensions throughout the Muslim world.With Libyan exports suspended, the world is down to an increasingly slim cushion of spare capacity, estimated at four million barrels a day, to make up for supply shortfalls or meet rising demand. Much of that spare capacity is in Saudi Arabia.Jan Stuart, an economist at Macquarie Securities, has raised his forecast for oil prices for the rest of the year and now predicts they will average $110 a barrel this year, up from a previous forecast of $95 a barrel. “Talk about looking through the fog of war,” Mr. Stuart said.The supply pressures have been less of a problem in February and March because those are weak months for oil consumption and a time when refineries traditionally perform lengthy maintenance operations in anticipation of the surge in demand that starts before summer.In April, global oil demand is expected to increase by a million barrels a day as refineries come back online. The International Energy Agency, an energy adviser to developed nations, acknowledged that the market was headed into more turbulent waters.“Market insouciance may change abruptly as April approaches,” the agency said in its monthly report released Tuesday.The energy agency said developed nations could tap into their strategic reserves if the market tightened more significantly. “But the fact that this is now being seriously considered shows how far we have come from earlier, more comforting days when a tranquil early 2011 oil market looked more likely,” the agency said.Natural gas supplies could also come under pressure. In the United States, natural gas futures have remained relatively stable, at $3.97 per thousand cubic feet. But demand from Japan for the liquefied natural gas needed to make up for its lost nuclear capacity might drive up prices around the world.Japan has shut down 11 nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 9.7 gigawatts — the equivalent of 200,000 barrels of oil a day, or 4.5 percent of Japan’s consumption.“It’s a little too early to say how the market will be affected, but there’s likely going to be a tightening of the liquefied natural gas market,” said Simon Henry, Royal Dutch Shell’s chief financial officer, at the company’s strategy day in London. “Especially Europe is likely to be affected.”Shell said that one shipment of liquefied natural gas arrived Monday night in the Tokyo Bay area. But the resupplying operations face complications because of the extent of the damage in northern Japan, according to Shell’s chief executive, Peter Voser.In the longer run, safety concerns about a nuclear accident might curtail the resurgence of the nuclear industry in the United States and Europe. Germany said it would take off line seven of its oldest reactors, or about a quarter of its nuclear capacity, for safety checks.'"
"'11-03-16,'0','“We don’t know the extent to which the post-tsunami Japan is going to grow, and whether or not there will be consequences for other countries as well,” said Chris Lafakis, an energy economist for Moody’s Analytics.Amid the flight to safety, oil prices fell $4.01 to settle at $97.18 a barrel, while gold dropped $30.70 to $1,395.70 an ounce. The 10-year Treasury note, meanwhile, rose 14/32, to 102 22/32. The yield fell to 3.30 percent, from 3.36 percent late Monday.The central fear is that the disaster — especially the danger of increased radiation exposure from stricken Japanese nuclear reactors — could rip a big hole in the supply lines of the world’s third largest economy and set back the global recovery.Some of the first ripples reached the United States on Tuesday as Subaru said it was canceling all overtime at its plant in Lafayette, Ind., which builds the Outback, Legacy and Tribeca models, to reduce the chance that it will run out of some parts from Japan.“The main economic shock is not the direct loss of business, but spillover effects in terms of damage to the power and transportation industries and disruptions to the supply chain,” said Ethan S. Harris, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “Specifically, many auto and electronics firms rely on the affected region for parts.”As a result of the volatility, several debt offerings were postponed, while Toys “R” Us was forced to delay a planned syndicated loan.The ultimate impact on world growth is likely to be small, however. “The quake-ravaged economy, the world’s third largest, could lower economic activity in Japan as much as one percentage point, and shave off worldwide growth 0.2 percentage point in 2011,” said Bernard Baumohl, an economist at the Economic Outlook Group.The region affected by the quake accounts for only about 6 percent of Japanese gross domestic product, and economists calculate that the short-term effects might be eventually offset as Japan spends hundreds of billions to rebuild.Closer to home, a temporary reduction in American exports to Japan might trim 0.1 to 0.2 of a percentage point from United States economic growth in 2011, according to Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC.One major exporter, General Electric, which designed the reactors at the Fukushima nuclear plant, fell for the second day in a row, closing down 1.6 percent at $19.61. G.E. has either built or licensed 92 nuclear reactors now operating worldwide — about 20 percent of the global total, according to Michael Tetuan, a spokesman for General Electric.But nuclear power development remains a small part of the company’s overall operation; it produces reactors in partnership with Hitachi. The business accounted for just $1 billion in revenues in 2010 — a tiny fraction of the $85 billion generated by its industrial supply business.“Nuclear is not a major piece of the puzzle for G.E.,” said Daniel Holland, an analyst with the investment research firm Morningstar. “This doesn’t move the needle a whole bunch.”Despite the problems in Japan, the Japanese yen strengthened, as speculation increased that big Japanese investors like pension funds and banks — Japan is the second-largest holder of United States Treasuries — would dump their overseas holdings and buy yen to return cash home.At the same time, there were signs that investors were unwinding other trading positions. With interest rates near zero at home, Japanese investors used yen to buy Australian and Canadian dollars, as well as the Brazilian real, to invest in higher-yielding assets there. Other foreign investors placed similar bets, bullish on those countries’ growth prospects.But as demand for the yen picks up, those currencies have weakened. The Canadian dollar fell 1.5 percent on Tuesday morning, while the Australian dollar fell around 2 percent. The Brazilian real has fallen nearly 4 percent since Friday.Across Wall Street, traders said the initial reaction among many hedge funds and institutional investors to the Japanese crisis was to sell first and ask questions later.“It’s definitely been risk-off since Friday,” said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist with Wall Street investment bank Jefferies & Company. “Uncertainty tends to breed a desire for safety. As it becomes easier to assess what all of the ramifications are, I suspect that will recede.”For instance, Robin Thorn, who oversees the $1.3 billion PineBridge Global Equities mutual fund, decided on Sunday evening to cut the fund’s 9 percent position in Japanese stocks in half.With the help of his team of more than two dozen analysts in Tokyo — many who have been sleeping in their offices — Mr. Thorn sold off companies that had exposure to nuclear-plant construction. “That turned out to be the right thing in the shorter term,” Mr. Thorn said.But Mr. Thorn said he and his team were also looking for buying opportunities, saying he had increased the fund’s stake in companies that will play a role in Japan’s rebuilding.And on Tuesday afternoon as Japanese American Depositary Receipts and exchange-traded funds rebounded sharply from early lows, Mr. Thorn said he expected Japanese markets to rally.“We feel a lot of the emotional selling has been done,” Mr. Thorn said. “And it’s clear through the action of U.S.-based investors today that people are now trying to look for bargains.”'"

"'11-03-17,'1','Regulators hoped that if banks handed out more shares and other forms of deferred pay, executives would avoid the type of excessive risk-taking that contributed to the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.At that time, regulators also pressured lenders to cut dividends and shore up their finances as loan losses mounted. Even some of the strongest institutions halted their stock repurchase programs and cut their quarterly dividend to a mere nickel or penny a share. As part of the financial bailout in 2008, banks need federal approval before they could increase the dividends. Dividends for financial companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell to $19 billion in 2010, from $51 billion in 2007. JPMorgan Chase, for example, now has an annual dividend of 20 cents a share, compared to $1.52 before the crisis.The larger dividends will also put billions of dollars into the pockets of big investors, like pension and hedge funds, as well as retirees who rely on the quarterly payouts as a steady source of income. JPMorgan has said it plans to pay roughly 30 percent of earnings as dividends. With analysts projecting the company to earn over $19 billion in 2011, that would translate to an annual dividend of $1.13 a share.Several other banks have said they plan to pay a similar percentage of earnings to shareholders. So chief executives stand to reap especially large gains because they are traditionally among the biggest holders of company stock.Corporate governance experts do not typically fret about such payouts since they help align the interests of management with those of investors more equally than other compensation practices. However, the dividends collected by chief executives will not be broken out in the compensation tables found in corporate filings. Investors must crunch the numbers themselves.“Even a small dividend can add up to a pretty substantial amount of money,” said Paul Hodgson, a senior research associate at GovernanceMetrics International. “It could be just another bonus for some C.E.O.’s. For others, it is a huge windfall.”The likely approval on dividends comes as the Federal Reserve completes a second round of stress tests for the nation’s 19 largest banks. Regulators are gauging whether they have stockpiled enough capital to weather a still-anemic economic recovery and meet the higher requirements put in place by new international accords.The top banks will learn the results of the examinations by Monday, including whether they can raise dividends and buy back shares. With the Fed’s expected blessing in hand, financial stocks could get a lift in the coming days, as one bank after another announces their plans.“Allowing some dividends to go up is a big vote of confidence in our banks,” said Jeffery Harte, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill.In addition to JPMorgan Chase and Capital One, other institutions hoping for dividend increases include BB&T, Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial and Wells Fargo.If Wells Fargo pays 30 percent of earnings to shareholders, its chief executive, John G. Stumpf, would reap nearly $400,000 a year in dividends, based on the bank’s expected profit in 2011. Using similar assumptions, PNC Financial’s chief executive, James E. Rohr, stands to earn close to $1 million a year.Other chief executives, like Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America and Vikram S. Pandit of Citigroup, may have to wait until the second half of 2011 or even into 2012 for a modest dividend increase, because their companies are recovering more slowly.American Express, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have told investors they may eschew dividend increases in favor of things like investing in their businesses or buying back stock. Goldman expects to use some of the money to repurchase the preferred shares it sold Warren E. Buffett at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.Some regional banks, like SunTrust Banks and KeyCorp, are forbidden by the federal government to raise dividends because they have yet to return the billions in federal bailout money they received in 2008. Depending on how those banks fare in the stress tests, the Fed may let them start repaying the government in the coming weeks.'"
"'11-03-17,'1','Nate Dogg, a singer with a silky, burly voice who helped shape the sound of West Coast hip-hop, died on Tuesday in Long Beach, Calif., the city where he was born and that he helped memorialize in song. He was 41.The cause was complications of a stroke, said his manager, Rod McGrew.Nate Dogg was the first male singer whose fame was predicated almost completely on his appearances on the songs of rappers. At the beginning of his career such collaborations were rare, and often ham-handed. But he incorporated hip-hop posturing into his vocals, and his blend of cocksureness and haunted melancholy became a genre staple.Born Nathaniel Dwayne Hale on Aug. 19, 1969, Nate Dogg spent much of his childhood in Clarksdale, Miss., where he sang in the choir of the church where his father was the pastor, before moving back to Long Beach. There, following a stint in the Marines, he formed the group 213, after the local area code, with his high school friends the rappers Snoop Doggy Dogg and Warren G.The group’s demo was heard by the superstar producer Dr. Dre, who eventually got Nate Dogg signed to the emerging hip-hop powerhouse Death Row Records. He made his recording debut in 1992 on Dr. Dre’s multiplatinum album “The Chronic” (Death Row/Interscope), which became the foundational document of G-funk, the smooth, lethargic style pioneered by Dr. Dre that was a central element in hip-hop’s crossover to the pop mainstream.Nate Dogg remained in the orbit of Death Row Records for a few years, appearing on Snoop Doggy Dogg’s “Doggystyle” and 2Pac’s “All Eyez on Me” among other albums. His 1994 duet with Warren G, the platinum single “Regulate” (Def Jam), was one of the most popular hip-hop songs of the era.Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, as hip-hop began to experiment more with melody and as the lines between rap and R&B became more porous, Nate Dogg remained an in-demand collaborator, working with 50 Cent, Fabolous, E-40, Mos Def and dozens more. A chorus by Nate Dogg, in his signature voice that spanned tenor and baritone ranges, became an imprimatur of a certain brand of hip-hop: tough yet accessible, menacing yet alluring. He also served as a template for later generations of male singers who gained notice primarily as collaborators on rap songs — Akon, T-Pain and Bruno Mars, among others — though none had his stoic force.'"
"'11-03-17,'1','Q. Do you need to have a certain Internet connection speed to stream Netflix movies so they don’t stop and start all the time?A. Netflix recommends that you stream its movies over a broadband connection with a speed of at least 1.5 megabits per second (1.5Mbps). To get better-looking video on par with a DVD, the company recommends using an Internet connection of at least 3 megabits per second. If you are watching the video on a computer, you may want to check and make sure the machine can handle Netflix video streams; visit www.netflix.com/Help and search for “system requirements.”Slower connection speeds or a busy home network may cause streamed Netflix video to skip, stutter or frequently rebuffer to the point where it becomes too annoying to watch. If your connection speed meets the recommended requirements but your video is still sluggish, check that your network bandwidth is not being used for online gaming, file-sharing or additional video streaming by other people in the house.If you are streaming the video over a wireless network connection, make sure your computer or Netflix device is getting a strong network signal. If you are using a Netflix-enabled set-top box for streaming video to the TV, connecting it directly to the home network router with an Ethernet cable instead of using a wireless connection may help.Some residential broadband packages may provide download speeds of only 768 kilobits per second to 1 megabit per second. Check with your Internet provider to see what connection speed you are supposed to be getting — or to inquire about an upgrade if you want the faster speed package to use Netflix. You can also check your connection speed yourself at sites like www.speedtest.net or www.speakeasy.net/speedtest.'"
"'11-03-17,'1','EL CENTRO, Calif. — The crowd gathers early each morning at the unemployment center, which sits amid a long strip of beige government buildings in the center of town.By 9 a.m., the cubicles are filled with people huddled over computer screens, searching for jobs in a town with far too few. They wonder aloud about their own requirements: Will they work for $12 an hour? How about $10 making deliveries across town?The center, One Stop, is the hub of services for the thousands of unemployed here. This is where business owners come if they want to hire, so dozens of job seekers arrive each morning, thinking maybe this will be the day they finally find work.By lunchtime on a recent Wednesday, the would-be workers were restless after hours of looking. They gathered on the sidewalk outside, joining the dozen or so students enrolled in a job search skills course. As many ate lunch from an In-N-Out Burger down the street, they traded stories about who had it the toughest. One man in his 20s said he could not get work because he does not speak Spanish, only English.A few women hoped to find jobs as office assistants. But they were reconsidering that plan after Rachel Vargas told them she was laid off after working as an assistant for more than 17 years.“I’m willing to do anything,” said Ms. Vargas, 46. “But the things I can get — they tell me I am too qualified, so what do I do then?” JENNIFER MEDINA'"

"'11-03-17,'1','The New York Times said Wednesday that four of its journalists reporting on the conflict in Libya were missing.Editors said they were last in contact with the journalists, who were reporting from the eastern city of Ajdabiya, on Tuesday morning New York time. And despite secondhand reports that they had been swept up by Libyan government forces, the newspaper said it could not confirm that information.“We have talked with officials of the Libyan government in Tripoli, and they tell us they are attempting to ascertain the whereabouts of our journalists,” said Bill Keller, executive editor of The Times. “We are grateful to the Libyan government for their assurance that if our journalists were captured they would be released promptly and unharmed.”The missing journalists are Anthony Shadid, the Beirut bureau chief and twice winner of the Pulitzer Prize for foreign reporting; Stephen Farrell, a reporter and videographer who was kidnapped by the Taliban in 2009 and rescued by British commandos; and two photographers, Tyler Hicks and Lynsey Addario, who have worked extensively in the Middle East and Africa.Mr. Keller said there was some speculation that they had been detained at a government checkpoint between Ajdabiya and Benghazi, a rebel stronghold in eastern Libya. If that is the case, he said, they would eventually be taken to Tripoli. “Beyond that, we’re still pretty much in the dark,” he added.The uprisings in the Arab world have made the region a perilous place for journalists. During the revolt that toppled Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, journalists were assaulted, accosted, detained and killed. Two Times reporters were detained there and eventually released unharmed. Lara Logan of CBS News was sexually assaulted by a group of men. An Egyptian reporter was shot and killed.Journalists’ safety in Libya has become only more uncertain since the month-old revolt began. Last week, the BBC reported that four of its journalists had been detained by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s security forces. They were beaten with rifles and subjected to mock executions, the network said. Also last week, a cameraman for Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based television network, was gunned down in what it said was apparently an ambush near Benghazi.The Committee to Protect Journalists has documented more than 300 cases of attacks on journalists in the Middle East and North Africa since uprisings began there in January. More than 40 of those have occurred in Libya.Joel Simon, the group’s executive director, said news organizations never had easy answers when it came to balancing safety with decisions about how to cover stories that put journalists in harm’s way.“In every one of these countries there are vital stories unfolding, stories of crucial significance that need to be told, so it’s understandable that news organizations are accepting a certain level of risk,” Mr. Simon said. “But how do you balance those risks? Those are very tough calls that journalists and news organizations have to make on an ongoing basis. But the starting point, I think, has to be these are crucially important stories.”The Times, like many news organizations, has procedures in place to carefully track its journalists’ whereabouts in war zones and areas of conflict.Susan Chira, foreign editor of The Times, said that each night, editors discuss plans for the following day with their correspondents, who are expected to check in regularly.“We expect to hear from them several times a day — and so do their colleagues in the field, who are often our early warning system of any trouble,” Ms. Chira said.The Times’s foreign picture editor, David Furst, said he requires photographers to check in with him at a designated time each day.'"

"'11-03-17,'1','WHEN Teresa Zumarán and her husband, Diego Wajner, began hunting for a place to build a vacation home six years ago, ocean views were their first priority. “I spent my childhood summers at my grandparents’ house right in front of the beach,” said Ms. Zumarán, 44. “I wanted to relive that feeling.”They set their sights on El Chorro, an unusually hilly area in this mostly flat beach town about 90 miles from Montevideo, where they live with their two daughters, Mia, 5, and Martina, 6.During a drive through the neighborhood, they found a 5,000-square-foot lot less than a half-mile from the beach, listed at the fire-sale price of $15,000. (Similar lots nearby were as much as $60,000, but the seller lived abroad and wanted a quick transaction.) But it wasn’t clear if the overgrown sloping site would offer the ocean views they coveted, so Ms. Zumarán’s brother Juan, who is an architect, agreed to take a look.After climbing onto the roof of a neighbor’s one-story house, from which he could see all the way to the shore, he assured them they could build a house with the views they wanted, and once the sale went through, he got to work designing it.Mr. Zumarán’s first task was elevating the site, which he did by bringing in truckloads of sand to create a plateau for “the best possible view,” he said.'"

"'11-03-17,'1','In her latest book to feature the quasi-retired detective named Jackson Brodie, Kate Atkinson lets him deliver a fair working definition of how an Atkinson book is apt to unfold. A whole lot of cryptic individuals may be involved in it, he admits: “Jackson didn’t know what ‘it’ was, but that was the point, wasn’t it? That was what solving something was about, it was hunting the ‘it’ down, pinning its arms above its head and making it spill the beans. It was like being in a game, a game where you didn’t know the rules or the identity of the other players and where you were unsure of the goal.”In other words, these books cannot be simply read. They must also be wrestled with, and that’s where much of the fun lies. This odd tactic has made Ms. Atkinson a darling of other writers, who understandably admire the wizardry of her techniques. It has also made nettlesome marvels out of the first three Brodie books: “Case Histories,” “One Good Turn” and “When Will There Be Good News?”The new one, the fourth, is a little different, as Ms. Atkinson has been refreshingly willing to admit. She has said in an interview that she’s beginning to need a break from Jackson Brodie. She had more trouble dwelling on him this time. So “Started Early, Took My Dog” — with a wonderful title from Emily Dickinson, summoning a poem that is as artfully enshrouded as this novel — is also jampacked with echoes, parallels, doppelgängers, sneaky omissions and authorial attempts to mislead. For Ms. Atkinson this is business as usual and often a source of final-act revelatory glee. But it doesn’t coalesce as neatly as this series’s earlier installments have.“Started Early, Took My Dog” features two central characters who have no direct connection with each other. The first is Jackson of course. He is rambling around his native Yorkshire, apparently as a tourist, visiting monasteries and brooding on the various women who have left him in the lurch. He has a lost sister, Niamh, murdered at 17; assorted exes, Josie and Julia, with each of whom he has a child, and Tessa, who stole his money and then vanished; and a woman for whom he pines and is likely to get involved in the future. (That one’s Louise.) None of them have anything to do with the event that gets this novel moving.That important early event takes place in a Leeds shopping mall where Tracy Waterhouse, a hefty, lonely former policewoman and the book’s other principal, now works in security. Tracy encounters a prostitute named Kelly who is clearly an abusive mother. When Tracy sees Kelly mistreating a quiet, sorry-looking little girl named Courtney, she makes a shocking spur-of-the-moment deal. She pays Kelly and simply buys the child.'"
"'11-03-17,'1','THE Smithsonian Institution is shaking off its image as “the nation’s attic” brimming with arcane treasures and using Web and mobile projects to enlist the public in delving into its collections, expanding its research and, sometimes, just adding interesting postscripts to history.Best known for its stately museums on the National Mall, the 164-year-old Smithsonian also conducts wide-ranging scientific research, part of its original mission to increase and spread knowledge. But instead of relying on its small cadre of experts, the institution is embracing social media to involve the public.“We are more than museums,” said Michael Edson, the Smithsonian’s director of Web and new-media strategy. No more than 1 percent of the huge complex’s 137 million items are on public display at any time.“We’re operating telescopes in space, preserving ancient languages, studying biodiversity, evolution and history — a vast distributed network of scholars and researchers active in over 100 countries,” he said.In addition to bolstering scholarship, social media also is helping the Smithsonian solve puzzles like identifying an early 20th-century woman whose illustrations humorously conveyed economic data to the public, or the purpose of the “perforating paddle” used by early postal workers.Also, the Smithsonian has been able to uncover new information about historic events like the trial of John T. Scopes for teaching evolution, and assemble a worldwide network to capture wild animal behavior and another to map American tree species.“What we are doing is more lively and accessible than developing an exhibit and providing a catalog,” said Mr. Edson.Crowd-sourcing and user-generated content are not new to the Smithsonian, said Pamela Henson, the institution’s historian, pointing to the creation in the 1850s of what later became the National Weather Service. The Smithsonian’s first secretary, Joseph Henry, enlisted volunteers around the country to gather observations about storms and other weather occurrences and to mail or telegraph them to Washington.“The volunteers helped us establish weather patterns,” she said, “Also, a source of our earliest collections were trappers, explorers and others who collected plants and animals and gave them to the Smithsonian.”Even so, the 21st-century Smithsonian was somewhat slower to embrace unfettered public involvement, fearing it would undercut the institution’s scientific credibility. After debate, the Smithsonian began moving ahead in the social media realm in early 2009, encouraged by its new secretary, G. Wayne Clough, who had served as president of the Georgia Institute of Technology.“We’re now broadcasters of knowledge,” Mr. Edson said of the Smithsonian’s efforts. “It’s invigorating, and a real collaboration.”The use of social media led to identification of a photograph that had been on the Smithsonian “Portraits of Scientists” since 2003. The Smithsonian added the image to its photo-sharing Web site,. Flickr users began contributing clues, like a wedding announcement, to pinpoint the woman in the picture as 21-year-old Ida Elizabeth Sabin Goodwin, an artist hired in the 1920s at a science news service.Her granddaughter, Linda Sabin Eisenstadt, recognized the Flickr photo and contributed details of her grandmother’s life and some of her drawings — noting that she had found two unknown cousins as a result.Ms. Goodwin’s “cartoonographs” amusingly depicted rising commodity prices, political campaign spending, spending on oil and the impact of new communications technologies, all still timely topics, said Effie Kapsalis, head of Web and new media for the Smithsonian Archives.Previously unpublished photos of the Scopes trial in Tennessee posted on Flickr resulted in a donation of 10 black-and-white photographs from Henrietta S. Jenrette, who said they had been taken by her father, who attended the trial with his former high school biology teacher. She wanted them to be online for anyone to see.With more than six million objects, and only four curators, the National Postal Museum created an online database called Arago for those who want to study particular objects, said Marshall Emery, the museum’s internal affairs manager. While the postal museum is small compared with other Smithsonian museums, its Web site, named after Francois Arago, a French scientist and friend of the Smithsonian’s founder, James Smithson, drew 26.4 million page views from 158 countries in fiscal 2010.Philatelic experts around the world can research — and sometimes pinpoint inaccuracies in — the museum’s collection, which includes every United States postage stamp, Amelia Earhart’s flight suit and unusual objects like an 1899 perforating paddle that was used to stab holes in mail envelopes so it could be fumigated inside railway mail cars. The purpose was to prevent letters from carrying yellow fever, then thought to be spread by such contact.A recently introduced Smithsonian digital endeavor to discover what environmental factors most influence the size of wildlife populations relies on a broad network of volunteers, rather than specialists. In late February, its Museum of the Natural History introduced “Smithsonian Wild,”, with links on Facebook, Flickr and Twitter. It can “can only be accomplished using citizen scientists — not unlike the annual bird counts — only this is for mammals, which are mostly nocturnal,” said Robert Costello, the museum’s outreach program manager.The site brings together 202,000 wildlife photos from various Smithsonian and other research projects where motion-sensitive cameras were installed to capture close-range images of elusive species like the jaguar.This gives the public “a better sense not only of the diversity of wildlife, but also of the diversity of the Smithsonian’s wildlife research,” said Mr. Costello.On the heels of that project, the Smithsonian began broadening its mobile offerings with a free new app, called Leafsnap, to identify tree species by their leaves. Smartphone apps typically help users to navigate their visit — the Smithsonian has them for its popular National Air and Space Museum as well as the Postal and Natural History — and to complement specific exhibitions.Leafsnap is the first of a series of electronic field guides that researchers from the Smithsonian, Columbia University and the University of Maryland have developed to help identify species from photographs. The Web site field guide currently includes the trees of New York City and Washington and will expand to include trees across the continental United States.The app can also be used to map tree diversity and location by sending global positioning data back to scientists. Other apps to raise awareness of biodiversity will be introduced in the future.“A few years ago, it was unusual for a museum to have social media,” said Mr. Edson. “Now it’s just assumed to be part of what museums offer — like the heat.”'"
"'11-03-17,'1','Ms. Jackson said that mercury and the other emissions covered by the rule damaged the nervous systems of fetuses and children, aggravated asthma and caused lifelong health damage for hundreds of thousands of Americans.She said that installing and maintaining smokestack scrubbers and other control technology would create 31,000 short-term construction jobs and 9,000 permanent utility sector jobs.Even before the formal unveiling of the rule, some utilities, business groups and Congressional Republicans cast it as the latest salvo in a regulatory war on American industry. They cited a number of recently issued E.P.A. rules, including one on industrial boilers and the first of a series of regulations covering greenhouse gases, which they argue will impose huge costs on businesses and choke off economic recovery.“E.P.A. admits the pending proposal will cost at least $10 billion, making it one of the most expensive rules in the history of the agency,” a group of utilities, the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, said in a report this week. “Adaptation to all the proposed rules constitutes an extraordinary threat to the power sector — particularly the half of U.S. electricity derived from coal-fired generation.”The group questioned Ms. Jackson’s assertion that the technology needed to reduce emissions of mercury, lead, arsenic, chromium and other airborne pollutants was readily available and reasonably inexpensive. The need to retrofit scores of plants in the same short period of time will tax resources and lead to delays, it said.A spokesman for the utility industry’s largest trade group, the Edison Electric Institute, said it would be easier for some utilities to comply than others, particularly those that rely more heavily on nuclear power and those that have switched to natural gas for part of their generating capacity.One utility executive said compliance would not be unduly burdensome.“We know from experience that constructing this technology can be done in a reasonable time frame, especially with good advance planning,” said Paul Allen, senior vice president and chief environmental officer of Constellation Energy. “And there is meaningful job creation associated with the projects.”Public health advocates said utilities had delayed the rules for more than two decades with court challenges and lobbying campaigns.“If you think it’s expensive to put a scrubber on a smokestack, you should see how much it costs to treat a child over a lifetime with a birth defect,” said Dr. O. Marion Burton, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, who stood with Ms. Jackson in announcing the rule.Roughly half of the nation’s more than 400 coal-burning plants have some form of control technology installed, and about a third of states have set their own standards for mercury emissions. But the proposed rule issued Wednesday is the first national standard and will require all plants to come up to the standard of the cleanest of current plants.The new rules bring to a close a bitter legal and regulatory battle dating back to the passage of the 1970 Clean Air Act, which first directed the E.P.A. to identify and control major industrial sources of hazardous emissions.By 1990, however, federal regulators had still not set standards for toxic emissions from power plants, and Congress, in the face of stiff resistance from utilities and coal interests, passed legislation directing the E.P.A. to study the health effects of mercury and other emissions, and to detail the cost and effectiveness of control technologies.In 1998, the agency finally complied, delivering a comprehensive report to Congress detailing the health impact of numerous pollutants, including mercury, which by then had been linked conclusively in multiple studies to serious cognitive harm to fetuses.In December 2000, in the last days of the Clinton administration, the E.P.A. finally listed power plants as a source of hazardous air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.The Bush administration E.P.A. faced its own deadlines to devise and put into effect controls for power plant pollution. But rather than issue emissions standards in line with federal law, in 2005, top agency officials instituted a controversial cap-and-trade program for mercury, despite a warning from agency lawyers that the move would throw the issue back into the courts and almost certainly be reversed.As predicted, a coalition of states and environmentalists sued the agency, arguing that the cap-and-trade program would not limit other toxic emissions like arsenic and would allow the dirtiest power plants to pay for the right to pollute, putting nearby communities at risk. In 2008 a federal judge ruled against the E.P.A., giving the agency three years to develop standards for mercury and other pollutants.The long delay has meant that emissions of some major pollutants have grown in recent years. The E.P.A.’s most recent data shows that from 1999 to 2005, mercury emissions from power plants increased more than 8 percent, to 53 tons from 49 tons. Arsenic emissions grew even more, rising 31 percent, to 210 tons from 160 tons.The E.P.A. will take public comment on the proposed regulations for the next several months. It anticipates publishing a final rule at the end of this year or early next year. The rule would take effect fully three or four years later.'"
"'11-03-17,'1','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Producer prices surged in February at their fastest pace in about 18 months, lifted by high food and energy prices, according to a government report on Wednesday that pointed to a buildup in inflation pressures.In a second report, the government said housing starts declined the most in 27 years in February while building permits dropped to their lowest level on record, a sign that the beleaguered real estate sector has yet to rebound from its deep slump.The Labor Department said on Tuesday that its seasonally adjusted index for prices paid at the farm and factory gate jumped 1.6 percent, the largest increase since June 2009, after rising 0.8 percent in January.Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.7 percent increase in producer prices last month. In the 12 months to February, producer prices increased 5.6 percent.The report came a day after the Federal Reserve said it expected the upward inflation pressure from energy and other commodities to prove transitory but that it would keep a close eye on inflation and inflation expectations.The increase in wholesale prices last month was broad-based, with energy prices surging 3.3 percent — the biggest increase since January 2010, after 1.8 percent the previous month. Gasoline prices, which rose 3.7 percent, accounted for over 40 percent of the increase in the energy index. Food prices jumped 3.9 percent, the biggest increase since 1974.'"
"'11-03-17,'1','Investors have been hit by one hard-to-foresee event after another in the last year, leaving them bewildered, Mr. Knapp said. From the European sovereign debt crisis to the protests across the Middle East and now the Japanese earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis, the risks to the world economy seem to be multiplying.Wednesday started on a calmer note, with investors seemingly reassured by a 5 percent recovery in Japanese shares. But stocks slumped shortly after 11 a.m. when traders focused on a warning from a European Union official in Brussels that a catastrophic event at the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant might be imminent.Treasury bond prices spiked at the same time, forcing the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to cancel a bond-buying operation for the first time.Stocks recovered slightly around midday, only to fall sharply again.By the end of the trading session, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 242.12 points, or 2.04 percent, to 11,613.30. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 24.99 points, or 1.95 percent, to 1,256.88. The Nasdaq declined 50.51 points, or 1.89 percent, to 2,616.82, hurt by a 4 percent fall in Apple after a rare downgrade by an analyst.All three major indexes have fallen more than 3.5 percent so far this week, putting the benchmark S.& P. 500 index down about 0.1 percent for the year.Oil prices climbed back above $98 a barrel as violence intensified in North Africa and the Middle East.The VIX, a measure of volatility in the Standard & Poor’s stock market index, rose to its highest level in more than six months, and market participants reported unusually large sales in the S.& P. 500 e-mini future, the instrument that was one of the triggers of last May’s flash crash, and big sales of some exchange-traded funds linked to Treasury bond yields, adding to the feverish atmosphere.Treasuries rose, continuing their ascent of recent days. Since Japan’s earthquake and tsunami on March 11, the prices of risky assets like stocks and commodities have plummeted while safe-haven investments like Treasuries have risen. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose a full percentage point late Thursday to 103 22/32, and the yield fell to 3.19 percent, from 3.30 percent.With the uncertainty around the world rising, government officials and central bankers signaled that they were prepared to act.The Bank of Japan continued to pump liquidity into the financial system on Wednesday, and Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, raised the possibility that Japan could receive financial assistance from other countries. Ms. Lagarde announced that she was arranging a discussion for as early as Thursday among finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 7 countries to assess the economic impact of the crisis in Japan and a possible response.In particular, officials in Paris think that the European Central Bank still has room to maneuver — certainly compared with the American Federal Reserve — in terms of using monetary tools to bolster liquidity in markets.Still, global central bankers have plenty of options to choose from if the situation in Japan and the global markets deteriorate. One initial plan could center on opening lines of credit from major central banks. Similar facilities were opened by some central banks after the terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001 and during the financial panic of 2008-9.In this case, the Bank of Japan would provide a steady stream of yen to the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, ensuring that private banks would have easy access to the Japanese currency. Demand for yen has been rising in recent days, as Japanese insurers and other financial firms sell their most liquid assets, like stocks and commodities, to generate cash to use at home for rebuilding efforts.With sensitivity so high, it took only a comment by the European Union energy commissioner, Günther Oettinger, to unnerve traders Wednesday. He told lawmakers in Brussels  that the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was “effectively out of control.”“In the coming hours, there could be further catastrophic events,” he said, according to Bloomberg News. That assessment was based on information from the European Union, the union’s mission in Tokyo, the International Atomic Energy Agency and media reports, he said.“This spooked the markets,” an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, Marc Chandler, said.Even though a spokesman was reported as quickly qualifying the commissioner’s statements, saying Mr. Oettinger had no special information beyond what was public, the damage was done. “Having witnessed a fall of such magnitude and so fast, the skittishness remained,” said Guy Lebas of Janney Montgomery Scott.'"

He was 53.The cause was “an unexpected complication” of stomach cancer, said Richard S. Price, president of Mesirow Financial, where Mr. Tyree was chairman and chief executive.In 2009 Mr. Tyree led an investment group that bought Sun-Times Media, the parent company of The Chicago Sun-Times, for $5 million in cash and the assumption of around $22 million in liabilities and took the company out of bankruptcy.“I certainly believe this is a good business opportunity, though certainly very risky,” Mr. Tyree said in a 2009 interview.Sun-Times Media, which also owns dozens of suburban Chicago newspapers and Web sites, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March of that year, after months of cost-cutting measures. The company’s troubles played out during the 2007 federal trial of Conrad M. Black, the chief executive of The Sun-Times’s former owner, Hollinger International. Mr. Black was convicted of siphoning millions of dollars from Hollinger.Among other concessions, Mr. Tyree asked unions to agree to lock in 15 percent pay cuts that were originally intended to be temporary.'"

"'11-03-18,'1','But it was Richmond’s first tournament victory since 1998. And it creates an unusual game on Saturday in the Southwest Regional: No. 12 Richmond against No. 13 Morehead State, which beat fourth-seeded Louisville earlier at the Pepsi Center, 62-61.Richmond (28-7) has won eight games in a row, including the Atlantic 10 tournament last week.“I don’t view it as an upset, with all due respect to Vanderbilt and the great program they have,” Richmond Coach Chris Mooney said.Anderson made three 3-pointers to turn a 48-42 deficit into a 51-48 lead midway through the second half.“I just know what I’m capable of doing on the court,” said Anderson, who averaged 16.5 points per game during the season, “and I’m just going to keep doing it.”B.Y.U. 74, WOFFORD 66 Jimmer Fredette, using his full arsenal of unabashed charges to the net, off-balance jumpers and free throws, scored 32 points to lead leading third-seeded Brigham Young past No. 14 Wofford in Denver.It was a litmus test, of sorts, for the Cougars (31-4), whose stellar regular season has been trumped by doubts over their ability to last long in the tournament.B.Y.U. will play No. 11 Gonzaga, which beat St. John’s, 86-71.Fredette made 10 of 25 field-goal attempts (2 of 9 from 3-point range) and 10 of 12 free throws and had 7 assists. Noah Dahlman scored 22 points and 9 rebounds for Wofford.The next game is likely to be tougher for B.Y.U. But for a team that has gone through what it has in the past couple of weeks, it is a matter of perspective. And a matter of Fredette. JOHN BRANCHU.C.L.A. 78, MICH. ST. 76 Michigan State Coach Tom Izzo said earlier this week that, for the first time in a long time, the Spartans “were excited” to get in the N.C.A.A. tournament. They certainly did not look like it until it was too late.The 10th-seeded Spartans started sluggish and sloppy and nearly rallied from a 23-point deficit in a 78-76 loss to No. 7-seed U.C.L.A. Thursday night. The defeat ended one of Coach Tom Izzo’s most disappointing seasons at Michigan State and the Spartans’ string of consecutive Final Four trips.The Bruins (23-10) advance to Saturday’s third round against No. 2 seed Florida.U.C.L.A. led by 18 at the half and increased its cushion to 23, 64-41, with 8:35 remaining, before Michigan State made a furious rally. The Spartans cut the deficit to single digits in the final two minutes as U.C.L.A. missed 9 of its final 12 free throws. The Spartans got within, 78-76, but the senior guard Kalin Lucas travelled with 0.2 seconds remaining, ending the comeback.W. VIRGINIA 84, CLEMSON 76 While Clemson was playing Tuesday night in Dayton, Ohio, to advance to Thursday’s second round of the N.C.A.A. tournament, West Virginia had a relaxing evening, watching the game from its hotel here.The Tigers did not get to sleep until 5 a.m. Wednesday and there were questions about whether the layoff of less than 36 hours would cause them to be tired against the Mountaineers.Clemson, seeded 12th, managed to remain awake, but the Tigers had little energy. Dalton Pepper converted two late steals into layups as West Virginia beat Clemson in an East Region game at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, Fla.The fifth-seeded Mountaineers (21-11) advanced to play Kentucky in the next round.SAN DIEGO ST. 68, N. COLO. 50 The Aztec warrior that represents San Diego State paced back and forth at McKale Center in Tucson, appearing nervous and subdued as his sixth-ranked and second-seeded team went to battle against No. 15-seeded Northern Colorado in a West Region game. And who could blame him?The college basketball world would have certainly called for a mascot change had San Diego State (33-2) fallen to the Bears (21-11). Instead, the Aztecs and their mascot survived after a win that will pit them against seventh-seeded Temple on Saturday.It marked the first tournament win at San Diego State for Coach Steve Fisher, the former Michigan coach who has been at the helm for three of the Aztecs’ six first-round failures since taking over the program in 1999.Kawhi Leonard, a sophomore forward and this regional’s top N.B.A. draft prospect, had 21 points.

After clumsily dispatching Asheville in Washington, the Pitt players acknowledged they needed to play much better Saturday against No. 8 Butler.“We played real sluggish in the first half,” said Pitt center Gary McGhee.“If you do that against a good team like Butler, you’re going to find yourself in a hole.”FLORIDA 79, SANTA BARBARA 51 The Florida Gators raced to a 24-point halftime lead and coasted the rest of the way against U.C.-Santa Barbara in Tampa, Fla.Chandler Parsons had 10 points, a career-high 10 assists and 7 rebounds for the Gators.On Saturday Florida will face the winner of the Michigan State-U.C.L.A. game in the Round of 32.

"'11-03-18,'1','Nearly 25 years after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, children and teenagers who drank contaminated milk or ate affected cheese in the days and weeks after the explosion still suffer from an increased risk of thyroid cancer, according to a study released Thursday by the National Cancer Institute.The study confirms earlier research about the risks of radioactive iodine, which can accumulate in the thyroid gland and lead to cancer later. Potassium iodide is often given as a supplement to prevent the accumulation of the radioactive type in thyroid glands, but Russian authorities failed to provide the supplement to all those at risk.Radioactive iodine has a half-life of just eight days, and it was not thought to be present outside the power plant in concentrations high enough to cause immediate health problems. But the isotope was concentrated by cows in milk, and children who drank contaminated milk or ate affected dairy products are particularly at risk.An international team of researchers led by the National Cancer Institute, a federal agency based in Bethesda, Md., has been monitoring the health effects of the Chernobyl accident for years. In the study released Thursday, the team screened 12,500 people who were under 18-years-old at the time of the 1986 accident and lived in one of three provinces near the accident site. The subjects’ thyroid glands were measured for radioactivity within two months of the accident.Those with the greatest exposures were at highest risk for developing thyroid cancer in later years, the researchers found. Sixty-five of the study’s subjects developed thyroid cancer during the study’s 10 years of screening.Indeed, the increased risks associated with exposures to radioactive iodine have yet to show any sign of declining. Studies done in Japan after World War II suggested that the increased risks of thyroid cancer began to decline 30 years after the atomic explosions but remained above normal even 40 years later.'"
"'11-03-18,'1','“We have dug ourselves a big hole financially, and we’re still behind,” the foundation’s president, George Grayson, said. “It’s been a struggle to keep up with the costs associated with a large and aging horse population, at a time when the economy and giving is down. Everybody on the board takes any allegation seriously, and anything less than positive circumstances for the horses are unacceptable. When we’ve been made aware of issues, we have responded quickly, and we will on this.”The cases of neglect, while noteworthy because of the prominence of the organization overseeing the horses, are only the latest embarrassment for an industry that remains vexed by one of its most fundamental challenges: how to humanely look out for horses that no longer have any value at the racetrack or in the breeding shed.The Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation was founded in 1984 to save racehorses no longer able to compete on the racetrack “from possible neglect, abuse and slaughter,” its mission statement says.It has been embraced by some of the biggest forces in the sport: the Jockey Club has given the foundation nearly $250,000 over the past two years, and individual owners — like Mike Repole, the co-founder of Glaceau water and the owner of the current Kentucky Derby favorite, Uncle Mo — have given sizable contributions as well.Over the years, the foundation’s board has included some of the sport’s most influential owners, and the farms it contracts with have been homes to many of the horses those owners have bred and campaigned. Beam Us Up, an accomplished racehorse bred by Richard Santulli, the former chief executive of NetJets, was recently removed from one of the contract farms because of neglect. Santulli’s wife, Peggy, is on the T.R.F. board.The findings of the veterinarian hired by the Mellon estate, Dr. Huntington, moved the estate’s trustees to send the farms money for things as basic as food. She found that some 25 percent of the horses have required some kind of urgent care, which the Mellon estate has provided, costing it “tens of thousands” of dollars, said Ted Terry, one of its trustees.Dr. Huntington found that the foundation’s education of the caretakers and oversight of their farms had been poor. At one farm, Dr. Huntington said, the horses were being fed cattle feed that contained a toxic element.“The horses are getting the short end of the stick from this group that advertises itself as advocates of horses,” Dr. Huntington said.The most dramatic instance of neglect discovered so far, she said, was at the 4-H Farm in Okmulgee, Okla., where the owners, Alan and Janice Hudgins, would not let Dr. Huntington onto their property to inspect T.R.F. horses until the foundation gave them $20,000, a partial payment of what was owed them for taking care of 63 horses since 2005. They also forced the foundation to sign a pledge not to prosecute them for the condition of the horses.When the horses were released, the 47 survivors were in such poor condition that Dr. Huntington filed a report with the Okmulgee County sheriff’s office. Her report included photographs of the malnourished horses, three of them considered starving. Nearly all of them needed urgent care.Ms. Hudgins said her farm had kept horses for the foundation since 2005, but in recent years it fell into a pattern of falling behind in payments.In a tough economy with rising fuel and feed costs, Ms. Hudgins said her family got tired of having to settle for less than they were owed by the foundation. She said they had done the best they could with the horses, and had informed the T.R.F. that some older horses had died.The foundation ran a $1.2 million deficit in 2009, according to its most recent tax filings with the federal government, three times the total in its previous filing. Its inability to pay the agreed costs for the care of its horses severed a number of relationships with farms, including Claybank Farm in Lexington, Ky., which cared for up to 80 horses.Interviews with farm owners, as well as e-mail correspondence they provided, showed the foundation was aware of its deepening financial straits — occasionally taking horses from farms where they had been well cared for and placing them elsewhere on the cheap.Last September, the T.R.F. owed Out2Pasture Farms in Jamestown, Mo., more than $43,000, The farm, run by two University of Missouri professors, Zachary and Robin Hurst-March, is one of the nation’s most highly regarded sanctuaries for thoroughbreds. When the couple pressed for payment, the T.R.F. asked them to reduce their per diem to $3 a day and eventually removed 13 of their horses.“I was being emotionally blackmailed to lower my per diem, and was the subject of retribution because I questioned the care of the horses,” said Mrs. Hurst-Marsh, who is owed $10,000.When Gayle England, whose farm in Stroud, Okla., is also highly regarded as a special-care facility, complained not only of the chronic slow pay but the general lack of regard for the farms and the horses, 26 T.R.F. horses were taken from her.Last month, some of the horses in the worst shape were taken from other foundation farms and returned to the Hurst-Marsh farm and Ms. England. In fact, one of the 14 horses moved to England’s farm with the help and funding of the Mellon Estate had to be put down.“They were making their administrative payroll this whole time, but the horses they were suffering,” Ms. England said. “They need to be held accountable.”Mr. Terry, a Mellon estate trustee, said he still does not know what went wrong.“We don’t know if it was bad judgment, taking on too many horses or bad decisions made internally,” he said. “Eventually, we’re going to have to ask ourselves if we are throwing good money after bad.”'"
"'11-03-18,'1','“We are equating this now to the epidemic that we saw when crack cocaine was first introduced to New York City,” Daniel M. Donovan Jr., the Staten Island district attorney, said of the boom in illegal oxycodone use. “We saw crack dealers give crack to people to get them addicted. Once these dealers got people addicted, the price went up. It’s very similar.”Oxycodone, an opiate, is especially dangerous, Mr. Donovan said, because people do not perceive the risks of recreational use of a medication with legitimate purposes. That might be one reason, some say, for its prevalence on Staten Island. Many of the borough’s residents are affluent and may view oxycodone as a more accessible way of getting high than heroin or crack, said Luke J. Nasta, the executive director of Camelot, a drug counseling center on Staten Island.“Prescription drugs are widely available,” Mr. Nasta said, “and they can be acquired without going to the ghetto to buy it off the street corner and risk personal harm, risk arrest, risk being sold something other than what you think you’re buying, and the whole negative stigma that goes along with that subculture.”Mr. Scala provided as wholesome a location as possible for local and out-of-town buyers, prosecutors said. He usually parked his ice cream truck near his home on Bedell Street, Ms. Brennan, the special prosecutor, said. While Mr. Scala sold ice cream to children, she said, the oxycodone buyers would sit in their cars and wait their turn.“It’s a community of close-knit neighborhoods, and when the addiction got into a certain neighborhood you could see it spread out from there,” said Ms. Brennan, who described the conspiracy as predatory because the defendants would give pills away to get people addicted.The conspiracy was uncovered, prosecutors said, when one of the runners was arrested in a string of gunpoint robberies of pharmacies, and a pharmacist recognized him as someone he had turned away with a suspicious prescription.Mr. Donovan has called for federal legislation to require pharmacies to enter prescriptions into a national database as they fill them, to prevent people from bouncing to different pharmacies to load up on a drug. Last year, more than one million oxycodone prescriptions were filled citywide, twice as many as in 2007, Ms. Brennan said.Gary, a recovering oxycodone addict who is being treated at Daytop Village on Staten Island and was interviewed on the condition that his full name not be used, said the borough’s oxycodone culture was evident in parking lots at strip malls and stores, where young people are often found discreetly selling the pills.Zachary Johnson, the lawyer for Mr. Zaffuto, said his client planned to fight the charges. Ms. Wilkins’s lawyer declined to comment. Mr. Scala’s lawyer could not be reached for comment.'"
"'11-03-18,'1','Nike, the sporting goods company, reported third-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates on Thursday, the first time in 19 consecutive quarters, amid higher costs.Net income rose to $523 million, or $1.08 a share, in the quarter, from $497 million, or $1.01 a share, a year earlier, the company said. Analysts projected $1.12 a share.Nike is grappling with higher costs for cotton, labor and transportation, which the company projected may reduce profit margins this year.

"'11-03-18,'1','Hundreds of monks and laypeople had gathered during and after the immolation and later began protesting the security presence, which had been tightened this month in anticipation of a potential uprising. The anniversaries of the 2008 revolt and one in 1959 that resulted in the Dalai Lama’s flight to India both fall in March.At some point, monks took Phuntsog’s body back to the monastery. Security forces locked down the town and detained many local people, said I.C.T. and another advocacy group, Free Tibet. A fellow monk from Kirti, Tsering, confirmed the accounts of the self-immolation in a telephone interview with The Associated Press late Wednesday.The Xinhua report, citing an unnamed official in Aba County, which is called Ngaba or Ngapa in Tibetan, said Phuntsog died at 3:44 a.m. Thursday after “treatment delays” because monks took him out of a hospital and hid him in Kirti Monastery. Calls made on Thursday to a police station in the area went unanswered.Kirti was the scene of a brutal crackdown in 2008 to halt an uprising that started after riots broke out in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. At least 10 Tibetans around Kirti were shot dead, according to Tibet advocacy groups. Monks living in exile in Dharamsala, India, have photographs of several Tibetans killed by bullets in Kirti during the 2008 protests.In February 2009, another monk from Kirti, Tapey, set himself on fire, but he survived after security officers put out his flames. In 1998, a Tibetan layman living in exile in India, Thubten Ngodup, died after an act of self-immolation to protest the Chinese occupation of his homeland.The most famous modern case of a monk using self-immolation as a form of political protest occurred in 1963, when a Buddhist monk in Saigon, South Vietnam, Thich Quang Duc, burned himself to death to protest persecution of Buddhists by the Catholic-dominated South Vietnamese government.International Campaign for Tibet also reported this week that a Tibetan monk, Sangey Gyatso, who had gone into hiding in Gansu Province, died on Feb. 26 of undisclosed health problems. He was among the 15 or so monks who held a protest in front of foreign journalists in April 2008 at Labrang Monastery in Xiahe. At least three monks from that protest fled to India to seek asylum.Wary of potential uprisings this month, Chinese officials have barred foreigners from traveling to central Tibet, known as the Tibet Autonomous Region. That travel ban has been in effect every March since the 2008 uprising.Chinese leaders say that Tibetans are generally satisfied with rule by the ethnic Han, who dominate China, and that only a small number take part in protests. They accuse the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, of organizing the protests from India.DHARAMSALA, India (Reuters) — The Dalai Lama said Thursday that his leadership was as outdated as a monarchy and insisted he would relinquish a four-century-old tradition of power despite opposition from within the Tibetan government-in-exile.“The rule by spiritual leaders, the rule by kings or rajas is now outdated,” Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, told a news conference in his first public statement since his decision.“I do not want to be like Mubarak,” he said, speaking of Hosni Mubarak, the former Egyptian president.The Dalai Lama, 75, said on March 10 that he would step down as head of state and administrative chief in favor of an elected prime minister, ending an institution of spiritual and political leadership that dates from 1642.But many exiled Tibetan leaders are fearful their movement could wane without his influence.The parliament-in-exile must approve the move by a two-thirds majority amid concerns opposition may lead to a constitutional deadlock.'"
"'11-03-18,'1','More food and gas price increases are in the pipeline. The Labor Department said that wholesale prices jumped 1.6 percent in February, the largest increase since June 2009. Wholesale food prices rose 3.9 percent, the biggest increase since November 1974.Price increases for other goods and services are recovering from very low levels. Core consumer prices increased 1.1 percent in the last year, up from a 0.6 percent annual increase in October. Still, that was below the Fed’s preferred range of 1.5 to 2 percent.The Federal Reserve said this week that more expensive food and energy was “currently putting upward pressure on inflation.” But the central bank said the pressures were likely to be temporary. It also said that measures of underlying inflation had been subdued, a reference to core prices.In a report on Thursday, the Fed said that factories produced more cars, appliances, computers and furniture in February, lifting manufacturing output for a sixth consecutive month.Overall output at the nation’s factories, mines and utilities dipped 0.1 percent last month, the central bank said. But the first decline in industrial production since October was caused by unseasonably warmer weather that cut demand for gas and electric utilities.Industrial production has risen by nearly 12 percent since hitting its recession low in June 2009. It remains about 6 percent below its prerecession peak in September 2007.Factory production, the biggest slice of industrial activity, rose 0.4 percent last month. Manufacturers have increased production in 17 of the 21 months since the recession ended. They are expected to keep bolstering economic growth, despite the nuclear crisis in Japan.Stronger factory activity has been an important factor supporting job growth. As the economy gains strength, companies are reducing layoffs and increasing hiring.As a result, fewer people are seeking unemployment benefits. The Labor Department said that applications fell to a seasonally adjusted 385,000 last week, the third decline in the last four weeks.The four-week average for claims dropped to 386,250. That was the lowest level since July 2008, providing evidence that the job market is on a more solid footing.Benefit applications below 425,000 signal modest job growth. But the level of applications needs to fall below 375,000 to be seen as a sign of sustained declines in the unemployment rate. Benefit applications peaked at 651,000 during the recession.Companies are finally hiring more after months of sluggish job creation. Employers added 192,000 jobs in February, the biggest gain in nearly a year. The unemployment rate dropped to 8.9 percent, the lowest point since April 2009.The benefits report showed that the number of people receiving regular unemployment benefits fell by 80,000, to 3.71 million. That was the lowest level since the week of Sept. 27, 2008.An additional 4.36 million unemployed workers received benefits under the extended programs during the week of Feb. 26, an increase of 53,000 from the previous week. In total, 8.95 million people were on the benefit rolls during the last week in February.In addition, a private research group’s measure of future economic activity rose 0.8 percent in February, as the job market showed improvement and consumers were more optimistic. It is the eighth consecutive month that the Conference Board’s index of leading economic indicators has shown growth.February’s pace was faster than the previous month’s, when the index rose just 0.1 percent. But it was lower than December’s revised reading of 1.0 percent.'"

"'11-03-19,'0','NEW DELHI — India’s prime minister hit back at allegations that members of his party paid hefty bribes in exchange for support in a crucial vote to salvage the landmark civilian nuclear deal between India and the United States in July 2008, declaring in Parliament on Friday that no member of the Congress Party or his government had broken the law.“No one from the Congress Party or the government indulged in any unlawful act,” Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, adding that the claims that bribes had been paid were based on a leaked American diplomatic cable obtained by WikiLeaks that is “unverified and unverifiable.”On Thursday, a prominent English-language daily, The Hindu, published the confidential cable, written by an American diplomat several days before a confidence vote that was essential to passing the nuclear deal, a centerpiece of Mr. Singh’s agenda.The cable said an aide to a senior Congress Party official told an American diplomat that a small regional party whose votes were crucial had already been paid millions of dollars for its support, and showed off chests containing $25 million in cash he said was available for buying more votes.Mr. Singh said that a parliamentary committee had already rejected the allegations. “The committee concluded there was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusion of bribery,” Mr. Singh said. Furthermore, the opposition had tried to persuade voters that the bribery scandal remained an important issue in the May 2009 general election, which Congress won handily.“It is unfortunate that the opposition continues to raise those charges that have been debated, discussed and rejected by the people of India,” he said.'"
"'11-03-19,'0','Mr. Crawford’s work was simple. He kept a segregated population moving. Any Birmingham child who needed a ride to school, a football game or a Girl Scout outing during the Jim Crow era and beyond most likely rode one.So did people heading to dozens of civil rights rallies — including the 1963 March on Washington where Dr. King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech — during a time when chartering a bus from a white-owned company was impossible and driving past the city limits was dangerous for a busload full of African-Americans.Now, Mr. Crawford’s only remaining child is trying to keep his father’s much more humble dream alive.“Dad felt he was never really given any recognition,” said Donald Crawford, 62, a longtime Birmingham high school band instructor and jazz musician. “I don’t think they intentionally left him out of the history books, but because he operated so under the radar they didn’t know what he did.”To try to make things right, his son sat Mr. Crawford down a few years ago and recorded his story, turning it into a self-published book. He titled it “The Wheels of the Birmingham Civil Rights Movement,” which is what a pastor called Mr. Crawford at an appreciation the community held for him in 1999.It is sold at a local black-owned bookstore (though the digitally inclined can find it on Amazon.com) or from the trunk of Donald Crawford’s car. He thought about sending a copy to Oprah Winfrey, but his cousin in Chicago said she thought it was unlikely to reach her.Copies made their way to the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, where curators store Mr. Crawford’s oral history.That is about where formal interest in Mr. Crawford ends. But like people who ran the grocery stores and doctors’ offices and other essential businesses in the era when blacks were not allowed to mix with whites, Mr. Crawford was an essential part of daily life for black Birmingham.“This is the only bus company that we had in the days of the segregationist era,” said Horace Huntley, who recently retired as a professor of African-American history at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and was a board member at the institute.“Knowing the width and depth of segregation, this is something that was very, very necessary if black people were to move from point A to point B in any semblance of numbers,” Dr. Huntley said. “The importance of it goes without saying.”Mr. Crawford’s first job in the transportation business was taking the popular Ensley All-Stars black baseball team to games around the South in a truck he used to haul coal. He traded the truck for a bus in 1951.“As far as I knew I was the only black person that had a bus,” he told his son.That he could start a bus line occurred to him when his mother-in-law asked him to take her and her church friends to a Seventh-day Adventist convention.He added another bus and started transporting other church and school groups, sometimes free. But when he went to the county clerk’s office for a commercial license, city officials used a racial slur and laughed him out of the office.Mr. Crawford figured out that if he “sold” his buses to churches in name only, he could get a special permit and operate a commercial line in a kind of legal gray area. It was cheaper, and he did not have to pay taxes.“This was the one time racism really worked in my favor,” he said in the book.His bus line grew, and Jim Crow laws faded. Mr. Crawford’s drivers started taking weekend partiers to New Orleans, Panama City, Fla., and other cities. Eventually, the company was cited for improper permits and other violations.In 1979, after a series of legal hearings and protests from established interstate bus companies, he got his interstate commercial permit, according to interviews he gave.“Didn’t nobody know who I was,” Worcy Crawford told The Birmingham News in an interview a few years before he died. “And to this day some people still don’t know who I am. I say that’s the way the Lord planned it.”Today, 18 of Mr. Crawford’s buses sit in various states of repair on a grassy lot behind his house. Family members still charter two newer coaches, keeping his legacy alive. The others are being sold for parts or kept for reasons of nostalgia.One of them, a tan GMC bus built in 1958, is nicknamed the Rosa Parks.'"

"'11-03-19,'0','HAVANA (AP) — Government supporters surrounded the home of a leading Cuban dissident on Friday, yelling insults at her and other opposition figures who had gathered inside to mark the anniversary of a notorious crackdown on dissent in the country.About 200 pro-government demonstrators encircled the house of the dissident, Laura Pollan, who is one of the leaders of the opposition group Damas de Blanco, or Ladies in White. They called the dissidents “worms” and shouted slogans in support of Fidel and Raul Castro.The Ladies in White, who are wives or mothers of former and current political prisoners, have been marching peacefully each Sunday since their relatives were arrested in a government crackdown in March 2003 that put 75 activists, intellectuals and social commentators behind bars, most with long sentences on charges that included treason.The government reached a landmark agreement with the Roman Catholic Church last year to free the 52 political prisoners who were still serving sentences after the crackdown.'"
"'11-03-19,'0','Late on St. Patrick’s Day, Eastern time, a spacecraft called Messenger, weighing a little more than a thousand pounds, slipped into an elliptical orbit around the planet Mercury, becoming the only manmade object to orbit the planet closest to the Sun.Through the coming days, scientists from NASA and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory will check Messenger’s systems and begin turning on its instruments. On April 4, observations begin.Messenger spent nearly seven years in transit and traveled about five billion miles. It will spend one Earth-year studying the mineralogy of Mercury, mapping its surface and magnetic and gravitational fields, and trying to identify the substance covering the planet’s north pole. All the while, a ceramic-fabric sunshade will be protecting Messenger from the ferocious heat of the nearby Sun and the solar reflection from Mercury. The craft will eventually plummet into the planet.It really doesn’t matter how many space missions you’ve followed or how many Hubble photographs you’ve marveled over. There is still a sense of raw excitement about reaching a critical stage in an expedition like this, an excitement that will only grow as data begins to stream toward Earth.Part of the thrill is knowing that this is the pure pursuit of knowledge, the scientific impulse — a human impulse — carried to a remarkable conclusion. It’s hard to know just what we will learn about Mercury. Like all scientific missions and experiments, this is a journey to a more refined sense of what we don’t yet know.'"
"'11-03-19,'0','At stake for each team is a trip to San Antonio for a Southwest Regional game on Friday. At stake for each university is a golden chance to boost exposure, reputations, recruiting and finances.That the opponent in the way is hardly a powerhouse makes the possibility that much more tantalizing.Richmond, a private school with only 2,750 students, will be the rare 12th-seeded favorite in a tournament game after it beat No. 5 Vanderbilt. Morehead State, a small-town state school of 9,000, is constantly eclipsed by Louisville and Kentucky, which is what made Thursday night’s victory so compelling.The T-shirt that proved so popular Friday showed the 62-61 score and the date; Morehead State’s eagle mascot had red feathers falling from its mouth, having just consumed Louisville’s cardinal.“It’s different because you assume if you would move on, you would play a team that everybody recognizes, like a Louisville,” Richmond Coach Chris Mooney said.Both coaches lauded Saturday’s opponent. But they acknowledged the interesting position they are in.“You’re not looking ahead, but you’re talking about the opportunity that may present itself,” Morehead State Coach Donnie Tyndall said of his message to his team. “But, obviously, you talk about having great respect for the opponent. Obviously, Richmond doesn’t beat a very good Vanderbilt team unless they’re a great team themselves.”The Morehead State and Richmond campuses were awash in celebration Thursday night and Friday. Players and coaches were besieged with congratulatory messages, and officials from both universities described spiked traffic across Web sites, bookstores and admission offices. The only thing better would be another week of that exposure.“This being major college athletics, large sums of money are at stake, too, beyond the sale of T-shirts and the donations from happy fans. Each participant in this year’s tournament receives a “unit” worth $239,664, the N.C.A.A. said, paid to the college’s conference for each of the next six years.Advance, as Richmond and Morehead State did on Thursday, and the payout doubles. Advance again, as one of them will do Saturday, and it multiplies again.In the Ohio Valley Conference, where Morehead State was the only team to make the tournament, the Eagles will get $40,000 to cover expenses. The rest, after a chunk is taken to feed the league budget, will be divided equally among the conference’s 11 teams, Commissioner Beth DeBauche said.In the 14-member Atlantic 10 (matching the actual number of institutions to the league name is no longer necessary), teams keep a much larger chunk of what they earn. After the league office takes its share, the program that earned the unit gets to keep 75 percent of the money. Other members split the other 25 percent.“It absolutely rewards success and reinforces the commitment to the men’s basketball tournament,” Commissioner Bernadette V. McGlade said.The Atlantic 10 had three teams invited to the tournament: Richmond, Temple and Xavier. After Richmond and Temple won on Thursday (Xavier lost Friday night), the conference had secured at least five units.That money will trickle in over the next six years. But there are more immediate concerns and opportunities. There was the sudden influx of interest from prospective students. There was the push for more merchandise. There were recruits to call. There were donors to contact.“We’re very fortunate to be here,” Morehead State guard Ty Proffitt said. “Hopefully we can keep this thing going.”He was not the only one saying that.'"
"'11-03-19,'0','A big part of the problem at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi power station are the highly radioactive spent fuel rods kept in storage pools at the plant. What to do, ultimately, with such dangerous waste material is the nuclear power question without an answer. Nuclear advocates and public officials don’t talk about it much. Denial is the default position when it comes to nuclear waste.In New York, Gov. said again this week that the 40-year-old nuclear power plant in Westchester County, 35 miles north of , should be closed. Try to imagine the difficulty, in the event of an emergency, of evacuating such an area with its millions of residents. “This plant in this proximity to New York City was never a good risk,” said the governor.There are, blessedly, very few catastrophic accidents at nuclear power plants. And there have not been many deaths associated with them. The rarity of such accidents provides a comfort zone. We can look at the low probabilities and declare, “It can’t happen here.”But what if it did happen here? What would the consequences be? If Indian Point blew, how wide an area and how many people would be affected, and what would the cleanup costs be? Rigorously answering such questions is the only way to determine whether the potential risk to life and property is worthwhile.The 104 commercial nuclear plants in the U.S. are getting old, and many have had serious problems over the years. There have been dozens of instances since 1979, the year of the Three Mile Island accident, in which nuclear reactors have had to be shut down for more than a year for safety reasons.Building new plants, which the Obama administration favors, can be breathtakingly expensive and requires government guarantees. Banks are not lining up to lend money on their own for construction of the newest generation of Indian Points.In addition to the inherent risks with regard to safety and security, the nuclear industry has long been notorious for sky-high construction costs, feverish cost-overruns and projects that eventually are abandoned. The , in a 2009 analysis of the costs associated with nuclear plant construction, said that once a plant came online it usually led to significant rate increases for customers:“Ratepayers bore well over $200 billion (in today’s dollars) in cost overruns for completed nuclear plants. In the 1990s, legislators and regulators also allowed utilities to recover most ‘stranded costs’ — the difference between utilities’ remaining in nuclear plants and the market value of those plants — as states issued billions of dollars in backed by ratepayer charges to pay for utilities’ above-market investments.”The refrain here is familiar: “The total cost to ratepayers, taxpayers and shareholders stemming from cost overruns, canceled plants and stranded costs exceeded $300 billion in today’s dollars.”Nuclear power is hardly the pristine, economical, unambiguous answer to the nation’s energy needs and global warming concerns. It offers benefits and big-time shortcomings. Ultimately, the price may be much too high.'"
"'11-03-19,'0','They said that previous immigration bills were still being reviewed by the courts, and that it was not smart to pass new legislation that plainly conflicted with the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.“I don’t believe that anyone, including myself, foresaw the national and international reaction” to April’s bill, said Glenn Hamer, chief executive of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who said estimates of lost tourism business ranged from $15 million to $150 million. “Now we have that experience under our belts. We know these measures can cause economic damage; it’s just a matter of degree.”A letter signed by 60 state business leaders this week blamed last year’s bill for boycotts, canceled contracts, declining sales and other economic setbacks.“Arizona’s lawmakers and citizens are right to be concerned about illegal immigration,” the letter said. “But we must acknowledge that when Arizona goes it alone on this issue, unintended consequences inevitably occur.”While Mr. Hamer said he doubted the bills could have been defeated on Thursday without broad-based business opposition, he cautioned that support for tighter restrictions on immigration remained strong in a number of quarters. But, he added, “Our hope is that these types of measures have crested and we could spend our time on efforts that could rebuild our economy.”Indeed, state politicians and other officials interviewed after the bills’ defeat said it was too soon to tell whether the turnabout represented a long-term change, or merely a breather until the economy rebounds. Concerns about illegal immigration remain a significant issue, and many state leaders are angry with what they describe as the federal government’s unwillingness to take firm action.But for now, “enough is enough,” said State Senator John McComish, a Republican who voted no on all five bills.Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, did not take a position on the five bills that were voted down Thursday — her normal practice on legislation that has not reached her desk, a spokesman said on Friday.An aide said Senator Pearce was unavailable for comment.Crucial to changing the discussion was a clearly articulated and executed strategy by the state business lobby, which made concerns over negative economic effects a far more significant factor than in the debate last year.State Senator Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, said business opposition — in contrast to what she called the tepid and delayed efforts of its leaders last year — gave Republicans the political protection they needed to vote no.“They have been working since January to provide people cover against these bills,” Senator Sinema said. Twenty-one of 30 state senators are Republicans, and none of the bills would have been defeated without many of them voting in opposition.The effect on the state’s convention and tourism industry after the April vote was immediate. Convention bookings plunged in Phoenix, one of the top destinations in the United States, with large organizations citing the immigration bill when canceling their reservations.“It was definitely a drastic decline,” said Kristen Jarnagin, vice president of communications for the Arizona Hotel and Lodging Association. She and other business officials pointed to data on bookings showing Phoenix’s ranking, on some measures, had dropped from the top four destinations nationwide to 23rd.So far, Arizona-style anti-immigration bills have not lived up to their advance billing in other states, which despite strengthened Republican legislative majorities have failed to pass any identical bills. Similar proposals are still advancing in some states, but they, too, have encountered strong business opposition.“Our legislature and our state are suffering from immigration fatigue,” Senator McComish said. “We’ve been at the forefront of this issue, and I think it is time for a timeout.”'"
"'11-03-19,'0','“The amended complaint is the latest chapter in the work of fiction created by the Trustee,” Wilpon and Katz said in a statement. “We will pursue a vigorous legal defense that will set the record straight and vindicate us.”The two sides are also in mediation with the former Governor Mario M. Cuomo.In 2004, Wilpon was looking to start the cable network, SNY, primarily to carry Mets games. Such regional networks, like the YES Network that broadcasts Yankees games, have become enormously profitable over the last decade. They collect a stream of revenue from cable, satellite and telephone companies, and from advertising.For the Mets, SNY generates tens of millions of dollars in cash annually, providing Wilpon and Katz with a reliable source of profits and money with which to bolster the team.But to create the network, Wilpon first had to buy out the remaining six years of the team’s contract with Cablevision, which then broadcast Mets games on two of its networks. To do that, he needed cash, and had negotiated $54 million in loans with two banks, according to Picard’s lawsuit.But in May 2004, and needing to close the deal with Cablevision, Wilpon was uncertain the bank loans would materialize in time, according to the lawsuit. First, according to the lawsuit, Wilpon and Katz sought to cash out $54 million from their vast array of longstanding accounts with Madoff.Madoff, though, told the men he could not do that, that their accounts were “in the market,” and instead offered to wire them, and their partners in Sterling Equities, Wilpon’s investment firm, a $54 million interest-free, cost-free loan, according to the lawsuit.“Although Madoff and Sterling agreed that the $54 million transfer from Madoff was a loan, Sterling prepared on Mets letterhead a letter agreement dated May 25, 2004 from Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz to Ruth Madoff that falsely described the transaction as an investment by Ruth Madoff in the company that would later become SNY.”The letter, the lawsuit said, was signed by Wilpon, Katz and Ruth Madoff.In the end, the money from the banks came through, and Wilpon and Katz returned the $54 million to Madoff a day after receiving it. Ruth Madoff does not appear to have ever truly become an investor in SNY. And, at no time, Picard charged, did Wilpon or Katz ever speak to Ruth Madoff about the investment.For Picard, it seems clear, the deal is important in two ways:¶As he asserts elsewhere in the lawsuit, Picard says Wilpon and Katz used Madoff and his money as their own bank, a source of loans that they would not have to disclose to the many banks from which they were, year in and year out, borrowing vast amounts of money.¶It established that Madoff was willing to participate in what amounted to a shady transaction, a fact, Picard asserts, that was one of many reasons Wilpon and Katz had to wonder about just how legitimate Madoff’s investment operation was.The loan and the fraudulent investment letter, the lawsuit says, demonstrate that Katz and Wilpon “were on notice that Madoff would work with them to knowingly falsify a significant business transaction.”“This is more nonsense from the Trustee,” he said. “The $54 million represented funds the Sterling partners had invested with Madoff, as the Trustee acknowledges. As the Trustee also acknowledges, that money was never used — and in fact was returned the next day — because the necessary funds were received from Sterling’s lenders by the buyout deadline, and were used to fund the buyout.”The court papers filed by Picard on Friday also include what he contends are details of an episode in 2000, when the New York State Attorney General’s office grew interested in the charitable foundations started by Wilpon and Katz. The foundations held accounts with Madoff, and the attorney general had grown concerned about their investment activity.The attorney general wrote to Wilpon and Katz asking them to detail their investment strategies — inquiring into who made decisions on trades and who was paid the commissions. In response, the lawsuit claims, Wilpon and Katz hid Madoff’s role, and instead said that they and their wives made the investment decisions.In each case, according to the court papers, the letters sent by the attorney general were faxed to Madoff’s firm, where he, or his employees, were “involved in drafting the responses.”Richard Auletta, a spokesman for Wilpon and Katz, said, “Sterling and its partners answered all questions to the satisfaction of the New York attorney general.”'"

The Los Angeles Times mentioned it only in passing in its editions on Friday.Which is not to say everyone in California — or, for that matter, across the country — is calm.

She said she believed that reaction to be unfounded. “But I have to confess: I bought some seaweed,” she said.There was no end to official statements telling people they had nothing to worry about.“I want to reassure residents and visitors that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the highest authority on radiation in the nation, has indicated Japan’s nuclear emergency presents no danger to Hawaii,” Gov. Neil Abercrombie said in a statement. A similar statement was issued by the Los Angeles Unified School District.At end of the day, this event is a reminder of the uncommon psyche of California, a place where the dangers may be part of the attraction (or at least, evidence that the considerable charms of Southern California compensate for the attendant dangers.) Joel Epstein, a Los Angeles-based transportation and communications consultant, linked to a news report about minor radiation expected over California in a Twitter posting, adding, “It’s how we keep our glow.”Jay McCloskey, 43, enjoying the bright spring day here, shrugged off questions about anything as mundane as radiation poisoning. “Don’t worry about the nuclear fallout over there,” he said. “Worry about forgetting sunblock when you’re on the beach in Santa Monica.”He added, “There is one thing that does worry me slightly: the 8.9 hitting right underneath us. “Understandably, concerns like those viewed by Mr. McCloskey can be heard, fairly regularly, at dinner party conversations. They even make their way into record reviews. In a Los Angeles Times review of a new album by the Black Eyed Peas, “The Beginning,” the writer said the record’s popularity on the radio was as inevitable as a temblor: “Dealing with the Black Eyed Peas’ dominance of pop radio is like planning for earthquakes in Los Angeles. There’s no use in protesting about either anymore.”Mr. Attie, the television producer, suggested the higher-minded approach here was just to go with it — whether it was radiation poisoning or a devastating earthquake.“I think the more evolved position is, we’ll take the apocalypse as long as we can keep the 72-degree weather and Zagat-worthy sushi,” he said.'"
"'11-03-19,'0','“Saudis’ Show of Force Spotlights Their Anxiety” (news article, March 15) thoughtfully outlines the strong and, at times, complicated relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It also underscores the need for the United States to make clear that it will not play favorites and give allies that stifle dissent a pass.The Saudis are using many of the same crackdown techniques that the Obama administration recently condemned after uprisings in Egypt and Libya. As these developments continue to unfold, the United States has a responsibility to call on the leaders of Saudi Arabia not to block peaceful dissent and allow people to exercise their internationally recognized rights to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression.Protesters there are no less entitled to demonstrate peacefully than are those in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya or Yemen. This administration must not allow strategic alliances and economic ties to determine how vigorously it will support these rights.'"
"'11-03-19,'0','Just what does he do anymore? Beltran turns 34 in April. He cannot play center field, and his last healthy season was 2008. Like Castillo, Beltran was a dubious long-term investment; the legs that stole 83 bases in two seasons before coming to New York just don’t work the way they used to.Yet the Mets must count on him. Manager Terry Collins told Beltran on Friday that he had an opening-day lineup in his desk drawer, with Beltran’s name in the cleanup spot. Beltran vowed to be ready, but no one really knows.Oliver Perez seems ready, at least in the sense that he is not injured. He is also starting the final year of his contract, at $12 million, and Collins is trying him as a left-handed specialist. Perez varied his arm angle and retired all three lefties he faced in a 3-0 victory over Atlanta on Friday, though Nate McLouth hit a screaming line-drive out to the warning track.Alderson could have cut Perez on Friday, but like his predecessor, Omar Minaya, he has resisted. Alderson and Collins both said it was critical to establish trust with the rest of the team. They promised Castillo and Perez would play this spring, and they have made good.“It was important for us, as a general manager and a manager, to take a fresh look at things, and I don’t think it’s cost us anything,” Alderson said. “Once we made that commitment, we had to honor it, and I think we did. We were pretty straightforward about how this process works, and that’s how it worked. When you make a commitment to a player, it’s not just a commitment to that player, it’s a commitment to all the players. They understand what’s going on.”The Mets tried to cut Castillo in the most polite way possible. His name was on the lineup card in the morning, and he was called to the locker room during the pregame workout while reporters were elsewhere, sparing some humiliation for a 15-year veteran.Castillo, though, did not seem to think he had a fair chance to win a second-base competition against the lukewarm field of Brad Emaus, Luis Hernandez, Daniel Murphy and Justin Turner. A Newsday reporter spotted him leaving the ballpark, and Castillo shared his message to Alderson and Collins: “I said I came here to play and you didn’t give me the chance. You didn’t use me.”Actually, Castillo had 31 plate appearances, in line with the rest of the field. He was 8 for 28 (.286), enough of a sample for other teams to scout him.Collins essentially said that the Mets released Castillo for his own good, because fans would never forgive him for his game-ending error at Yankee Stadium in 2009.“You know, he dropped a stinking pop-up,” Collins said. “It’s not going to be the last time an error’s ever made. It’s not going to be the last time someone costs a team a game. Luis Castillo should not be blamed for anything except being a professional.”The departure of Castillo moves the Mets forward, but there is still not much to excite the skeptical. Alderson said fans could look forward to the new starting pitchers, Chris Young and Chris Capuano, and to Collins. He mentioned the continued development of young players.“I think there are lots of things, but they’re a little more subtle than just signing a new free agent for $100 million,” Alderson said. “But one of the great things about New York is that the fans are so intelligent but at the same time passionate. I think they will begin to appreciate those changes.”The Mets are a team in transition, filling in around the decay as they methodically plan for the future. Alderson’s best hope is that savvy fans understand him, and that by releasing Castillo, others will start to buy in.'"

Bayer broke the news during a federal court hearing in a lawsuit brought by residents seeking to stop the company from restarting the unit that produces methyl isocyanate, used in pesticide production. The chemical killed about 15,000 people and sickened about a half-million when it leaked from a former Union Carbide plant in Bhopal in 1984. Bayer halted the chemical’s production at the plant in Institute last summer, but had hoped to resume production before the growing season.'"
"'11-03-19,'0','Throughout the nuclear crisis, Japanese officials have been accused of withholding information and understating the severity of the risks. But on Friday, pressure mounted on the Obama administration to release information it has gathered on the radiation coming from Japan, with six environmental and watchdog groups sending the White House a letter calling for “transparency on the part of the government.”In many respects, the plume underscores the lack of a global system for monitoring nuclear emergencies and making the results public. European officials said the system was designed to be hugely sensitive to detect cheaters trying to develop clandestine nuclear arms — but not radioactive plumes from commercial reactor failures, which are easier to detect.“What we can measure is almost a single atom, which has absolutely no danger” for human health, said Lars-Erik De Geer, research director of the Swedish Defense Research Agency, a part of the monitoring system. “It has to be very sensitive because we are looking for people who are trying to hide the testing of weapons.”The Sacramento readings were made on Air Force equipment shared with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, an arm of the United Nations in Vienna. Its mandate is to monitor the global ban on the testing of nuclear arms.The United Nations agency has more than 60 stations that sniff for radiation spikes and uses weather forecasts and powerful computers to model the transport of radiation on the winds.Earlier this week, its scientists forecast the plume’s arrival in the continental United States around the end of this week.European officials said that — outside of Japan — its global network of detectors first picked up the presence of the Japanese plume at a station on the Kamchatka Peninsula, in Russia. Then, on Friday, they said, the station in Sacramento began to register the faint radiation. The government declined to release further details.In both cases, officials said, the detectors found minuscule levels of iodine-131 and cesium-137 — highly dangerous byproducts of reactor operation that in large amounts can cause cancer. The measured levels are judged to be many millions of times lower than concentrations that would pose a danger to human health.Experts tracking the plume said it would continue to drift east and might arrive in the New York region early next week.By definition, the current measurements are tracking relatively old radiation that was released into the atmosphere at the start of the Japanese crisis. It began on March 11 when an offshore earthquake with a magnitude now estimated at 9.0 shook the reactor complex. A tsunami rolled into northeast Japan minutes later, swamping six reactors lined up along the coastline.As the crisis has worsened, the releases of radiation into the atmosphere have increased. So it seems inevitable that the concentrations of radiation in the plume will grow — though still, health experts say, posing no health risk in the United States.“We’re monitoring the situation,” said Mike Sicilia, a spokesperson in Sacramento for the California Department of Public Health. But he emphasized that no danger was anticipated.“All data from state and federal sources,” he said, “show that harmful levels of radiation won’t reach California.”In brief remarks at the White House on Thursday, President Obama said he knew Americans were worrying about radiation drifting across the Pacific. “So I want to be very clear,” he said. “We do not expect harmful levels of radiation to reach the United States, whether it’s the West Coast, Hawaii, Alaska or U.S. territories.”But environmental and watchdog groups cited a growing anxiety in the United States and complained of a lack of adequate information from American officials.“The U.S. government clearly has information that the public has a right and need to know,” Damon Moglen, climate and energy director at Friends of the Earth, said in a statement.He called federal insights into the nature of the Japanese radiation “critically important” for the Japanese people, Americans in Japan and “those here at home who are anxious that dangerous radiation may creep towards our shores.”The California readings were made by an arm of the Air Force Technical Applications Center, an institution of the cold war that monitors for signs of clandestine nuclear tests. Its unit in suburban Sacramento, northeast of the city, has radiation detectors set up at Camp Kohler, near the former McClellan Air Force Base.In addition to serving the United States government, the unit feeds new readings into the international data system of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, which has 120 member states that share the monitoring insights.Although the legal mandate of the organization is to scan the globe for clandestine bomb blasts — not reactor accidents — its officials recently decided to start sharing its data more widely in an effort to help international authorities struggling with the Japanese crisis.In a statement on Friday, the Vienna group said it began sharing the monitoring information Friday with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organization. The organization said it was “responding to respective requests” from the two groups that it received Thursday for help in “assessing the situation.”'"
"'11-03-19,'0','The Australian-born Ms. Bennetts has effected an astonishing transformation on a sleepy regional company since arriving in Antwerp in 2005. She wasn’t an obvious candidate for the job, never having directed a ballet company before. But she had spent 15 years as a ballet mistress at William Forsythe’s Frankfurt Ballet.Both the dancers and the repertory were quickly revitalized, as Ms. Bennetts acquired works by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins and contemporary choreographers and held a choreographic competition that garnered applicants worldwide. She insisted that the company dance to live music and applied stringent standards to rehearsal and performance.But Ms. Bennetts’s real coup was immediately acquiring Mr. Forsythe’s full-length, wildly theatrical “Impressing the Czar” — a major work not seen since the Frankfurt Ballet performed it in the mid-1990s and never before danced by another company.“Czar,” brilliantly performed, catapulted the troupe onto the world stage: at the end of Ms. Bennetts’s first Antwerp season, the company appeared at the prestigious Montpellier Dance Festival; the following year it went to the Lincoln Center Festival in New York and Sadler’s Wells in London.Financially, the picture was far less rosy. The company budget — just over 5 million euros (about $7 million) a year when Ms. Bennetts arrived, significantly lower than most comparable European troupes — barely covered the basic costs and the salaries of 100 employees. And the 800,000 euros ($1.1 million) a year that she was contractually promised for artistic purposes proved not to exist.A 2008 audit found the company to be 3 million euros ($4.2 million) in debt. A new executive director was appointed, eight people were fired, and a tighter budgetary regime was introduced. Ms. Bennetts cut the number of programs and increased its lucrative international touring. By 2010 the debt had been reduced to 1 million euros ($1.4 million).“As soon as we were in a better situation, they cut our money again,” Ms. Bennetts said.A cut made by the Flemish government was a relatively minor 4.3 percent. (The troupe’s annual budget now stands at about $7.5 million.) But salaries, linked to an inflationary index, have increased, Ms. Bennetts said, so even a small reduction puts the company deeper into debt.The cut and the merger proposal come amid a climate of steady erosion in arts subsidies in Europe, where such support has long been considered a right by audiences and artists, and the public reaction to the ballet’s situation has picked up steam.Ms. Bennetts’s televised denunciation found its way onto YouTube. A Facebook support group, a Web site and a Twitter account called balletisnojoke appeared within days.Ms. Bennetts and Ms. Schauvliege were inundated with e-mails and letters.The public outcry led to two hearings in the Flemish Parliament to debate the merger idea. In an interview last month with Ms. Schauvliege and other government officials in Ghent, Jan Vermassen, the parliament’s adviser to arts and heritage, maintained that the decision was not political. Rather, he said, it was based on the recommendations of an independent commission.“They made a very negative report, both artistically and concerning management,” he said. “Artistically in that they are concentrated on the repertoire of Forsythe. They had a serious debt. And they are touring all over the world but are not present enough in their own country.”In fact the report from the two commission members — Brigitte Lefevre, the director of the Paris Opera Ballet, and Monica Mason, the director of the Royal Ballet — praises Ms. Bennetts’s artistic policy, in particular her Forsythe acquisitions, and never mentions touring in Belgium. It does, however, express concern about the company’s finances.“We were concerned about plans for doing new, large-scale classical pieces like ‘The Nutcracker’ when a deficit already existed,” Ms. Lefevre said in a telephone interview last week. “And we felt that the existing state structures — the orchestra, the opera houses — which the ballet currently must pay for, should be better integrated. But we did not advise putting the ballet with the opera when there is no tradition of that there.”Ms. Schauvliege insisted that a merger was not a cost-cutting measure but a way of increasing efficiency and cooperation.Others are skeptical about the government’s motives.“Of course this is all about money,” said Ted Brandsen, the Dutch National Ballet’s artistic director, who spoke in January at the second parliamentary hearing. “But the ballet company has its own premises, its own theater, its own technical staff. Putting it with the opera, which is physically in another place, with vastly different rules, pay scales and organizational structure, is not a solution here.”Ms. Bennetts said that aside from these considerations, her primary concern was artistic independence, even though the minister has insisted that nothing will change.“I didn’t sign up to work under an intendant,” she said. “It’s an old-fashioned structure, with ballet subservient to opera, that it has taken us years to break away from.”The director of the Flemish Opera, Aviel Cahn, said that he was not against fusion in principle but that he too had serious reservations.“It’s a system that is common in Europe and can exist successfully,” he said. “But the opera and the ballet are similarly underfinanced, and to put them together won’t solve anything.”For now, the Flemish government and Ms. Bennetts appear to be at an impasse. In February a parliament statement declared a wish “to ensure the artistic identity of the Ballet of Flanders and of the Flemish Opera,” without specifically mentioning a merger. Last week Ms. Schauvliege’s office said in a news release that an “integration of opera and ballet” was supported by both companies’ boards.In response, the theater unions put out a statement, saying, “This is definitively NOT what has been stated in a mutual document from both boards.”Meanwhile, the Royal Ballet of Flanders continues to do what it does best: dance. After the Ghent performance, Ms. Bennetts was backstage, offering corrections to the dancers.“At one of the hearings, they asked if I was too ambitious for Belgium,” she said. “I hope not.”'"
"'11-03-19,'0','Cisco Systems, the world’s largest maker of computer networking gear, said on Friday that it would pay a cash dividend of 6 cents a share, its first dividend ever, on April 20.The company had announced last year that it would start paying a dividend equating to an annual yield of 1 to 2 percent, but had not specified the amount or precise timing.The dividend amounts to an annual yield of 1.4 percent at Thursday’s closing price of $17. The shares hit a 52-week low of $16.97 on Thursday.The dividend will be paid to shareholders of record as of March 31.Technology companies like to hold on to their cash, investing it in their own growth rather than paying dividends. But several of them have started paying small dividends as they find their business maturing. Microsoft introduced a dividend in 2003 and now carries a 2.6 percent annual yield. Hewlett-Packard, which competes with Cisco in many fields, has a yield of 0.8 percent.Among the companies that do not pay a dividend are Apple, Dell and eBay. Cisco, which is based in San Jose, Calif., said its “leadership position in the markets we serve is strong,” making this the time to reward shareholders.The company has already been transferring cash to shareholders through stock buybacks. Most recently, it authorized a $10 billion buyback program in November. The dividend will cost $1.3 billion a year. Cisco had $40.2 billion in cash in February, but only $3.1 billion is in the United States. The rest sits at overseas subsidiaries.'"
"'11-03-19,'0','BEIJING — Chinese security officers in a restive Tibetan area of Sichuan Province have released seven monks who were detained after one monk, Phuntsog, died after setting himself on fire to protest Chinese rule, according to a report issued late Thursday by International Campaign for Tibet, an advocacy group based in Washington.One of the seven monks released, Tashi, had head wounds that indicated he had been beaten while detained, the group said. An unknown number of monks and laypeople are still being detained.Security forces detained a large number of Tibetans in the town of Aba, known as Ngaba in Tibetan, when hundreds of locals held a protest on Wednesday after Phuntsog’s set himself on fire to protest Chinese rule in the vast Tibetan regions of western China. It was the first time that a monk protesting against China had killed himself through self-immolation, according to historians of modern Tibet.Phuntsog, from Kirti Monastery, died early Thursday after fellow monks brought him to a hospital.Ngaba and Kirti Monastery were still under lockdown on Friday.'"

"'11-03-20,'0','Richmond’s 6-foot-10 Justin Harper had a game-high 19 points. Faried, often double-teamed, finished with 11 points and 13 rebounds, both short of his season averages of 17.5 and 14.6.While Morehead State was motivated by dreams of a Butler-like run in the tournament, the understated Spiders felt slighted by their low seeding. They won the Atlantic 10 tournament, and their nonconference victories included wins against Purdue (a third seed) and Virginia Commonwealth (a No. 11 seed that beat No. 6 Georgetown on Friday).Richmond beat fifth-seeded Vanderbilt on Thursday, 69-66, in large part because of the senior guard Kevin Anderson, the Atlantic 10 player of the year. He is listed at 6 feet but only reaches that height when he wears his basketball shoes.Anderson scored 25 points against Vanderbilt, none more important than his floater with 18.7 seconds left to lift the Spiders into their matchup with Morehead State.It was the ninth 12-versus-13 game. The 12th-seeded team is now 8-1 in those games, the lone loss coming in 1998 when Valparaiso beat Florida State.Morehead State (25-10) was left haunted by a squandered opportunity to become the first Ohio Valley Conference team to advance to the Round of 16 since the tournament expanded to 64 teams (it is now at 68) in 1985. Morehead State last played in the Round of 16 in 1961.But the Eagles started slowly, quickly falling behind by 10 points because of sloppy turnovers and poor shooting. When Richmond held a 20-11 lead with about seven minutes left in the first half, the Spiders had taken 19 shots. Morehead State had managed only 12.Richmond took a 30-21 lead to halftime, and never let the lead slip below 6.“They’re so skilled at every position,” Morehead State Coach Donnie Tyndall said.The Spiders welcomed the slow pace. They run a Princeton-style offense, rotating around the perimeter and trying to find passing seams through the lane.Morehead State tried to quicken things with a full-court press, but Richmond, starting four seniors, was never rattled. The Spiders attacked Morehead State’s zone defense — designed to keep Faried close to the basket rather than chasing the nimble Harper around the perimeter — with cuts and screens and sudden bursts to the basket.Faried, a 6-8 forward who leaves as the career rebounding leader in Division I since the modern era began in 1973, made his presence felt in a few highlight-worthy bursts. He blocked a dunk attempt that lifted fans from their seats and rattled the rim with several dunks. He once ducked under the basket to rebound a teammate’s missed free throw and score on a layup.But as a team, Morehead State made only 37.5 percent of its shots. The senior Demonte Harper, who averaged 15.8 points a game during the season, was 2 of 15 and had 4 points.It was all enough to send the Spiders scrambling to San Antonio. Their next game will not be played against a team with a lower seed than them. It will come against a team that stands in the way of Richmond going places it has never gone before.'"
"'11-03-20,'0','Customers must sign a broad release of liability — so broad that some lawyers say it’s not enforceable — and then the fliers are pretty much on their own. In a city that celebrates its tolerance but often veers toward nanny-state-ism — no Happy Meals here, thank you — House of Air stands as a defiant symbol of the right to put yourself (or your children) in harm’s way in the name of a good time. Participatory sports of every kind are as much a part of the culture here as artisanal foods or the latest gadgets. How much fun makes the very real possibility of debilitating injury an acceptable risk? You decide.Polly Wood, 28, and her husband went to House of Air in late November to scout it out as a possible party venue. After a cursory safety briefing, Ms. Wood said, employees were so impressed with her athleticism — she had run a half-marathon earlier that month — that they encouraged her to become the first female customer to slam-dunk in the Colosseum.Thinking she was “God’s gift to trampolining,” Ms. Wood said, and following the staff member’s instructions, she bounced her way toward the basket, gaining height each time. The final bouncing surface had much different surface tension, she said, and she sank into it. Her knees issued “two outrageously loud pops,” she said, and bent in the wrong direction. She then endured months of surgeries and physical therapy to fix her torn anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus.“I hate to hear of anyone having a less-than-fantastic experience at House of Air,” wrote David Schaeffer, 35, the co-founder, who declined to be interviewed in person. Mr. Schaeffer and his partner, Paul McGeehan, 33, have gradually trimmed weekly capacity (to 6,090 a week, or 70 at a time, from 7,221) and last month they hired a gymnastics-safety expert.“We take safety very seriously,” Mr. Schaeffer said. “Our injury rates are well below that of other action sports.”Mr. Schaeffer acknowledges that trampolining is inherently dangerous. Still, public records show no ambulance trips to hospitals involving Planet Granite, a rock-climbing space, or San Francisco Gymnastics, also in the Presidio. Ski resorts report an injury rate of 2.63 per thousand skiers, Mr. Schaeffer notes, while House of Air has an injury rate of 1.96 per thousand.So far, Bay Area fun-seekers are unbowed. Peter Ackerson and about 30 friends celebrated a birthday at House of Air one night shortly after Christmas. That party yielded a broken ankle, a torn A.C.L. and a badly strained ankle.So it was the party from hell? No, it seems.“I’m a big fan of House of Air,” said Mr. Ackerson, 34, who counts among his past sport injuries 13 broken bones, two concussions and two surgeries. “It was a lot of fun. And it ended badly.”'"

Daley will be in China next week, home of the magnetically levitated train that whisks passengers from downtown Shanghai to Pudong International Airport — just like the one he had hoped to introduce in Chicago.His trip comes a week after he had to accept a compromise plan that formally delays the final phase of the O’Hare Airport expansion.’The yin and yang of Mr. Daley’s final days in office show how mayoral dreams sometimes run into economic reality.The reality is that he got all he could, for now, from the airlines and the federal government in last week’s $1.17 billion deal. The stalemate is broken, and a partial O’Hare expansion moves forward. Mr. Daley has clumped the yet-to-do list into a Phase 3 that his successor must handle.Among the unfinished — rather, unstarted — business that was part of the original $6.6 billion O’Hare Master Plan unveiled in 2001:  A  western terminal, a direct connection to the East-West Tollway, a system to circulate traffic from the Kennedy Expressway on the east to the new complex on the other side of the airport and a special C.T.A. express line to O’Hare. The idea of a high-speed rail link came later.The budget has grown. The city acknowledges that costs will be at least $1 billion higher than original estimates. Other estimates have put the cost of expansion and improvement plans in and around O’Hare at more than $15 billion.'"

He told them, “Your friendships should be based on people liking you and not what you can bring along.”Of course, as a senator who was the son of a Connecticut senator, Dodd has had plenty of brushes with celebrity. He campaigned with and hung out with in Westport. He had a cameo in the political movie “ .” As a merry bachelor in the ’80s, he was linked to Bianca Jagger and .He even ran into one of his most famous constituents, , who lived out her life at her family home in Fenwick, on the mouth of the . He had stopped by the Fenwick house of a friend, Ellsworth Grant, Hepburn’s brother-in-law.“I walk up the back step of his house and the door opens up, and Ellsworth and Katharine Hepburn are standing three feet away,” Dodd recalls. “And Ellsworth says to me in a very loud voice, ‘Would you like to meet Katharine Hepburn?’ and she’s not even glanced in my direction. So I say, ‘I’d be honored, delighted.’ And he says to her really loudly, ‘Katharine, do you want to meet Senator Dodd?’ And without ever looking at me, she goes, ‘Why?’ ”He laughs. If he seems happy, it’s understandable. After 36 years in Congress, his final stretch in the Senate was not easy. As chairman of the Banking Committee, he was dealing with the financial crisis while shepherding Teddy Kennedy’s health care bill as his good friend was dying. In trouble with Connecticut voters for taking a V.I.P. home from , he didn’t seek re-election.Dodd is legally not allowed to lobby Congress for 22 more months. “Aside from that,” he says, “I don’t think it necessarily involves a principal all the time.” He has lobbyists on his staff.“Whatever else the world may think of us, they think we do a pretty good job at telling a story,” he says. “There’s probably someone around the world burning an American flag as we’re talking, and it wouldn’t be a shocking circumstance that once they’re finished demonstrating, they’ll go home tonight and they’ll probably watch an American movie.”It’s a tough job in an era of digital looting — Dodd disdains the word piracy as too “romantic” — and studios enmeshed in the webs of multinational corporations predicted by Paddy Chayefsky in “ .”“The impression of the industry is sort of a gilded, tuxedo-wearing, red-carpet walking, movie-star, People magazine kind of thing,” Dodd says. “And the irony is, the automobile industry competes with each other once a year. These guys compete with each other every Friday night. The business model is nuts in many ways.”Like his vibrant predecessor , Dodd thinks movies can have “a profound influence.” When he was a teenager, he and his siblings went to see “Birdman of Alcatraz” with and began furiously debating the flaws in the justice system.“To have this lovely man who loved in jail,” he says. “And we got my father, who was in the Senate, so upset, he calls the attorney general of the . And apparently the Birdman was a serial killer, but they forgot to tell you in the movie.” He laughs.Dodd loves an array of films, from “ ” to “ .” He diplomatically notes that he enjoyed both “The King’s Speech” and “The Social Network.”He talks about ways to persuade to show more than 20 non-Chinese films a year; an idea to hold conferences here debating social and political issues raised in movies; and, of course, about the possibility of an Irish film festival next St. Patrick’s Day.Asked how he likes Hollywood, Dodd replies, “It’s fine, you know, it’s more appealing in January and February.”'"

The ultimate price, in human life, may not be known for years.The details of this catastrophe were unforeseeable, leading some to conclude this was a black swan event — something so wildly unexpected, so enormous in its impact, that it seems to defy our understanding and expose the fragility of our knowledge of the world. How could anyone have predicted this?And yet in 2007, Tokyo Electric Power, or Tepco, escaped a disaster at its huge Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power station, on the opposite side of Japan, when that plant was damaged by a 6.8-magnitude earthquake — three times as large as what the plant was designed to withstand. Tepco basically lucked out last time.So perhaps a bigger question is whether the markets — in which we have come to place so much trust — can put a true price on outsize risks like this.Many have compared the events unfolding in Japan with 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, the financial collapse of 2008 and 2009, the BP oil spill, and the uprisings in the Arab world — in that all have shown the limits of the collective wisdom of the marketplace. For a moment, all the swans seemed black. And those swans seemed blacker still when viewed through the lens of today’s hyperkinetic global markets.“There are an amazing number of crosscurrents in the world economy right now, more than I’ve seen in 25 years,” said Shawn Reynolds, a co-portfolio manager at Van Eck Associates in New York.Like everyone else, corporate executives, economists and financial analysts in Tokyo, New York, London and beyond struggled last week to wrap their heads around the scale of this disaster. But, as they so often do, the analysts quickly fell to work assessing the implications for companies, markets and economies. At times, it was almost surreal: On Tuesday, Laszlo Birinyi, a prominent stock market analyst based in Westport, Conn., e-mailed around a succinct report titled “Nuclear Meltdowns at a Glance.”This is what happens on Wall Street. If you’re not immersed in the culture, it might be hard to understand the cool calculus that is applied to world events, however dire those events might be. After the quake hit on March 11, the CNBC anchor Larry Kudlow told viewers, “The human toll here looks to be much worse than the economic toll, and we can be grateful for that.” He later apologized.As the week wore on, and prices were gyrating on everything from a share of I.B.M. to a ton of copper, everyone was making back-of-the-envelope calculations. There is still no clear consensus about how far the economic shocks will reverberate. Many analysts are guessing — and then second-guessing — how the disaster will play out in northeast Japan. The first, tentative analysis seemed painfully obvious: the Japanese economy, already weak, perhaps already in a recession before calamity struck, will become even weaker.On Friday, the Group of 7 industrialized nations took the rare step of intervening on the world’s foreign exchange markets to stem a sudden rise in the value of the yen. The currency had soared all week against the dollar — the exact opposite of what you might expect. But Japanese companies and investors were bringing their money home, to pay for huge rebuilding costs.After its most harrowing week since the 1987 market crash, the Tokyo Stock Exchange found its footing on Friday. But it was a week like few others on the exchange: the Nikkei 225 stock index, Japan’s equivalent of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 6.2 percent on Monday, plunged 10.5 percent on Tuesday, rebounded 5.7 percent on Wednesday and sank 1.4 percent on Thursday. It closed up 2.7 percent on Friday, at 9,206.75.The loss for the week totaled 1,048 points, or 10.2 percent.IF you happen to visit a Wall Street trading floor, walk over to the nearest Bloomberg terminal, type “WRST” and hit the green key that says “go.”WRST — that is short for “worst,” as in, “worst-case scenario.” The program enables Wall Street types to measure the level of risk in their investment portfolios under a variety of scary circumstances modeled on past crises, including the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the bankruptcy of WorldCom in 2002 and the devaluation of the Thailand’s currency, the baht, in 1997.Such “what if” scripts are the stuff of modern Wall Street. Everyone runs them. Entire schools of financial analysis are devoted to examining historical market patterns in the belief that those patterns can predict the future.Such analysis, of course, depends on — and perhaps even encourages — our belief that tomorrow will be much like today. And all that despite the fine-print caveat on your 401(k) statement that reads, “Past performance is no guarantee of future success.”'"

"'11-03-20,'0','But Mr. Corson also said the Japanese seafood industry could face a long and difficult struggle “to establish faith in the safety of their seafood — not unlike the challenges faced by gulf fishermen in the U.S. after the BP oil spill.”The Tsukiji fish market in central Tokyo, the world’s largest clearinghouse for just about anything that fishermen pull from the sea, was not physically damaged by the earthquake. Its cobblestone aisles and alleyways were as loud, profane and hurly-burly as ever on Saturday. But something in Tsukiji’s soul seems to have been lost, or at least badly bruised, in the tsunami.Before the disaster, the market drew 10 percent of its daily inventory of 2,400 tons of seafood from the waters off Tohoku, the coastal epicenter of the earthquake. The fishery there is renowned for its scallops, seaweed, bonito and shark’s fin. Tohoku, as a place and a brand in Japan, was formidable.“It’s not like the brand is just damaged now — it’s over,” said a glum Tsutomu Kosaka, the general manager at Tsukiji. “At least for now, the brand is finished. Gone. It’s hopeless.”Mr. Kosaka said Saturday that neither the Health Ministry nor city inspectors had tested any seafood in the Tsukiji market. The last time there were radiation tests of seafood in Tokyo, he said, was in 1954, after a Japanese tuna boat was contaminated by fallout from an American atomic test on Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands.Mr. Kosaka’s hopelessness, for now, stems more from the outright destruction of fishing facilities in the north than from a possible poisoning of the fishery.In towns and ports all along the coast, docks and jetties have vanished into splinters. Boats and trawlers are smashed or sunk. Nets and tackle, gone. Offshore fish farms and onshore processing factories, gone. Among the victims was Ojika, a 100-year-old whaling port that had just two boats left from its once mighty fleet.A sushi chef at a restaurant near the fish market said the tsunami and its plundering of Tohoku had also been disastrous for his business.“Scallops, sardines and oysters from Tohoku, none of that is available now,” said Tomohito Narasaki, 27, a chef at Sushizanmai. He said millions of dollars’ worth of bluefin tuna, red snapper and yellowtail farmed off Tohoku was instantly destroyed.Japanese consumers certainly prize the domestic seafood products that go into their premium sushi dishes, but they also eat plenty of non-Japanese products in their sushi — as do consumers around the globe. Now that sushi is eaten worldwide, it is also sourced worldwide. Wholesalers, distributors, restaurant owners and chefs search everywhere for quality fish.“I have started to hear people in the West worrying about radioactive sushi and so on, but perception and reality are quite different,” said Mr. Corson, the author of “The Story of Sushi.” “Much of the seafood typically used in sushi doesn’t originate in Japan and never passes through the country.”Producers of Kobe and other top brands of Japanese beef said Saturday that they had not yet tested their prized cattle, which can cost upward of $50,000 each. Nor had they tested the special feed they use.Ranchers with operations far from the damaged reactors scoffed at the notion that their cows might be contaminated. Distance is in their favor, they said, pointing out that Kobe is 360 miles southwest of the damaged reactor complex.“I don’t need any tests,” said Kazunori Ikeda, director of the Wagyu Registry Association, the oversight body for all Wagyu cattle, including Black Wagyu, the strain from which Kobe beef comes. “We’re not afraid of contamination because Kobe is so far from Fukushima. I’m sure all cattlemen in Japan feel the same way. I’m confident.”Certified Kobe beef produced in Japan is not exported, the certification group said, so foreign consumers will not be affected.Kobe cattle, like the other leading brands here, have strict requirements for certification. Only 3,000 head per year make the Kobe grade. A five-ounce sirloin at the Ekki Bar and Grill in Tokyo currently goes for 12,000 yen, about $150.Japan’s other brands of premium beef include Sendai, Ohmi, Matsuzaka and Yonezawa. “We can’t feed our cows anymore because of the shortages of feed and water,” said Masaru Takahashi, manager of the JA Cooperative in hard-hit Furukawa, which raises Sendai beef. “We have only 20 percent of the feed we need. I can’t imagine what effect this is going to have on our herd.”Sendai cattlemen had just started to export their beef to Hong Kong and Macao, and had drafted plans to start shipping to the United States. That project is now delayed as the ranchers await word on further radiation tests. The government said Friday that it would test meat for cesium, plutonium and uranium, but gave no timetable.Mr. Takahashi said he was worried about the public’s perception of beef cattle if tests showed any further spread of radiation. “If the rumors grow,” he said, “I’m not confident that anyone will buy our beef, even if it’s the highest quality and even if it’s safe.”'"

"'11-03-20,'0','Down on the farm, however, they would probably laugh at this notion. That’s because, when hard times come — as they always do — the children and working adults would have to cut back in order to pay the full “pensions” of the old. Younger generations would be hit with a double-whammy, having to make do with less themselves while having to sacrifice more to meet their contractual obligations to their elders.In a sense, this is what is happening to us now, as the slack economy increases our tax burdens to support state pensioners. Working people in the private sector know this, and it is no surprise that some of them are upset. That is ultimately why they are pushing to drop traditional government pensions.But wait. To make things even worse, standard modern finance has more to say. The conventional wisdom is that traditional government pension plans must be fully funded. That would be like assigning a part of the farm — a flock of sheep, say — to a pension trust fund that would then foot the bill for some of the farm’s future retirees. Every time those sheep were sheared, the profits would accrue to the pension fund.If the flock did not produce prosperity — if the price of sheep collapsed, for example — we would say that the farm’s pension plan was underfunded. We would ask the children and all working adults to sacrifice more and buy more sheep for the fund.That, too, is essentially what is happening today, as underwhelming investment returns on state pension funds are forcing governments either to raise taxes or to cut spending on things like schools and health services. During the financial crisis, the funds’ investments soured along with the economy, so working people are dealing with the effects of tightened state budgets at a particularly difficult time.Gov. Jerry Brown of California referred to these inequities in his State of the State message in January. “We must also face the long-term challenge,” he said, “of ensuring that our public pensions are fair to both taxpayers and workers alike.”Economic theorists disagree about whether public pension funds should be fully funded, or even funded at all. The economic issues turn out to be surprisingly complicated.Henning Bohn, an economist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, examined this issue in a recent research paper, using a mathematical version of the three generations on the farm. He concluded that we should not fully fund pensions. He pointed out that raising taxes to support pension funds punishes young working people, who are typically in debt with mortgages and credit cards. These workers usually pay higher interest rates on their debts than the return that the state government can earn on pension fund investments.So what is the alternative?One idea that has gained momentum is to replace traditional pension funds with plans akin to 401(k)’s. In 401(k)-style plans, no one would be guaranteed a particular income upon retirement. The government would merely contribute to retirement accounts, and state workers would choose how that money was invested — and live with the consequences.On the old-time farm, some people might choose to invest their retirement money in sheep, others in the vegetable garden, and still others in the cornfield. Their future welfare would depend on how those investments panned out.But traditional farming families would probably laugh at this, too. What if the sheep died? What would happen to elderly family members who had invested so much in them?THE trouble with the debate over what to do about our strained public pension systems is that so much of it is veiled in abstract, financial terms. The best solution might be the old-fashioned one: sharing, with some adjustments in our modern defined-benefits system. Yes, making the transition would not be easy. We would have to respect promises that have been made to today’s retirees.But, basically, we can keep traditional pensions by changing how we compute them. We should use a formula so that guaranteed future income in retirement bears a fixed relationship to a state’s future ability to pay — as measured, for example, by that state’s economic output.It is that simple: Just scrap the current indexing of pensions to the Consumer Price Index and replace it with a link to the state’s gross domestic product.We can’t accurately fund traditional pension plans until we have G.D.P.-linked bonds, or “trills,” which I described in a recent column. But it is time to start the transition, so that pensions share risks across generations.'"
"'11-03-20,'0','It’s an intriguing idea — that by studying creative people who are passionate about what they do, we can enhance our own creativity, and business savvy, even if we work in a completely different arena.Of course, it’s easier for most people to relate to musicians and their work than, say, to people who design furniture (and their end tables). The obvious emotion underlying a great song makes us feel that we have at least some understanding of the performers and their motivations. The authors of “Come Together,” both Nashville residents and avid Beatles fans, make the most of that idea: that in the beginning at least, the Beatles were just like you and me.For example, when the Beatles were a young band, their only means of transportation was a van missing its windshield. That meant that in the dead of winter, traveling across England to a gig was such a frigid experience that the band members who weren’t driving huddled on top of one another for warmth, the authors write, adding: “Take a page out of their book. Although frostbite is generally a bad idea, avoid relying heavily on debt to finance your daily operations or growth.”THE Lennon-McCartney decision to always share credit on songs provided another lesson, the authors suggest: Don’t waste time arguing over crumbs when that energy could be better used building a bakery — or, in this case, the Beatles songbook.Another story from the Beatles’ early years highlights the importance of heeding feedback, even when it’s not what you want to hear. Executives at Capitol Records, the American affiliate of EMI, took a pass on “Love Me Do.” Even after the success of “Please, Please Me” — a No. 1 album in Britain — Capitol refused to issue the record or any of its singles.The Beatles could have kept arguing about the album’s merits, or simply given up on conquering America. Instead, Mr. Courtney and Mr. Cassidy explain, they kept recording new material and sending it to Capitol — for one solid year. Finally, in 1964, Capitol released “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” which became the Beatles’ first No. 1 hit in the United States.“The most important lesson here is not simple perseverance, though that is important,” the book says. “The approach was key. They did not continue to pitch Capitol the same product that they had already rejected.” Instead, the Beatles’ producer George Martin got in touch only “when he had something new and improved.”In the book, Mr. Courtney and Mr. Cassidy tell a story about how one night Lennon and McCartney taught Mick Jagger and Keith Richards how to write their own songs — by composing “I Wanna Be Your Man” in front of them. The anecdote raises the question: Is there a book to be written about the business wisdom of the Rolling Stones?Mr. Courtney, a Realtor and real estate columnist who has read every book ever written about the Beatles, said a Stones project would require much new research. But Mr. Cassidy, a longtime business journalist and sometimes sound engineer, seemed intrigued.“The Stones have stayed together as a working band for so long and weathered so many changes in the music business,” he said. “They weathered the decline of record sales and the increased emphasis on live performance and touring as a revenue source. They also adopted a number of strategies very different from the Beatles — becoming expatriates to avoid the crushing British tax burden. It’s a very different story but almost an equally fascinating one.”In other words, if “Come Together” does well, “Gimme (Tax) Shelter” may not be far behind.'"
"'11-03-20,'0','I love to be around smart, fun people. And if you’re confident, let your people ask questions, and do things, and speak up.Q. How do you draw people out?A. I have a philosophy at Hain that there are no closed doors. Anybody can go into any meeting they want. If you’re not invited, you still can go in. I’m a big believer in getting people comfortable in meetings, making them comfortable to ask questions. And there’s no such thing as a dumb question.I’ll bring interns into my board meetings. It gives them exposure. This is where they’re going to learn; this is where the grass is going to grow. There were times when board members were saying, why do we bring these people in here? And I said, they are good employees of this company and they’re here to learn. I bring them into important discussions. If we’re talking about acquisitions, I want to know their opinions, their thoughts. It’s not just about sitting through a presentation where you’re going to learn about market data and market share.Q. How do you get everyone talking in meetings?A. I’m consistent. It’s not, Monday I mean it, Tuesday I don’t. It’s just been the way from the beginning here. I will say, “What are your thoughts on that?” It comes back to, you hire good people who are smart. You’re not going to embarrass them. The point is to make them feel good. There were some situations in my career where some nasty things were said to me. There’s scar tissue from that stuff. I think it’s important, with people who work with me, to spoon-feed them.Q. What do you mean by spoon-feed them""?A. Spoon-feeding them means playing to their strengths, to help them build confidence. It’s not just my senior executives. It’s everybody. You should know what people want because I know what I want. I know how I like to be treated. And you just take that and say, how do I treat people in the same way?A. I look at my days of playing sports and you apply that to business today — where’s your strong offense, where’s your strong defense, building a team. I was always a part of a team. We huddled, we won, but we also got beaten up sometimes. A lot of times when I’m with my people, I talk about sports and I talk about offense and defense and talk about how we played short-handed.As C.E.O., I look at myself not as chief executive officer, but as chief energy officer, chief cheerleader. I’m a big communicator by telephone and by person. I’m not big on writing the whole staff my holiday observations and where we’re going and what’s the strategy. You’re never going to see me do that. I’m just big into communicating face-to-face, eye-to-eye and not through e-mail. Part of what’s happened today is we lose a sense of communication because everything is done electronically.Q. People may say that sounds great, but there’s just no time to do it face-to-face.A. It comes back to, what are your priorities? Am I doing that for everybody in every place? No. But I live by this philosophy: I juggle 13 balls, and there are certain balls I never drop.Q. What else did you see in your previous corporate jobs that you’re making sure to avoid in your company?A. Within corporate America, I learned that people are put in a box — you are an accountant or you are a marketing person, and basically, you were labeled for life. So I love to take a marketing person and put them in finance, or I’ll take a finance person and put them in marketing. I believe in taking people out of their box, taking them out of their comfort zone and putting them into other areas.Q. What do you do if people say, “That’s not my comfort zone”? How does that conversation go?A. How do you grow in life? Look at the exciting opportunity for you. I love people to move to other parts of the world, just to see how the world works. I try to push people to do other things and see other things.Q. How do you decide if somebody is right for a new box?A. Sometimes it’s just my gut. I have a hole to fill, and this person seems to be right to try it. At the end of the day, what’s the worst situation? They’re not going to take us down; they’re not going to destroy the company. Let’s go do it. And that’s what it comes down to. There is no science. There is no major interviewing process. It’s just I think they have it, and I sell the idea. And that’s kind of what’s fun about what I do. I’m a big believer in the idea that you’ve got to push people. They can get in this comfort zone, and if you don’t push them, they get very comfortable.I don’t believe in organization charts, and we don’t have organization charts. You should know what you have to do. You should know what’s necessary. I can’t tell you the last time I looked at an organization chart within my company.Q. Let’s shift to hiring. Let’s say you’re interviewing me for a senior position. What are you looking for and what questions do you often ask?A. I interview almost every person who comes into the company. I’m not hiring all of them, but the reason I want them to meet me is, if you’re coming to work for us, you should meet the head of the company and believe in the person running the company. But if I were interviewing for a head of finance, I’d ask you a lot about your financial skills and I want to understand your background and what you’ve done in your life and in your career.I’ll sit down and say: Tell me about yourself. Tell me what you’ve done. Tell me what you’ve accomplished. I love it when people tell me about their kids and their family. I don’t care if you’re the smartest marketing person or financial person, but you’ve got to be a human being first. To me their experience is important, but their personality, their experiences really matter.And then I usually have a good gut feel about whether they’re a good person and whether they’re sincere. And I come right out and ask them: Do you believe in what we’re doing? Do you live a healthy lifestyle? Do you believe in natural organic products? Because if you don’t, don’t come work for us.Q. Can you talk more about the intangible qualities you’re looking for?A. I look for people who can grow, who can do more, who can take on more responsibilities.Q. And how do you find that out?A. Are they a risk-taker? Do they want to stay in their box? Do they want to do other things? I also look for people who would want to move, who would want to go abroad, who would want to do that. And we’ll come out and ask them that. I like people who want to make money. I want to hear about schools, where they live, stuff they want to do because they’ve got fire in their belly. I look for that fire in the belly. I look at their eyes and I look for whether they can look me straight in the eye. I can’t stand it if someone’s eyes are moving all over the place and they’re looking down or up. I really look for confident people, secure people.Q. What else do you ask about?A. Whether they played sports. I believe in playing sports. It says a lot about leadership that you went out there, and were part of a team. Or were you involved in school politics? Were you on a student council? Did you ever run for presidency of the council? Did you ever do entrepreneurial stuff before?'"

I felt like they only recruited black players that were Uncle Toms.”Rose admitted that he was jealous of Hill, who had two highly accomplished parents, was staunchly upper middle class and, on top of that, kicked the Fab Five’s collective butts.Hill responded last week with an eloquent letter in The New York Times.My view about the Fab Five, then and now, was that these young men had chosen the right pew but had gone to the wrong church. Seen through the prism of black power and empowerment, and also from the point of view of one who attended a black college, the Fab Five had simply made a wealthy white institution wealthier and had missed a grand opportunity to catapult a historically black college or university to the mountaintop of March Madness.Did Rose have any idea of the impact they would have had on history had they elected to attend a historically black college or university?Yes, the stage would have been smaller, television nonexistent, at first. But the novelty of their act and then the courage of what they represented would have attracted attention. The Fab Five would have been the story of March Madness, not simply a spectacle.Americans love the underdog; we also respect those who stand for principle. What a grand stand that would have been for the Fab Five.This was a rare opportunity, one that may have resonated for generations. Rose, Webber, Howard, King and Jackson could have done something revolutionary.They opted for shortsighted rebellion, though you can argue that you cannot reasonably expect a group of young African-Americans to have the courage, vision and conviction to have made that kind of move.Had they ever thought about the impact such a decision would have made?During an interview several years ago, Webber explained his thought process.“A lot of people put that pressure on me to go to an H.B.C.U., like, ‘Come on, Chris, you can change it around, you can change it around,’ ” Webber said.“But I think that process has to start within the black college association,” Webber said at the time.“Just like me not playing on MTV is not good enough. I want the world to see. I feel guilty because we could have changed that rhyme. But we had to do what was best for us at that time. But we talked a lot about going to black colleges.”The reality is that, by the strict standards of black empowerment, neither Hill nor the Fab Five did the black community any favors.Uncle Tomism, notwithstanding, Hill and the Fab Five both elected, for their own reasons, to play in the big house.'"
"'11-03-20,'0','But comments by unnamed Treasury officials deriding Mr. Barofsky and his work often appeared in news articles after he published his reports. In mid-February, when he announced his retirement, an unidentified Treasury source told The Washington Post that the news was “a nice valentine to us.”Now comes the business of replacing Mr. Barofsky — a decision that President Obama must make. In his resignation letter to Mr. Obama, Mr. Barofsky said that his office’s team, led by its deputy special inspector general, Christy Romero, is “fully prepared to continue advancing” its mission.Mr. Barofsky declined to comment about who might replace him.With 153 continuing investigations covering possible accounting fraud, securities fraud, insider trading, mortgage servicer improprieties, obstruction of justice and other possible misconduct, it could not be more important that the person who takes over continues his vigorous approach. The inspector general’s mission will continue until the last TARP dollar has been repaid and a forceful pursuit of these inquiries sends a powerful message that at least some miscreants are being held accountable. Recently, there was roughly $160 billion outstanding among TARP recipients.Government rules for filling vacancies in executive agencies like Mr. Barofsky’s give Mr. Obama three choices. If the president does nothing, Ms. Romero will take over temporarily as acting head. The president can also name someone who has already been appointed to another executive agency position and has therefore received the Senate’s consent. Finally, Mr. Obama could appoint someone else from within Sigtarp.An administration official would say only that the president would nominate the most qualified person for the post as soon as possible.Behind the scenes, however, a Treasury official is arguing on Capitol Hill that no one from inside Sigtarp be appointed to head the office, according to three people who were briefed on the matter but who are unauthorized to speak publicly about it.That official, Eric Thorson, the inspector general for the Treasury Department, has spoken against an appointment of Ms. Romero or other internal candidates, these people said. He has not yet identified a preferred candidate but appears to be trying to get a blessing from Congress for an outsider to be appointed.A phone message left with Mr. Thorson on Friday was returned by Rich Delmar, counsel to the Treasury inspector general. He said that with respect to Ms. Romero, Mr. Thorson “doesn’t know her and has no opinion on her qualifications for this position.”Unlike Mr. Barofsky, Mr. Thorson — in his role as inspector general of the Treasury — reports to Mr. Geithner. When asked whether higher-ups in the department were directing Mr. Thorson to Steve Adamske, a Treasury spokesman, said no.Senator Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican who has worked to strengthen the independence of agency-appointed inspectors general, has often praised Mr. Barofsky’s approach to oversight.Regarding his replacement, Mr. Grassley said: “The principle of advise and consent is especially important here because TARP has been so controversial and involved hundreds of billions of tax dollars. The Vacancies Act is intended to protect this check on the president’s power and give the people’s branch of government the opportunity to make sure the special inspector general’s office remains independent and effective.”LAST week, Mr. Barofsky testified before the Senate for the last time as special inspector general. His comments were, typically, and refreshingly, straightforward.“For all its help in rescuing the financial system from the brink of collapse, TARP may have left a truly frightening legacy,” he said. “It has increased the potential need for future government bailouts by encouraging the too-big-to-fail financial institutions to become even bigger and more interconnected than before, therefore increasing their ultimate danger to the financial system, while at the same time, Treasury’s mismanagement of TARP and the resulting deep unpopularity of the program have decreased the government’s ability to actually accomplish such bailouts in the future, even if necessary.”Later this spring, Mr. Barofsky will become an adjunct professor at the School of Law at New York University and a senior fellow at its Center on the Administration of Criminal Law. His anonymous critics at the Treasury will probably not miss him, but taxpayers will.'"

"'11-03-20,'0','Currently, she is working with a television producer on a series based on her 2008 book, “Road Trip Guide to the Soul,” which she will pitch this month — with the help of Ms. Taylor — to national outlets like the Oprah Winfrey Network. The show would trail Ms. Nardini with a crew as she engaged pedestrians in a dialogue about relating to their inner selves. Ms. Nardini is unapologetic about seeking material rewards for her spiritual endeavors. “My landlord doesn’t take karma,” she said.Ms. Taylor started YAMA in 2009 after quitting her job in marketing for the apparel company lululemon athletica. Her yoga teacher at the time happened — “cosmically,” she said — to be Schuyler Grant, the owner of the Kula Yoga Project studios in TriBeCa and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and the wife of Jeff Krasno, the co-founder of Wanderlust, a roving festival that combines rock musicians and the rock stars of yoga.Mr. Krasno, who is a co-owner of Velour Music Group, not only helped her expand her roster of connections, Ms. Taylor said, but also to understand the infrastructure of the yoga business and its parallels with the music industry.YAMA rents office space in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, but Ms. Taylor prefers to meet clients (including a reporter) at a local gastro-pub, Watty & Meg, or at other spots in the city. And by living with roommates in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she’s keeping costs down.Ms. Taylor would not reveal her income or the details of her fee structure, but said she invested about $30,000 of her own money in the business. Last year, she said, YAMA arranged more than 100 “gigs” — speaking engagements, workshops, modeling spots — and already has that many on the books for the first quarter of this year.By gathering information about day rates for workshops or private lessons, appearances at festivals or gear contracts with companies like Adidas, she is creating a database of market research that few others have, she said.Another of Ms. Taylor’s clients, Leslie Kaminoff, who founded the Breathing Project, an educational nonprofit organization on West 26th Street, said that even with three decades of experience as a teacher, he was not sure how to value his products and services in the current marketplace. (Ms. Taylor estimates that an “average teacher” giving classes for 10 to 15 hours a week and leading retreats and workshops on weekends might earn about $35,000 in New York.)Mr. Kaminoff said he had been passively fielding requests for appearances generated by a book he co-wrote, “Yoga Anatomy.”   Since developing an online anatomy training series, however, he has been more willing to travel to promote it, even if it means time away from his wife and three sons in Great Barrington, Mass. Ms. Taylor helped him make contacts on a recent trip to Los Angeles, he said.“I have every right to be rewarded for my work,” said Mr. Kaminoff, who recalls his early days making “next to nothing,” waiting for students in an empty studio. “This is not cashing in on work someone else has done.”For now, he is glad to pay Ms. Taylor for her services and believes he is working more efficiently, he said. But as she expands her business, Mr. Kaminoff isn’t so sure he will continue to benefit. “The busier she gets, the less attention she can pay to me,” he said.'"
"'11-03-20,'0','Mr. Collins compared the information gleaned from Facebook with what is overheard when driving children around in the car with their friends. “You become invisible and they have these conversations around you which they would never have if you were sitting and looking at them. Some of it is kind of hairy. Facebook is a little bit like that.”In a recent interview, Dr. Alan Hilfer, chief psychologist at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, who specializes in treating adolescents, said he worried about how parents like Mr. Collins would handle the kind of information that can be gleaned from the updates and pictures teenagers tend to post on Facebook. They might overreact to their children’s online hyperbole, which is part of the reason he is a bit skeptical of the Internet’s role in parent-child relationships. “On Facebook, you know tons of things about people that are kind of bizarre,” he said.When I first spoke with Mr. Collins about this, he said that he thought he was two weeks away from being defriended by his younger daughter, Grace.Indeed, a few weeks later he announced: “Well, it’s happened. She defriended me last week.” He had commented via private message on her membership in a group with a vulgarity in its name. Mr. Collins said he wasn’t upset by his daughter’s decision to join but thought he’d be remiss as a parent if he didn’t say something to her.But Grace told a different story. She reported defriending her father over something fuzzier — literally. “He always posts animals on my Facebook wall,” she said with a very mild look of irritation. “It was weird. I’m 13 and I don’t like furry animals anymore.”Though many fathers have trouble thinking of their daughters as more adult than the little girls they remember, I wondered whether this tendency was exaggerated when the parent is often absent.As a junior in high school I recall feeling similarly frustrated with my father for not knowing that I had given up on my fourth-grade career aspiration years earlier (I had wanted to be a geneticist until I realized I was bad at math). If he had seen my attempts at problem sets in the interim, he never would have made that mistake.Any impression that Facebook would have revolutionized my relationship with my father as a teenager was being quickly dispelled by Ella, Grace and Veronica, Mr. Collins’s stepdaughter, who said that she wasn’t Facebook friends with either of her parents but that she was friends with her stepmother. And Grace said that she also was friends with her stepmother, Mr. Collins’s wife.I was surprised, but Dr. Andrew Cherlin, a professor of sociology and public policy at Johns Hopkins, wasn’t, noting stepparents’ role as “valued insider/outside figures.” “Stepchildren confide in them things they wouldn’t tell their biological parents,” he said, noting that stepparents can fulfill this role “online as well as in person.”While that’s great for the stepparent, what is a noncustodial biological parent to do if phone conversations are awkward and social networking only works until the onset of adolescence? For Mr. Collins, the answer has been an unusual form of video chat — he and his daughters simply leave it on for hours and go about their regular business.“It’s just a window,” he said. “It doesn’t demand a particular kind of communication. It’s terrible to have a phone call when the person isn’t willing to do a kind of back-and-forth with you. But this window allows us to sit and do what parents and adolescents do together, which is almost nothing.”Dr. Cherlin agreed. “Before this electronic media, noncustodial parents had very formalized, appointment-driven communication with their kids,” he said. “Electronic media may help noncustodial parents by informalizing the process of communicating with their children. They become less dependent on schedules and therefore more consistent with an easy, informal flow of information, which may be what teenagers like.”As sanguine as Mr. Collins is about video chat and social media, he still realizes that it’s no substitute for living in the same house with his children. He cited a passage from “Civilization and Its Discontents,” in which Freud laments the intrusion of technology when speaking of his son, who was studying in Paris: “If there had been no railway to conquer distances, my child would never have left his native town and I should need no telephone to hear his voice.”“That’s the great irony,” Mr. Collins said. “Culture has put us in this place where we need things like Facebook and video chat. There’s a contradiction to wrestle with there.”My own wrestling led to the same conclusion Grace eventually had come to. I ignored the request from my father. Unlike the Collinses, my father and I hadn’t been living parallel lives through an open virtual window. Our phone calls had never become less awkward, only less frequent. Though I have many Facebook “friends” who scarcely know me, I decided I didn’t want my father to be one of them.'"

"'11-03-20,'0','It’s not that Hollywood hasn’t made films set in the Islamic world. “The Hurt Locker” even won the Oscar for best picture last year, and “Syriana,” which won George Clooney an Oscar, and “Three Kings,” also featuring Mr. Clooney, along with Brian de Palma’s “Redacted,” also take place in the contemporary Middle East.But in such films the focus is on the Americans characters, whether soldiers, C.I.A. operatives or businessmen, rather than the society itself or the interaction of Americans with local people and their customs. “We see everything through American eyes, without context or a representation of community” on the Islamic side, said Matthew Bernstein, an editor of the book “Visions of the East: Orientalism in Film” and chairman of the film and media studies department at Emory University in Atlanta.Exceptions to this pattern are rare, confined to under-the-radar features like “Amreeka,” a 2009 portrait of a Palestinian family that moves from the West Bank to suburban Chicago, only to encounter prejudice in the aftermath of 9/11 and the Iraq war, and Tom McCarthy’s “Visitor.” In 2009 “The Visitor” earned a best actor Oscar nomination for Richard Jenkins, who played a widowed, depressed college professor who discovers a Syrian immigrant musician and his Senegalese girlfriend living in his Manhattan apartment and develops a friendship with the couple.“Mine was a humanistic approach, as opposed to political or social, and I think that makes a big difference,” said Mr. McCarthy, who traced his interest in the Middle East and its complicated passions to a State Department-sponsored trip he made to Beirut to work with filmmakers there. “The spirit of the Lebanese people was so warm, engaging and verbal that it almost reminded me of my Irish heritage, and that was something I hadn’t seen portrayed in an American film.” But as Mr. McCarthy also noted, his was also a low-budget, character-driven indie film, which gave him the freedom to take his story where he wanted, without having to worry about high-concept pitches, marketing strategies or focus groups. For movies made within the Hollywood studio system for a mass market, the dynamic is very different.“I’m not sure the industry sees a lot of box-office potential in getting these representations right and portraying Muslims or the Islamic religion in a more nuanced and realistic way,” Mr. Bernstein said. “It’s easier to simply represent everyone as fanatical and a threat to America, and easier still not even to go near it, because then you upset a lot fewer people.”European films have been grappling with the Islamic presence on that continent since at least the 1970s, when Rainer Werner Fassbinder made “Ali: Fear Eats the Soul,” the tale of an unlikely romance between an aging German cleaning woman and a young Moroccan immigrant. France in particular has produced a flood of such movies in all kinds of genres, from the recent prison drama “A Prophet,” in which a naïve young North African prisoner learns to outwit Corsican gangsters, to “Angel A,” Luc Besson’s “It’s a Wonderful Life”-like fantasy whose main character is a petty thief of Arab origins.The same phenomenon can be observed in Israel, where the relationship with Islam and the Arab world is both emotionally charged and existential. Two award-winning films directed by Eran Riklis, “The Lemon Tree” and “The Syrian Bride,” portray Arab characters in nuanced and even sympathetic fashion, as does “The Band’s Visit,” a 2007 comedy by Eran Kolirin about a group of Egyptian musicians stranded while on tour in Israel.One explanation sometimes offered for the paucity of American films that engage the Muslim world is that North America, unlike Europe or Israel, is distant from the places where Western and Islamic civilizations converge or collide. In that regard, though, it may be worth noting that of the four foreign-language films dealing with such issues that were nominated for the foreign-language Oscar this year, one (“Incendies”) came from Canada and another (“Biutiful”) from Mexico.In Alejandro González Iñárritu’s “Biutiful,” a Senegalese woman whose husband has been deported from Spain moves into the apartment of the main character, played by Javier Bardem, after his wife has a nervous breakdown, and becomes a mother figure to his two children. “Incendies,” which opens April 22, focuses on a civil war between Christians and Muslims in a country much like Lebanon and its corrosive effect on an Arab refugee family in Montreal.“One of the beauties of cinema is that it can build bridges between cultures, and my film is a tiny bridge,” Denis Villeneuve, the director of “Incendies,” said when asked to explain what pushed him to make the film. “We deeply need communication with the Arab world right now, a dialogue other than war.”Of course other ethnic and racial minority groups, including Hispanics and East Asians, also have long complained about negative stereotypes of them in Hollywood films. So is there a fundamental difference between, to cite two Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicles aimed at a mass audience, the portrayal of Arabs as crazed terrorists in “True Lies” and that of Colombians as crazed narco-guerrillas in “Collateral Damage”? Jack G. Shaheen, the author of “Reel Bad Arabs” and “Guilty: Hollywood’s Verdict on Arabs After 9/11,” said yes.“Other groups are stereotyped, but there they also benefit from contrasting images,” he maintained. “I tell my Italian friends, for example, that I’d like to walk in their sandals. Yes, there is the Mafia thing. But there are also movies in which they are portrayed as funny, warmhearted and kind people. In the case of Arabs and Muslims it’s Johnny-one-note, a continuous bombardment of negative images over and over, with nothing to balance that.”Mr. Shaheen said he dreams of Hollywood releasing an image-changing movie that can be “like ‘Philadelphia’ was for gays and ‘The Defiant Ones’ was for African-Americans,” by offering a more subtle and humane portrait. “All it takes is one breakthrough film or television series.” Jonathan Demme, the director of “Silence of the Lambs” and “Philadelphia,” may be one candidate for such a role. He has bought the rights to Dave Eggers’s book “Zeitoun,” about a Syrian immigrant in New Orleans who was helping neighbors after Hurricane Katrina when he was arrested, and is now developing a script for an animated film version of that story.“I feel it’s important as filmmakers and writers that we be inclusive, and that’s what is great about Dave Eggers’s book, which felt like the first in-depth immersion I’d ever had through literature or film into the Muslim-American family,” Mr. Demme said. “The moral was that they are like people of any other faith, and I hope our film, if we can get it made, will also be like that.”Mr. Demme described the script he is writing as “a work in progress, written on spec,” and expressed confidence that when it is finished, he will be able to find financing, perhaps even from a major studio.“It’s a wonderful, gripping story,” he said, “and we can have a very, very competitive commercial picture that won’t cost an enormous amount,” since animation provides an alternative to expensive re-creations of the hurricane.Or perhaps a breakthrough will come from someone like the French-Algerian director Rachid Bouchareb, who has a pair of Academy Award nominations to his credit, both for films that address aspects of the difficult relationship between France and its former colony Algeria: “Days of Glory” in 2007 and “Outside the Law” this year. His next two films, though, will be shot in the United States, mostly in English, with American and Arab-American actors, and will offer new twists on genre films familiar to American audiences.One, which Mr. Bouchareb said he is scheduled to begin shooting this summer, will be a road movie, somewhat in the vein of “Thelma and Louise,” featuring two women, one of whom is an Arabic belly dancer. The second, which he hopes to start next year, is “about an American cop and a French-Arab policeman who comes to investigate a crime, like in ‘48 Hours.’ ”“For me, all of this is simply a pretext to talk about the relationship between these two peoples, these two cultures,” Mr. Bouchareb said recently, “This is a question that is of interest to me, and has been for a long time, but perhaps American filmmakers are still reluctant to deal with it.”'"

"'11-03-20,'0','The other Pike cars were the minimal Be-1, the snail-shaped S-Cargo van and the sporty Figaro convertible.“They were designed to be polarizing and build a buzz,” Mr. Thompson said. “They are concept cars come to life.”The cars were as cute as Hello Kitty, radiating a cartoonish insouciance that spoke of Japanese confidence before a decade of stasis set in.The cars were based on the Nissan Micra (also sold as the March) and used its 51-horsepower engine.“They were heavily influenced by French design from the 1950’s, but the production techniques were supermodern,” Mr. Thompson said. “They used composite body panels.”But it is more than abstract appreciation that led Mr. Thompson to buy his Pao. “The Pike cars influenced me to become a car designer,” he said.The Pao has its fans, but the most lovable of the Pike cars was probably the Figaro, whose expressive face is worthy of Pixar Studios. Better known was the S-Cargo, a van whose name was a pun on small cargo and escargot. Its rear cargo area, curved like a snail’s shell, was based on the French Citroën 2CV camionette, or small truck.The plain Be-1 looks generic. The Pao, in contrast, seems like a ride for the weekend with its canvas roof and ribbed sides. “The Pao was designed for drives through the countryside, and picnics,” Mr. Thompson said.His Pao is Aqua Grey, one of four colors inspired by 1950s hues. Raised ribs on the hood and doors emphasize the body’s thinness. Mr. Thompson likes this feature, along with the two-part tailgate and the instrument panel that looks like Bakelite.The Pike cars represented the height of postmodernism. Unabashedly retro, they were inspired by French and Italian designs of the ’50s, promiscuously combining elements of the Citroën 2CV, Renault 4, Mini, Fiat 500 and even the East German Trabant into an archetypal car. A decade later, the designer Mark Newson created a concept car for Ford, the 012C, in the same vein.Each type of Pike car was produced in limited numbers, essentially as fashion accessories for hip young Japanese. Today, the Pike cars are appreciated as forerunners of other high-style retro vehicles like the Volkswagen New Beetle, the Mini Cooper and the latest Fiat 500.Although Nissan did not heavily promote the cars — customers had to discover them, like an unmarked club — they exceeded expectations. The company held lotteries for the right to buy one.The designs were credited to Naoki Sakai, although Shoji Takahashi is also often mentioned as the Figaro designer. Mr. Sakai also worked for Olympus around the same time and designed the retro O-Product camera that helped to popularize the brushed aluminum look. Mr. Sakai also helped to design a Toyota version of the Pike cars, called the Will cars.Mr. Thompson noted that this is his second Pao. “The first one I had while living in Japan, but I couldn’t figure out how to bring it home,” he said. “So I left it parked on a small side street in Yokohama. It’s probably still there, collecting tickets.”'"

"'11-03-20,'0','No one ever accused Ernest Hemingway of creating memorable women characters — except perhaps in his posthumously published Paris memoir, “A Moveable Feast,” where he idealizes his first wife, Hadley Richardson, as the alter ego who shared with him the good old days before fame and fortune and another woman wrecked it all.Hadley Richardson now comes into her own, sort of, as the long-suffering wife in Paula McLain’s stylish new novel. Narrated largely from Hadley’s point of view, “The Paris Wife” smoothly chronicles her five-year marriage to the novelist, most of which was spent in Paris among aspiring writers when, as McClain’s Hadley recalls, “we were beautifully blurred and happy.” This is her own movable feast: Paris was fresh, the wine was flowing and “there was only today to throw yourself into without thinking about tomorrow.”Though initially disgusted by the expatriate community, which, as the fictional Hadley remembers, “preened and talked rot and drank themselves sick,” Hemingway was ineluctably drawn into its orbit — and then into the orbit of the rich, who “had better days and freer nights. They brought the sun with them and made the tides move.” No one does this better than chic Pauline Pfeiffer, a wealthy Midwesterner who works for Vogue, wears “a coat made of hundreds of chipmunk skins sewn painfully together” and sets her cap for Ernest. “Keep watch for the girl who will come along and ruin everything,” Hadley warns herself, after the fact.There’s a certain inevitability, then, about what happens in “The Paris Wife.” Based on letters and biographies, and on Hemingway’s own ample recollections of Paris, the novel proceeds by the book — all the books, in fact, about Paris in the 1920s, including those by Hemingway — and thus bumps against the usual expatriate suspects, like Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ezra Pound, who, as Hadley almost apologetically explains, “were or would soon become giants in the field of arts and letters, but we weren’t aware of this at the time.”Livelier and fresher is the reconstruction of Hadley’s youth. The migraine-ridden daughter of a suffrage-minded mother and an alcoholic father who had committed suicide, Hadley is a sheltered young woman from St. Louis who plays Rachmaninoff on the piano while yearning to break free of the staid “Victorian manners keeping everything safe and reliable.” Hemingway is just the ticket. Though eight years her junior, he is an ambitious, proud fledgling journalist intending to be a great writer. “There wasn’t any fear in him that I could see, just intensity and aliveness,” Hadley notes with cloying naïveté. The couple meet in Chicago, soon marry and, on the advice of Sherwood Anderson, bolt the monotonous Midwest for adventure, paid for partially by Hadley’s inheritance, in the City of Light.But the city soon turns gray and rainy. Forlorn whenever Ernest leaves her, Hadley tries to keep him from going to Smyrna to cover the Greco-Turkish war. “I was asking him to choose me over his work,” she acknowledges. His refusal signals the beginning of the end. Two months later, when Ernest is covering the peace conference in Lausanne, Hadley plans to meet him there and, for a surprise, to bring him all his manuscripts, including carbon copies and a novel-in-progress. She packs them into a small suitcase, then somehow manages to lose the bag on the train.'"
"'11-03-20,'0','After Ms. Weese left for the Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle in 2007 — she has since retired — Mr. Seth moved in with Mr. Rasmussen. They soon discovered an artistic connection outside of ballet. “I came to visit,” Ms. Weese said, “and they were like, ‘We’ve been making music.’ I thought, ‘Really? Great.’ ” Her voice was a blend of fear and sarcasm.“But I thought it was amazing,” she continued. “The music is actually sophisticated. Ask uses strings, so it was almost like classical music but not. I loved the orchestrations, the styling. I told Henry that I wanted to take my clothes off and dance.”For Mr. Rasmussen music runs in his veins. His father is the Danish conductor Frans Rasmussen, and he grew up studying piano. (His mother is the former dancer Lise la Cour.) “I have a lot of influence from classical music and obviously from the ballet,” Mr. Rasmussen said. “But I like everything: I don’t let myself get restricted by what’s out there, and I’m not afraid to do something simple.”Mr. Seth said, “And he’s got melodies for days.”While Bangin Sid — from Mr. Rasmussen’s nickname, Sid — may seem like a new venture, there is a secret history. In the late 1990s Ms. Palladino was in the rock band Womoto, which played small clubs and attracted big ballet crowds — so much so that if disaster had struck a Womoto show, most of City Ballet and half of American Ballet Theater would have been wiped out.During the height of Womoto, another band, Muffin Box, was formed by five ballet men: Mr. Seth (drums), Peter Hansen (guitar), Christopher MacDougall (bass), Sébastien Marcovici (vocals) and Benjamin Millepied (djembe drums). While the group never performed publicly, there was one show at a company party. “We all kind of went, ‘Oh my God, this is so funny,’ ” Ms. Weese said. “And then we all went, ‘It’s really not that bad.’ ”At one point Mr. Hansen and Mr. Seth were members of Womoto. “It just kept morphing and morphing,” Ms. Palladino said.There was interest from labels, but nothing came to fruition.While Womoto was a traditional rock band, Bangin Sid, with its blend of electronica and rap, is more of an extension of the loft parties that ballet dancers hosted in the 1990s when Mr. Marcovici or Mr. Millepied, now City Ballet principals, would serve as D.J.’s. Whenever possible Bangin Sid shows will be followed by a dance party; at Crash Mansion, D.J. Tear, Mr. Marcovici’s nom de music, will do the honors. (He has a tear tattoo under his left eye.)The Bangin Sid experience also features dancers, or Sidettes, for which Ms. Weese is reluctantly coming out of retirement, joined by Natasha LaFayette, who danced with the Joffrey Ballet and Hubbard Street Dance Chicago. Instead of point shoes, which Ms. Weese has said she would never put on again, they wear, as she gleefully put it, “full-on stripper patent-leather boots.”In ballet Ms. Weese was a tremendously natural, musical dancer, and judging by a recent rehearsal in a grim Midtown studio, little has changed despite the five-inch heels and trading a pirouette for a hip gyration.“This isn’t what I do,” she said. “But there’s this part of me that does miss performing. I always had another more raw side that I felt like I did not get to express. When I was dancing, a lot of my inspiration came from other styles of music — Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, whatever I was listening to at the time. That’s what fueled me, and that’s the vibe I brought to the stage, even if I was in a tutu.”In choreographing the movements with Ms. LaFayette, Ms. Weese, inspired by Madonna concerts, is rejecting the idea of a backup dancer as wallpaper. She views the show as a mini-performance piece.“Sometimes we are supporting the others, and sometimes we’re in it,” she said. “We wanted that freedom for Michelle and Henry too. It’s a playground, and Natasha and I are moving instruments. That’s how I see my body anyway.” She laughed. “I always did.”'"

"'11-03-21,'1','But comments by unnamed Treasury officials deriding Mr. Barofsky and his work often appeared in news articles after he published his reports. In mid-February, when he announced his retirement, an unidentified Treasury source told The Washington Post that the news was “a nice valentine to us.”Now comes the business of replacing Mr. Barofsky — a decision that President Obama must make. In his resignation letter to Mr. Obama, Mr. Barofsky said that his office’s team, led by its deputy special inspector general, Christy Romero, is “fully prepared to continue advancing” its mission.Mr. Barofsky declined to comment about who might replace him.With 153 continuing investigations covering possible accounting fraud, securities fraud, insider trading, mortgage servicer improprieties, obstruction of justice and other possible misconduct, it could not be more important that the person who takes over continues his vigorous approach. The inspector general’s mission will continue until the last TARP dollar has been repaid and a forceful pursuit of these inquiries sends a powerful message that at least some miscreants are being held accountable. Recently, there was roughly $160 billion outstanding among TARP recipients.Government rules for filling vacancies in executive agencies like Mr. Barofsky’s give Mr. Obama three choices. If the president does nothing, Ms. Romero will take over temporarily as acting head. The president can also name someone who has already been appointed to another executive agency position and has therefore received the Senate’s consent. Finally, Mr. Obama could appoint someone else from within Sigtarp.An administration official would say only that the president would nominate the most qualified person for the post as soon as possible.Behind the scenes, however, a Treasury official is arguing on Capitol Hill that no one from inside Sigtarp be appointed to head the office, according to three people who were briefed on the matter but who are unauthorized to speak publicly about it.That official, Eric Thorson, the inspector general for the Treasury Department, has spoken against an appointment of Ms. Romero or other internal candidates, these people said. He has not yet identified a preferred candidate but appears to be trying to get a blessing from Congress for an outsider to be appointed.A phone message left with Mr. Thorson on Friday was returned by Rich Delmar, counsel to the Treasury inspector general. He said that with respect to Ms. Romero, Mr. Thorson “doesn’t know her and has no opinion on her qualifications for this position.”Unlike Mr. Barofsky, Mr. Thorson — in his role as inspector general of the Treasury — reports to Mr. Geithner. When asked whether higher-ups in the department were directing Mr. Thorson to Steve Adamske, a Treasury spokesman, said no.Senator Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican who has worked to strengthen the independence of agency-appointed inspectors general, has often praised Mr. Barofsky’s approach to oversight.Regarding his replacement, Mr. Grassley said: “The principle of advise and consent is especially important here because TARP has been so controversial and involved hundreds of billions of tax dollars. The Vacancies Act is intended to protect this check on the president’s power and give the people’s branch of government the opportunity to make sure the special inspector general’s office remains independent and effective.”LAST week, Mr. Barofsky testified before the Senate for the last time as special inspector general. His comments were, typically, and refreshingly, straightforward.“For all its help in rescuing the financial system from the brink of collapse, TARP may have left a truly frightening legacy,” he said. “It has increased the potential need for future government bailouts by encouraging the too-big-to-fail financial institutions to become even bigger and more interconnected than before, therefore increasing their ultimate danger to the financial system, while at the same time, Treasury’s mismanagement of TARP and the resulting deep unpopularity of the program have decreased the government’s ability to actually accomplish such bailouts in the future, even if necessary.”Later this spring, Mr. Barofsky will become an adjunct professor at the School of Law at New York University and a senior fellow at its Center on the Administration of Criminal Law. His anonymous critics at the Treasury will probably not miss him, but taxpayers will.'"
"'11-03-21,'1','The Tokyo Electric Power Company built its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, nearly 40 years ago, to withstand a powerful earthquake — but not one as big as the 9.0-magnitude quake that struck on March 11. Or the tsunami that followed. Now, the terrible “ifs” accumulate, as Japanese engineers work to bring the station’s reactors under control. The ultimate price, in human life, may not be known for years.The details of this catastrophe were unforeseeable, leading some to conclude this was a black swan event — something so wildly unexpected, so enormous in its impact, that it seems to defy our understanding and expose the fragility of our knowledge of the world. How could anyone have predicted this?And yet in 2007, Tokyo Electric Power, or Tepco, escaped a disaster at its huge Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power station, on the opposite side of Japan, when that plant was damaged by a 6.8-magnitude earthquake — three times as large as what the plant was designed to withstand. Tepco basically lucked out last time.So perhaps a bigger question is whether the markets — in which we have come to place so much trust — can put a true price on outsize risks like this.Many have compared the events unfolding in Japan with 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, the financial collapse of 2008 and 2009, the BP oil spill, and the uprisings in the Arab world — in that all have shown the limits of the collective wisdom of the marketplace. For a moment, all the swans seemed black. And those swans seemed blacker still when viewed through the lens of today’s hyperkinetic global markets.“There are an amazing number of crosscurrents in the world economy right now, more than I’ve seen in 25 years,” said Shawn Reynolds, a co-portfolio manager at Van Eck Associates in New York.Like everyone else, corporate executives, economists and financial analysts in Tokyo, New York, London and beyond struggled last week to wrap their heads around the scale of this disaster. But, as they so often do, the analysts quickly fell to work assessing the implications for companies, markets and economies. At times, it was almost surreal: On Tuesday, Laszlo Birinyi, a prominent stock market analyst based in Westport, Conn., e-mailed around a succinct report titled “Nuclear Meltdowns at a Glance.”This is what happens on Wall Street. If you’re not immersed in the culture, it might be hard to understand the cool calculus that is applied to world events, however dire those events might be. After the quake hit on March 11, the CNBC anchor Larry Kudlow told viewers, “The human toll here looks to be much worse than the economic toll, and we can be grateful for that.” He later apologized.As the week wore on, and prices were gyrating on everything from a share of I.B.M. to a ton of copper, everyone was making back-of-the-envelope calculations. There is still no clear consensus about how far the economic shocks will reverberate. Many analysts are guessing — and then second-guessing — how the disaster will play out in northeast Japan. The first, tentative analysis seemed painfully obvious: the Japanese economy, already weak, perhaps already in a recession before calamity struck, will become even weaker.On Friday, the Group of 7 industrialized nations took the rare step of intervening on the world’s foreign exchange markets to stem a sudden rise in the value of the yen. The currency had soared all week against the dollar — the exact opposite of what you might expect. But Japanese companies and investors were bringing their money home, to pay for huge rebuilding costs.After its most harrowing week since the 1987 market crash, the Tokyo Stock Exchange found its footing on Friday. But it was a week like few others on the exchange: the Nikkei 225 stock index, Japan’s equivalent of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 6.2 percent on Monday, plunged 10.5 percent on Tuesday, rebounded 5.7 percent on Wednesday and sank 1.4 percent on Thursday. It closed up 2.7 percent on Friday, at 9,206.75.The loss for the week totaled 1,048 points, or 10.2 percent.IF you happen to visit a Wall Street trading floor, walk over to the nearest Bloomberg terminal, type “WRST” and hit the green key that says “go.”WRST — that is short for “worst,” as in, “worst-case scenario.” The program enables Wall Street types to measure the level of risk in their investment portfolios under a variety of scary circumstances modeled on past crises, including the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the bankruptcy of WorldCom in 2002 and the devaluation of the Thailand’s currency, the baht, in 1997.Such “what if” scripts are the stuff of modern Wall Street. Everyone runs them. Entire schools of financial analysis are devoted to examining historical market patterns in the belief that those patterns can predict the future.Such analysis, of course, depends on — and perhaps even encourages — our belief that tomorrow will be much like today. And all that despite the fine-print caveat on your 401(k) statement that reads, “Past performance is no guarantee of future success.”'"

"'11-03-21,'1','“It’s like any athletic event: technique and form are key,” said Danny Taylor, chairman of the mining engineering department at the University of Nevada, Reno, which hosted this year’s games. “Your best golfers are not guys who hit the ball the hardest; they’re the ones who hit the ball hard with the right form. It’s the same thing with shoveling dirt or swinging that four-pound hammer.”And while few original Gold Rush miners were women, the action in Reno was not limited to men. Take the fierce women’s team from the Missouri University of Science and Technology, who sport neon-green hard hats and are and are led by Catherine Walker, a former high school wrestler who sees the competition as a chance to strike a blow for equality.“I like doing the same activity as the boys do,” said Ms. Walker, 24 and a senior. “Most people would never see a woman jack-legging.” And they did it well, winning the women’s division.Considering the sharp instruments and heavy materials used, judges have to keep a sharp eye on proceedings. Hard hats are mandatory, and violations of safety rules can disqualify you.With all the hammers and sledges flying, smashed fingers a constant worry, as are ripped jeans and other hazards.“I think I swallowed a rock,” said Ms. Walker, after loading a ore cart as part of the mucking competition, in which teams load and unload dirt into an ore core and run it down a 75-foot stretch of rail.Teams have their own looks — and specialties. The University of Nevada, Reno has long dominated in the muck. “We should be winning this every year,” said Mr. Taylor, a bit disappointedly. “We haven’t always but we should be.”The squad from the Western Australian School of Mining in Kalgoolie — the defending men’s champions — were decked out in sleek black windbreakers and sunglasses, and oozed confidence, and have a reputation as perhaps a touch too intense.“I don’t want to sound arrogant,” said Campbell Haines, a returning competitor, “but I think we’ve got a good chance of repeating.” And so they did.The team from Montana Tech, meanwhile, took a more military approach, donning Army green T-shirts and camouflage pants and enlisting ringers like Katherine Berry, a 19-year old who was unafraid to plunge her hands into a tank of frigid water for the gold panning competition.“I’m from Butte, Mont.,” said Ms. Berry. “That was barely touching my permafrost.”The events are outside, and often simulate the back-breaking conditions suffered by the old-timers all along the Sierra Nevada. And sure enough, Friday’s event went on despite a howling wind and temperatures near freezing. On Saturday it snowed.Most of the teams come from mining-proud states like Kentucky, Montana, and Nevada, which is the nation’s largest producer of gold, and several have year-round training and practice facilities. Most teams practice daily leading up to the event.“We practice all year for one competition,” said Mr. Strickland. “We’re idiots.”While most of the mining methods have long gone out of fashion, they are still useful to know, said several professionals in the mining industry, who come to the competition to act as judges — and scout for talent.“I’ve absolutely hired people I’ve met here,” said Richard Perry, a geologist who was judging the surveying event, which tends to attract a quieter, cerebral types (think Jeter, not A-Rod). “I’m looking for people who know how to work as a team,” Mr. Perry said.Indeed, many of the students, who organize the competitions themselves, said that the events also acted as a chance to network. “As much as this is a competition, these are the people we’re going to be working with,” said Ms. Walker. Like many of the seniors here — and unlike many other graduates — Ms. Walker has a job promised to her when she leaves school.That is in part because of a recent increase in demand for engineers after years of declining numbers of mining programs and students, said Mr. Taylor. The surge in the price of gold has also helped, with two mines recently reopening across the border in California.That said, some of the students here could also go pro. Mining events date back as far as mining, and professional mining competitions are periodically held in several Western states, including the World Championships of hand-drilling contested every fall in Carson City, Nev., the state capital. (Pros, of course, drill into granite, which is even harder than wimpy old concrete.)But on Friday, concrete seemed plenty hard to those young men and women competing in the handsteel, as they repeatedly slammed their hammers atop the chisel, boring into a three-foot tall concrete block. Teammates and spectators cheered — “Big hit! Big hit!” — as the sound of metal on metal echoed around the event’s arena, an old construction site just outside the university’s stadium.The team captain, Mr. Strickland is also the anchor of Virginia Tech’s five person co-ed team, and showed why, speedily pounding the chisel bit with dozens of blows per minute. When time expired — each hand-steeler gets two minutes — Mr. Stickland’s face was red and his sunglasses specked with bits of concrete.“My arms feel like jelly,” he said. “I need a steak.”'"
"'11-03-21,'1','Four plants operated by Toyota subsidiaries, two of which build models for Toyota dealers in North America, were closer to the epicenter and more directly affected. They remain idle.Company officials said that Toyota planned to resume building parts for overseas factories on Monday. A Toyota spokesman in New York, Javier Moreno, said the company was still evaluating its supply chain in Japan but that production of replacement parts was “going well.”Nissan said it planned to resume making parts for overseas production and for repairs at the Japanese factories on Tuesday. Vehicle assembly is scheduled to resume Thursday.The plants build several models for the Infiniti brand, as well as the Nissan Rogue, Murano, 370Z and GT-R.But company officials warned that a plant that builds the engines for many of its vehicles would remain down indefinitely. Nissan asked employees at the engine plant, in Iwaki, a city near the disabled Fukushima nuclear reactor, to spend their down time volunteering in community restoration efforts.“With aftershocks still heavily impacting the region and infrastructure reestablishment still continuing, restoration is expected to take longer than the other plants,” Nissan said in a statement from its headquarters in Yokohama.Meanwhile, in Detroit, the chief executive of General Motors has told employees worldwide to curtail nonessential spending and travel while the company assesses the disaster’s effects on operations. The executive, Daniel F. Akerson, notified workers of the temporary cut by e-mail, a company spokesman, Klaus-Peter Martin, confirmed.Mr. Martin also said that G.M. would halt production Monday at a plant in Zaragoza, Spain, and cancel two shifts Monday and Tuesday in Eisenach, Germany, because of a shortage of parts made in Japan. The plants build models for G.M.’s Opel brand in Europe.G.M. previously said it would shut a pickup truck plant in Shreveport, La., for at least a week starting Monday. The company is sending parts that would have gone to that plant elsewhere so it can continue building more popular models.While the crises have hobbled Japan’s economy in the short term, and the cost of rebuilding is expected to soar into the hundreds of billions of dollars, the World Bank said in a report to be released Monday that it expected only a temporary setback for economic growth in East Asia.The bank said growth would begin to pick up in the second half of this year, as Japan’s rebuilding effort got fully under way. Japan’s experience “suggests an accelerated reconstruction effort, and the short term impact on the economies of developing East Asia is likely to be limited,” it said.The bank said the report had been completed before the earthquake, but was revised to account for the likely impact of the quake and its aftermath.“Clearly given Japan’s importance in East Asia, the tragic events unfolding will be felt in the region,” Vikram Nehru, World Bank chief economist for the East Asia and Pacific region, said in the report.“At this stage, we expect the economic impact of this disaster on the East Asian region to be fairly short-lived,” Mr. Nehru said. “In the immediate future the biggest impact will be in terms of trade and finance. We expect growth in Japan will pick up as reconstruction efforts accelerate.”'"
"'11-03-21,'1','The bodies of 45 patients were discovered at Memorial Medical Center after the August 2005 storm, far more than at any other hospital, and some doctors subsequently acknowledged that they had injected patients with drugs to hasten their deaths. No criminal charges were brought. Last year, a relative of a patient who died filed a civil claim of euthanasia against a Memorial doctor. It was dismissed and is on appeal.Staff members at Memorial said they did their best in the face of inhuman conditions.“The doctors didn’t create that environment. The hospital created that environment,” said Joseph M. Bruno, one of the lead lawyers for the class-action plaintiffs. He said no physicians had opted out of the class and some might testify at the trial in New Orleans.The hospital and Tenet deny the allegations.“We are confident that in the end, the evidence will show that Memorial Medical Center and its staff and physicians acted heroically in the face of such a tragic situation,” Rick Black, Tenet’s director of communications, said in a statement.Lawyers for Tenet and Memorial have lined up experts to testify that the city’s failed levees, a chaotic government response and the huge hurricane are what created the deadly environment. Plaintiffs’ lawyers have moved to exclude all such evidence from consideration, arguing that it is irrelevant to the duty the hospital had to its patients.One issue almost certain to figure in the trial is the extent to which executives at Memorial and other hospitals understood the possible dangers of flooding. It has been previously reported that Memorial did not act on a 2004 recommendation to move components of its electrical system above the ground floor. New documents raise questions about whether design, maintenance or other factors led to the total failure of backup power after the floodwaters rose.Even before all power was lost, Memorial’s air-conditioning shut down, by design. American hospitals are required to maintain emergency power systems, but they do not have to support air-conditioning or heating.According to employees, temperatures inside Memorial soon rose to over 100 degrees, threatening older patients in particular. Among them was 70-year-old Leon Preston, an amputee who died at Memorial and whose family’s case is part of the lawsuit.Memorial’s hurricane plan assumed that backup power would function for at least three days, but the system failed in less than two.At least some hospital employees were aware that the system would be at risk in a flood. Memorial’s director of plant operations learned from the Army Corps of Engineers in 2004 that the hospital could be surrounded by 12 to 15 feet of water after a major hurricane. The director, Eric Yancovich, who also served as safety officer, recommended raising basement and ground-level emergency power transfer switches and the pumps that supplied most of the hospital with medical air and vacuum suction — needed by patients with respiratory problems.A partial bid for the electrical work came to more than a quarter of a million dollars. “Due to the lack of capital, I don’t anticipate anything being approved right now,” Mr. Yancovich concluded in a memo to his supervisor. “I’ll keep it on file for future consideration.”Given these vulnerabilities, the hospital should have warned patients and visitors away before the hurricane, according to Mr. Bruno, the plaintiffs’ lawyer. “Fundamentally, they could have told their patients: ‘It’s not safe for you. Go.’ ”The mayor’s pre-storm evacuation order specifically exempted hospitals, even though a 2002 poll by the city’s health director revealed deficiencies in generators and evacuation plans for flooding. Hospital evacuations are costly and risky, and hurricanes often change course. According to the minutes of a statewide hospital emergency conference call held the day before landfall, nearly all hospitals had either generators, electrical switches or both at ground level, yet they chose not to evacuate.An expert hired by the plaintiffs, Jerry Watts, concluded that the floodwaters shorted out Memorial’s electrical transfer switches and many distribution panels, much as the plant operations director had predicted. However, Gregory Gehrt of ccrd Partners, an expert hired by Tenet, attributed the power shutdown to mechanical problems in the hospital’s three 750-kilowatt diesel generators, which were located well above the water.Codes and standards require only that potential for flooding be given “careful consideration” in electrical-system design. Hospital generators must be tested monthly, but for short periods, unlike what would be needed in a major disaster.A central question likely to be raised at trial is why Tenet did not try to hire private helicopters immediately after Ms. Cordray’s call for help. A vice president of the Federation of American Hospitals also appealed to Tenet for medevac resources that day, saying that Senator Mary Landrieu’s office was “begging us to help them fill in emergency rescue gaps in Louisiana.”Tenet officials have said publicly that they did not hire private helicopters until the following day, after emergency officials told them that Memorial was low on the state’s evacuation priority list and that they would need to use private resources to get patients out quickly. Before that, they said, emergency officials told Tenet that Federal Emergency Management Agency and National Guard troops were coordinating hospital evacuations, and that it would not be possible to get into the city.Tenet corporate headquarters did not have an emergency command system in place and established one as the disaster unfolded. Company officials lobbied hard to get federal rescuers to prioritize Memorial, warning that dozens of patients were in danger of dying. Ultimately, the company spent more than $1 million on airplanes, buses, ambulances and security personnel to support its six hospitals in the region, a portion of which was later recovered from insurance.Tenet Healthcare Corporation has since sold Memorial and its other Louisiana hospitals. Tenet bills itself as one of the largest publicly owned health care companies in the country, listing operating revenues of $9.2 billion in 2010. Tenet’s 49 hospitals in 11 states counted more than a half-million admissions that year, and its outpatient centers treated nearly four million. Tenet’s corporate structure includes more than 400 subsidiaries.Claims were also made against Lifecare, a separate health care company that leased space at Memorial to operate a long-term acute-care hospital, many of whose patients died awaiting evacuation. It reached confidential settlements with all but one plaintiff and is not a defendant in the class-action suit.'"
"'11-03-21,'1','There have also been reports that Google has set aside $100 million for incentives for well-known celebrities to program their own “channels” on YouTube to increase the amount of high-profile content on the platform. And the media initiatives are not entirely new: ’s Channel 4 signed a three-year deal back in 2009 to make entire programs available for streaming on YouTube.“There is no doubt in my mind they are becoming a media company,” said Mike Vorhaus, the president of the media consulting firm Magid Advisors. “They are providing content to consumers and selling ads against it — sounds like a media company to me.”So what, you might ask. What difference does it make what occupation Google writes down on its driver’s license?For starters, being in the media business means looking at media a little differently. Google has been spending a lot of time and some significant money trying to help traditional media businesses stay in business, in part because Google does not want its search engines to crawl across a wasteland of machine-generated info-spam and amateur content with limited allure.With that objective in mind, the company has also tweaked its vaunted search algorithm to point toward new, real, trusted content and away from link-bait generic content cranked out by so-called content farms. Even if it is a machine doing the executing, the company’s push for one kind of link over another is fundamentally an editorial exercise.In essence, Google, which has cracked the code on the Web advertising model, has come to realize that if content becomes just a commodity, then advertising will follow suit. “Google depends on the high-quality content created by wonderful Web sites around the world, and we do have a responsibility to encourage a healthy Web ecosystem,” the company said, sounding more like the pronouncement of a media executive than a statement from a tech company.Jonathan Glick, chief executive of Sulia, a media company that filters and publishes real-time content from , said that Google is in a new land.“They are moving down a road where they are now thinking of the motivation of people who produce content in addition to the content itself,” he said.When big companies bump into a ceiling in an area they have dominated, they tend to shift into new pursuits that may help their core business. RCA commercialized a spectacular invention called radio, but by the mid-1920s the company realized its new wonder needed great content, so it bought and merged several radio stations to form a media company called . Later, RCA did the same trick with another catchy invention: television.As content bolts across both platforms and technology, doing taxonomy on media and technology companies is more complicated than it used to be. is spending an enormous amount of effort to enroll media companies in its subscription plan for the . I was on the phone with a very senior official at Apple a few weeks ago for half an hour, and we talked about new subscription models, the prospects for newspapers, and the pros and cons of various media apps. The new iPad that was about to be unveiled hardly came up.may be in the business of dishing up movies and television programming, but the company triumphed through technology, pivoting over the course of a few short years from being the biggest user of the postal service to the largest source of broadband traffic. And Netflix is not satisfied to just negotiate access to content produced by others: Last week, Netflix announced that it had obtained the rights to an original television series starring and directed by .Other than Apple’s — who seems to have a knack for the content business, if Pixar is any indication — this is unfamiliar and foreboding territory for technology companies. Making content is kind of a software business, but a very unruly one known for fickle talent and fickle audiences.The story of the last decade or so has been a huge shift in value from the media companies, which produced the content, to Silicon Valley, where companies like Google and Netflix came up with newer, more convenient and far less lucrative — at least for the media companies — ways to distribute it.Before Google gets in too deep, the company may want to compare its valuation over the past decade with that of, say, Time Warner or just about any newspaper company in the country.“We are in the business of media distribution, but I don’t think that we would be very good at media creation,” Hal Varian, chief economist at Google, said in a phone call.“I think it’s one thing that we have astutely avoided in the last 12 years,” he said, adding, “the media business is a tough business.”Tell me about it.'"
"'11-03-21,'1','But it does create another arena for the he-said, he-said debate that has erupted around almost every facet of the players’ relationship with owners.“Kevin Mawae can have his own opinion,” said Robert Batterman, an outside counsel to the N.F.L. “But the decision about whether the union has effectively decertified is not a decision for Kevin Mawae. It’s a decision for the N.L.R.B.”Jeffrey Kessler, the players’ outside counsel, said about the N.L.R.B.’s role: “It’s really not all that relevant. Putting aside the fact that the complaint had absolutely no merit when there was a union, the remedy for that claim if it were true is an order for the union to bargain in good faith. Well, there’s no more union.”The general counsel’s goal: to determine whether there is enough evidence to merit issuing a complaint, which equates to an indictment in the criminal court system. Observers of the N.L.R.B. consistently note the deliberate — read: slow — pace of its investigations as the general counsel tries to talk to people on both sides of the charge and obtain documents to support what they say.George Cohen, the federal mediator who had led negotiations between the owners and the union, will not be interviewed.The case is a priority for the N.L.R.B., but it is also unusual because of language in the old collective bargaining agreement in which the owners said they would not raise the issue of a sham decertification in connection with disputes over labor exemption issues, language the owners will contend does not apply to N.L.R.B. proceedings, only to antitrust matters.The N.F.L. filed its charge Feb. 14, and some people say it could take 45 to 60 days just to decide if a complaint is merited. In 2010, the median time from when a charge was filed to when a complaint was issued was 101 days, according to the N.L.R.B.The players will undoubtedly point to how many times the two sides met at the negotiating table as evidence that they were engaged in real bargaining.The owners will point to the union’s own history, in which it has decertified and reformed, as proof that the recent decertification is not legitimate. And they will try to prove that the players engaged in what is referred to as surface bargaining, by questioning whether the union moved on any points in the negotiation — a rookie salary maximum or an 18-game regular season, for instance.The idea for owners is to demonstrate that while the union showed up, it had no intention of moving toward a deal.That, say several observers of the N.L.R.B., is not an easy case to prove. The overwhelming number of charges never make it to the complaint stage because they are withdrawn, settled or the general counsel dismisses them.If the general counsel does not find enough evidence to issue a complaint, the owners’ charge would essentially die with no appeals process.If the general counsel does issue a complaint, it triggers a hearing before an administrative law judge, and perhaps a request by the N.L.R.B. for an injunction to stop the antitrust case while the N.L.R.B. makes its decision .“It’s a cutting edge issue; there’s an awful lot the general counsel is going to have to look at,” said Prof. William Gould of Stanford Law School, a former chairman of the N.L.R.B.The owners faced a “real challenge,” Gould said, but it was not insurmountable. “If they got the general counsel to issue a complaint, then I think it is quite likely the board would go into federal District Court and try to enjoin the antitrust proceedings, which the board would maintain would interfere with their jurisdiction.”If the general counsel agrees with owners, the case could take months or even years before there is a final decision from the N.L.R.B. In the meantime, the players’ antitrust suit against the league, Tom Brady v. N.F.L., will continue, the parallel cases perhaps producing the only action in football this year.'"

"'11-03-22,'0','As the loss settled in, Anthony watched from the bench and attended to his eye. “It just got out of our hands a couple plays down the stretch,” he said.Anthony scored a team-high 22 points but had only 5 in the second half. Amar’e Stoudemire added 16. Neither Anthony nor Stoudemire had a field goal in the fourth quarter.“We have to keep playing the way that we play to get the lead,” Stoudemire said. “We can’t all of a sudden change our method in the fourth quarter or the second half.”D’Antoni said: “I’m getting to a point where we got to figure something out, because it’s not real good right now, obviously. And there’s no reason why we can’t figure it out. We got two scorers on the floor like Amar’e and Carmelo, then we got to do a little bit better job.”With 12 games remaining, the possibility of a Knicks-Celtics playoff pairing is real. It will be an abbreviated first round if the Knicks and Anthony do not quickly adapt to one another.If the teams meet again, both will have added motivation. Jared Jeffries glanced Ray Allen with an elbow in the third quarter, leaving Allen with a cut above his right eye while his mother, Flora Allen-Hopson, watched from a courtside seat next to Spike Lee.Earlier in the game, Anthony grabbed a rebound and struck Davis with an elbow that left Davis momentarily dazed.“It was a bloodbath, but it was beautiful,” Celtics Coach Doc Rivers said. Allen’s cut added to his frustrating night. He shot abnormally poor: 5 of 16. Pierce was limited by foul trouble but still managed 21 points, including a key shot with 55 seconds left.After Pierce’s shot, Toney Douglas missed two 3-pointers and Shawne Williams missed one.An earlier Pierce 3-pointer, Boston’s first, brought the Celtics to 4 points behind, at 82-76, with 6 minutes 45 seconds left. The shot came shortly after Chauncey Billups converted a 4-point play, created when Rondo fouled him as he made a 3-pointer, to give the Knicks a 9-point lead.Garnett tied the score, 82-82, on a layup, and Boston (50-19) did not trail again.The Knicks returned home after dreadful losses to Detroit and Milwaukee. Anthony performed better Sunday against the Bucks after sulking during a poor performance against the Pistons.Against Boston, Anthony started efficiently and made quick decisions. He scored 7 points before he picked up his second foul and sat the rest of the quarter. In a display of their erratic play, the Knicks scored 9 points — their total in the first quarter against Milwaukee — in the first 3:27 against the Celtics.The Knicks opened the second quarter with a 14-4 run. Ronny Turiaf supplied energy with two baskets, and Anthony picked up where he left off. He finished the first half with 17 points.Anthony indicated Sunday that it could take until next season before the Knicks blossomed into a quality team. The Knicks’ president, Donnie Walsh, disputed that notion.“Yeah, I don’t want to hear that,” Walsh said of Anthony’s statement. “I understand what he’s saying, because you put it in the context of really good teams are together for a long time. We’re trying to compete against some teams that have been together for a long time. That’s like an uphill fight sometimes.”'"

"'11-03-22,'0','The foundation’s organizers also say the new technologies will offer ways to improve computer security and could possibly enhance individual privacy within the e-commerce and social networking markets. Those markets are the fastest-growing uses for computing and network resources.While the new capabilities could be crucial to network engineers, for business users and consumers the changes might be no more noticeable than advances in plumbing, heating and air-conditioning. Everything might work better, but most users would probably not know — or care — why or how.The members of the Open Networking Foundation will include Broadcom, Brocade, Ciena, Cisco, Citrix, Dell, Deutsche Telekom, Ericsson, Facebook, Force10, Google, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Juniper, Marvell, Microsoft, NEC, Netgear, NTT, Riverbed Technology, Verizon, VMWare and Yahoo.“This answers a question that the entire industry has had, and that is how do you provide owners and operators of large networks with the flexibility of control that they want in a standardized fashion,” said Nick McKeown, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at Stanford, where his and colleagues’ work forms part of the technical underpinnings, called OpenFlow.The effort is a departure from the traditional way the Internet works. As designed by military and academic experts in the 1960s, the Internet has been based on interconnected computers that send and receive packets of data, paying little heed to the content and making few distinctions among the various types of senders and receivers of information.The intelligence in the original Internet was meant to reside largely at the end points of the network — the computers — while the specialized routing computers were relatively dumb post offices of various size, mainly confined to reading addresses and transferring packets of data to adjacent systems.But these days, when cloud computing means a lot of the information is stored and processed on computers out on the network, there is growing need for more intelligent control systems to orchestrate the behavior of thousands of routing machines. It will make it possible, for example, for managers of large networks to program their network to prioritize certain types of data, perhaps to ensure quality of service or to add security to certain portions of a network.The designers argue that because OpenFlow should open up hardware and software systems that control the flow of Internet data packets, systems that have been closed and proprietary, it will cause a new round of innovation focused principally upon the vast computing systems known as cloud computers.”This is a pragmatic solution,” said David Farber, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon who was one of the pioneers of data networking technology.“The idea of moving intelligence to the end points of the network was one of the original design points of the Internet,” Mr. Farber said. But he noted that as the network evolved to offer sophisticated advanced services through centralized cloud computers, including the delivery of digital voice and video, it became less feasible to continue relying on decentralized network design.Mr. Farber noted that there have been other research projects aimed at redesigning the Internet. For example, the National Science Foundation, in addition to supporting the OpenFlow initiative, has financed the Global Environment for Network Innovations, or GENI. Open Flow appears to have generated broad industry support, he said, but it must still prove itself in the market.A number of networking companies, including Cisco, Hewlett-Packard and Juniper, have already produced prototype systems that support OpenFlow technology. Morever, at least one Silicon Valley start-up, Nicira Networks, is now testing OpenFlow products that are meant to enter the cloud computing market later this year.“If you look at really big companies like Google and Amazon, they take really smart programmers and give them a problem like search or automating storage and then turn the crank and out pops a great system,” said Martin Casado, Nicira’s chief technologist and one of the members of the OpenFlow research project at Stanford.But Mr. Casado noted that in the past the one part of the system that could not be programmed was the network. “This customizes the network to the applications that are actually being run.”'"
"'11-03-22,'0','SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) — California did not adequately consider alternatives to its plan to create a cap-and-trade market for carbon emissions, a judge ruled on Monday, a setback for the most aggressive effort by a state to combat climate change.The state’s regulator on climate change matters, the Air Resources Board, will need to consider other possibilities to meet state environmental law, said Judge Ernest Goldsmith of San Francisco Superior Court.“A.R.B. seeks to create a fait accompli by premature establishment of a cap-and-trade program before alternatives can be exposed to public comment and properly evaluated by A.R.B. itself,” Judge Goldsmith ruled.The plaintiffs in the case, the Association of Irritated Residents, had challenged the plan, arguing that it would inadvertently increase air pollution in some pockets of the state.The Air Resources Board said it would appeal. Carbon trade was set to start in California in 2012.The judge directed the plaintiffs to draft a formal order, or writ of mandate.“This ruling will compel A.R.B. to fully consider those of us most affected by its decisions, and not just move forward in its haste to make major polluters happy,” the group’s president, Tom Frantz, said in a statement.'"
"'11-03-22,'0','One hallmark of preparedness is the ability of a company to use technology to know where its people are, which can be a huge hurdle in some countries. But Tim Daniel, executive vice president of International SOS, said, “The ability to use text messaging or e-mail to reach travelers, except in the most heavily affected areas, has definitely made this job easier.”Last year, about 8.6 million foreigners visited Japan, including 727,200 Americans, the Japan National Tourism Organization said. How many business travelers were in Japan when the earthquake struck, or how many remain there, is not known, but “it is a very significant number,” Mr. Daniel said.During a Web seminar last week that involved more than 600 International SOS clients, almost two-thirds said their biggest challenge in Japan was getting reliable, timely information.While not many foreign travelers were in the immediate area of the tsunami, or in the evacuation zone near the damaged nuclear complex, concern about potential disruptions and possible radiation effects grew among travelers in Tokyo and other business centers. Back home, companies struggled to assess conditions for traveling employees.“We’re getting calls from a lot of corporations asking us what the benchmark is, what everybody else is doing,” Dr. Quigley said. “Our job is to give them enough information so they can make informed decisions. We have some companies that completely evacuated Japan, others that evacuated just the nonessential folks and other companies that are staying put.”Concern also is widespread among the many business travelers who do not stay in Japan, but stop there for hours on connecting international flights. “Narita is a very important transit hub,” Mr. Daniel said of Narita International Airport. “For every traveler who gets off a plane at Narita and goes into Tokyo, my guess is there are about another five that end up spending time in that airport on their way to other destinations in Asia, and we’ve been fielding calls from travelers and companies worried about potential effects of radiation” he said.Travelers have also been asking how vulnerable they may be to disruption or danger if the situation in Japan worsens, he said.Yet there has been no sense of panic. Well, almost none. Shortly after the earthquake, some foreign banks anxiously booked private jet flights out of Tokyo and other Japanese cities. According to a Reuters article on March 16, private jet charter operators throughout Asia “reported a surge in demand for evacuation flights” from foreign banks with operations in Japan.So far, though, no real need for private jet airlifts has arisen. People who want to leave have been able to take regular commercial flights. The major airports in Japan are open and operating smoothly. Most flights leaving Japan are full, however, and it can take days to find a seat.Emergency response companies all maintain access to noncommercial service like charter aircraft, but normal commercial flights and flights for medical and disaster response have priority. That is an issue for private flights, as the government is carefully supervising limited supplies of aviation fuel, as well as landing and takeoff slots.“There are, of course, plenty of charter air assets available within the region,” Mr. Puig said. “The issue has been the capacity the airports have to take in the increase in volume of charter flights that people are looking to bring in.” With strict controls on private, nonemergency flights, “you’re going to find it harder to get fuel if you’re a charter flight,” he said.'"
"'11-03-22,'0','Yale Law School, renowned for competitiveness and its Supreme Court justices, is embarking on a pilot program next week in which students can check out a “therapy dog” named Monty along with the library’s collection of more than one million books.While the law school is saying little so far about its dog-lending program, it has distributed a memo to students with the basics: that Monty will be available at the circulation desk to stressed-out students for 30 minutes at a time beginning Monday, for a three-day trial run.“It is well documented that visits from therapy dogs have resulted in increased happiness, calmness and overall emotional well-being,” Blair Kauffman, the law librarian, wrote in an e-mail to students.The school is not saying what sort of dog Monty is; what happens to him when school is out of session; or how Monty himself may be kept from becoming overstressed with all his play dates.Sebastian Swett, 26, a second-year student at the law school, said he had signed up for a session with the dog, but does not necessarily think that it will relieve all the pressures that come with being a student at Yale. “I don’t think its going to solve anybody’s anxiety problems, but it’s certainly nice to play with a dog for half an hour.”Monty, according to the memo to students, is hypoallergenic and will be kept in a nonpublic space inside the library, presumably away from those who don’t much like dogs.'"
"'11-03-22,'0','Financial markets have already started to price in this new interest in gas. Since the disaster in Japan, uranium prices have dropped by 30 percent, while natural gas prices in Europe and the United States have risen by about 10 percent. Officials from several countries, including China, Germany, Finland and South Africa, said they would review their nuclear strategies.Utilities are also reconsidering natural gas as a potential source of stable power, a function historically filled by coal and nuclear energy. Utility chiefs have been wary of price fluctuations of natural gas, particularly in the last two decades.But that may be about to change, according to John Rowe, chairman of Exelon, the biggest nuclear utility in the United States. He argued that building a nuclear power plant would be prohibitively expensive, while new rules limiting carbon emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency would require costly investments to scrub emissions from coal-powered plants. This means that utilities will increasingly switch to natural gas.“Natural gas is queen,” Mr. Rowe told a panel at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington this month.That view was endorsed by a report to be released on Tuesday by the Bipartisan Policy Center and the American Clean Skies Foundation, which predicts that natural gas consumption will increase because of an abundance of new supplies, some of them in the United States, that are likely to keep prices relatively low.Global natural gas production rose by 44 percent in the two decades from 1990 and 2010, while gas reserves grew by 67 percent. After peaking at $13.58 per thousand cubic feet in 2008, gas prices in the United States averaged $4.38 last year. What is more, natural gas emits about half as much carbon dioxide as coal when it is burned to produce one kilowatt hour of electricity.The immediate market for natural gas will likely be Japan, which is looking to raise its fuel imports after a fifth of its nuclear power capacity was shut down, including the troubled Fukushima Daiichi plant. And Tokyo Electric Power says that the rolling blackouts in the country will continue at least into next winter.Japan already imports a third of global liquefied natural gas shipments and its import terminals, mostly in the south, were not damaged by the earthquake. Nuclear power and coal each accounts for a quarter of Japan’s power generation, while natural gas accounts for 30 percent, according to analysts with the Raymond James financial company.“It could be that the Honshu earthquake is the catalyst which fundamentally reshapes our approach to global energy,” Bernstein Research analysts wrote last week.Many oil companies have anticipated this shift. At Royal Dutch Shell, natural gas production overtook its oil output in recent years. Exxon Mobil bought XTO Energy last year to raise its presence in the growing domestic shale gas market. It has also developed significant resources in Qatar, which holds the third-largest reserves of natural gas in the world, after Russia and Iran.Huge new projects dedicated to liquefied natural gas — in which gas is frozen, compressed in liquid form for easier shipment, then returned to a gas state at import terminals — have been mushrooming around the world.In Papua-New Guinea, Exxon is leading a $15 billion project to build and develop an LNG plant to supply Asian customers. Chevron recently began engineering work on the $40 billion Gorgon gas project in Australia, along with Shell and Exxon. Russia, for its part, is planning to develop huge new fields in the Arctic.Natural gas is not without problems. To unlock methane from hard shale rocks in the United States, energy companies use hydraulic fracturing, a method that has been criticized on the grounds of polluting water sources, including rivers and underground aquifers.But energy policy must balance out these hazards with the concerns about nuclear power, as well as the still unresolved problem of what to do with spent nuclear fuel that remains radioactive for hundreds of years.“Nuclear power has suddenly found itself going from being (arguably) part of the solution for future green energy to a now dangerous relic of the cold war era,” Deutsche Bank said in a report last week.In the United States, where no new reactor has been built since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, the attitude toward nuclear power has been ambivalent. Last year, the president asked the Energy Department to provide some financial backing for nuclear operations, including two reactors planned for Georgia.But in the aftermath of the Japanese disaster, the administration ordered a comprehensive review of safety at nuclear plants.At the same time, the industry has found it nearly impossible to develop and finance new plants. In December, for example, Exelon dropped its application to build a plant in Victoria County, Tex., in the face of opposition.Utilities have also faced a challenge in renewing their existing operating licenses. The Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station, in Plymouth, Mass., has been waiting for a new license for five years because of litigation and court delays. State officials in Vermont have been battling to shut down Entergy’s Vermont Yankee plant, which began operations in 1972.There are 104 nuclear reactors in the United States, which contribute 23 percent of the nation’s electrical power. Twenty reactors have applications pending with federal regulators to extend the plants’ operating lives by as much as two decades, according to Bloomberg News.“We are likely to do to nuclear licensing what we did to offshore permitting,” Mr. Goldstein, of the energy policy foundation, said. “We will delay and stall.”'"
"'11-03-22,'0','FRANKFURT — Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, stood by his prediction of higher interest rates for the euro zone on Monday despite the recent calamity in Japan.Appearing before the European Parliament’s economics committee, Mr. Trichet referred to “the tragic developments in Japan with the deplorable loss of human lives” and “their potential global economic and financial implications,” but said “inflation in the euro area is on the rise.”He went on to say that he had “nothing to add” to comments he made in February, when he signaled that the bank’s governing council was likely to raise the benchmark interest rate from a record low of 1 percent when it meets next month.There is still plenty of time for Mr. Trichet to revise his view before the April 7 policy meeting. But for now, he and other members of the governing council are not showing any sign of softening their view.“I think if the E.C.B. were to see that the macroeconomic implications of Japan were such that they would put seriously into question the European outlook, then they might reconsider the policy decision,” Nick Matthews, senior European economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, wrote in an e-mail. “But at this stage they do not appear to be backing away from it.”'"
"'11-03-22,'0','This city embraced Bonds, who last played in 2007. People here cheered him and his achievement in overtaking Hank Aaron as baseball’s home run king.But now that Bonds is retired and the Giants have a World Series championship, will fans turn their backs on their onetime hero? It is clear that some will not. One prospective juror said Monday that he would find it difficult to be fair and impartial while rendering a decision about a great athlete like Bonds.Scott Ito, a second-year student at the University of San Francisco School of Law, said Sunday night: “If you grow up in San Francisco, you’re a Giants fan. I think Giants fans just want closure. Right now, I think what baseball and the Giants are doing is trying to turn their back on Barry Bonds a little bit because they don’t want the taint of whatever might happen. But at the end of the day, Barry Bonds was a Giant for a long time — whether he did steroids or not. He’s still going to be a Giant. We just want it to be over.”The trial is expected to last three to four weeks. Prosecutors need to prove that Bonds knew he was using steroids and lied under oath about it.Bonds has been under scrutiny for eight years for his involvement with the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative and for his testimony before a federal grand jury in 2003 that he never knowingly used performance-enhancing drugs provided to him by his former trainer, Greg Anderson.In the coming weeks, it will be interesting to see if the support for or opposition to Bonds divides a hard-core, closely knit Giants fans base. On Sunday night, Elias Khalil discussed the trial. “I hope he goes free,” said Khalil, who has operated a liquor store a block and a half from the courthouse for the last 24 years.“There are things that are more important than this,” Khalil, 55, said. “If he did something really bad and they got him doing it, O.K. I mean real bad, like murder; real bad, like drug selling, dealing. Something like that, O.K.”The government argues that its pursuit of the case is only about making the point that it will not tolerate lying to a grand jury.“Is he the only one who lied?” Khalil said.As he took a study break Sunday night, Ito said he thought he had an idea about what has driven the chase of Bonds.“I just feel that they spent so much money investigating steroids that they had to justify it by charging him with something,” Ito said. “Perjury just happens to probably be their best bet.”He added: “I’m not into trying to be a litigator or anything like that, but it seems like common sense. You stop Congress, you hold all these hearings, so you have to have some kind of payoff to justify what you’re doing. It’s not to say that perjury’s not a big deal; it is. But for the government to go through this whole hoopla and end up with perjury, it’s kind of like getting Al Capone on tax evasion.”On Sunday night at Gateway Croissants, Corey Donaldson finished his coffee and  prepared to go to his security job in a nearby government building. Donaldson’s Giants cap was a dead giveaway for where his heart was: He was a Giants and Bonds fan.Asked what he thought about the government’s pursuit of Bonds, Donaldson said: “What’s the point? I don’t understand why they go after him like that — because he has money? He’s successful, has a big name.”Reminded that prosecutors are going after Bonds because they think he lied to a grand jury, Donaldson just shook his head and repeated: “What’s the point? Nobody wins. Ain’t  no winners here, only losers.”After eight years, it is finally batter up for the prosecution. Bonds is at the plate, and Parrella will have to succeed where so many others have failed. He’ll have to get Bonds out, with a multimillion-dollar fastball.'"
"'11-03-22,'0','WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve will publish new details about its emergency lending to banks during the 2008 financial crisis after the Supreme Court on Monday rejected an industry appeal for secrecy.The Fed said it would release detailed information soon about its main emergency aid program, the so-called discount window, breaking a policy of confidentiality that dates to its founding in 1913. The Fed was required by Congress to publish similar data about its other lending programs last year.“The board will fully comply with the court’s decisions and is preparing to make the information available,” David Skidmore, a Fed spokesman, said.The disclosures could embarrass some of the nation’s largest banks, which are eager to focus public attention on their renewed profitability, by returning a spotlight to the extent of their dependence on federal aid during the crisis. It also signaled a victory for Bloomberg News, which first requested the data in 2008.But the industry and the Fed also won a victory of sorts simply by delaying the release of the information for more than two years, as investors now will be less likely to draw inferences about the current condition of the banks that needed help during the crisis.Bloomberg News filed a request for the discount window data under the Freedom of Information Act in 2008. When the Fed denied the request, the company filed a lawsuit. After a trial court ruled in favor of Bloomberg in 2009, the Fed appealed. A federal appeals court handed Bloomberg a second victory last March and the Fed conceded the issue, but the verdict was appealed by the Clearing House Association, which represents 10 of the nation’s largest banks.The Supreme Court rejected that appeal Monday in a brief written order.“The Federal Reserve forgot that it is the central bank for the people of the United States and not a private academy where decisions of great importance may be withheld from public scrutiny,” Matthew Winkler, editor in chief of Bloomberg News, said in a statement.'"
"'11-03-22,'0','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Sales of previously owned homes fell sharply in February and prices hit their lowest level in nearly nine years, a real estate trade group said Monday.Sales fell 9.6 percent month over month to an annual rate of 4.88 million units, snapping three straight months of gains, according to the report. The percentage decline was the largest since July.Economists polled by Reuters had expected February sales to fall 4.0 percent to a pace of 5.15 million units from the previously reported 5.36 million unit rate in January. January’s pace was revised up slightly to 5.40 million.“This is a frustrating number,” said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Advisors in New York.“The U.S. residential real estate market doesn’t seem to want to turn around despite better affordability.” Financial markets largely ignored the data.The report, released by the National Association of Realtors, said the median home price fell 5.2 percent in February from a year earlier to $156,100, the lowest since April 2002.'"
"'11-03-22,'0','Women who take codeine, oxycodone and other opioid pain drugs early in pregnancy may be exposing their babies to a higher risk of birth defects, a new study suggests.Though the overall numbers were small, babies whose mothers took opioids were considerably more likely than others to have congenital problems, including a potentially fatal syndrome in which the left part of the heart does not develop completely; spina bifida; and gastroschisis, in which the intestines stick out of the body.The study, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was one of the largest to examine the effects of opioid use during pregnancy. It appeared last month in The American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology.It used data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study about mothers in 10 states who gave birth from 1997 to 2005.Of 17,449 mothers whose babies had a birth defect, 454, or 2.6 percent, reported treatment with opioid analgesics a month before pregnancy or during the three months after conception. In the comparison group of 6,701 women, the rate of opioid treatment was 2.0 percent.“Opioids and their receptors act as growth regulators during embryologic development, which may explain our findings,” said Cheryl S. Broussard, the paper’s lead author.'"
"'11-03-22,'0','A major new analysis challenges the long-held idea that obese people who carry their extra weight mainly around the middle — those with an “apple” shape — are at greater risk for heart disease than “pears,” whose fat tends to cluster on their thighs and buttocks.The new report, published online on March 11 in The Lancet, pooled data from 58 studies about more than 220,000 people,mean age of 58. During the time they were followed, more than 14,000 suffered a heart attack or stroke.Conventional risk factors like blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes and smoking were accurate predictors of a heart attack or stroke, but additional information about weight or body shape (ascertained by measuring waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio) did not improve the ability to predict risk.“Whatever your shape is doesn’t really matter,” said Dr. Emanuele Di Angelantonio, a lecturer at the University of Cambridge and a member of the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, which carried out the study.He emphasized that being overweight or obese is one of the main modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and is often an early sign of future risk. But he said, “Whatever form of obesity or overweight you have is all the same.”'"

"'11-03-23,'1','Howard Stern and his agent have sued Sirius XM Radio, claiming the satellite radio company has failed to pay him stock awards tied to subscriber growth.Mr. Stern, 57, the outspoken talk-show host, signed a five-year, $500 million contract with Sirius Satellite Radio in October 2004, when it had less than one million subscribers. He began his show in January 2006, and two years later the company merged with XM Satellite Radio.The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan by Mr. Stern’s production company, One Twelve, and his longtime agent, Don Buchwald, claims that Mr. Stern was to be paid in stock when certain subscription goals were met. But after an initial payment of 34.4 million shares in early 2006 and another payment in 2007, the suit says, the company failed to make additional payments. Sirius reported 20.2 million subscribers at the end of 2010.“When Sirius needed Stern, it promised him a share in any success that the company achieved,” the suit says. “But now that Sirius has conquered its chief competitor and acquired more than 20 million subscribers, it has reneged on its commitment to Stern, unilaterally deciding that it has paid him enough.”In December, Mr. Stern renewed his contract with Sirius XM for another five years. The terms were not disclosed, but some analysts believed that it was for $80 million a year in cash, with no stock.In a statement, Sirius XM said it had abided by the terms of its 2004 deal.“Sirius XM just signed a contract through 2015 with Howard Stern, and he is a valued part of our company,” the statement said.'"
"'11-03-23,'1','OTTAWA — Research In Motion challenged Apple on Tuesday by announcing that its BlackBerry PlayBook would be sold at the same price as the iPad 2.But the success or failure of the BlackBerry tablet, which will have a base price of $499, is unlikely to be determined in the aisles of Best Buy, Staples, RadioShack or the other retailers that will begin offering it on April 19. Many analysts believe that the PlayBook’s main customer base, like that of the original BlackBerry smartphone, will be corporations and government buying in bulk at a discounted price.“Maybe ‘PlayBook’ is a misnomer,” said Tony Cripps, an analyst with Ovum, a unit of Datamonitor, who is based in London. “R.I.M. would be crazy not to maximize its advantages in the enterprise market.”The PlayBook will be the first tablet that is directly price-competitive with Apple’s offering. By comparison, both the Motorola Xoom and the Samsung Galaxy Tab cost more than the iPad 2. Hewlett-Packard, which is also expected to sell its TouchPad tablet to corporations, has not yet announced the price of its device.While Best Buy began accepting advance orders for the PlayBook on its Web site on Tuesday, the primary buyers of the PlayBook are unlikely to be paying retail. From the first days of the BlackBerry hand-held, R.I.M. carefully cultivated relationships with the information technology departments within corporations and governments. Its products have long included security and control features that are of more interest to people who run computer systems than to the employees using the BlackBerrys.Jeff Orr, an analyst with ABI Research, said that R.I.M. had been consulting with its large customers about the PlayBook for several months. “They’re playing to a market where they definitely have a closer relationship than Apple,” Mr. Orr said.'"
"'11-03-23,'1','Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told a House subcommittee recently that a drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing could be the “Achilles’ heel” that kills the natural gas industry. Like many others, Mr. Salazar sees natural gas, which America has in great abundance, as cleaner and more climate-friendly than coal or oil and a useful transition to alternative fuels. But he also fears, as we do, that public support for drilling will diminish unless the industry and its state and federal regulators do a better job of making sure the gas does no harm to drinking water.Hydraulic fracturing involves blasting water, sand and chemicals into underground rock formations to unlock the gas they contain. The technique has been around for many years and has been used, mostly without incident, in hundreds of thousands of natural gas wells. But the risks have multiplied as the wells are drilled deeper and stretched vertically and horizontally to get at remote deposits. A single well can cough up a million gallons of wastewater laced with carcinogens like benzene and radioactive elements like radium.The technique has become especially controversial in Pennsylvania, the epicenter of a big push for natural gas locked in the Marcellus Shale, a formation stretching from West Virginia to upstate New York. Ian Urbina’s recent series in The Times found that conventional wastewater treatment plants in Pennsylvania could not prevent radioactive contaminants from entering rivers that provide drinking water for millions of people. The series also identified many instances of poor regulation.At the urging of Congress, the Environmental Protection Agency has begun an investigation of hydraulic fracturing’s effect on the environment. An earlier E.P.A. study in 2004 was superficial and skewed toward industry. The oil and gas companies provided much of the underlying data, and there were few onsite inspections. This time the study must involve rigorous field testing. It must also be thorough and transparent.There is a message here for New York State as well. Albany has been dithering for years over whether to allow increased hydraulic fracturing, and under what conditions and rules, in New York’s portion of the Marcellus Shale. The state’s Department of Environmental Conservation is nearing the end of a revised environmental impact statement that is due on June 1.Given all the new information, this is a ridiculously short time frame. The department — which hasn’t even finished processing comments from a 2009 study — needs to get it right. We would hope that it prohibits drilling altogether in two watersheds that supply millions of people with unfiltered drinking water, while imposing the strictest possible drilling standards elsewhere. The two watersheds are the New York City watershed, which covers one million acres north and west of the city and provides drinking water to 8.2 million people, and the smaller Skaneateles Lake watershed near Syracuse.'"

"'11-03-23,'1','SEAFOOD supplies in northern Japan were devastated by the tsunami that destroyed the region’s fishing fleets and aquaculture farms as well as the ports themselves. The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun reported on Tuesday that fishermen in the area are living in shelters, transportation to the famous Tsukiji market in Tokyo is not possible, and there is no ice to keep fish fresh.So far, this grim picture is not causing serious shortages in American sushi bars, but how the situation will evolve remains to be seen.“It has definitely affected the market,” said Jack Lamb, an owner of Jewel Bako in the East Village, where most of the fish is imported from Japan. But he said that the restaurant had made adjustments and was now buying fish from Kyushu Island in the south, far from the affected area, and was obtaining mackerel and octopus from sources in the United States.Nobuyoshi Kuraoka, the owner of Nippon, a restaurant in Midtown, wrote by e-mail from Tokyo, where he was on business, that the “striped jack, yellowtail, sniper fish, sea eels and others are coming from Fukuoka on Kyushu Island through Korean airlines.”Tadashi Ono, the chef and a partner at Matsuri in Chelsea, also said he is buying from Kyushu, as well as from Australian and New York waters. “Today fish comes from all over the world, so we’re O.K.,” he said.There have been reports that restaurants and hotels in Asia and elsewhere have canceled all shipments of fresh produce from Japan after radiation turned up in products like milk and spinach.'"

"'11-03-23,'1','Oil prices have risen by about 20 percent since unrest began spreading through North Africa and the Middle East earlier this year. But prices have remained relatively stable over the last week, despite the Allied attacks on Libya.The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Tuesday was a penny lower than a week earlier, according to AAA’s daily fuel gauge. But at $3.55 a gallon, it is still 38 cents higher than a month ago.Oil prices slipped early Tuesday after Japan announced that it would release 22 days worth of oil from its reserves to assist areas that were damaged by the earthquake. But prices quickly rebounded as reports of unrest in Libya, Bahrain, Yemen and Syria roiled markets. West Texas Intermediate crude closed up $1.67, to $104 a barrel, in New York.Japan relies on imported oil for 45 percent of its energy needs, according to the United States Energy Department, and it is the third-largest importer of oil in the world. Japan is the world’s third-largest economy and a major trading partner of China, South Korea and the United States, and a slowdown of its economy will have at least some ripple effects.“Japan is a big buyer of stuff from China and South Korea, so this is going to lever down the export growth of Asia for at least a half a year, and that is going to diminish the demand for oil out of Asia,” said Allen L. Sinai, chief global economist at Decision Economics, an advisory firm. He estimated that “on a pure supply-demand basis, oil prices should go down $10 or $15 a barrel,” as a result of the sharp decline in the Japanese economy over the next six months or so.But Mr. Sinai and other economists cautioned that a reduction in Japanese demand was only one of many global factors that were now affecting oil prices. At a time of economic and political uncertainty, traders and central banks are adding oil futures to their portfolios as an alternative asset like gold. More important, turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East will threaten the security of vital oil fields, ports and shipping lanes for at least the near future.Meanwhile the oil appetite of the growing Chinese economy, the principal driver in the recovery of global demand in recent years, is running at 10 percent higher than a year ago, or 9.5 million barrels a day.One factor that will continue to depress Japan’s oil demand is that as much as 550,000 barrels a day of Japanese refinery capacity may be off line for months and possibly until the end of the year, according to experts. Two major refineries, JX Nippon’s Sendai refinery and Cosmo Oil’s Chiba plant, suffered major fires after the earthquake. A third refinery remains closed and oil storage facilities at several refineries have also been damaged.Cosmo said on Monday it had finally extinguished the fire at its Chiba refinery, north of Tokyo. But the 220,000-barrel-a-day plant would be out of commission for a prolonged period. Katsuhisa Maeda, a spokesman for the company, said Cosmo would ramp up production at its other facilities as much as possible.Even with the damage to refineries and the slowdown to the Japanese economy, though, some energy analysts predict that there will be a steady increase in Japanese oil demand. In a recent research note, Barclays Capital estimated that Japan would experience “incremental demand” increases of 143,000 barrels a day of fuel oil and 67,000 barrels a day of crude oil to replace lost nuclear and other power capacity.The Japanese calamity may eventually lead to a construction boom, which will most likely require more fuel consumption.“After a period of demand destruction the tragedy in Japan will become very bullish for oil,” wrote Phil Flynn, an energy analyst at PFGBest, a brokerage firm, in a research note on Tuesday. “Not only the hard numbers rebuilding Japan, but a reduction in nuclear power plants around the globe will, eventually lead to millions more barrels of oil consumed on a daily basis as well as coal and natural gas.”'"
"'11-03-23,'1','TRIPOLI — The Qaddafi government gave journalists a tour on Tuesday of the wreckage of two missile warehouses at the Tripoli port in the first public display of significant damage to the capital from the American and European airstrikes.Inside the still smoldering remains of the warehouses were four Russian-made surface-to-air missile launchers with Cyrillic writing on them, a row of what appeared to be missiles and several burned-out military vehicles. Scraps of shrapnel had been blown as far as 50 yards from a deep crater near the center of the warehouse. Libyan naval frigates in the harbor were left untouched by the blast.Some military officers on the scene said the site was merely a training or refueling location, and asserted that several people had been wounded in the attack. But Capt. Abdul Baset Ali, a Libyan naval officer, said no one had been injured or killed because the Libyan government had expected the attack and evacuated.“Nobody was here because we knew this place may be targeted, so we went far away,” he said. Asked what the future holds for Libya, he said: “Nobody knows. We hope it will be good.”One military officer, asking for anonymity so he could speak openly, said that he respected the Western goal of establishing a no-fly zone to protect Libyan civilians, but that the broad scope of the attacks risked creating a backlash. “This is not the way to shift out Qaddafi,” he said.Though the airstrikes do not appear to have led to any new uprising against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi here, there was evidence that they had had a significant psychological impact. On an organized stroll through the old city with Qaddafi government minders, several Tripoli residents approached foreign journalists to offer their disdain or impatience with the Qaddafi government. Sometimes they spoke within just a few yards of a government representative.Offered the bromide that it was a beautiful country, one man replied in perfect English, “It will be after we change the system.”Despite the government’s many warnings that the population was boiling with anger at the West over the airstrikes, there appeared to be no hint of hard feelings. Most people, even those with nothing to sell, were as eager as ever to talk about America or Europe and welcome Western strangers.Several pointed to the perennial demonstration in support of Colonel Qaddafi in the city’s Green Square — in the early afternoon a few dozen people were waving green scarves and flags — and cautioned that it did not represent the real Libya. Some directed journalists to the rebellious neighborhoods of Tajura and Feshloom, to get a better sense of Libyans’ true feelings.“People are very afraid, honestly,” one man said, explaining why most people still refused to talk. “They killed a lot of people in Tripoli, including one of my relatives. You have to be careful. They are watching right now.”Other signs suggested that the Qaddafi government itself was bracing for more unrest. About half a dozen soldiers with machine guns were stationed behind a newly erected wall of sandbags in front of the Libyan central bank building. Asked about the wall, an official minder said the bank needed protection because the government had by now armed so many citizens for defense against the rebels — suggesting, perhaps inadvertently, that the newly armed citizens, many from poor neighborhoods known for strong support of Qaddafi, might themselves be a source of instability.Colonel Qaddafi and officials of his government have said repeatedly in recent days that they were arming civilians to fight against the rebels, and nearby a 24-year-old man said he had returned two days ago from the front lines in Ajdabiya. He showed an identification card issued for the occasion and said the Qaddafi government had handed him a Kalashnikov on his way to the battle. But he said he did not kill anyone, and he seemed bewildered by his experience.As the fourth night of airstrikes began about 8 p.m., a news conference broadcast over state television showed a group of tribal leaders in Tripoli announcing plans for a peace march — really a bus ride — to Benghazi as an attempt to unify the country.Sitting in traditional white robes around a long conference room table under a towering portrait of a young Muammar el-Qaddafi, all talked about their desire to reconcile the warring factions of the country, without mentioning any substantive disagreements.A reporter asked how they would resolve the philosophical differences between the Qaddafi government’s embrace of its current system and the rebels’ calls for a constitutional democracy.“Our main purpose is to stop the bloodshed,” the group’s leader said, speaking through a government translator. “After that, everything is up for dialogue.”'"
"'11-03-23,'1','“Fear is affecting Apple in particular,” said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. “This is a company with tight supplies, and the fear is that they will get even tighter.”Figuring out the precise impact on Apple of the disruptions in Japan is more art than science. The company, which declined to comment for this article, is intensely secretive about its supply chain. While other companies typically don’t talk about whom they buy parts from, analysts say Apple takes secrecy particularly seriously and will cut off any supplier that it suspects of being loose-lipped.That has left analysts piecing together bits of information dribbling out of Japan about certain parts or suppliers. In a series of sometimes-conflicting reports, they have focused on a handful of iPad components.On Monday, for example, analysts highlighted a new concern: 300-millimeter wafers, which are silicon disks used to manufacture essential chips for the iPhone and iPad. A factory operated by Shin-Etsu in Shirakawa, in northern Japan, produces at least 15 percent of the world’s supply of the wafers, said Gus Richard, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, and is not likely to become operational for a long time.“Will it affect Apple today or tomorrow?” Mr. Richard said. “No. But everyone is worried about those wafers. At some point, chip makers will run out.”Last week, the focus was elsewhere. On Thursday, IHS iSuppli, which is known for its “teardowns” of new Apple products — taking them apart as soon as they come out to analyze their components — identified five parts that it said could be affected. They included the flash storage, memory chips, an electronic compass, batteries and glass used in the touch screen.Underscoring the challenges with its analysis, iSuppli said that the glass was only likely to come from Japan, and that it might have failed to identify other Japanese components in the device.Other analysts said last week that they were concerned about the supply of BT resin, a product used to produce circuit boards for iPhone and iPad chips, manufactured primarily by a Mitsubishi facility in Japan that was temporarily shut down.“Part of it is a guessing game,” said Andy Hargreaves, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. Mr. Hargreaves was among those who played down the impact of the crisis on Apple. Mr. Hargreaves noted that Apple would be first in line to receive components like flash storage and memory chips. He also noted that the prices of those components, while likely to rise, were still lower than in 2010.Like many others, though, Mr. Hargreaves was cautious. “The biggest thing we don’t know is how long will the disruptions last,” he said.With supplies for the iPad 2 and the iPhone tight, even a short-lived disruption could have an effect. Apple has not said how many of the new iPads it has sold since it went on sale on March 11. Analysts estimated that the number was around 500,000 in the first weekend. After that, sales slowed to a trickle, even as demand remained strong.Apple stores have been resupplied daily, but in small amounts. Mr. Munster said a large group of people lined up overnight at the Apple store in New York’s meatpacking district one day last week. Only the first 20 people were able to buy an iPad. Another Apple store, at the Mall of America in Minneapolis, received just six iPads on a recent day, while a Target store received 15, he said.On Apple’s own Web site, the waiting time for new orders has increased to four to five weeks, from two to three weeks. On Friday, the company plans to begin selling the iPad 2 in some two dozen countries. While Apple is certain to have earmarked units for the international debut, no one outside of the company knows how many. Analysts said they were unsure whether serving a bigger market would worsen supply problems.Apple has faced challenges in meeting demand as far back as 2004, when it first released the iPod Mini. The iPhone has been in tight supply since Apple introduced it in 2007. And only in the most recent quarter, Apple managed to end the backlog for the original iPad.“This is a problem that Apple has had since 2004,” Mr. Munster said. “They are doing a better job than before, but they still can’t make enough.”Mr. Munster predicted that the delay for online orders of the iPad 2 would extend to six or seven weeks by summer.'"
"'11-03-23,'1','“I don’t understand how the powers that be can allow these things to keep happening,” Sheila McNeil, the mother of Mr. McNeil, said of the Feb. 10 shooting death of her son. “Something is drastically wrong.”Chief Exposito, a burly 37-year veteran who became chief in November 2009, defended his leadership. “We don’t have a violent police department,” he said in an interview last week. “You’ll find our officers are very compassionate with the people they deal with. They will try to de-escalate situations rather than resorting to deadly force.”The officer who shot Mr. McNeil is Reinaldo Goyo, a member of the city’s elite gang unit who appeared in the “Miami’s Finest SOS” video. (The TV show has since been shelved.)Saying on the video: “I’ve got some style. I’ve got some flavor” while wearing a hoodie emblazoned with the words “ ,” Detective Goyo says he and his partner inherited the nicknames Crockett and Tubbs after the lead characters in the 1980s TV show “ .” “It’s got a nice little ring to it,” he says.Detective Goyo would not comment, a police spokesman said. A lawyer for Detective Goyo did not respond to phone messages.Chief Exposito said he thought the video was “excellent,” although in an e-mail to the production company in December, he acknowledged that he regretted using the word “predator” and asked that his quotation be changed. In another e-mail to one of his assistants, he wrote: “This statement would add fuel to the fire. They need to soften it!”In an interview last week, Chief Exposito said the video was not supposed to be for public consumption. “I had a problem with the production company — it was not supposed to be on or anywhere else.”The chief also defended the officer who said, “I like to hunt.”“Hunting doesn’t mean you go kill people,” the chief said. “Hunting means you go out there and capture people.”Miami has a long history of racially charged police shootings, some of which combusted into deadly riots and Justice Department inquiries that ended with police officers in prison. The pattern this time is familiar: All seven men who were fatally shot by the police were African-American; the police officers who shot them are all Hispanic.“There is a wide range of growing concern in the community regarding the apparent lack of communication and response to these incidents by the City of Miami Police Department,” Representative Frederica S. Wilson, a Democrat from Miami, wrote in a recent letter to Attorney General , asking the Justice Department to investigate.Questions about Chief Exposito’s leadership have galvanized some leaders of the African-American community, who say that two of the men shot by the police were unarmed. Police officials would not describe details, but they have said that during both shootings, the officers had reason to believe their lives were in danger.Community leaders also expressed outrage that a 12-year veteran of the city’s gang unit, Ricardo Martinez, shot and killed two men within nine days last August. Officer Martinez returned to his job six days after fatally shooting one man, then shot and killed another three days later. Before the shootings, he was under investigation for allegedly selling seized phones.One officer being responsible for two fatal shootings in such a short period of time is highly unusual, national experts on police forces say. Typically, officers are assigned to desk duty after a shooting pending an inquiry.“What does that tell you about the chief’s judgment?” said the Rev. Anthony Tate, president of the civil rights organization Pulse and pastor of New Resurrection Community Church in the Liberty City neighborhood.Chief Exposito said that the inquiry had been initiated by his department, and that it would have been inappropriate to keep Officer Martinez off the street because of an allegation of wrongdoing. In December, Officer Martinez was charged with selling stolen Bluetooth phone headsets. He has been dismissed.Mr. Tate, two Miami city commissioners and other community leaders have repeatedly called for the chief’s dismissal. Chief Exposito was a major in the property room and in charge of a compliance task force before being elevated two years ago to police chief by Mayor Tomas P. Regalado. Since then, the chief and the mayor have feuded bitterly over a variety of issues.City Commissioner Richard P. Dunn II was the first on the commission to call for the chief’s dismissal. “It’s not personal. He’s just not competent to be a chief, that’s all,” said Mr. Dunn, whose district includes the neighborhoods where all seven fatal shootings occurred.“These shootings have us sitting on a time bomb,” he said. “Everyone wonders: When is the next one going to happen? And the fact the chief is still here just makes Miami look like a banana republic.”Chief Exposito said that after the first of the fatal shootings, last July, he invited the to attend the department’s internal inquiry, a gesture his predecessors had not offered, he said. “This is not something I was forced to do,” he said.The chief’s critics say his leadership is markedly different from that of his predecessor, , a deputy police commissioner in New York in the Giuliani administration.During Mr. Timoney’s seven-year tenure, the department once went 22 months without having a police officer fire a weapon. When Mr. Exposito succeeded Mr. Timoney in November 2009, he assigned more than 100 officers to “tactical units” to try to curb violent crime.The tactical units, including the gang unit whose officers have been responsible for the majority of the most recent shootings, have arrested hundreds of suspects and removed 400 more guns from the street in 2010 than in 2009, the chief said.During those sweeps, “seven people decided they were not going to obey the law and not adhere to the police orders,” said Armando Aguilar, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, the police union, “and they ended up getting shot.”The chief’s fate is in the hands of the city manager, Tony E. Crapp Jr. In late February, Mr. Crapp hired a former senior F.B.I. agent, Paul R. Philip, to assess the department’s record.Mr. Philip, who headed the F.B.I.’s Miami field office, said in an interview that he compared the number of police shootings in 2009, the last year of Mr. Timoney’s leadership, with the first 15 months of Chief Exposito’s tenure. During Mr. Timoney’s final year as chief, seven officers shot at suspects, killing four and missing three others. Under Chief Exposito, there have been 10 shootings, with seven fatalities.“It seemed to be a concern that the department was engaged in an accelerated rate of shootings, but there doesn’t appear to be,” Mr. Philip said. “The data seems to support the chief.”Mr. Philip said his review did not include interviewing police officers who fired their weapons, witnesses or the family members of victims. Determining whether each of the shootings was justified is the state attorney’s job.The chief said he was gratified that “someone with the stature of Paul Philip is agreeing with me.” He added: “I’ve been saying all along, we’re trying to get violent crime under control in that community. Unfortunately when you do that, you will be confronted by people who are armed and dangerous.”Community leaders said they were upset about the pace of the Police Department’s own inquiries. They complained that police investigators had not taken a statement from Kareem Williams, 31, who is Mr. McNeil’s cousin and was shot three times as he sat with Mr. McNeil in the rental car last month. Mr. Williams, who left the hospital two days later, told his family that the officer began shooting without saying a single word, Mrs. McNeil said.Not long ago, Mrs. McNeil met with Chief Exposito, who spoke about police procedures on the use of deadly force, she said. She added that the “impersonal” nature of the discussion had left her frustrated and sad.“When your son has been shot,” she said, “you don’t want to hear about policies.”'"
"'11-03-23,'1','SAN FRANCISCO — Greg Anderson, the childhood friend and former trainer of Barry Bonds, went to jail Tuesday for refusing to testify in Bonds’s perjury trial. For Anderson, it is nothing new.The federal judge presiding over the case ordered him into custody for the fourth time in the past five years for contempt of court. He will remain there for the duration of the trial, which could last as long as four weeks.If Anderson changes his mind, Judge Susan Illston of United States District Court said that he would be freed. But if he does not, some legal experts say Anderson is headed for even bigger trouble based on his repeated reluctance to take the stand.They say Anderson — who spent three months in prison in 2005 for conspiracy to distribute steroids and for money laundering in connection to the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative steroids case — may face his most serious charge yet: obstruction of justice. That charge carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.“I have absolute confidence that Greg Anderson will be charged with obstruction of justice when the Bonds trial is over,” said Rory Little, a former federal prosecutor who is a professor at University of California Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco. “It’s very uncommon to have someone who is willing to go to jail for months for no direct promise of payback from the defendant. And the government doesn’t take intentional obstruction of justice lightly.”Little said the refusal of a witness to testify — either to a grand jury or at a trial — was common in organized-crime cases in the 1960s, when potential witnesses did not testify to stymie the prosecution. Those potential witnesses considered it “sort of a joke” that they could elude testifying by simply spending some time in jail or prison and not face any other charges. It was considered commonplace and a badge of honor to be jailed because of their silence, he said.'"
"'11-03-23,'1','He promised further political change in the restive tribal areas, which has met with resistance from the Pakistani military, as well as economic and energy reforms and increased regional trade.Despite an increasingly difficult and unpopular relationship with the United States, he reiterated his party’s conviction to fight terrorism and develop good long-term relations with neighboring Afghanistan, and the United States and other regional actors. “We seek trade, not aid,” he said.“With the United States we remain committed to building a long-term partnership based on mutual respect, mutual interest, and sovereign equality,” he said. Relations with Afghanistan had undergone a “sea change” under his government, he said.He condemned the killing of the former Punjab Province governor, Salman Taseer, who was assassinated by one of his own security guards in January, and that of the minister for minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti, in the first week of March. Both had campaigned for changes to Pakistan’s blasphemy laws, which often are used to persecute Christians and other religious minorities.Mr. Zardari’s government has dropped its plans to revise the blasphemy laws and he did not mention the issue in his speech, but promised to protect the rights of minorities.“We will ensure a modern, moderate Pakistan,” Mr. Zardari said. “We will avenge the martyrdom of heroes of democracy by defeating the mind-set that preaches violence and hatred,” he went on.“We must be true to our principles, and we must be strong,” he said. “Being strong means, denouncing what is wrong. And violence, hatred, extremism and intolerance are wrong.” In the climate of fear that followed the killings of the two officials, Mr. Zardari and members of his government were criticized for their weak response in condemning the murders and pursuing their assassins.He also vowed to continue to pursue those behind the death of his wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, during an attack by extremists in 2007 in Rawalpindi, the garrison city adjacent to Islamabad. After a United Nations commission completed its inquiry into her death, the government had brought forward a new prosecution document to court, he said.Her family and her party, the Pakistan Peoples Party, did not want revenge, he said. “We aim at defeating the mind-set that was behind her assassination. As she herself so famously said: ‘Democracy is the best revenge.’ ”“The fight against militancy may be long and bitter, but we have no other option except to win. And win we will, soon, God willing,” he said.'"

"'11-03-24,'1','LOS ANGELES — Imax has reached a deal valued at about $100 million to open 75 new theaters in China, a move that underscores the degree to which the movie exhibition business is surging there.Imax, the large-format film company, said late Wednesday that it would team with China’s largest theater operator, Wanda Cinema Line Corporation, to build the theaters by 2014. Imax currently has 45 theaters open in China, with an additional 57 in the works. The company expects to have 300 theaters operating in China by 2016.“As disposable income has increased in China, the demand for entertainment — particularly a movie experience — has dramatically increased,” said Richard L. Gelfond, Imax’s chief executive. “To meet that demand, the creation of a more robust exhibition infrastructure is crucial.”Terms were not disclosed. Imax investors with knowledge of how the company conducts business overseas estimated that building the theaters would jointly cost Imax and Wanda about $100 million. The new theaters in aggregate could add about $25 million in annual revenue to Imax. The company’s total revenue last year was $250 million.The 75-theater deal is unusual for Imax because the company stands to profit primarily by splitting a share of box-office grosses with Wanda. Until now, the bulk of Imax’s deals in China have involved licensing technology and collecting royalties.'"
"'11-03-24,'1','Nova, a 24-year-old rookie, arrived at spring training with an advantage, and he never lost his grip on a starting job. As much as Colon, 37, has impressed — and surprised — the Yankees by pitching so well, they are not completely convinced that he can last a full season without breaking down. A job in the bullpen would reward Colon, who has not pitched in the majors since July 2009 and has not logged 100 innings in a season since 2005, while also protecting him.Colon has walked only one batter while striking out 17 over 15 exhibition innings and has achieved better results than Garcia, who is notorious for his poor springs and has a 5.93 earned run average. But Girardi reiterated Wednesday that Garcia, scheduled to pitch in a minor-league game Thursday, cannot do anything more to affect his standing. The odd man out, then, would be Sergio Mitre, who filled the long relief and spot starter role for the last one and a half seasons.“I think we have a pretty good feel what Freddy can do,” Girardi said. “And I said that we had a pretty good idea when he came into camp just from watching him and seeing plenty of video of him, watching him compete.”Phil Hughes, whose spot in the rotation has never been in question, pitched seven innings Wednesday in the Yankees’ 5-3 win over the Toronto Blue Jays.BIDEN IN TOWN Vice President Joseph R.

"'11-03-24,'1','This year, with Republicans newly in control of legislatures across the country, many state governments have vowed to pass bills to crack down on illegal immigrants; they include proposals resembling an Arizona law that expanded the powers of police officers to question the immigration status of people they stop.State Senator Daniel L. Squadron, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan who is co-sponsoring the New York bill, said the legislation was prompted by the failure of the Dream Act, which passed the House but was blocked by the Senate in December. “This allows New York to take the lead in a place where the federal government hasn’t yet succeeded,” he said.New York allows illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition, but the bill would give them access to state financial support, including grants, loans and scholarships. Its most ambitious proposals are those seeking to provide certain illegal immigrants with “state identification or driver’s licenses” and “work opportunities with the State of New York.”Mr. Squadron said the bill did not seek to undermine federal laws that prohibit employers from knowingly hiring illegal immigrants. But, he said, it “could potentially expand the state’s options within the federal limits.” He added that he was still studying the potential effects of the bill on employment.To qualify for the benefits of the legislation, an illegal immigrant would need to have entered the United States before age 16, be younger than 35 and have lived in New York for at least two years before the law’s effective date. Among other requirements, the immigrant would have to have completed at least two years of a four-year degree in a college or university in the state, served at least two years in the New York National Guard or completed 910 hours of community service. Convicted felons would not be eligible.Mr. Perkins said that he hoped the bill would attract support in the Legislature, but that he had not yet surveyed his peers or sounded out Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. “Nobody has yet said this is ridiculous, or anything negative in that vein,” Mr. Perkins said.But several officials who loudly opposed Mr. Spitzer’s measure four years ago did not hesitate to criticize the new bill on Wednesday. Homing in on the driver’s license clause, Assemblyman James N. Tedisco, a Republican from Schenectady, said he anticipated opposition to that provision — and, by extension, the bill — would be strong.“It’s just as wrong now as it was under Eliot Spitzer,” he said. “I think it’s a bill to nowhere.”'"
"'11-03-24,'1','“When the Marketing Reach of Social Media Backfires” (Advertising column, March 16) highlighted some of the vast opportunities and potential perils social media afford individuals and brands. The examples from the Chrysler Group and Aflac of what can quickly go wrong and potentially sully a company’s reputation reinforced the golden rule of sustainable corporate trust: credibility matters.What is becoming increasingly difficult for companies to manage, however, is balancing that credibility with the need for amplification of a message, which is why the use of celebrity brand endorsers has proliferated. There is a level of accountability that must exist within social media communications, just as there is within all offline marketing and advertising.The expedient and decisive measures taken by Chrysler and Aflac in light of their recent online missteps, therefore, are commendable. Actions that are consistent, credible and ethical engender strong organizational reputations over time. In both cases, it appears that Chrysler and Aflac have kept this ethos intact even while traversing the sometimes confusing world of online marketing and social media.Rosanna Fiske Chairwoman and Chief Executive Public Relations Society of America New York, March 17, 2011'"
"'11-03-24,'1','The point of civil contempt is coercion rather than punishment, and judges like to say that people held in such circumstances hold the keys to their own jail cells. All they have to do to be released is comply with the court’s order.But Mr. Turner said he was too poor to pay what he owed, which turned his incarceration into pure punishment. He said a lawyer could have helped him convince the judge that jailing him in the circumstances was impermissible.In a series of decisions starting with Gideon v. Wainwright in 1963, the Supreme Court has held that poor people facing the loss of liberty for crimes must be provided with lawyers. But those decisions were rooted in the text of the Sixth Amendment, which concerns only criminal proceedings.A majority of states do provide lawyers to people in Mr. Turner’s situation, as a matter of state law. The question in the case argued Wednesday, Turner v. Rogers, No. 10-10, was whether court-appointed lawyers are required in civil contempt cases as a matter of the due process protections of the federal Constitution.Seth P. Waxman, a lawyer for Mr. Turner, urged the justices to adopt a bright-line rule that anyone facing the loss of liberty should have a lawyer in light of what the Supreme Court has called “the awesome prospect of incarceration.”Some of the justices seemed concerned about how broadly such a ruling might sweep. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for instance, asked about “alimony and palimony.”Mr. Waxman said contempt proceedings in such cases would be covered.Stephanos Bibas, a lawyer for the woman who had sought child support from Mr. Turner, Rebecca L. Rogers, added that a ruling for Mr. Turner would also apply to “tens of thousands of immigration and extradition cases.”“We’re talking about reformulating rules in a huge number of states that probably affect hundreds of thousands of cases,” Mr. Bibas said.Mr. Bibas cautioned the justices against disrupting the informality and effectiveness of child support proceedings in which neither side, he said, tends to be represented by a lawyer.He added that requiring states to provide lawyers might cause them to decide not to pursue deadbeat parents at all. New Jersey, he said, had stopped trying to enforce child support orders through civil contempt after its Supreme Court recognized a right to counsel.Justice Ginsburg questioned the wisdom of that financial calculation, noting that it costs money to lock people up, too.The federal government urged the justices to take a middle ground. Appointing counsel, the government said in its brief, is “a sufficient, but not a necessary, means of satisfying due process in this case.”It would also be enough, the brief said, to give someone facing jail in Mr. Turner’s circumstances “a meaningful opportunity to establish his present inability to pay, such as asking him to complete an understandable form seeking his financial information or asking him questions on the topic as necessary at a hearing.”At the argument on Wednesday, Justice Elena Kagan told a lawyer for the government, Leondra R. Kruger, that the proposal was “remarkably anemic.”“Apparently, your idea of the procedure is just to give the person a form,” Justice Kagan said.Ms. Kruger responded that the government’s proposal also called for notice to the person facing jail, a hearing and a judicial finding that the person is indeed capable of paying.Justice Antonin Scalia said he was frustrated by the government’s proposal for a different reason. The court, he said, had agreed to answer just the question of whether a lawyer must be appointed and not what other procedures might satisfy due process.'"
"'11-03-24,'1','Mr. Brack would rather talk about his working years than money any day. He was the first person to run the company who had not gone to an Ivy League college and also the first chief executive who started his career in sales, not journalism or finance. He also appointed the first female publisher at any Time magazine.But now that Mr. Brack, 73, is working less, he has time to think about his wealth. He sits on several boards, including that of Fieldpoint Private Bank and Trust, which he helped found, in Greenwich, Conn., where he lives. But he is less busy than he was in his days at Time. Financially, he thinks about his cash-flow needs, his charity and his family; he is married with three grown children.Self-made executives often delay wealth planning, said Sharon H. Jacquet, managing director in J. P. Morgan Private Bank, who runs a team that works with senior executives of public and private companies.“Not thinking about finances until retirement is not uncommon,” she said. “Really successful C.E.O.’s put the priority on doing their job as a C.E.O. They have a comfortable lifestyle and adequate financial resources, and they don’t focus on it.”In his professional life, Mr. Brack said he concentrated on work during the week and his family the rest of the time. This helped him be successful, but it also left him in his 70s with a seemingly diffuse financial plan.Early on, he started with an adviser in Allentown, Pa., who persuaded him to sell some of his high concentration of Time Warner stock ahead of his retirement. This diversification helped Mr. Brack, and he remains loyal to his adviser.Mr. Brack chose the Royal Bank of Canada to create his municipal bond portfolio after a search many years ago to determine which firm had the top muni management team. He credits that part of his portfolio with helping him sleep during the financial crisis. “I was frightened, but I was comforted by that muni bond portfolio,” he said.His third adviser, after the team at the Royal Bank, works for Fieldpoint Private Bank and Trust and counsels him on estate issues, equities and new managers.While three advisers may seem like too many cooks in the kitchen, Ms. Jacquet said it could work if one of them had the entire financial and legal picture, even if someone else was managing the assets. Mr. Brack said Fieldpoint has the full picture of his finances.Estate planning is crucial for Mr. Brack and his wife. When they die, there will almost certainly be money left over. But they do not have so much that he feels comfortable taking advantage of the generous gift tax exemption of $5 million per person that is in effect for the next two years. (This is separate from the annual gift exclusion of $13,000.) “That would be a serious diminution to our lifestyle,” he said.The first time he tried to talk to his three children about their estate it was awkward. “The boys were very interested and asked a lot of questions,” he said. “Our daughter put it back in the envelope and said this is not going to happen.”Two years ago, he convened everyone again for a more formal discussion that was moderated by his adviser at Fieldpoint. “All the people who worked with us and our outside attorney were there,” he said. “Our children had questions that were really great.”That said, he limited the meeting to his children, leaving out his daughter-in-law. Ms. Jacquet said this was not uncommon and was not, ultimately, harmful from a planning perspective.“The real issue is they should know what the plans provide for,” she said. “What happens in the event that he is hit by a bus? In some families there is one individual who is responsible, so it doesn’t need to be that everyone knows everything.”One of the things he and his wife have done to keep their family close is set up a foundation to give to charities they like but also to help their children and grandchildren talk openly about the purpose of their wealth. Family members make pitches for particular charities and they all vote on which ones to support.“Our focus is small things where a little bit of money matters,” he said, adding the gifts are under $10,000 and more often around $3,000. “We give five or six grants per year with one or two repeats.”One constant is animal welfare and a charity called Animal Aid Unlimited, which is based in Seattle and runs an animal hospital and shelter in Udaipur, India.He has also set up a charitable remainder trust and put his remaining Time Warner stock in it. The trust essentially pays him a 5 percent annuity on the amount, and when he and his wife die the money will go to the family foundation.“I would suggest that since he has a little more time that he might consider sitting down with the family and framing how they could make their giving more impactful,” Ms. Jacquet said. “If animal welfare is important to them, do they want to have some permanent funding for rescuing animals that are at risk? Is there something they could really do that would be their family legacy?”Mr. Brack said a mission statement was something his family talked about often. They have an out-of-date one. “When something comes up like Haiti or Japan, we say we want to help out, too,” he said.Still, Mr. Brack is better off than many retired executives. He has avoided the major pitfall (after divorce) that befalls many successful executives — not understanding the need for liquid assets and the cash flow necessary to maintain their lifestyles.“My motto is kids first, charity second,” he said. “Our goal is to continue to be able to do the things that are important to us.”'"
"'11-03-24,'1','The only hint of anger Mr. Mainou showed was toward Citibank, which raised the rate on one card to 18.99 percent from 12.99 percent, even though Mr. Mainou said he had never missed a payment.“This is my debt, and I’m going to pay it off,” Mr. Mainou said of the credit card bills. “I didn’t qualify for any student loans, and I was a young guy living beyond my means.”Nor is Ms. Thornburg concerned about the drop in the value of their home. For her, the house represents stability after many years of renting in college and graduate school, and she said she hoped its value would rebound in case they had to sell it in a few years.“I just want to break even,” she said. “Paying $1,100 a month on a mortgage was better than paying $1,100 to someone else for rent.”They both said their attitudes toward money were formed when they were young. Ms. Thornburg described herself as “middle middle class” with two brothers, a father who worked as a scientist and a mother who stayed at home. Her upbringing in Pittsburgh was modest, she said, yet she had all she needed. “I hate, hate, hate to think about money,” she said. “I really just want to have enough so we have enough food on our table and a safe home. I want to be able to live well and retire.” She added, “Having more money is never going to make me any happier.”Mr. Mainou, who grew up in Mexico City, said his father had made a good living for quite a while, but lost his film business during the peso devaluation and recession in the mid-1990s. Then the family learned that his father had saved little.“It was always spend now, think about the future later,” he said. “I inherited some of those traits, but I became more conservative with my money and thinking about the future.”When they considered their finances, Mr. Mainou and Ms. Thornburg’s top priorities were working their way out of credit card debt, saving in case something went wrong and figuring out child care come May, when their time off ends. The child care alone could range from $600 to $1,200 a month depending on where they place their son.While all their concerns are valid, said Liz Durrell, a certified financial planner with LPL/Financial Advocates in Portland, Ore., their top priorities should be different.The couple should instead focus on increasing their emergency fund, taking out life and disability insurance and paying off all nonmortgage debt, starting with the smallest piece and working their way up, said Ms. Durrell, 30, who has worked with many young academics at Portland State University.“The emergency fund is No. 1,” Ms. Durrell said. “Clients say if I’m paying down more on my credit cards, then it’s there when I need it. No, it’s not. Banks could reduce their credit limits. The only thing that is there is cash.”Insurance is necessary now because Mr. Mainou and Ms. Thornburg have a child, Ms. Durrell said, suggesting term life insurance with coverage of at least $600,000. That could cost as little as $50 a month, given the couple’s ages and occupations.Ms. Durrell also recommended disability insurance, which is always much more expensive than life insurance. She said that was necessary in case one of them could not work for some health reason.Even if the insurance process was gradual, it should start now, Ms. Durrell said, adding, “I may not be able to get them to the optimal level of both, but at least they’ll have something.”When it comes to credit card debt, Mr. Mainou and Ms. Thornburg have plenty of company. Ms. Durrell said her biggest battle with her clients in their 30s was on this front; too many of them have grown accustomed to carrying credit card balances because their friends do the same.“One of the things with working with young people is to coach them not to feel comfortable with credit card debt, even if society says it’s O.K.,” Ms. Durrell said.Asked about the unexplained spike in Mr. Mainou’s credit card rate, Sean Kevelighan, a spokesman for Citibank, said, “Repricing was necessary given the doubling of credit card losses across the industry from customers not paying back their loans and regulatory changes that eliminate repricing for that risk.”He said the bank had decided to lower Mr. Mainou’s rate to 16.99 percent even before an inquiry from The New York Times.Mr. Mainou and Ms. Thornburg said their conversation with Ms. Durrell had changed the way they thought about money. (Mr. Mainou also said he was not pleased with Citibank’s explanation.)They said they were going to look into finding insurance immediately, but the switch from paying down debt to putting money into an emergency fund was going to be more difficult.“That is making me twitchy,” Ms. Thornburg said. “The idea that debt is bad has been drilled into our heads. But if you have it, the last thing you should be doing is paying your minimum.”The eye-opening moment for the couple, who both have Ph.D.’s in microbiology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, came when they realized that they had overlooked facts in their personal finances in a way they never would in their work.“We’re scientists, so we spend the bulk of our lives being data-driven,” Mr. Mainou said. “We managed to live 30 years of our lives without looking at the financial data.”Ms. Thornburg said changing how they thought about money would be hard, but she was glad to have the chance to do it now, while their son was young.“It’s going to be more time and effort that we don’t necessarily have,” she said. “We have a baby and we’ll do it for him. We don’t want to be a drain on him. We want to send him to college like my parents did for me.”'"
"'11-03-24,'1','Mr. Langerfeld, a master repairman, would keep busy maintaining the motel, while Mrs. Langerfeld, a fastidious record keeper, would handle the books.“We figured it was a good investment and would give us something to do,” she said.They discussed their situation with Kathleen Rehl, a financial planner and author in Land O’Lakes, Fla., who, as a 64-year-old widow, is thinking about phasing into retirement herself. She calculated their net worth at $1.2 million. Their only debts are $20,000 in education loans for a son and a $10,000 401(k) loan.“Right now, they are standing at the abyss, and they have lots of risk in their life,” said Ms. Rehl, who said she had major reservations about the motel.The Langerfelds do not know how much their house will fetch, but the motel would lock up at least $200,000. Then there is the business risk, though the couple has met with the motel owners and studied their finances. They must also run the motel for two years before they can apply for permanent resident status, which an immigration lawyer said they were likely, but not guaranteed, to get. And it could be tough to sell the motel if they needed to.Though healthy now, the Langerfelds have had three cancers, heart bypass surgery and a minor stroke between them. Mr. Langerfeld would qualify for Medicare by the time they got there, and could easily go to Maine for treatment. But Mrs. Langerfeld would have to buy health insurance for the three months they said it would take them to get Canadian health care.Ms. Rehl raised other questions: Can either of them run the motel alone? What is their exit strategy? The Langerfelds said the current owners ran the motel five months a year.“Jumping into the motel business would be challenging,” Ms. Rehl said. Ideally, she would want Mr. Langerfeld to wait until full retirement age to collect Social Security, which would yield a bigger check, for him and for his wife, should she live longer.Ms. Rehl suggested selling the Tampa house first, then renting for two years while they still worked. Mrs. Langerfeld did not dismiss that idea. Still, she expressed a sense of urgency if they were going to proceed with the motel. They said they were more likely to gain permanent residence status in Canada sooner than later. “We’re lucky to have the years that we have, after all the health scares,” she added. “I want to do something else.”Here is what their income picture would look like: if they clear at least $400,000 from their Tampa home — it is worth $502,000, according to Zillow, the real estate Web site — and use the proceeds to buy the motel and their friends’ share of the home, their $720,000 would remain intact.So Ms. Rehl estimated the Langerfelds would have $67,000 in income — $38,000 from Social Security and nearly $29,000 from savings, assuming a 4 percent withdrawal rate. Since the bulk of their retirement money is in traditional Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k)s, she said they would owe about $2,000 in federal taxes on that income. But she suggested they speak with an expert in cross-border tax issues.The motel income would be extra, and the Langerfelds said their cost of living in Canada would be much lower. Ms. Rehl said they spent $100,000 in 2009, excluding their savings, but the Langerfelds said it was an unusually expensive year because of their two sons’ weddings and Mrs. Langerfeld’s mother’s funeral. Ms. Rehl said if they downsized in Florida, they would have more money from which to draw. But the Langerfelds said their cost of living would be higher.Then there is their portfolio, where stocks, precious metals and mining investments account for 72 percent of their money — far too risky for their age. “I had to take the risk because we didn’t have enough money to retire,” said Mrs. Langerfeld, who handles the investments. “It has been a successful ploy.”But she knows her luck could turn quickly, and is ready to shift into something safer. In fact, she was not certain she wanted to put as much as 40 percent into stock index funds, which Ms. Rehl had suggested, since she predicts the market is headed for a fall.For now, the Langerfelds are honest about the myriad risks of the motel and continue to do research. Mr. Langerfeld said it would ultimately be an emotional decision. “There are so many factors beyond our control,” he said, “that there is really no way to make a logical decision.”'"
"'11-03-24,'1','Ria and Yiouri Augousti raised many eyebrows back in 1990 when they introduced a collection of home furnishings covered in exotic skins like shagreen and snakeskin. In the decades since, their company, the Paris-based R&Y Augousti, has gained quite a following, but it wasn’t until two weeks ago that they opened their first American showroom, at the New York Design Center.“Prior to this, we’d pop in twice a year to do a trade show, but you cannot bring everything to a show,” said Yiouri Augousti. “Ria and I felt a showroom would allow us to have a more proper representation of our brand. Clients can come in, look at different color schemes and not feel rushed.”The selection includes small items like decorative boxes and frames, as well as larger pieces like lamps, side tables, chairs and desks.

"'11-03-24,'1','The title of Christiane Lemieux’s book, which she wrote with Rumaan Alam, “Undecorate” ($40, Clarkson Potter), is a bit deceptive. While the 20 spaces shown may not be “decorated” in the traditional sense, they are very stylish.“These people do have very sophisticated taste,” said Ms. Lemieux, the founder and creative director of DwellStudio. “And they are constantly tweaking their interiors. Now, with interior design, there is no start and finish. People are always changing, sharing, getting their friends to weigh in on it.”Ms. Lemieux credits the Web in large part for the phenomenon of interiors that evolve and reflect the owners in a stylishly imperfect way: “It used to be the people with the super-cool eclectic houses went to estate sales and got a first look at everything. Now you have access to a very cool flea market, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The popularity of that eclectic interior is because it’s achievable now.”'"
"'11-03-24,'1','As they did earlier in Greece and Ireland, protesters have taken to the streets in bitter opposition to the Portuguese government’s program.“The opposition removed from the government the conditions to govern,” the prime minister said in a televised address. With this vote by Parliament, he added, “I am convinced that Portugal today has lost, rather than won.”The collapse of Portugal’s government comes at a particularly awkward time for the European Union. An attempt to increase the size of the union’s 440-billion-euro rescue fund has been resisted by more prosperous European countries like Finland and Germany.Europe’s leaders are set to meet on Thursday and Friday to complete plans for broadening this fund — a step aimed at giving investors confidence that Europe is prepared to handle more emergencies not just in Portugal, but perhaps also Spain.Once again, however, tensions among Europe’s faster-growing economies and its debt-plagued periphery is creating a bureaucratic paralysis, feeding investor fears that divisions on the Continent have not yet healed.Portugal needs to borrow about 20 billion euros this year, with most of that refinancing to be done before the summer. Many analysts have been predicting an imminent bailout because Portugal’s borrowing costs have reached a level in recent weeks that its finance minister described as unsustainable in the medium or long term.“What has really triggered this political crisis is the perception that all the efforts that were made over the past year to solve our financial problems have come to nothing and that we would not be able to avoid going the same way as Greece and Ireland,” said Rui Ramos, a political analyst and professor of political history at the University of Lisbon.Ahead of the vote, Mr. Sócrates had warned that parliamentary rejection of his latest austerity measures would prompt him to quit. The main Social Democratic opposition party, however, had warned it would oppose an austerity package that would inflict further pain on Portuguese citizens, notably by raising taxes for pensioners.Instead, the Social Democrats demanded a snap general election, possibly opening the door for the formation of a coalition government between Portugal’s main parties.In the end, lawmakers from all five opposition parties rejected further austerity measures, leaving 97 Socialist lawmakers to vote in favor the plan, out of 230 members of Parliament. The Socialist government of Mr. Sócrates had been in power for six years, but was governing without a parliamentary majority.It will now be the president’s task to dissolve Parliament and call a general election, probably in about two months.“The electorate is now very divided, so there is a real risk that an election will not give any party an absolute majority and bring the political clarity that we really need,” said Pedro Lomba, a lawyer and political columnist for Público, a Portuguese newspaper. “A new government must be strong enough to implement the measures that these difficult financial circumstances require.”In recent weeks, the yield on Portugal’s benchmark 10-year bonds has stayed above 7 percent — a level that Fernando Teixeira dos Santos, the finance minister, told lawmakers earlier this month would prove unsustainable for Portugal in the medium and long term.The government had said that a further austerity package — blending spending cuts with tax changes — would be sufficient to avoid emergency financing and meet the government’s goal of cutting its budget deficit from an estimated 7.3 percent of gross domestic product last year to 4.6 percent this year. Portugal has been among a handful of euro nations in investors’ line of fire for the last year after posting a record deficit of 9.3 percent in 2009.This week, the Socialists laid the blame on the opposition Socialist Democrats for escalating tensions just ahead of a European Union summit meeting that was supposed to help ailing euro economies like Portugal avoid emergency financing.Concerns had been growing about Portugal’s economic outlook. Portugal is struggling with a record unemployment rate of 11.2 percent, and the Bank of Portugal recently forecast that the economy would contract 1.3 percent this year. Further, the government’s plan prompted hundreds of thousands of Portuguese to take to the streets this month, as evidence of rising social unrest.'"
"'11-03-24,'1','To assess the value of its software, Prometheus had to engage potential clients to determine what problems HTSQL might solve for them. The management team debated who was best equipped to initiate those conversations.THE OPTIONS Though Dr. Rozenblit and his staff were busy serving existing clients, he considered pursuing corporate accounts himself. After all, no one knew the product and its possibilities better. They also thought about reallocating several employees to approach organizations with large data management needs.As a slightly more ambitious option, they considered hiring a junior sales representative to try to gauge the potential demand for HTSQL and to pursue new business. An employee at this level would be paid about $60,000 base salary, plus commission.Finally, Dr. Rozenblit considered hiring a more expensive and experienced sales representative to cultivate relationships and help shape the way HTSQL would be deployed by future clients. A senior representative would command $150,000 to $200,000 in base salary, plus commission.THE DECISION Dr. Rozenblit chose the last option. In November 2009, he hired Peter Harker, a senior salesman with nearly 20 years of experience selling technology, to lead the product introduction.Dr. Rozenblit acknowledged that his decision was risky, in part because it forced him to cede some control over the trajectory of his business. Dr. Rozenblit said he wanted to stay connected to the process while removing himself from the daily demands of sales. He decided to include Mr. Harker in all executive team meetings so they could work together to determine how to approach new markets. “How do you let go of your baby?” he asked. “It would have been really hard for me five or seven years ago, but I’m a more experienced manager now.”Dr. Rozenblit tried to assess his own limitations. Because his team could not define exactly how corporate clients would use HTSQL, he believed that Prometheus needed an experienced representative who had credibility with executive decision-makers and who could prompt a discussion about how HTSQL might help their businesses. “We were effective at selling ourselves to scientists,” he said, “but we had no contacts in the markets we thought were most promising. We needed someone who knew about enterprise software sales.”Dr. Rozenblit said he believed Mr. Harker had the right blend of product and sales knowledge, and enough credibility to command attention from senior executives. He had a history of joining early-stage companies and helping identify new markets for cutting-edge technology. He had also been an entrepreneur himself, so he understood the scrappy culture and fiscal constraints of fledgling companies.Though Dr. Rozenblit’s decision was the most costly of his options, he viewed it as part of a strategic investment required to build the business. To commercialize HTSQL, he decided, Prometheus would spend about $1.5 million, including Mr. Harker’s low six-figure salary and commission, which ranges from 8 to 12 percent for software sales and from 4 to 8 percent for the sale of services. Mr. Harker was also promised he would be awarded 1 to 2 percent of the company’s total value, provided growth goals were met.“We had to go into cash-flow negative while building this product,” Dr. Rozenblit said. “It was certainly hard to make the final call and authorize a high salary, but here you get what you pay for. We had plenty of lower-cost people who were interested in the job, but we didn’t think they could meet our needs.”WHAT OTHERS SAY Steve Blank, a serial entrepreneur who sold his last company, E.piphany, for $329 million, and teaches entrepreneurship at the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University: “I normally say that founders have to get out of the building to lead the customer-discovery process themselves, but he already has. This is not a typical entrepreneur who hired a V.P. of sales on Day 1. He built a business in an area where he was a domain expert. The insight he’s gained is that there’s a bigger pile of money in another market, and he’s made the pivot to go after it. He was smart enough to realize he needed a domain expert in that larger market. It’s exactly what he should be doing, as long as he doesn’t forget that he ultimately needs to be the judge of how this guy is doing in that other market. Young entrepreneurs fall in love with sales guys because they have these Rolodexes. They confuse ‘I got a meeting’ with ’I got an order.’ ”Mike Pasley, president of Central Packaging, a company based in Kansas City, Kan., that markets packaging supplies and equipment: “He was right not to do it himself and lose focus on his current accounts, because the best customers are always existing customers. But I would have hired the junior salesperson who could give you customer feedback at the lowest possible rate. It’s a longer cycle to generate sales revenue, but you can train, direct and inform them. An experienced salesperson almost never brings his entire book of business, but he always comes with his entire baggage. Sometimes it’s hard to bring them around to your way of doing things, and you’re more likely to have conflict on style and approach.”Christian Heidelberger, chief executive of Nexaweb Technologies, a company based in Burlington, Mass., that helps clients adopt “cloud” computing: “I agree with his decision. It’s clear he understood the ramifications of each option and was emotionally prepared to delegate responsibility. The challenge is finding the right blend of skills.”Andrew Straub, chief executive of Renewal Property Services, a business in Jenison, Mich., that provides painting and cleaning services for property management companies and colleges: “I would have taken a chance on the right junior guy. As long as the junior guy projects confidence, professionalism and problem-solving skills, he’ll get results.”THE RESULTS To offer your thoughts on Dr. Rozenblit’s decision, go to the You’re the Boss blog at nytimes.com/boss.

"'11-03-24,'1','KAMPALA, Uganda — The Ugandan government has engaged in torture, illegal detention and extrajudicial killings of its citizens, according to a report released on Wednesday.The report, by Human Rights Watch, focuses on the activities of an agency known as the Rapid Response Unit, a branch of the Uganda police service created to tackle violent crime. The unit has also become an ally of the United States in combating terrorism. Most recently, it helped investigate the terrorist attacks in Uganda’s capital, Kampala, during the World Cup last year, in which more than 70 people died.The report says that members of the unit, called the R.R.U., have repeatedly broken the law. “Since the unit was established, R.R.U. officers and affiliated personnel have carried out arrests for a wide range of crimes, from petty theft to terrorism,” it said.The Ugandan government declined to comment on the report.Of 77 people interviewed, Human Rights Watch said, 60 said they had been tortured by members of the unit. Common abuses included beatings on wrists, ankles, knees and elbows while suspects were handcuffed in stress positions.“R.R.U. personnel beat detainees with batons, sticks, bats, metal pipes, padlocks, table legs and other objects,” the report said. “Suspects often said they were forced to sign confessions under duress following torture.”'"
"'11-03-24,'1','Despite the frequent rain in recent days, it was not entirely clear why the levels of iodine were so high, said a senior Western nuclear executive, noting that the prevailing breezes seemed to be pushing radiation out to sea. “The contamination levels are well beyond what you’d expect from what is in the public domain,” said the executive, who insisted on anonymity and has broad contacts in Japan.It was possible that the levels were an indirect indication that the problems at the plant were deeper than had been publicly acknowledged.The daily Asahi Shimbun cited the Health Ministry as saying that drinking the water would hurt neither a pregnant woman nor her fetus, and that it was safe for bathing and other everyday activities.But experts say that pregnant women, and fetuses, as well as children, face the greatest danger from radioactive iodine, which is taken in by the thyroid gland and can cause . Children are at much higher risk than adults because they are growing, and their thyroid glands are more active and in need of iodine. In addition, the gland is smaller in children than in adults, so a given amount of iodine 131 will deliver a higher dose of radiation to a child’s thyroid and potentially do more harm.According to the , if an adult and a child ingest the same amount of radioactive iodine, the thyroid dose will be 16 times higher to a newborn than to an adult; for a child under 1 year old, eight times the adult dose; for a 5-year-old, four times the adult dose.Pregnant women also take up more iodine 131 in the thyroid, especially in the first trimester. The iodine crosses the placenta and reaches the fetus, and the fetal thyroid takes up more iodine as progresses. During the first week after birth a baby’s thyroid activity increases up to fourfold and stays at that level for a few days, so newborns are especially vulnerable.Potassium iodide can protect the thyroid by saturating it with normal iodine. People in Japan have been advised to take it.The 1986 accident at Chernobyl caused an epidemic of thyroid cancer — 6,000 cases so far — in people who were exposed as children. The culprit was milk produced by cows that had grazed on grass heavily carpeted by fallout. The epidemic could probably have been prevented if people in the region had been told not to drink milk and if they had been given potassium iodide.The warning Wednesday applied to Tokyo’s 23 wards, as well as to the towns of Mitaka, Tama, Musashino, Machida and Inagi to the west. At a press briefing on Thursday, Mr. Edano said radiation had also shown up in tests of water supplies for two of Tokyo’s neighboring prefectures, Chiba and Saitama, in levels above the maximum recommended limits for infants, but below levels considered dangerous to adults.At a Lawson convenience store in the Tsukiji neighborhood of central Tokyo, the shelves were about half-stocked with water. A clerk said he had restocked them just an hour before.“People came in and cleared us out in the first hour after the announcement,” he said, saying he did not want to be identified because he did not want to anger his boss. “They were taking 20 or 30 bottles at a time.”Outside the store a man struggling to load more than 30 half-liter bottles on his bicycle said he had bought the water for his wife, who is seven months pregnant.“Tap water is O.K. for me,” he said, asking that he be identified only by his family name, Takahashi. “But all they said was that babies shouldn’t drink it. They haven’t said anything about what pregnant women should do.”“We’re going to stay in Tokyo for now,” Mr. Takahashi, 31, said, “unless the reactor problem gets worse.”The city government said it would begin distributing 240,000 bottles of water on Thursday to families with children younger than 1 year, the broadcaster NHK reported. There are about 80,000 such children in the affected zone, NHK said. Outside Tokyo, the government said it had found radioactive materials exceeding legal limits in 11 vegetables in Fukushima Prefecture, the Kyodo news agency reported. Shipments of the affected vegetables from there ended on Monday. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Kan also suspended shipments of raw milk and parsley from neighboring Ibaraki Prefecture, Kyodo reported.The United States Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday that it would prohibit imports of dairy goods and produce from the affected region. also banned food and milk imports from the area. on Wednesday imposed stricter controls on milk products, fruits and vegetables, and on Thursday imposed new restrictions on food products including seaweed and seafood.Mr. Kan’s office said Wednesday that rebuilding after the 9.0-magnitude quake and tsunami would cost up to $309 billion. The , citing private estimates, said on Monday that the figure could reach $235 billion.The economic cost of the disaster has hit the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates the crippled nuclear plant and is in negotiations with its bankers for of as much as $24 billion, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation who asked not to be identified.The Associated Press reported on Wednesday that the official death toll from the disaster had been raised to more than 9,500, with more than 16,000 people missing, although officials said there could be overlap between the figures.Meanwhile, a magnitude 6.0 quake shook Fukushima Prefecture in the morning, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency, followed by a magnitude 5.8 about 20 minutes later.'"

Freeport McMoran, Newmont Mining and Alcoa all rose more than 3 percent.Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, said that “headline risk” from events overseas eased on Wednesday. “The market doesn’t seem to be as obsessed with headlines from the Middle East and Japan,” she said.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 67.39 points, or 0.56 percent, to 12,086.02, while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 3.77 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,297.54. The Nasdaq composite index was up 14.43 points, or 0.54 percent, to 2,698.30.The Commerce Department said Wednesday that sales of new homes fell 16.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 250,000 in February, the lowest levels on record.

"'11-03-25,'1','What went wrong? The chief executive, Kerry K. Killinger, talked about a bubble but was also convinced that Wall Street would reward the bank for taking on more risk. He kept on doing so, amassing what proved to be an almost unbelievably bad book of mortgage loans. Nothing was done about the office where fraud seemed rampant.The regulators “on the ground” saw problems, as James G. Vanasek, the bank’s former chief risk officer, told me, but the ones in Washington saw their job as protecting a “client” and took no effective action. The bank promised change, but did not deliver. It installed programs to spot fraud, and then failed to use them. The board told management to fix problems but never followed up.WaMu, as the bank was known, is back in the news because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation sued Mr. Killinger and two other former top officials of the bank last week, seeking to “hold these three highly paid senior executives, who were chiefly responsible for WaMu’s higher-risk home-lending program, accountable for the resulting losses.”Mr. Killinger responded by going on the attack. His lawyers called the suit “baseless and unworthy of the government.” Mr. Killinger, they said, deserved praise for his excellent management.I’ll let the courts sort out whether Mr. Killinger will become the rare banker to be penalized for making disastrously bad loans. But I am fascinated by how his bank came to make those loans despite his foresight.Answers are available, or at least suggested, in the mass of documents collected and released by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which held hearings on WaMu last year. Mr. Killinger wanted both the loan book and profits to rise rapidly, and saw risky loans as a means to those ends.Moreover, this was a market in which a bank that did not reduce lending standards would lose a lot of business. A decision to publicly decry the spread of high-risk lending and walk away from it — something Mr. Vanasek proposed before he retired at the end of 2005 — might have saved the bank in the long run. In the short run, it would have devastated profits.Ronald J. Cathcart, who became the chief risk officer in 2006, told a Senate hearing he pushed for more controls but ran into resistance. The bank’s directors, he said, were interested in hearing about problems that regulators identified over and over again. “But,” he added, “there was little consequence to these problems not being fixed.”There were consequences for him. He was fired in 2008 after he took his concerns about weak controls and rising losses to both the board and to regulators from the Office of Thrift Supervision.By early 2007, the subprime mortgage market was collapsing, and the bank was trying to rush out securitizations before that market vanished. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a secondary regulator, was pushing to impose tighter regulation, but the primary regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, was successfully resisting allowing the F.D.I.C. to even look at the bank’s loan files.In June of that year, amid evidence that home prices were falling in some of the areas of California and Florida where WaMu had its greatest concentration of loans, Mr. Killinger was crowing that he had been right. “For the past two years, we have been predicting the bursting of the housing bubble,” he wrote in a memo to the company’s directors. “That scenario has now turned into a reality.”That was, however, no reason to turn his back on the high-risk loans. Instead, he wanted to keep more such loans for the bank, rather than sell them in securitizations. He viewed WaMu as overcapitalized by $7 billion and said reducing its capital — and attractiveness to a potential acquirer — was a “must do.”In Washington, concern over highly risky mortgages had been growing, and in 2006 regulators issued guidance about them. The Office of Thrift Supervision fought to weaken the guidance, and when it met with WaMu after the guidance came out, its officials told the bank not to worry.“They specifically pointed out,” a WaMu official wrote in a memo after meeting with regulators, “that the language in the guidance says ‘should,’ vs. ‘must’ in most cases and they are looking to WaMu to establish our own position of how the guidance impacts our business processes.”As things got worse and worse in 2008, the regulators resisted taking any enforcement action, despite pleas by the F.D.I.C. Finally, on July 3, John M. Reich, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, notified Mr. Killinger that they would take harsher action than the bank had wanted, by requiring the bank to sign a memorandum of understanding. He did so in an apologetic e-mail, saying he had written only after Mr. Killinger failed to return a couple of phone calls.Mr. Reich promised the action would be kept confidential, and said action was needed in part because “if someone were looking over our shoulders, they would probably be surprised” the regulator had not acted long before.By then it was too late. After Lehman Brothers failed in September, depositors fled and the bank was closed. The vast majority of its loans were based on “stated income,” and it turned out that there were more than a few liars among the borrowers. Its $178 billion in mortgage loans went to JPMorgan Chase, which promptly concluded that about two-thirds of them were impaired. It took a $30 billion write-down, but that proved inadequate. It has written off another $5 billion since.The Dodd-Frank law abolished the Office of Thrift Supervision, in part because of the WaMu failure.To Carl Levin, the Michigan senator who heads the subcommittee that investigated WaMu, a lesson is that “you need cops on the beat.” I doubt it is that simple. There were cops at the thrift office, and the ones on the ground found lots of problems that their bosses did little about. There were also cops inside WaMu. But they were neutered, ignored and eventually pushed aside. The board passed appropriate resolutions, but did nothing to stop the rot.A few decades ago, I recall the chairman of one large bank explaining why his bank had joined in the lending folly of that era — lending to developing countries that needed money to pay rising oil prices.If his bank had not joined in, he said, business would have gone elsewhere, and his bank would no longer have been a major lender.So it was with WaMu. It had identified Countrywide Financial as a model to emulate, and any other course would have surrendered market share, not to mention the immediate profits that financed huge paychecks for executives.Was that illegal? A court will decide, assuming no settlement is reached. Perhaps a judge will be impressed by all the formalities that Mr. Killinger’s lawyers listed in rising to his defense:“Washington Mutual’s management structure was a model of corporate governance,” they wrote. “The mortgage lending practices of the bank were established by a professional corps of bankers and risk managers with extensive experience in home lending. Those practices were in turn carefully reviewed and monitored by independent credit risk management and board committees. An internal audit group similarly reported directly to an audit committee of the board to assure compliance with law and management objectives. The work of the management and board committees were, in turn, subject to continuous review and scrutiny by outside auditors and, perhaps most importantly, by federal bank regulators.”Senator Levin’s view of the bank is more pithy.“It was a model,” he said, “of corporate ineptitude, greed and wrongdoing.”'"
"'11-03-25,'1','A Russian court sentenced six men involved in a rare case of European piracy to 7 to 12 years in prison on Thursday for their roles in the hijacking of a cargo ship off the coast of Sweden in July 2009, Russian news agencies reported. The men were among a team of eight hijackers, mostly residents of Estonia, charged with commandeering the ship and 15 Russian crew members and ferrying it through European waters out into the Atlantic Ocean. The Russian Navy eventually tracked down the ship, Arctic Sea. It was officially carrying cheap timber, though the heavy-handed rescue operation fueled rumors that it was smuggling illicit cargo. Russian investigators denied this. The two other hijackers were convicted earlier.'"

The folk rock duo the Indigo Girls performed their song “Shame on You” with lyrics adapted for the rally. Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat who was a leader in the civil rights movement of the 1960s, urged the crowd to fight. “I was beaten, left bloody, but I didn’t give up, and you must not give up,” he said. Sponsors of the legislation say the bills are necessary to fight illegal immigration because the federal government has not solved the problem.'"
"'11-03-25,'1','Yet in setting these dark elements to sunny melodies, “The Book of Mormon” achieves something like a miracle. It both makes fun of and ardently embraces the all-American art form of the inspirational book musical. No Broadway show has so successfully had it both ways since Mel Brooks adapted his film “The Producers” for the stage a decade ago. Directed by Casey Nicholaw and Mr. Parker, with choreography by Mr. Nicholaw, “The Book of Mormon” has its tasty cake (from an old family recipe) and eats it with sardonic relish.If you know “South Park,” the 14-year-old animated sitcom about four naturally impious young lads, then you will know that Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone take a schoolboy’s delight in throwing spitballs at things sacred, including most major religions. But you also may have gathered that these men take equal pleasure in the transcendent, cathartic goofiness of song-and-dance numbers. (As students they collaborated on the low-budget film “Cannibal! The Musical,” and their 1999 feature-length film, “South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut,” is one of the best movie musicals of recent years.)As the composer of “Avenue Q” — which took public-television-style teaching songs out of the kindergarten and put them into post-collegiate urban life — Mr. Lopez helped bring to Broadway young adults who had grown up on “Sesame Street.” And Mr. Nicholaw has demonstrated an affinity for savvy, high-energy musical pastiche with his work on shows like “Spamalot” and “The Drowsy Chaperone.”Now, as a team, Messrs. Stone, Parker, Lopez and Nicholaw have created the ideal production for both the post-“Avenue Q” kids — the ones who wallow in the show tunes of “Glee” without shame and appear on YouTube lip-syncing to cast albums — and their older, less hip relatives. “The Book of Mormon” is utterly fluent in the language of musical entertainment from vaudeville to anthem-laden poperettas like “Les Misérables” and beyond. And it uses this vocabulary with a mixture of reverence and ridicule in which, I would say, reverence has the upper hand.Which brings us, inevitably, to the issue of sacrilege. This show makes specific use of the teachings of the Mormon Church and especially of the ecclesiastical history from which the play takes its title. Church founders like Joseph Smith and Brigham Young appear in illustrative sequences, as does Jesus and an angel named Moroni. When delivered in musical-comedy style, these vignettes float into the high altitudes of absurdity.But a major point of “The Book of Mormon” is that when looked at from a certain angle, all the forms of mythology and ritual that allow us to walk through the shadows of daily life and death are, on some level, absurd; that’s what makes them so valiant and glorious. And by the way, that includes the religion of the musical, which lends ecstatic shape and symmetry to a world that often feels overwhelmingly formless.All the folks involved in “Mormon” prove themselves worthy, dues-paying members of the church of Broadway. Whether evoking Salt Lake City-style spic-and-span-ness or squalid poverty in a drought-plagued village, Scott Pask’s sets and Ann Roth’s costumes have exactly the right heightened brightness, which stops short of the cartoonish. And as sung and danced, the production numbers have the pep and shimmer of yesteryear’s showstoppers.Set to eminently hummable melodies, Mr. Nicholaw’s superb choreography (his best to date) manages to evoke the tap orgies of Busby Berkeley, the zoological pageantry of “The Lion King,” the calisthenic boogieing of latter-day Broadway and even Martha Graham-style Americana. These numbers are witty, ridiculous, impeccably executed, genuinely stirring and — contrary to expectation — free of snark or satirical malice.Nearly all of them are surprising, and I don’t want to give away much. But allow me to single out my personal favorites. “Turn It Off” is a hilarious chorus-line piece about repression, performed by the (all-male Mormon) missionaries and destined to make a star of its lead singer and dancer, Rory O’Malley (whose character is repressed in his own special way). And then — oh, bliss — there’s “Joseph Smith American Moses,” a spirited, innocently obscenity-laden reworking of Jerome Robbins’s “Small House of Uncle Thomas” sequence from “The King and I.”The book is not quite on the level of the production numbers. (Isn’t that always the way with musicals?) The fractious bromance between Elder Price (Mr. Rannells), a human Ken doll, and Elder Cunningham (Mr. Gad), a portly, hysteria-prone slob, will seem standard issue to anyone who has attended buddy comedy flicks since, oh, the 1980s. Mr. Gad’s character, in the mold of Jack Black and Zach Galifianakis, is a variation on a screen type you can’t get away from these days.But Mr. Gad remains likable and funny (especially doing Bono in a number called “I Am Africa”), while Mr. Rannells makes brilliant use of his character’s narcissism, which isn’t so far from the impulse that animates musical stage stars. As Nabulungi, the smart, dewy village girl who dreams of Salt Lake City, the sweet but savvy Nikki M. James gives a lovely, funny performance, never winking at her character’s earnestness. And for combining polish, enthusiasm and individuality, the ensemble is the best in a musical since Susan Stroman’s team for “The Producers.”In a number that perfectly captures the essence of this happily paradoxical show, Mr. Rannells’s character beards the den of the evil warlord (Brian Tyree Henry) and, much like Julie Andrews in “The Sound of Music,” sings radiantly of his faith and hope and determination. The warlord isn’t buying any of it, and the priceless contrast between attitudes here is the difference between the world of musicals and the world of real life.“The Book of Mormon” thoroughly understands this difference. This makes all the sweeter its celebration of the privilege, for just a couple of hours, of living inside that improbable paradise called a musical comedy.Book, music and lyrics by Trey Parker, Robert Lopez and Matt Stone; directed by Casey Nicholaw and Mr. Parker; choreography by Mr. Nicholaw; music direction and vocal arrangements by Stephen Oremus; sets by Scott Pask; costumes by Ann Roth; lighting by Brian MacDevitt; sound by Brian Ronan; hair design by Josh Marquette; production stage manager, Karen Moore; orchestrations by Larry Hochman and Mr. Oremus; dance music arrangements by Glen Kelly; music coordinator, Michael Keller; production manager, Aurora Productions; general manager, STP/David Turner.

"'11-03-25,'1','The N.B.A. regular season comprises 82 games for all 30 teams, but the games are not distributed evenly. At some point, back-to-back games stack up to resemble a baseball schedule more than an N.B.A. one.The Knicks are in that portion of their season. They will play 18 games in March; 12 will be games played on consecutive days. Since the All-Star break in mid-February, the Knicks have had consecutive days without a game only once.Another off day will be lost when they host the Orlando Magic for the second time in six days on Monday to make up a November game that was postponed because of asbestos-related concerns after debris fell at Madison Square Garden.The effect of the frequent games might have culminated in the Knicks’ loss to Orlando on Wednesday, when Amar’e Stoudemire finished with 13 points, his fewest as a Knick. He admitted to fatigue as early as the first quarter, but played 39 ½ minutes.Immediately after the game the Knicks scheduled a practice for Thursday, then quickly canceled it after Stoudemire and Coach Mike D’Antoni talked.“We’ve played 14 games in the last 20 days and he’s been carrying us throughout the whole year and that’s it,” D’Antoni said. “I play him a lot of minutes and we keep talking about playing too many minutes. To get where we are, I had to, and we’re trying to get into the playoffs and he’s paying for it a bit, but we’ll snap back.”'"
"'11-03-25,'1','Starz, the pay cable channel, is about to be more restrictive about what it allows Netflix to stream to customers’ computers and television sets.The channel has been one of Netflix’s closest partners, but it backed off a bit from that partnership on Thursday, when it announced a three-month delay between the time Starz plays new TV episodes and when those episodes will be available on Netflix. Starz also said that it would impose a similar delay for movies sometime in the future, though Netflix said any such delay of movies would violate the contract between the two companies.The policy shift by Starz, a unit of Liberty Media, reflects an attitude change toward Netflix by many in Hollywood. Though Netflix, which has more than 20 million subscribers, has been embraced by media companies as a new buyer of library content, it is perceived by some of those companies as a competitive threat. Starz, after all, relies on subscriber revenue just as Netflix does.Showtime, a unit of the CBS Corporation, is also expected to place new restrictions on the shows it streams through Netflix later this year.Last week, Netflix said it would enter the original programming business by buying the rights to two seasons of “House of Cards,” a new political thriller. The show will have its premiere exclusively on Netflix late next year.Starz said its policy shift toward Netflix would begin on April 1, the day its new show “Camelot” plays for the first time. Past seasons of shows like “Spartacus” will remain available without the 90-day delay.'"

"'11-03-25,'1','Who is heavier: a) the average bus rider, b) the average boat passenger or c) the average flier?In the eyes of the federal government, which has had to tweak its safety rules and weight guidelines to reflect the fattening of the nation, the answer is c) the average flier, estimated by the Federal Aviation Administration to weigh 195 pounds in winter clothing and 190 pounds in summer clothing.The average boat passenger is estimated to weigh a little less: 185 pounds. The Coast Guard recently raised its estimate of average passenger weight after the National Transportation Safety Board warned that outdated estimates that passengers weighed only 140 pounds, on average, were factors in two deadly accidents in which overweight boats capsized.The award for sveltest traveler, at least in the world of federal regulations, goes to the average bus passenger. Bus riders are currently estimated to weigh a mere 150 pounds when federal regulators test new buses. But that is about to change, if the Federal Transit Administration gets its way: the agency issued a proposal this month to increase the assumed average weight of bus passengers to 175 pounds so that its tests will “better reflect the actual loads that buses are already carrying in service today.”Exactly why the estimated weight of travelers should differ slightly depending on whether they go by land, sea or air — calling to mind those scales in planetariums which show that Earthlings weigh less on Mercury, but more on Jupiter — is one of those mysteries that are sometimes puzzled over by close readers of The Federal Register. But the trend line here is as clear as the nation’s widening waistlines: Americans are getting heavier, and federal safety regulators must take that into account.Federal officials said that they believe the current 150-pound standard for bus passengers comes from a national health survey dating to the “Mad Men” era.How much Americans actually weigh, on average, is not exactly a mystery. The National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently calculated the mean average weight is now 194.7 pounds for men and 164.7 pounds for women, no matter what means of transportation they use.'"
"'11-03-25,'1','A rare provision in San Francisco’s business tax code that taxes companies when employees cash in their stock options has caused a stir in this hotbed of fledgling tech companies.Remarkably, few companies even knew about the tax, which has been in effect for seven years. But since city officials offered Twitter a payroll-tax break as an incentive for it to remain in San Francisco (the company is considered likely to go public soon), the stock-option provision has suddenly come under intense scrutiny.A number of other booming companies, including Zynga, the maker of online games and one of the city’s fastest-growing firms, have threatened to leave the city unless they receive similar payroll-tax exemptions before going public.Unlike most cities, San Francisco generates most of its business tax revenue through a payroll tax.The Twitter exemption bill, which will be considered by the full Board of Supervisors on April 5, would freeze payroll taxes for six years along a strip of Market Street — where Twitter is set to relocate — and several square blocks in the Tenderloin neighborhood.Twitter executives had been concerned because since 2004 the city’s payroll tax code has counted stock options granted to employees as compensation, which is taxed at 1.5 percent.'"

"'11-03-25,'1','In San Francisco, 18 Reasons, which is affiliated with Bi-Rite Market, is the swapping hub. In the East Bay, the backyard-fruit-focused group Forage Oakland has been host to several produce and preserve swaps, and two new series begin in April: the Homemade Food Swap from East Bay Swappers, led by Kendra Poma, and the Belly to Belly Bartermart, hosted by Ellen Johnson, a chef who is host to underground dinners made with local, seasonal foods.Some have termed the swaps “collaborative consumption”— a new, tech-savvy angle on the familiar idea that sharing and trading is crucial to creating prosperous communities. Clothes swaps, co-working and car shares are among the most visible forms of the new sharing economy, with sites like thredUP (for children’s clothing), RelayRides (for cars) and Sharable.net (everything from bikes to data) gaining traction nationally.Food sharing is an inherently personal form of collaboration; it is hard to quantify because most swaps occur privately. But thanks to social media and a resurgence in urban food production and preparation, it is now fairly easy to set up more formal exchanges.No money changes hands at food swaps, and thus far, public food swaps have not been subject to Department of Public Health regulations, as underground restaurants and food markets are.Ms. Johnson, host of the coming Belly to Belly swap, describes her event as “an entirely different experience than shopping at Costco or Trader Joe’s.”“I can look a farmer in the eye, take the product he’s lovingly made, transform it into something tasty and then trade it with another individual,” she said.Most food swaps are structured to drive home these values — as well as to function practically. Ms. Poma is asking participants in her 30-person April event to state their offerings in advance, to make sure that everyone does not end up taking home jam.Ms. Solomon requires that attendees’ baby food be organic and, when possible, local. Her lunchtime event draws 5 to 10 parents at a time. Each swapper is responsible for 10 pints of pureed food, like squash and yogurt or green beans.The mood varies between brisk exchange and social outing. “I usually have to get back to work myself,” Ms. Solomon said, “and trying to get everyone out in time feels a little like closing down a bar at the end of the night.”Simran Singh and Stacie Dong, bloggers for A Little Yumminess, began their monthly Homemade Family Dinner Swap in the fall of 2010, also at 18 Reasons, because they wanted to encourage people to eat at home in a city where residents still consume about half their meals at restaurants.Every participant makes four batches of each meal, intended to feed three adults. They meet for half an hour on Sunday afternoons to swap. It is common for ingredients to come from local farms or from participants’ gardens, a kind of transparency and personalization that goes beyond mere cost-effectiveness.The spirit is one of generosity. For example, a new dad showed up late to a recent swap run by Ms. Singh and Ms. Dong, after the trading had already taken place, but the remaining members let him in anyway. “The people who were leaving all just traded what they’d gotten with him, so it worked out fine,” Ms. Singh said.At Ms. Solomon’s baby-food swap, community is also a theme. The information and advice exchanged among parents has been so meaningful to Ms. Solomon that she continues to put it on, despite the fact that her youngest son has moved on to solid foods.She hopes to start cooking for Ms. Dong and Ms. Singh’s swap when time allows, but for now, she is still encouraging those interested in homemade baby food. “I’ll be happy to host as long as people come,” she said.Vanessa Barrington, the author of “DIY Delicious,” has been swapping things like preserves, pickles and granolas informally for years, but she is heartened by the potential for a larger cultural shift toward organized swapping.“There is trust involved, but also a deeper appreciation for the work that goes into producing these foods,” she said. “And that can only bring us closer.”'"
"'11-03-25,'1','That doesn’t mean that they’re about to collapse but that they need maintenance, rehab or replacement. In the case of the Western Avenue overpass, which was built in 1961 to deal with congestion from the now-defunct Riverview Amusement Park, it’s in such poor shape that it will be demolished next year.The nonprofits’ attempt to muster more general civic concern is tied to Congressional deliberations on a six-year transportation bill. The measure is important because about half of the states’ transit money comes from Washington. In the 2010 fiscal year, Illinois awarded $3.5 billion to transportation projects, with $611 million going to maintain 138 bridges, according to the Metropolitan Planning Council.The federal transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, a congenial Republican and former Peoria congressman, gets high grades from transit advocates for pushing the monitoring of bridges and maintenance.  He’s toughening inspection guidelines and on Monday even blogged — yes, even the proud traditionalist Ray LaHood — about it on the Transportation Department Web site.In a phone call Wednesday, Mr. LaHood said, “We can’t replace every bridge, but we can repair those that need it.” But he conceded our collective preference for the new and shiny and how people often won’t notice infrastructure repairs that are frequently not visible.While the transportation secretary establishes priorities, money and accountability derive from Congress. But it has allowed states to shift as much as half their federal bridge maintenance dollars elsewhere.It’s not as if we’re blind to bridge repair, but for us and for politicians, it just doesn’t conjure excitement in the way that flashy roads or new subway cars do. Mayor Richard M. Daley is in China seeking investment in an important competing priority: high-speed rail.“It’s like putting leather seat covers on your car when, for less money and more long-term value, you can get the oil changed regularly,” said David Goldberg, spokesman for Transportation for America.Look around at all the cracked concrete supports on bridges and overpasses. We’re often not moved.  To that extent, our entire civic and political culture has adopted the crack cocaine mores of the 1990s: We’re hooked to instant highs and results.It’s why advocates of early childhood education, like my wife, confront a lack of money. Politicians want results now. So they’ll strain to raise test scores of existing students slightly rather than deal with tougher long-run challenges.It’s illogical, since few of us would live in a house with exposed rebar or cracking foundations. We would be embarrassed, even ashamed.Why is that not the same for us, or our representatives, when we survey our town’s brick, mortar and steel? Why so little interest in prevention, even stipulating that it still must be done efficiently and well?Start at the edge of most cities, then drive through neighborhoods toward downtown, surveying tenuous supports and busted street lights. Ultimately, you may arrive at a vibrant, well-maintained downtown.It’s sort of like building a gorgeous skyscraper in the middle of a ghetto. Unless we take care of business with all those cracks and exposed rebar, even shiny symbols of enterprise will seem far less inspiring.'"
"'11-03-25,'1','Madonna has lent her name, reputation and $11 million of her money to the organization that she founded with Mr. Berg. She has been a regular visitor to Malawi, attending at least two ceremonies at what would have been the site of the school in Lilongwe, and has adopted two children from the country.On Thursday, in conceding the shortcomings of her charity, Madonna issued a statement saying she was still intent on using the organization, which has raised $18 million so far, to advance improvements in the beleaguered nation.“There’s a real education crisis in Malawi,” she said. “Sixty-seven percent of girls don’t go to secondary school, and this is simply unacceptable. Our team is going to work hard to address this in every way we can.” She and her aides offered no explanation of why, given her high interest in the project, she had not noticed the problems as they began unfolding.Trevor Neilson, a founder of the Global Philanthropy Group, which Madonna recruited last November amid signs of upheaval at her charity, said he told her that building an expensive school in Malawi was an ineffective form of philanthropy, and suggested instead using resources to finance education programs though existing and proven nongovernmental organizations.Mr. Neilson said that an examination found that $3.8 million had been spent on the school that will now not be built, with much of the money going to architects, design and salaries and, in one case, two cars for employees who had not even been hired yet.“Despite $3.8 million having been spent by the previous management team, the project has not broken ground, there was no title to the land and there was, over all, a startling lack of accountability on the part of the management team in Malawi and the management team in the ,” he said. “We have yet to determine exactly what happened to all of that $3.8 million. We have not accounted for all the funds that were used.”A written report by the Global Philanthropy Group, a copy of which was provided Thursday by the Kabbalah Centre, was critical of two former officials of the organization: Philippe van den Bossche, who has worked for Madonna since 2004 and was the executive director of Raising Malawi from 2005 until October, and Anjimile Oponyo, who worked at the United Nations Development Program when she was chosen last year to head the Raising Malawi Academy for Girls.Ms. Oponyo said that she was barred from talking about her association with the foundation, and that she could not comment on the allegations in the report of mismanagement — including whether she benefited from an extravagant compensation package that included that car and driver and golf club membership.In an e-mail, Mr. van den Bossche said he, too, was prohibited from commenting; Madonna has a history of confidentiality agreements with employees.“I am strictly bound by the confidentiality agreements and I am forced by those agreements to be silent on any of these questions,” Mr. van den Bossche said.Mr. Neilson said that Madonna was involved in a film project — she is directing a movie about King Edward VIII — and was not available for an interview. But in a statement, Madonna said she was pleased with other work that Raising Malawi had done in helping children in Malawi, even as she acknowledged its problems. “While I’m proud of these accomplishments, I’m frustrated that our education work has not moved forward in a faster way,” she said.Raising Malawi will not disband and will instead use its money in different ways to help the poor in a country where Madonna has sought to become a major philanthropic presence, foundation officials said.Madonna attended a fund-raiser hosted by Gucci in New York in 2008, whose guests also included and , and was on hand for what turned out to be a purely ceremonial groundbreaking and the laying off the first brick at the school. Other donors to the project include the Yankee .The report faulted Mr. van den Bossche for his roles both in overseeing the planning of the building and in creating the educational curriculum. “Philippe’s level of mismanagement and lack of oversight was extreme in both aspects of the project,” it said, “and the lack of success of the players on the ground is in large part a result of his inability to effectively manage project plans, people and finances.”The report was similarly critical of Ms. Oponyo. “Her charisma masks a lack of substantive knowledge of the practical application of educational development,” it said, “and her weak management skills are a major contributor to the current financial and programmatic chaos.”'"
"'11-03-25,'1','The evidence of the human hand, and all the labor implied by such work, is part of the low-wattage charm of the French animated children’s movie “Mia and the Migoo,” where visible brushstrokes fill blocks of bright color. The human touch is the most notable aspect of “Mia,” which won as best animated feature at the 2009 European Film Awards and involves a girl, her father, a tree of life, a bad dad, his unhappy son and the curious shapeshifter (or two) that is the movie’s most diverting creation.Set in what looks like the present and might be the near future (global warming is heating things up), the movie opens with a man, Pedro (voiced by Jesse Corti), peering into the night sky and crying out for Mia (Amanda Misquez), the young daughter he’s left behind while he helps to build an exclusive complex in a forest. The brains behind the development is Jekhide (John DiMaggio), a bully in a cream-colored suit who’s more consumed by greed than by being a good father to his son, Aldrin (Vincent Agnello), an imbalance that, as even a wee moviegoer knows, must be righted. To that storybook end, Pedro ends up buried in a tunnel, and Mia embarks on a journey to find him.Being incredibly resourceful, Mia quickly makes her way from her native land to the forest where her father has gone missing. There, amid cawing, calling animals and washes of pastel green, she meets the Migoo (Wallace Shawn), a pleasingly plump creature who shrinks, grows and divides into little versions of himself, like a particularly advanced single cell. Beige-brown and speckled with crosshatch marks, the Migoo brings to mind a hairless yeti and the Michelin Man. He’s a joyous, seemingly anarchic character, if one with a higher purpose, and the director, Jacques-Rémy Girerd, does his most vivid work bringing this bearish critter to life, whether the Migoo is racing up the side of a cliff or slipping through the earth as if it were water.Mr. Girerd’s disjointed screenplay, written with three others, features some odd detours, including a visit to a weapons depot where Jekhide ominously stocks up on heavy artillery, a portent of the coming cataclysmic violence. The message here might be green, but the pulsing red that soon fills the screen suggests that Mr. Girerd digs the apocalypse more. Even so, trying to parse meaning in “Mia” is secondary to its main point, which is its look, created with 500,000 hand-drawn frames. That’s impressive in an age in which most mainstream animation is done with computers, even if “Mia” doesn’t have the fluidity of the older Disney films, and most of its simple character designs, including all the humans, might work better in a comic. The exception is Migoo, who can’t hold a clown nose to Mr. Magoo, but steals the movie nonetheless.“Mia and the Migoo” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

"'11-03-25,'1','2012: The United States begins a military withdrawal from Iraq and the rest of the Middle East. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il, dies and is succeeded by his son Kim Jong-un.2013: Saudi Arabia ramps up its militarization and begins to square off against Iran for control in the Middle East. Oil markets roil. Kim Jong-un begins reunification talks with South Korea and ignites a wave of anti-Americanism across Asia. The American military withdraws from South Korea.2014: General Motors declares bankruptcy again. American department stores and consumers experience scarcity for the first time in decades.2015: Korea is unified, and Kim Jong-un is elected president.2016: Iraq is riven by sectarian violence. Iran declares that Saudi Arabia has turned Iraq into a “client state” and invades in the face of what it calls “unacceptable Saudi intervention.” In the United States gasoline tops $12 a gallon. Thousands of Americans freeze to death that winter amid nationwide energy shortages. The United States withdraws its forces from Asia.2017: As tax revenue declines, the American economy continues to falter under the weight of the nation’s crushing debt. Black markets in gasoline emerge. Without regular outside supplies of electricity and food, major cities become unlivable. Japan erupts in conflict between natives and ethnic Koreans. Kim Jong-un promises to protect Koreans in Japan.2018: Korea declares war against Japan. Korean special forces sabotage a Japanese nuclear power plant, causing a meltdown and a huge radiation leak. Japan capitulates to Korean occupation. Iran and Malaysia, among other nations, congratulate Kim Jong-un.2019: Korea begins to use Japanese infrastructure to produce nuclear weapons. American cities descend into chaos.2020: Korea provides commando units to help Iranian forces operating in Iraq.2021: Malaysia joins Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand in the Greater Korean Republic, with Cambodia and Vietnam on the doorstep. An Asian H5N1 influenza pandemic strikes the United States.Soon Korea detonates an electromagnetic pulse weapon over the United States, essentially destroying the national electronic fabric. The Mississippi River is irradiated, dividing the country. Mexico closes its borders to American refugees, and the military of the Greater Korean Republic eventually invades and occupies Western states.Which is where you come in. As Homefront begins, in 2027, you are inducted into the Resistance in Colorado. Western America has become an occupied wasteland of the Korean military, devastated suburban tracts and pockets of crazed survivalists.The basic shooting and combat mechanisms in Homefront are standard fare. And the main single-player story campaign is brief, perhaps five hours at most, though the multiplayer modes are surprisingly engaging.What makes Homefront stand out from all the other shooting games is its setting and its ambition to grapple with a vision of what could happen in the real world if absolutely everything were to go wrong. When you see images of bulldozers pushing around mounds of American corpses, citizens in an internment camp in what used to be a high school football stadium and the twisted wreckage of a suburban White Castle or Hooters restaurant, you feel an emotional connection to the action that simply doesn’t accompany a science-fiction game set on a faraway planet.When Mr. Milius worked on “Red Dawn” in the 1980s, few people really thought that Soviet troops were about to occupy a small town in the Rockies. And maybe no one thinks a unified Korea is about to take over San Francisco.And yet I can’t imagine what the social and political fallout would be if some company had invested the millions of dollars required to make a film or TV mini-series out of Homefront’s vision. And I’m not sure a whole lot of people would really want to watch it, because it is disturbing.And it is disturbing because as unpalatable as it may be, the inkling that America might not necessarily be the most important place in the world forever is finally sinking into our national consciousness.No matter what the politicians say.'"
"'11-03-25,'1','The story of his childhood in Connecticut and Washington, D.C., is punctuated by revelations. The image of his mother — “she isn’t the stuff that cracks under a bit of difficulty,” in the words of Mr. Darnton’s father as he headed off to war — gives way to the reality of such fragility that Mr. Darnton as a boy was placed with three different families in four years. Alone with his mother after Bob left for boarding school, he had to nurse her through alcohol withdrawal; he was a 14-year-old who kept a spoon on his dresser to dislodge her tongue from her throat when she was in the grips of the DT’s.While Mr. Darnton’s youth is shaped by the struggles of his mother, this is a book about working out his relationship with his father. Not the man, of course, but the concept.“Not having a father present didn’t mean not having a father,” he writes. “There wasn’t just an absence in my life. There was the presence of an absence.”That presence is underscored by the way Mr. Darnton refers to his father almost exclusively by his nickname, Barney. It’s a jarringly effective choice to establish emotional distance and underscore ambivalence. Taking us through his own adventures hitchhiking and hopping the rails, his summer jobs and, eventually, his expulsion from prep school, which costs him a place at Harvard, Mr. Darnton always appears slightly unmoored. He doesn’t have a relationship with a father, but with what’s been created to replace his father. It’s flimsy construction.Eventually, like his father before him, Mr. Darnton goes to work at The Times, enjoying a long, distinguished career. And in “Almost a Family,” old-school reporting skills and a newspaperman’s sensibility are on ample display. His tool box includes spare prose honed under deadline pressure in city rooms and cop shops. At key moments of revelation he forces the reader to set the book down for a moment to absorb the shockers about his parents and their relationship.This is not a modern memoirist happy to locate his narrative somewhere in the circle of plausibility. He won’t report what he can’t source. No document was left unread that might have shed a sliver of light on the events of 70 years ago. Anyone with a connection to his father or mother was hunted down and interviewed. A boy raised on myth, who realized its power to disorient and corrupt, is not about to play fast and loose in the realm of memory.Mr. Darnton’s choice of career makes perfect sense but not because, as his mother tells him, he’s so much like Barney. He has been left with an aggressive allergy to fraudulence, duplicity and bunk. That, as much as anything, probably explains his Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of Solidarity-era Poland.Yet given that the lure of newspapering took his father away from him, Mr. Darnton makes short shrift of his own decision to become a newsman, drawn by the camaraderie of a group of police reporters at a dinner one night. He doesn’t dwell on his wife and daughters’ temporary jailing by Nigerian authorities when he was posted in Africa. If the incident raised questions about the risk to his own family created by his career choices, he doesn’t articulate them.That’s not what Mr. Darnton has set out to do in “Almost a Family.” His thoughtful memoir dives deeper. Mr. Darnton’s life is the product of collateral damage. Tragedy was out of his control. But finding stability, if not well-being, in its aftermath was not. It was a matter of staring clear-eyed at the wreckage.'"
"'11-03-25,'1','What went wrong? The chief executive, Kerry K. Killinger, talked about a bubble but was also convinced that Wall Street would reward the bank for taking on more risk. He kept on doing so, amassing what proved to be an almost unbelievably bad book of mortgage loans. Nothing was done about the office where fraud seemed rampant.The regulators “on the ground” saw problems, as James G. Vanasek, the bank’s former chief risk officer, told me, but the ones in Washington saw their job as protecting a “client” and took no effective action. The bank promised change, but did not deliver. It installed programs to spot fraud, and then failed to use them. The board told management to fix problems but never followed up.WaMu, as the bank was known, is back in the news because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation sued Mr. Killinger and two other former top officials of the bank last week, seeking to “hold these three highly paid senior executives, who were chiefly responsible for WaMu’s higher-risk home-lending program, accountable for the resulting losses.”Mr. Killinger responded by going on the attack. His lawyers called the suit “baseless and unworthy of the government.” Mr. Killinger, they said, deserved praise for his excellent management.I’ll let the courts sort out whether Mr. Killinger will become the rare banker to be penalized for making disastrously bad loans. But I am fascinated by how his bank came to make those loans despite his foresight.Answers are available, or at least suggested, in the mass of documents collected and released by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which held hearings on WaMu last year. Mr. Killinger wanted both the loan book and profits to rise rapidly, and saw risky loans as a means to those ends.Moreover, this was a market in which a bank that did not reduce lending standards would lose a lot of business. A decision to publicly decry the spread of high-risk lending and walk away from it — something Mr. Vanasek proposed before he retired at the end of 2005 — might have saved the bank in the long run. In the short run, it would have devastated profits.Ronald J. Cathcart, who became the chief risk officer in 2006, told a Senate hearing he pushed for more controls but ran into resistance. The bank’s directors, he said, were interested in hearing about problems that regulators identified over and over again. “But,” he added, “there was little consequence to these problems not being fixed.”There were consequences for him. He was fired in 2008 after he took his concerns about weak controls and rising losses to both the board and to regulators from the Office of Thrift Supervision.By early 2007, the subprime mortgage market was collapsing, and the bank was trying to rush out securitizations before that market vanished. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a secondary regulator, was pushing to impose tighter regulation, but the primary regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, was successfully resisting allowing the F.D.I.C. to even look at the bank’s loan files.In June of that year, amid evidence that home prices were falling in some of the areas of California and Florida where WaMu had its greatest concentration of loans, Mr. Killinger was crowing that he had been right. “For the past two years, we have been predicting the bursting of the housing bubble,” he wrote in a memo to the company’s directors. “That scenario has now turned into a reality.”That was, however, no reason to turn his back on the high-risk loans. Instead, he wanted to keep more such loans for the bank, rather than sell them in securitizations. He viewed WaMu as overcapitalized by $7 billion and said reducing its capital — and attractiveness to a potential acquirer — was a “must do.”In Washington, concern over highly risky mortgages had been growing, and in 2006 regulators issued guidance about them. The Office of Thrift Supervision fought to weaken the guidance, and when it met with WaMu after the guidance came out, its officials told the bank not to worry.“They specifically pointed out,” a WaMu official wrote in a memo after meeting with regulators, “that the language in the guidance says ‘should,’ vs. ‘must’ in most cases and they are looking to WaMu to establish our own position of how the guidance impacts our business processes.”As things got worse and worse in 2008, the regulators resisted taking any enforcement action, despite pleas by the F.D.I.C. Finally, on July 3, John M. Reich, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, notified Mr. Killinger that they would take harsher action than the bank had wanted, by requiring the bank to sign a memorandum of understanding. He did so in an apologetic e-mail, saying he had written only after Mr. Killinger failed to return a couple of phone calls.Mr. Reich promised the action would be kept confidential, and said action was needed in part because “if someone were looking over our shoulders, they would probably be surprised” the regulator had not acted long before.By then it was too late. After Lehman Brothers failed in September, depositors fled and the bank was closed. The vast majority of its loans were based on “stated income,” and it turned out that there were more than a few liars among the borrowers. Its $178 billion in mortgage loans went to JPMorgan Chase, which promptly concluded that about two-thirds of them were impaired. It took a $30 billion write-down, but that proved inadequate. It has written off another $5 billion since.The Dodd-Frank law abolished the Office of Thrift Supervision, in part because of the WaMu failure.To Carl Levin, the Michigan senator who heads the subcommittee that investigated WaMu, a lesson is that “you need cops on the beat.” I doubt it is that simple. There were cops at the thrift office, and the ones on the ground found lots of problems that their bosses did little about. There were also cops inside WaMu. But they were neutered, ignored and eventually pushed aside. The board passed appropriate resolutions, but did nothing to stop the rot.A few decades ago, I recall the chairman of one large bank explaining why his bank had joined in the lending folly of that era — lending to developing countries that needed money to pay rising oil prices.If his bank had not joined in, he said, business would have gone elsewhere, and his bank would no longer have been a major lender.So it was with WaMu. It had identified Countrywide Financial as a model to emulate, and any other course would have surrendered market share, not to mention the immediate profits that financed huge paychecks for executives.Was that illegal? A court will decide, assuming no settlement is reached. Perhaps a judge will be impressed by all the formalities that Mr. Killinger’s lawyers listed in rising to his defense:“Washington Mutual’s management structure was a model of corporate governance,” they wrote. “The mortgage lending practices of the bank were established by a professional corps of bankers and risk managers with extensive experience in home lending. Those practices were in turn carefully reviewed and monitored by independent credit risk management and board committees. An internal audit group similarly reported directly to an audit committee of the board to assure compliance with law and management objectives. The work of the management and board committees were, in turn, subject to continuous review and scrutiny by outside auditors and, perhaps most importantly, by federal bank regulators.”Senator Levin’s view of the bank is more pithy.“It was a model,” he said, “of corporate ineptitude, greed and wrongdoing.”'"
"'11-03-25,'1','BEIJING — China, the world’s largest tobacco producer and home to a third of all smokers, has issued a national ban on lighting up in hotels, restaurants and other indoor public spaces, the Health Ministry said on Thursday.The rules, which take effect on May 1 and spell out education provisions about the dangers of tobacco, include restrictions on cigarette vending machines and on outdoor smoking that affects pedestrians.But there are considerable loopholes. The rules do not cover factories, offices or government workplaces, and, more important, they lack specific penalty guidelines. That detail has prompted shrugs among devoted smokers, many of whom have long since learned to ignore the no-smoking signs in hospital waiting areas, gymnasium locker rooms and elevators.“Chinese people, including most government officials, are just too in love with their cigarettes to pay attention to such a law,” said Liu Bailing, 28, a bank employee dining beneath a cumulus cloud of smoke at a restaurant here on Thursday evening.Ms. Liu’s complaint was not without reason. In the nearly three years since Beijing required restaurants and bars to provide nonsmoking sections, most smokers have continued to puff away with abandon.While acknowledging the challenges of enforcing the new ban, antismoking advocates hailed the measure as a first step to weaning the nation off tobacco, which health officials say kills more than 1.2 million Chinese a year. China has among the world’s highest smoking rates, with nearly one-third of all adults lighting up. (In the United States, about 21 percent of adults were smokers as of 2008.)'"
"'11-03-25,'1','The layoffs have deeply divided this small city, just a few miles inland from Newport Beach. While Costa Mesa has long been a politically conservative enclave, much like the other wealthy suburbs that surround it, the move to privatize city services strikes many residents as a harsh political tactic that is meant to remake their community into a national model in the battle over public employee unions.But the City Council, which moved quickly to approve the outsourcing and layoff plans, says the moves are the only way to solve a budget gap of as much as $15 million next year and to handle pension costs that grow exponentially each year, eating away at the city’s $93 million budget.“We see the train wreck coming, and the only questions are how bad it will be and how quickly we want to try to stop it,” said City Councilman Jim Righeimer, who has led the push for outsourcing and has battled with public employee unions for years. “We have to stop blaming other people and start to solve these problems ourselves. These are hard-working people, but we know we cannot afford to keep paying what we have been.”This is the labor battle in miniature — union officials and opponents of the layoffs say it is politics and not money that is driving the decision. City officials say they do not know how much money they will save through outsourcing, although Mr. Righeimer said he expected to cut labor costs by anywhere from 15 to 40 percent.Mr. Righeimer, a real estate developer, fought a bruising battle against the unions in his bid for the City Council last fall. But few here seemed prepared for him to push such wholesale change so quickly. Several community leaders called this week for the city to rescind the layoff notices, although there were few signs that officials would back down.“They should have been thinking from the very beginning what kind of cost saving they were going to get before doing this — not tell us now, ‘You don’t have a job, and we’ll get back to you later if we change our mind,’ ” said Helen Nenadal, who has worked in the city’s maintenance department for more than 30 years and who does not think the city will back down. “They are on their mission,” she said.City officials say services could be outsourced to a mix of private firms and other municipal governments. The county’s Fire Department has indicated that it is willing to take over the firefighting duties in Costa Mesa, as it has in other cities. The department said it could cover the city with 15 fewer firefighters, Mr. Righeimer said.Other city officials have not ruled out outsourcing the duties of the Police Department, one of the only departments not included in the first round of layoffs. Although other employees, like city planners and engineers, may have avoided the pink slips for now, few feel confident that they will not be laid off later as a team of consultants considers cost savings for the entire city.Wendy Leece, the only one of the five City Council members to vote against the layoffs, said her colleagues were acting “recklessly.”“We’re a nice, safe and clean city, and we need to make sure we stay that way,” Ms. Leece said. “I’m a lifelong Republican — nobody can out-Republican me. But I think we also need to be conservative on the front end and not rush into something that is going to alienate all our employees.”“The sky isn’t falling,” she added, “but there is a real effort by some to exaggerate the crisis.”The city has already been through a round of cuts. Last year, it eliminated or reduced the hours for 77 employees and cut programs. Tom Hatch, the city’s chief executive, said the city currently had the same number of staff members as it did in 1985, “with a much higher demand of services.” And employees have offered some concessions, including paying more toward their pensions.But because so much of the budget goes to paying salaries and benefits, there has been less money to spend on services. Roads have gone unrepaired for too long, and it has been years since there has been enough money to buy fertilizer for city parks, said Stephen Mensinger, who was appointed to the City Council this year and supports the outsourcing plan.“At some point we don’t have money for anything else except for labor,” Mr. Mensinger said. “That can’t go on. We’re not a poor town, but we’ve been spending money without regard to whether it’s for the best possible services at the lowest possible price.”'"

"'11-03-26,'0','Like many others in Tajura, the two men said that they believed their neighborhood was under the control of a private militia loyal to Mansour Dou, a wealthy Libyan businessman close to the Qaddafi family who they said lives in the area.Many white Toyota pickup trucks — the preferred vehicle of the Qaddafi militia — could be seen cruising the streets full of armed men, and a police wagon with men carrying machine guns was parked at an intersection leading downtown. Nearby gunshots were heard during the interviews.Several others said they were afraid to speak. A cafe emptied immediately after two Western journalists walked in. One young man who stayed, Hamza al-Hader, said he worked at the cafe. Contradicting scores of recent interviews with Tajura residents, he repeated the story told by state television. He said the few protests that took place there were led by foreign-born Islamic terrorists wearing long beards — a line that in some circles appears to have become code language meant to signal one’s disbelief in the official propaganda.Whether he was sincere or ironic could not be determined. “Qaddafi should hit back hard,” he said. “I would be a suicide bomber.”Even the official minders who typically accompany foreign journalists seemed jumpy on Friday. On an official trip earlier in the day, an official minder turned back over his shoulder to warn journalists not to photograph a heavily armed checkpoint in Tajura. “I don’t want to go to jail,” he said, “so don’t film anything.”Later, a minder was stopped by security forces — more than 15 armed men sprang out of at least six vehicles — and questioned for more than 30 minutes, apparently because he allowed foreign journalists too much latitude to roam Tajura freely.The Libyan government has been eager to show that the allied airstrikes are killing civilians. State television, for example, has been showing images of insurgent attacks on American military vehicles in Iraq, as part of its extensive effort to draw comparisons between the allied airstrikes on Libya and the war in Iraq.But the press office has so far failed to show foreign journalists any convincing evidence of civilian casualties. On Friday, officials escorted foreign journalists to a lightly damaged house that they said had been hit in an airstrike.Inside the house, a man who said he worked for the Libyan security forces was directing his three young daughters — one in tears — to tell their story to Libyan television cameras. On the lawn outside were fragments of a missile, including some that appeared to have been jammed into a tree trunk by an explosion or a fall. But no one was hurt, and the little damage done to the house appeared to come from bullets rather than a missile or explosion. At least one bullet casing was found at the scene.But some in Tajura said — apparently without official staging — that they had lost family members who were part of the Qaddafi militias as a result of the Western airstrikes. Tarak Ali Rizk said matter-of-factly that his son Mohamed, 18, was killed in an airstrike on Thursday night.He had been a soldier in the militia loyal to Colonel Qaddafi’s son Khamis, Mr. Rizk said, and was killed in a barracks in the Tajura neighborhood. Another family member standing in the same cluster of men said he also had a young relative in the militia, Nurreddin Abdel Majid Rizk, who had been killed.Unlike the others interviewed, the men told the stories of their losses under the watchful eyes of an official Libyan government minder and militia officers. But the minder and officers spoke only Arabic, and after a few moments another man in the group interrupted in English.“We are afraid,” he said. “We can never say the truth.”Asked of what, he said, “Of many things. I cannot say.”“My heart is full,” he added, “but I am afraid to say.”'"

"'11-03-26,'0','Even for the world’s largest asset manager, every million counts.Among the thousands of provisions up for inclusion in the budget deal being crafted this weekend by the Legislature and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo are a few dozen words that could save BlackRock, the New York-based financial firm, millions of dollars in city taxes in the future.The provision was proposed by Senate Republicans last week as an amendment to an otherwise routine extension of state tax law. It would allow BlackRock, which earned a record profit of more than $2 billion last year, to be taxed by the state as a general business corporation rather than as a bank, saving it at least $3.5 million — and possibly several times that much — in city taxes each year.A spokeswoman for BlackRock declined to comment. Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, said the amendment was intended to correct a running flaw in the state’s tax code that for years has effectively stranded BlackRock, one of the world’s largest financial companies, in the wrong section of the code.“Our budget proposes a technical fix that will allow companies to avoid the unintended negative consequences of an otherwise good and necessary provision,” Mr. Reif said. Aides to Mr. Cuomo and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said the matter was still under negotiation. It is unclear how many other companies it could affect, and thus how much tax revenue might be gained or lost as a result of the change.The Senate push represents merely the latest wrinkle in a five-year saga for BlackRock. The firm was once wholly owned by PNC Bank, but is now a stand-alone asset-management business partly owned by PNC and other companies.'"
"'11-03-26,'0','Hapag-Lloyd, a German container shipping line that is one of the world’s largest, halted service to Tokyo and Yokohama after the tsunami swamped Fukushima Daiichi. The shipper has not resumed service to those ports.“We put safety ahead of everything else,” said Eva Gjersvik, the company’s senior director for corporate communications, adding that the company was reviewing daily whether to resume sailings to Tokyo.Reuters reported that another German shipper, Claus-Peter Offen, has also stopped calling at Tokyo and Yokohama.OOCL, a shipping line based in Hong Kong, said late Friday that the company had decided to halt all traffic to Tokyo and Yokohama.OOCL will take Tokyo-bound containers to Osaka instead and send them overland from there, said Stanley Shen, the head of investor relations. The company has also drafted contingency plans to prevent its containers from traveling even overland to Tokyo if radiation levels increase in the Japanese capital, Mr. Shen added.Merchant vessels may have to be scrapped if quarantined even temporarily for radioactivity, because they would face extra coast guard checks for years at subsequent destinations, said Basil M. Karatzas, the managing director for projects and finance at Compass Maritime Services, a ship brokerage in Teaneck, N.J.The extra inspections make it hard to keep a schedule. “The charterers in the future will try to avoid the vessel because of the likelihood it will be delayed again,” Mr. Karatzas said.It is not only commercial ships that are giving the radiation region a wide berth.A senior nuclear executive said on Friday evening that the United States Navy had moved nuclear-powered vessels like the Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier far from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after officers became concerned that radiation from the plant could enter the ships’ air ducts.The worry is not that the radiation would pose a threat to the vessels’ crews, but that even trace contamination of the ducts could create problems in the extremely sensitive equipment aboard nuclear-powered vessels that is intended to detect any hint of a radioactive leak from onboard systems, said the executive, who insisted on anonymity to protect business connections.Shippers, even if they can avoid radiation exposure, know that cargo coming from Japan is now subject to new delays.In California on Friday, the ship scanned for radiation at the Port of Long Beach carried about 2,500 containers from four ports: Kobe and Nagoya in the south and Shimizu and Tokyo farther north.Under protocols established after the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States Customs Service usually inspects all arriving shipments in radiation scans in the port. But according to Art Wong, a spokesman for the Port of Long Beach, concerns from dockworkers prompted Coast Guard and customs inspectors to board the Japanese ship in the harbor and scan the cargo for radiation with hand-held scanners. Only then was the ship allowed to dock.Mr. Wong said he expected a slowdown. “One of the problems we’ve been hearing is they have transportation issues of getting things from northern Japan,” he said. “Which is why we expect to get a slowdown of autos and auto parts. That should hit us in a few more weeks.”One of China’s largest ports, Yantian port in Shenzhen, next to Hong Kong, announced Friday that it had begun screening all arriving vessels and containers for radiation if they had been to Japan in the preceding 28 days and if Yantian was their first port of call in China. These vessels will not be allowed to unload until after all screening has taken place.The port of Hong Kong announced earlier this week that it would begin screening random vessels for radiation as well.Hapag-Lloyd has started unloading Tokyo-bound containers near Osaka and sending them overland. Shippers are allowed to send containers to areas north of Tokyo, but must pay for them, because the company will not take them back afterward.Maersk of Denmark and the German shipper Hamburg Süd have maintained port calls at Tokyo but are reassessing weather conditions and radiation there almost hourly, company officials said. The main weather worry is that a north wind might blow radiation south from the damaged nuclear reactors and then rain might wash radioactive particles out of the sky and onto vessels.“The overriding factor for us is to safeguard the well-being of our seagoing staff and, at the same time, ensure that Japan is not cut off from the international flow of merchandise,” Joachim A. Konrad, the deputy chairman of Hamburg Süd, said in a statement.Container shipping lines typically buy some of their ships and lease the rest from finance companies and other owners. Some ship owners, particularly in Europe, are now trying to limit the shipping lines from using their vessels on services that include port calls in the Tokyo area, said a shipping line manager who insisted on anonymity because of the sensitivity of shipping lines’ relationships with owners.Jeffrey Landsberg, of Commodore Research, a shipping consulting firm, said that bulk shipping vessels carrying grain to Japan had been able to unload using Japan’s undamaged southern ports. Some were diverted from disabled ports in the north.Ports north of Tokyo were devastated by the earthquake and tsunami, but were not served by international shipping lines even before the crisis. But now, until the radiation problem is contained, Tokyo and Yokohama are themselves threatened as fully functioning seaports.'"
"'11-03-26,'0','DETROIT — General Motors said on Friday that it would resume production at a Louisiana pickup truck plant that had been idled this week because of low supplies of a Japanese-made part.But the automaker also cautioned that other plants could have some down time in the weeks ahead.Meanwhile, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group each said they were restricting dealer orders for some vehicles in certain metallic colors — mostly reds and blacks — because a Japanese plant that supplies a pigment used in their paint is expected to be closed for at least a month.The G.M. plant, which employs 925 in Shreveport, La., was the first site in the United States where vehicle assembly was halted as a result of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. G.M. also temporarily laid off 59 people at an engine plant near Buffalo.G.M. executives declined to say whether they had obtained more of the unspecified part that had caused the shutdown. The Shreveport plant makes the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon, two of G.M.’s slower-selling trucks.“We have enough material to operate, so we’re resuming production,” Kim Carpenter, a G.M. spokeswoman, said.'"
"'11-03-26,'0','The tension surrounding the talks and the potential for a shutdown boiled into public view Friday evening as House Republican leaders issued a series of harsh statements accusing Democrats of failing to make a serious offer on spending cuts. Representative Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican and the House majority leader, labeled as “completely far-fetched” a claim by Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, that negotiators were making progress.Speaker John A. Boehner joined in with a statement that accused Democrats of lacking a fiscal plan. “If Democrats don’t have a plan, do they intend to shut down the government because they can’t agree among themselves?” he asked.Democrats fired back, suggesting that Republicans were backtracking under pressure from House conservatives allied with the Tea Party who were opposed to any compromise with Democrats in the budget debate.“After days of positive negotiations, with significant flexibility shown by the speaker, the House Republican leadership is back to agonizing over whether to give in to right-wing demands that they abandon any compromise on their extreme cuts,” Mr. Schumer said. “Instead of lashing out at Democrats in a knee-jerk way, we hope House Republicans will finally stand up to the Tea Party and resume the negotiations that had seemed so full of promise.”Congressional officials said the budget talks were set back significantly in a meeting Tuesday when the participants feuded over what legislation should serve as the benchmark for the talks — the House-passed spending measure with $61 billion in cuts for this year or an interim budget bill approved by Congress in early March that maintained financing for most programs at their current levels.Democrats, who believed they had an agreement to work off the stopgap plan, felt blindsided, officials said. Jacob J. Lew, the White House budget director and chief Democratic negotiator, angrily resisted the Republican push to use the House measure as the starting point. The meeting abruptly broke up, with talks resuming haltingly since then.Ken Baer, a spokesman for Mr. Lew, said he would not “discuss details of meetings that were agreed by all to be confidential. But there are ongoing discussions at many levels.” He did say that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had consulted Thursday with both Mr. Boehner and Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader.The heated meeting on Tuesday was the first with participation by representatives of the House Appropriations Committee, which drafted the House plan and saw that bill as providing the most legitimate framework for the budget talks. But Democrats argue that using the House measure, which the president has promised to veto, puts them at a disadvantage.Failure to reach agreement without another stopgap measure could cause a number of federal operations to be halted after April 8. Both Senate and House officials said they believed it would be difficult to advance another short-term budget bill after numerous lawmakers said the temporary measure now in place would be the last one they would support before considering a plan to finance the government through Sept. 30.The fight over spending levels for the current fiscal year — through Sept. 30 — will be followed by two others that could be even more contentious. Congress will be asked this spring to increase the federal debt limit, a measure that many conservatives say they will oppose unless President Obama is willing to accede to a package of deep spending cuts. The two parties will also be at odds over a budget for next year, with House Republicans intending to introduce into that fight proposals to rein in the long-term costs of entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid.The budget showdown between Democrats and the new House Republican majority is caught up in strong political currents since House conservatives are pushing for steep spending cuts in the current fiscal year and pressing the leadership to not give much ground.But negotiations had been continuing among representatives of the White House, Mr. Boehner and Mr. Reid, with Democrats proposing spending reductions that they said would total more than $20 billion, while Republicans expressed a willingness to give some ground on their $61 billion figure.“We’re getting closer on the number,” Mr. Schumer said in an interview on MSNBC Friday morning.Officials said an agreement on spending reductions in the vicinity of $30 billion to $40 billion had seemed possible before Tuesday’s abbreviated negotiating session, but lawmakers and their aides seemed uncertain Friday about where the talks would head, given the tough partisan statements and persistent disputes over the makeup of any budget deal.In another development that could influence the debate, Tea Party groups are planning to rally outside the Capitol on Thursday to encourage Republicans to hold firm on their budget cuts.'"
"'11-03-26,'0','But many people find that what they win back in savings or time from this investment in hours more than makes up for whatever income they may have earned during that period.What might you do exactly? There are 31 ideas on the interactive checklist we built last year; it’s linked from the online version of this column.And here’s what I tuned up this past week. Please share your own stories on the Bucks blog.401(K) IMPROVEMENTS There are few more important tasks than tending to your retirement accounts, so this was my first stop.First, I rebalanced. I keep my 401(k) in 80 percent stocks and 20 percent bonds, though you may be doing something entirely different for any number of reasons.In the process I sold all of the company stock that had arrived as a portion of the employer match on my own contributions. If The New York Times Company stumbles (though, just to be clear, I have no idea whether it will), I don’t want my savings at risk at the same time my job is.Finally, I crossed off an item that had been on my list for more than a year: I urged our head of compensation and benefits to add more index funds to the lineup of available investments in the 401(k) plan that I participate in. My plan currently does not have access to stand-alone, broad-based international or bond index funds; they’re available only through target-date mutual funds.If your 401(k) plan isn’t perfect either, try to get a group of co-workers together to make some noise. To give my pleas more heft, I pulled in my fellow personal finance scribe Tara Siegel Bernard, who knows even more about this world than I do; she offered her own comments via e-mail.A company called BrightScope grades many 401(k) and 403(b) retirement plans on its Web site, so that may help you get a sense of where your plan stands. (For the record, it rates my plan’s investment menu as merely average.) The site also names the plan administrator, so you know where to direct your inquiries.SAVING FOR THE MEDIUM TERM There’s nothing duller than reading about somebody else’s budgeting struggles, so I’ll spare you mine.The result, however, is that my household is finally on the ING Direct subaccounts plan. The anonymous author of the Five Cent Nickel blog helped popularize this idea in 2005, though many others have written about it since and we rounded up other companies that can help in a Bucks post last year.The idea is to have separate, cordoned-off savings accounts for every goal that is important to you.Each account can automatically pull money from your primary checking account every month, so you don’t even have to think about it. Or, if your income is irregular, you can push money to the accounts yourself via an online transfer.My family is going to try this for expenses that come up at least once a year that can total four figures or more by the time they’re done. These include one-time charitable donations, clothing, vacations, camp for our daughter, synagogue dues and taxes on freelance income.It took a couple of hours on fiscal health day to do the research, parse the family budget and open the accounts, but it was time well spent.AUTOMATIC DONATIONS Rather than make a pile of donations all at once in December each year, we started making recurring monthly contributions to some of our favored institutions two years ago.At the time, I mentioned that a site called Network for Good was our vehicle for doing so. Some of you pointed out that recipients lose a bit to fees in the transaction. On fiscal health day, however, it takes just a few minutes to set up recurring donations on one site. It can take an hour or more, however, to contact a bunch of institutions and print and fill out their forms (or discover that some of them can’t, in fact, ping your credit card each month after all).This year, we added a few new recipients to our list. We also moved the operation over to American Express’s Members Give service, after Network for Good canceled our recurring donations several months back. We didn’t receive notice of the move and didn’t get any explanation (or apology) on the phone or via Twitter this week.So if your 1040 happens to show a refund this year and you don’t have debts to pay, this would be a good moment to open some subaccounts of your own.Or if you’re feeling generous, the Members Give service makes it easy to take that lump sum and make some new tax deductions for yourself by making one-time contributions to a few worthy causes.'"
"'11-03-26,'0','FRANKFURT — A closely watched indicator of German business sentiment, while still indicating economic growth, declined on Friday, signaling that events in Japan and the Arab world could be making businesses more cautious.The Ifo Business Climate Index, considered a reliable predictor of growth in the German economy, the largest in Europe, fell to 111.1 from 111.3, the first decline since May 2010. A reading above 100 indicates that the majority of the 7,000 businesses surveyed rate their current situation and expectations for the future as positive.“On the whole, firms in Germany remain very confident,” Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, said in the report. “The business-cycle traffic lights still signal ‘green.’ ”The index was higher than expected and, along with data showing an increase in lending to European business, was not likely to dissuade the European Central Bank from raising the benchmark interest rate next month in a bid to pre-empt inflation.However, analysts at Barclays Capital noted that the Ifo index showed a decline in expectations for the future even as businesses remained pleased with the current situation. That could be a sign that businesses were worried about the effect of turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa on energy prices, as well as what effect the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan could have on supplies of Japanese-made products like auto parts. About half of the responses to the survey came after the earthquake.'"
"'11-03-26,'0','Stocks rose for the third consecutive day on Friday, capping the best week for the Dow Jones industrial average since July.The government said the economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2010, slightly better than economists had expected and higher than the estimate made last month.Technology shares rose after the business software giant Oracle reported a 78 percent increase in income late Thursday. The company, which makes database software, credited new software license sales and the benefit of three full months of revenue from Sun Microsystems, a company it acquired last year. The Dow rose 50.03 points, or 0.41 percent, to close at 12,220.59. It gained 362 points for the week, the most since a 512-point jump during the week ending July 9.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 4.14 points, or 0.32 percent, to 1,313.80. The Nasdaq rose 6.64 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,743.06.All three stock indexes gained more than 2 percent for the week, helping them erase losses after the March 11 earthquake that hit Japan. The week started with a 178.01 point jump for the Dow after AT&T agreed to buy T-Mobile USA for $39 billion, raising hopes for more buyouts. Better economic reports and stronger earnings followed, driving more gains.'"
"'11-03-26,'0','The new round of protests and bloodshed came one day after the Syrian government tried to appease an increasingly angry popular revolt with talk of improved political freedoms and promises of restraint.Instead, it unleashed its forces, firing on peaceful demonstrators in and near Dara’a, according to a witness. There were reports of security forces firing on civilians in cities around the country, as well. For the first time since the protests began, crowds called for the downfall of the government and in one instance tore down a billboard-size photo of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad.Ahmed Sayasna, the imam of the Omari mosque in Dara’a, said the violence began after crowds set a fire under a statue of former President Hafez al-Assad, the current president’s father. Speaking by telephone, Mr. Sayasna said thousands of people gathered near the statue after Friday Prayer when officers from Syria’s central security forces lobbed tear gas canisters and opened fire with live ammunition. He said about 20 people were killed, and many more wounded.In Sanamayn, a city of 27,000 people about 40 miles north of Dara’a, a video posted on YouTube showed at least seven bloodied bodies lying on stretchers, at least three clearly with gunshot wounds. Mr. Sayasna said 10 to 15 people were killed there, while residents told The Associated Press that as many as 20 people had been killed. These figures could not be independently confirmed. In the capital, Damascus, several hundred protesters tried to rally, but were quickly dispersed by security forces as pro-government supporters took to the streets honking car horns and waving photographs of President Assad. In the city’s majestic Umayyad mosque, some men rose from prayer shouting “God, Syria and freedom only” — a counterpoint to the chants of pro-government supporters. There were also reports of troops firing on demonstrators in the suburbs of Damascus.In Latakia, President Assad’s hometown, two people died as protesters faced off against pro-government supporters, a witness said. A video posted on YouTube shows the body of a young man with a bullet wound being carried by protesters. There were reports of scattered protests and scores of arrests in several other cities.On Thursday, a longtime minister and adviser to the president, Bouthaina Shaaban, appeared to edge close to an apology for the deaths, insisting that the president had ordered security forces not to fire. Ms. Shaaban then laid out what she framed as concessions, saying that the government promised to consider lifting a state of emergency in place for decades and would consider more political freedoms — offerings that were dismissed out of hand by the public because they had been put forth before, in 2005, and never carried out.President Assad “doesn’t want the bloodshed at all, and I witnessed his directives on not using live bullets whatever the circumstances as he is keen on every citizen,” Ms. Shaaban said.“This doesn’t mean that there are no mistakes or practices which were not unsatisfactory and not up to the required level,” she said.Less than 24 hours later, witnesses reported that live fire was again turned on unarmed protesters.“This is exactly what has been happening around the Arab world,” said Ayman Abdel Nour, a Syrian opposition activist who is living in self-imposed exiled in the United Arab Emirates. “Sixty percent of Syrian society is less than 24 years old, and they want to be part of drawing and designing their future.”Mr. Sayasna, the imam in Dara’a, whose prominence in the community allows him to speak openly, unlike others there, said: “We are hoping for peace and quiet. The people only want freedom and dignity and an end to the emergency law.”Syria’s emergency law, in place since the Baath Party took power in 1963, has long been a focus of critics, who say it grants the government license to jail anyone with little pretext.Syria has few resources, but a strategic location bordering Iraq, Israel, Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan that its leaders have often tried to use as leverage. It has rankled the West and its Arab neighbors by forging close ties to Iran and by helping to sponsor Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas, the militant group controlling the Gaza Strip.The cascading events in Syria bear a remarkable resemblance to the course taken in other nations in the Arab world, where a relatively small incident — in this case the arrest of children who scrawled graffiti: “The people want the fall of the regime” in Dara’a — led to protests and a lethal government response. That in turn fueled wider rage, prompting government talk of concessions that were too little, too late.“There’s a real change in attitude from a couple of months ago, when Syrians were watching this take place in other countries,” said one Western diplomat in Damascus. “Now it’s here, and the government is very concerned.”The Syrian government “is sending a very mixed message — holding out carrots like the concessions announced on Thursday, and then beating and arresting and even opening fire on protesters,” the diplomat said. “I assume that indicates a lack of agreement or coordination in the government.”Karim Émile Bitar, a researcher at the Institute for International and Strategic Relations in Paris, said: “They tried to use the classic Baathist method: You wave a few carrots with one hand, while the other one is holding a huge stick. But the massacres in Dara’a are only going to strengthen the protest movements.”Syria has a liability not found in the successful uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt — it is a majority Sunni nation ruled by a religious minority. The ruling Assads and their circle are Alawite, a sect of Shiite Islam. Hafez al-Assad forged his power base through fear, co-optation and sect loyalty. He built an alliance with an elite Sunni business community, and created multiple security services staffed primarily by Alawites. Those security forces have a great deal to lose if the government falls, experts said, because they are part of a widely despised minority, and so have the incentive of self-preservation.The killings in Hama, when the Muslim Brotherhood, a conservative Sunni organization, moved against the government, resonate to this day — both for a resentful populace and for a government that fears revenge for its past actions.“These minority regimes are galvanized against defections and splitting,” said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “They believe if the regime comes down, they fear being slaughtered by the Sunni majority after what happened in the past. It makes it likely if these protests get bigger, it will be very bloody.”Sectarian tensions did not initially motivate this conflict. But they have begun to emerge. Mr. Tabler and Joshua M. Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said the demonstrators had started chanting: “No to Iran, to Hezbollah. We want a leader who fears God.”That, they said, is a direct reference to the Alawite faith of the leadership.“What makes this all surprising at this point is this is an area of Syria that is traditionally pro regime,” Mr. Tabler said. “So what the regime has been doing is suppressing a major Sunni base, all because a group of kids wrote graffiti on the wall.”The government had initially insisted that the protests and deaths were the work of criminals brought across the border from Jordan. A vice president and former foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, who is from the Dara’a region, said Thursday, “We are not opposed to the Islamic currents that are rational and broad-minded which understand their true roots, but as for Al Qaeda and the Taliban, which take their instructions from America and pretend that they are against it, they are condemnable.”And yet, even government supporters appeared taken aback by the decision to use lethal force. “The government believes we have to give people more freedom,” said Muhammad Habash, a moderate Islamist cleric and member of Parliament. But he added: “There was a very clear decision by the government to use guns. We are against using guns against people, there is no justification for using violence.”But Syria state television behaved as if the violence and protests had simply not occurred: it broadcast images of government demonstrations in every Syrian city, with crowds shouting “God, Syria and Bashar only.”'"

"'11-03-27,'0','Tournament organizers struggle to find sponsors, particularly in the United States. Though chess has a reputation as a worthwhile game to learn and play, it is not as easy to market as, say, poker.Yet the University of Texas at Dallas, whose team is one of the country’s best, found several novel sponsors for the tournament it held this month, including the Turner Construction Company.Lance Charriere, the company’s director of client relations, said Turner put up $10,000 and recruited Walker Engineering and the architecture firm Corgan Associates, both of Dallas, to help supply the remaining $18,000 the tournament needed. Charriere said the companies would also sponsor the Dallas tournament next year.Turner says it donated the money because the chess team is an important part of the university’s identity. The company, which has a 200-person office in Dallas, has built projects on campus. “We are aware of the community we live in, and U.T.D. is an important part of the community,” Charriere said. The chess program, he added, is “very dear to the heart of the president of the university.”The tournament was a Scheveningen-style team competition in which six of the university’s top players each played 12 games against six grandmasters. The grandmasters won 42.5 to 29.5, but one of the students, Julio Sadorra, a U.T.D. standout from the Philippines, earned the final norm for the grandmaster title.'"
"'11-03-27,'0','Wallace, who ran unsuccessfully for the presidency four times, was later elected to third and fourth terms as governor. Paralyzed from the waist down as a result of an assassination attempt in 1972, he publicly moderated his views on segregation toward the end of his life. He died in 1998.The party Dr. Cashin founded did succeed in changing the face of local offices throughout the state. In 1968, after Alabama refused to place its candidates on the ballot for the general election, the party sued. The case was ultimately heard by the United States Supreme Court, which ordered the state to put them on.In November, 17 of the splinter party’s candidates won local offices in Alabama’s Black Belt, the region, named for its rich, dark soil, comprising 17 counties in the central and western part of the state.But in Greene County, near Tuscaloosa, a judge defied the high court’s order and refused to place six of the party’s candidates on local ballots that fall. The case returned to the Supreme Court, which voided the results of the general election in the county and mandated a special election there.In that election, held in July 1969, the six candidates, all African-American, prevailed. Their victory — four seats on the county commission and two on the school board — was the first time since 1819 that Greene County’s government had not been controlled by whites.John Logan Cashin Jr. was born in Huntsville on April 16, 1928. His father, John Logan Sr., a dentist, and his mother, the former Grace Brandon, a junior high school principal, were active in civil rights work. His paternal grandfather, Herschel V. Cashin, had served in the Alabama Legislature during Reconstruction.After attending Fisk University, John Cashin Jr. received a bachelor’s degree in natural science from Tennessee State University. He earned a D.D.S. from Meharry Medical College, a historically black institution in Nashville, and joined his father in practice. In the 1950s, he served with the Army Dental Corps in France.The younger Dr. Cashin ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Huntsville in 1964. A licensed pilot, he took to the air in his single-engine plane each election season for years to drop campaign leaflets in the state’s black districts.Partly because of his civil rights activities, Dr. Cashin’s life had no small share of turmoil. As his daughter’s memoir recounts, he was long monitored by the F.B.I. The Internal Revenue Service pursued a case against him for years, saying he owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes. (The amount was later greatly reduced.)Although Dr. Cashin had been “moderately wealthy,” as The New York Times wrote in 1970, he poured nearly all of his personal resources into the party he founded, leaving his family in vastly reduced circumstances, Ms. Cashin wrote. In April 1982, Dr. Cashin was convicted of perjury in federal court in New York. He had been charged with giving false statements to a judge while trying to arrange bail for a narcotics dealer. He was sentenced to four months in prison.Later that April, Dr. Cashin pleaded guilty in an Alabama court to two counts of second-degree theft for having cashed his mother’s Social Security and pension checks for at least several years after her death. As The Huntsville Times reported, he served 17 months in a minimum-security prison.Dr. Cashin’s first wife, the former Joan Carpenter, whom he married in 1957, died in 1997. He is survived by their three children: his daughter, Ms. Cashin, and two sons, John M. and Carroll; his second wife, Louise White Cashin; and five grandchildren.'"
"'11-03-27,'0','As the nation grapples with a jobs crisis and unemployment hovers near 9 percent, it is easy for policy makers to forget the plight of those who work but earn very little. There are about 4.4 million workers earning the minimum wage or less, according to government statistics. This amounts to about 6 percent of workers paid by the hour. They need a raise.Today, a worker laboring 40 hours a week nonstop throughout the year for the federal minimum wage could barely keep a family of two above the federal poverty line. Though it rose to $7.25 an hour in 2009, up $2.10 since 2006, the minimum wage is still lower than it was 30 years ago, after accounting for inflation. It amounts to about $1.50 an hour less, in today’s money, than it did in 1968, when Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were killed, Richard Nixon was elected president and the economy was less than a third of its present size.The minimum wage has many opponents among big business and Congressional Republicans. In Nevada, the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce is pushing to repeal the state’s minimum wage, a whopping $8.25 an hour. Representative Darrell Issa, the California Republican, has proposed a bill in the House that would effectively cut the minimum wage in states where it was higher than the federal threshold by allowing employers to count health benefits toward wages.Opponents argue that raising the minimum wage would inevitably lead to higher unemployment, prompting companies to cut jobs and decamp to cheaper labor markets. It is particularly bad, the argument goes, to raise it in a weak labor market. Yet with unemployment likely to remain painfully high for years to come, this argument amounts to a promise that the working poor will remain poor for a long time.What’s more, we know now that the argument is grossly overstated. Over the past 15 years, states and cities around the country have rushed ahead of the federal government to impose higher minimum wages. Economists analyzing the impact of the increases on jobs have concluded that moderate increases have no discernible impact on joblessness. Employers did not rush off to cheaper labor markets in the suburbs or across state lines for a simple reason: that costs money too.The most recent research, by John Schmitt and David Rosnick at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, found that San Francisco’s minimum wage jump to $8.50 in 2004 — well above the state minimum of $6.75 — improved low-wage workers’ incomes and did not kill jobs. An even bigger jump in Santa Fe, N.M., the same year — from $5.15 to $8.50 — had a similar effect.'"
"'11-03-27,'0','While social conservatives have long wielded a greater influence in Iowa than in many early-voting states, a bitter fight here over same-sex marriage and rivalries among some of the state’s conservative leaders have amplified the issues and might help define the message of Republican candidates in ways that could resonate nationally.No events have focused solely on the economy, job creation or even the health care law that is widely reviled among Republicans. Instead, the most prominent platforms for candidates to introduce themselves have been a number of forums — three last week alone — before socially conservative audiences in Iowa.Several Republican prospects appeared here Saturday at the Conservative Principles Conference sponsored by Representative Steve King of Iowa, one of the party’s firebrands in Congress, who argues that “culture, not the economy, is the most important thing” in choosing a nominee. He said he planned to endorse a candidate “who can be an effective constitutional president.”All prospective contenders are trying to glean lessons from the 2008 Iowa caucuses, when former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas scored an unexpected victory, in part by winning over evangelical Christians. Four years ago, he was the only candidate to address a forum of Iowa pastors called Rediscovering God in America. But Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi and former Speaker Newt Gingrich were among those attending this year’s event.A balancing act has been on display all weekend.In an appearance before pastors on Friday, which was closed to reporters, Mr. Barbour criticized the president for supporting abortion rights and pledged to do “everything that we can to stop abortion.” He did not raise the subject when he addressed Mr. King’s conference on Saturday, and urged Republicans to focus on the Obama administration’s policies.“It is absolutely critical that we elect a new president,” Mr. Barbour said. “I think the best way — perhaps the only way — is for us to make sure the 2012 campaign is focused on policy.” He added, “The American people agree with us on policy.”A few minutes later, Mr. Gingrich signaled a different approach. He ranked values above the economy and national security in a three-point priority list for voters.“Some people may say we should stay away from values, stay away from social issues.” Mr. Gingrich said. “I’m here to tell you that if you don’t start with values, if you don’t start by saying who we are as Americans, the rest of it doesn’t matter.”Ms. Bachmann, also pledged to keep social issues at the forefront. To booming applause, she declared: “We’ve been told that we need a truce on social issues. I highly disagree with that. Social conservatism is fiscal conservatism.”Mr. Romney was invited to the forum but has not attended any events with other candidates this year. Former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota did not attend because of a family commitment.For Republican candidates, social conservatives have the only established political structure in Iowa, with churches, home-schooling groups and a variety of competing organizations providing ready-made lists of voters. There is no comparable network for fiscal-minded or moderate Republicans.Yet many contenders could split the social conservative vote, opening a path to victory for more business-minded conservatives like Mr. Barbour, Mr. Pawlenty or even Mr. Romney, who has played down his plans to compete in Iowa even though he has supporters quietly working on his behalf at the Capitol and is the only candidate with a network in all 99 counties.“Social conservatives could fragment, creating an opportunity for a fiscal conservative to sweep the field with people who aren’t as concerned with social issues,” said J. Ann Selzer, whose firm here conducts the Iowa Poll and other state and national public opinion surveys. “All candidates are going to have their fiscal credentials vetted.”Gov. Terry E. Branstad, a Republican who also led the state from 1983 to 1999, returned to politics last year and faced a strong primary challenge from a social conservative, Bob Vander Plaats. Mr. Branstad prevailed on an economic message in a contest that attracted 227,347 Republican voters, the state’s biggest primary turnout since 1994.But the presidential caucuses, a series of party gatherings across the state, require more effort than a regular election and are traditionally dominated by party activists. The outcome of Mr. Branstad’s race last year suggests that the electorate includes sizable numbers of moderate Republicans, but campaigns must work to expand the universe of caucus-goers, as Mr. Obama did when he won here in 2008, setting him on his course to the White House.“Obviously, the economic issues are critically important, considering where this country is right now,” Mr. Branstad said. “You’ll find people who are very concerned about social issues, but they are also deeply worried about the economy.”Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and is considering doing so again, is popular among many social conservatives. But his central focus is government spending, the national debt and foreign policy, all of which he said had rarely come up in conversations with Iowa voters.“I haven’t been asked too much about fiscal issues,” Mr. Paul said in a brief interview after speaking to parents who home-school their children. He added, “Focusing on only social issues will make a weaker candidate, not a stronger candidate.”The campaign in Iowa is off to a slower start than four years ago. The Iowa Straw Poll, the political carnival in Ames that provides an early test of support, is only five months away, leaving little time for campaigns to build their organizations. That makes the existing network of social conservative groups even more important.The political atmosphere in the state has changed considerably since the last time the spotlight of a presidential campaign shined on Iowa. Mr. Obama not only won the Democratic caucuses, he also carried the state by 10 percentage points in the general election.But last fall, few states saw a more significant shift than Iowa, with Republicans winning the governor’s office, taking control of the Iowa House and nearly capturing the Senate. An infusion of newly elected Republicans, many of whom campaigned on Tea Party principles and strong social conservative messages, have changed the climate.State Senator Kent Sorenson of Indianola, Iowa, a leader among the newly elected conservative officials, sponsored legislation seeking to require presidential candidates to produce a birth certificate. He said Iowa Republicans looked for a candidate with solid conservative credentials and were not interested in a truce on social issues, as Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana, another possible Republican presidential candidate, has suggested.Mr. Sorenson signed on to the likely presidential exploratory bid of Ms. Bachmann, who he believes will benefit from awakened social conservatives. As she met with voters in a four-day visit to Iowa, she urged them to look closely at what kind of Republicans they were.“It can’t just be a Republican. Do you hear me? It can’t just be a Republican,” Ms. Bachmann said, urging Iowa conservatives to set the tone for the nation. “We need to have people who have guts, who you won’t see melt like wax when they get there.”'"
"'11-03-27,'0','Still, Browns Ferry is ready for “a one-in-a-million-year flood, or however many zeroes you want to go out,” said Preston D. Swafford, the T.V.A.’s chief nuclear officer, who led a group of reporters on a three-hour tour through the plant.Inside the reactor building, near the entrance to the primary containment structure, are carefully marked spaces with two lime green carts about the size of hand trucks that a supermarket worker might use to roll cases of soda cans to the proper aisle. Each is loaded with batteries.One cart could power the instruments that measure the water level in the reactor vessel, an ability that Japanese operators lost a few hours after the tsunami hit. Another could operate critical valves that failed early at Fukushima.“They’re like a backup to the backup,” said Keith J. Polson, the T.V.A.’s vice president for the Browns Ferry site. “That’s what we think the Japanese didn’t have.”In the best tradition of an industry whose terminology is ever more impenetrable to outsiders, the battery carts are known as E.D.M.G.’s, a label for hardware derived from the industry’s Extensive Damage Mitigation Guidelines, largely put into effect after the Sept. 11 attacks.Deeper into the building, in an odd-shaped space in the basement between a corner of the square reactor building and the round containment shell is a steam-driven pump. This is something that the designer, General Electric, intended to be available to deliver up to 600 gallons per minute of cooling water into the reactor core even if the electrically driven pumps failed for want of power. An overheating reactor would be likely to have ample supplies of steam to run it.That worked at Fukushima for a while but appears to have stopped functioning later; the Japanese plant’s operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, has not provided an explanation. Again, the T.V.A. suggests that it has backup tools that the Japanese utility, known as Tepco, probably lacked: a battery-powered strobe light stored in a nearby cabinet, and a valve that usually runs on electricity but also has a hand crank.While the details of the Fukushima catastrophe may be months in reaching plant operators elsewhere, the T.V.A. hypothesizes that Tepco ran out of battery power to control the steam pump. But T.V.A. engineers say they could use the strobe light to determine how fast the pump’s shaft was turning, enabling workers to adjust its speed with a hand-cranked valve nearby.In plant stairwells, there are fire hoses attached to hydrantlike fittings that could hurriedly be connected to a reactor’s spent fuel pools. Water would be fed in from the outside — either the purified water normally used around the plant or, in a pinch, raw water from the Tennessee River, operators say.Fukushima sprayed seawater into its spent fuel pools but appears to have had problems getting the hoses and pumps in place before the water level in at least one of the pools, at the plant’s Unit 4 reactor, became dangerously low or possibly reached the bottom.Officials at the Alabama plant concede that they do not know exactly what went wrong in Japan. “They let the spent fuel pools get away from them; it’s kind of hard to fathom how,” Mr. Swafford said. “I’m glad I’m not living in their shoes,” he added.Perhaps more than most American nuclear plant officials, executives at Browns Ferry should realize they can expect the unexpected. In 1975, an electrician looking for an air leak in a cable room lighted a candle to see which way the smoke would blow and set off a fire that disabled most plant systems at Reactor No. 1. The plant was shut down for 18 months. And in 1985 the T.V.A. shut all of its reactors because of a variety of safety problems that industry experts say mostly boiled down to bad management. The others reopened, but Browns Ferry 1 stayed closed for 22 years.Restarting it required a five-year effort to rip out and replace much of the electric cabling, among other improvements.The authority also operates two nuclear plants in Tennessee: Sequoyah, in Soddy-Daisy, and Watts Bar, near Spring City. Combined with Browns Ferry, the plants make enough electricity to power more than three million homes in the Tennessee Valley, the T.V.A. says.The plants have massive, robust structures that assure safety, and many features have been added since they were opened in the 1970s to further reduce the risk of an accident, said William R. McCollum Jr., the authority’s chief operating officer. “Having said all that, we are not going to be complacent or satisfied,” Mr. McCollum added.Japan’s crisis has already prompted a shift in the T.V.A.’s strategic thinking, said Mr. Swafford, the authority’s chief nuclear officer. “We’ve started doing the what-ifs, what we’ve started calling ‘stacked’ events,” he said. “What clearly has shown up in Japan is multiple, stacked events. We’ve not analyzed for all those things.”He said the authority would keep exploring “until we’re comfortable we’ve gotten every one that’s humanly imaginable.”Yet Mr. McCollum said there were limits to the contingency planning. “There has to be a reasonableness to each one of these,” Mr. McCollum said of the plans, “or I think you could take it out to the 10th degree.”'"
"'11-03-27,'0','Ms. Gouda was one of about 19 women arrested that day. Though the army has denied all such accusations, her testimony is confirmed by other detainees and by human rights groups. They say that the women were taken to the Egyptian Museum, a tourist landmark beside Tahrir Square, tied up or handcuffed to the gate outside it, and then slapped, beaten and subjected to electric shocks.“They didn’t give us a chance to speak,” Ms. Gouda said. “They used an electric prod whenever we tried to speak.”The prisoners were later taken to the military prosecutor’s office, where the men were photographed as criminals beside a table full of clubs and Molotov cocktails supposedly confiscated from them. (In my experience, the people with such weapons in Egypt are usually plainclothes police officers.) The women were paraded before cameras and told that they faced charges of prostitution — leaving them terrified at the thought of the accusations being broadcast on state television.Ms. Gouda was extraordinarily strong in telling her story. But at one point she broke down in tears. “They know that the way they can harm a woman the most is by accusing her of prostitution,” she said.Later, the detainees were taken to a military prison. Ms. Gouda said that the women were strip-searched by a female guard, but — perhaps to add to the humiliation — the search was conducted in a room with doors and windows wide open. She said she did not know if anybody looked in.Then the unmarried women were subjected to a forced “virginity exam,” conducted on a bed in a prison hallway, by a man. When the women pleaded to be examined by a woman instead, they were threatened with cattle prods, Ms. Gouda said.“I was shattered,” she recalled. “My whole body was shaking.” Her legs were covered with a blanket, but a half-dozen military men stood behind her as she was examined, Ms. Gouda said.“I was ready to be beaten,” she added. “But the worst moment was when I was stripped and examined.”Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch said that such exams were not customary in prisons and that the point was to humiliate female activists. “In this context, they’re sexual assaults,” she noted — but added that the military is above the law.Ms. Gouda and the other women were all released after a few days, and in the end none were actually charged with prostitution. But many male democracy activists have been sentenced to prison terms.A Cairo human rights lawyer, Ragia Omran, estimates that perhaps 1,000 Egyptians who have been arrested by the military since the protests began remain in detention today. Some have been sentenced to five years in prison after military trials lasting 30 minutes or less, without any right to choose their own lawyers, she said.Ms. Omran is accustomed to representing other detainees. But during a referendum on constitutional changes this month, she herself was seized by soldiers while observing the polls. By her account, she was roughed up, strip-searched, shouted at and detained for hours until her well-connected family and friends managed to get her released.All this is a huge letdown from the triumph when “people power” toppled President Mubarak. The lesson may be that revolution is not a moment but a process, a gritty contest of wills that unfolds painstakingly long after the celebrations have died and the television lights have dimmed.“The revolution isn’t over yet,” Ms. Omran told me. “Freedom isn’t for free.”'"
"'11-03-27,'0','Q. When you first joined Frog Design, how big was the company?Q. What were some leadership lessons for you as the company grew?A. I think that what creative people want, more than money or fame or power, is to be listened to. They want to see their ideas be made into something. They love when something we work on actually goes to market. That’s more exciting to them than anything else you can give them. So it’s very important to get really, really interesting projects, with hard problems to solve. They might say, “Oh, this is so difficult.” But at the end of the day, they really love that.Part of this is just having, I think, an instinctual knowledge of people. I’m a people person. I like people very much. My mom always said I should have been a psychologist, because I can read a person pretty quickly and I have a lot of empathy for people. So I kind of pick up where there are weak points and use that. So part of this is just using your instinctual knowledge to make it work, and sometimes you fail. But that’s part of innovation. You fail fast. You move on.Q. Can you talk more about the culture of your company?A. The small things matter. We have many rituals. One is something called coffee time: every day at 4 o’clock, in every one of our studios around the world, everybody stops and they have the opportunity to go into the kitchen and people just socialize. They might play a game of Ping-Pong, they might play a video game, and there are pool tables, foosball. Different studios have different toys. That’s a ritual and that’s just accepted. That’s what we do.Q. Why do you do that?A. These are intense people. This is a time for them to take a break, to talk to people they might not work with, and to listen to things. That’s every day, Monday through Friday. We often joke that if we ever took coffee time away, we think everybody would quit. And we have 10 o’clock Monday-morning meetings at every studio, where they go over anniversaries, birthdays, projects, and share stuff that another studio has done. That’s something that’s really important to people.Then each studio has a little bit of its own culture to inspire creativity. They might go on field trips. There’s a “sketch jam” in one of the studios every Tuesday at noon, and people come in and they just practice their sketching skills. But that’s all accepted. That’s part of the culture.Q. How do you preserve the culture as your company continues to grow?A. You can only lose it if you want to lose it. I remember somebody telling me: “Oh, you can’t have a creative studio bigger than 30 people. If you’re bigger than 30, you’re going to lose it.” Then they said, “you can’t have it bigger than 70 people.” And then, “you can’t have it bigger than 100 people.” So now we’re up to 150 in one of the studios, and you know what, we’re still creative, we’re still driving it.The mission statement at Frog has always been to change the world, and our people are really passionate about that. And if you keep that in the front of your mind, it is amazing that no matter how big you get, if you hire the right kind of people, that’s their mission. And you have to empower people. Micromanagement is the death of creativity, so you have to create an environment where they can succeed, and where the environment can expand.Q. So how do you hire?A. There’s a certain type of personality you look for, because the business changes so rapidly and it moves so fast. As I always say, “Jump on the train, it doesn’t stop.” So you’re looking for people who are, obviously, very talented, very smart, who like process but understand that process has to change, and who are very eclectic in their thoughts and are passionate. I look for people who have that sensibility. They come from diverse industries. They have conquered something.They have to be very articulate, because, in our business, you have to explain complicated ideas that have never been done before. Let’s say a designer presents something to a client, and the C.E.O. asks, “Well, why did you choose that?” You don’t want somebody to say, “I don’t know — because it’s cool.” That’s not going to work. You need somebody who can really explain why you’re doing what you’re doing. Being creative is just not enough. And sometimes you get very, very creative people, but they can’t work in a team — it’s their idea or it’s the highway. That’s not going to work, either.Q. So what questions do you typically ask?A. One of the questions I always ask them is, why don’t you want this job? What are the things that scare you about this job? You learn a lot about a person that way. And if they say, “Well, what scares me about this job is it’s too chaotic,” they’re not going to thrive here. Or if they say to me, “You know, I like to be in charge,” then you’re thinking, this person’s not going to thrive in his group.You’re really looking for that person who understands the mission. Not that they agree with everything that you say, but they understand the mission. I want to hear someone who says: “I can contribute. I want to be part of this team. I feel like I can add some value and these are the reasons why.” That’s important. You want people who can put in and not take out.Q. Have you been given feedback about your leadership and management style that led to you to make some adjustments?A. People want to hear from me. I thought I was being very communicative. But they want more, so I send out updates constantly. They are usually pretty passionate and it’s about what’s going on in the business.I’ve added companywide phone calls. I’ve added town hall meetings and then I make my rounds to all the studios. And as I do, I just try to meet people one-on-one. I’ll set up a day and book my calendar to have one-on-one’s with people, because I’ve found that you learn so much that way.So that was an adjustment I had to make. Somebody said to me, “Well, how do you manage the time?” But you have to recalibrate. If your people are asking you for something, and you’re a people-driven business, you’ve got to listen to that. I think that’s part of being a good leader — really listening and making those adjustments and letting people know that you are serious about what you say. It’s not just lip service.Q. Some people might prefer to meet with a small group because it’s more efficient.A. What happens when you meet with five people or two people, there’s always going to be somebody who’s braver and talks more. There’s always an alpha in any group, and that’s O.K., but you’re not getting at what’s on people’s minds. And you learn different things. You learn about changes people want to make. You learn about their personal lives. We have a lot of people having children. So we have “kid day” now in certain studios. People bring their kids into the studio and we have arts and crafts. These are things that we’ve added as a result of wanting to include families into the equation. You get that from talking to people. If I sat at my 50,000-foot level, I’d die.Q. How do you get people to open up in those one-on-ones?A. I’ll just say, “What do you want to talk about?” I can start a conversation pretty easily and get people talking. Oftentimes, people just want to hear about the vision. Even though you’ve talked about the vision 5,000 times, people want to hear about the vision. They want to hear it from you. They want to be sitting close to you and they want to hear that, and that’s fine.Q. Why do you think that is?A. Despite all the technology we have in the world, people still need human contact. Think about it. I’m sitting with someone who is maybe newly married, maybe just had a kid, they have a house payment, and their spouse might have stopped working to take care of the child. They’ve got a lot of responsibility, and they’re looking at me saying: “O.K., do you get that? Is this company going to be O.K.?”I really take that seriously. I get the fact that I’m responsible for their livelihood. That’s a very human thing, and I want everybody to feel confident that we’re getting through that. We’ve come through a lot of downturns really well, and I think it’s because we keep everybody very focused on doing the best they can do. If you do the best work you can do, listen to your clients and work really closely with them, and you produce something that’s really great, then you’re going to be successful.'"
"'11-03-27,'0','Meanwhile up in Bryant Park, two other Ping-Pong tables occupy a proud spot just off West 42nd Street.According to Adrian Benepe, the Commissioner of the Parks and Recreation Department, which oversees 54 tables in recreation centers across the boroughs, these three parks represent something new for the city: an experiment in open-air Ping-Pongery.Each feels like an outgrowth of its very specific surroundings. As befits Manhattan’s most manicured park, the somewhat traditional-looking tables in Bryant Park are carefully branded, with a signature visual motif (and the name of the corporate sponsor) replicated on surrounding cafe tables.In addition to free paddles and balls, and to monthly public tournaments, the Ping-Pong area also offers suggestions on appropriate public decorum.“You are welcome,” an instructive sign reads, “to be polite, considerate and courteous in victory and defeat.”In Tompkins Square Park, to get the (also free) paddles and ball, you have to stop into the homey Flea Market Cafe on Avenue A and introduce yourself.Ping-Pong is often described as the world’s second most popular sport, after soccer.New York, with its cramped apartments, put a distinctive spin on it: the city turned a family recreation into a public event, played in gaming parlors rather than in private homes.As Nancy Franklin wrote in a 2003 article in The New Yorker, playing in front of strangers can have a corrective effect on the delusions of greatness that might flourish unchecked in a suburban rec room.But those strangers in those parlors were already interested in the game, whether as world-class competitors or as wide-eyed novices who had come to study their wicked moves.Placing a Ping-Pong table in the middle of a park has a different effect: it integrates the game into the fabric of everyday life.In Bryant Park, library workers or junior account executives play as maintenance crews turn the snow-damaged lawn into a vast expanse of wet brown earth, soon to be reborn as an oasis of green.In Tompkins Square last week, a teacup Yorkshire terrier named Axl sniffed around the table’s sculptural base while a rat, more than half Axl’s size, skittered past on the other side.And after a Ping-Pong tournament in Gulick Park, a neighborhood blog called The Lo-Down wrote, “An Estonian woman put on quite an impressive show of skill, as did her female Scottish opponent. Chinese-speakers, Spanish-speakers, African-Americans, Anglophiles and those of Yiddish ancestry (like myself) surrounded the table throughout the afternoon, all joined by a shared love of Ping-Pong.”So far from being precious about their artful creation, the folks at Henge are eager to see how the city begins chewing up their terrazzo tables.“Skateboarders are going to go for it,” Mr. Good said with unmistakable delight.In preparation, he has already begun designing “skateboard-ready, or grindable,” modifications to make sure the tables are up to whatever the skateboarders can dream up.To him, urban appropriations like that are what make it fun. “That kind of spirit — thank God they take risks, and thank God cities find new kinds of insurance to protect them,” Mr. Good said.Commissioner Benepe, who admitted to being a terrible player, said, “Depending on the success of this we’re going to try to do more.”Putting durable outdoor Ping-Pong tables in a park, he pointed out, is “not a huge investment” and “doesn’t take up a lot of space.” He said it was “the kind of thing I could see including when we do capital renovations of larger playgrounds.”In 1971, a United States Ping-Pong team visited China. The ostensible purpose was to conduct some exhibition matches, but the effort has been credited with helping pave the way for President Richard M. Nixon’s historic trip the next year and has been described as “Ping-Pong diplomacy.”Could the sport that paved the way for more open relations between two cold-war powers improve relations among New Yorkers, still shivering from a blustery winter?Clearly, some are already counting on it. At the Duane Reade on Avenue B and East Second Street, one vertical display positioned in front of a wall of beer features Ping-Pong balls on one side, condoms on the other. Let the games begin.'"
"'11-03-27,'0','Appealing to a generation awash in sound bites, Twitter and the rapid-fire exchange of information, he holds out the promise that if you follow a simple set of dictates, it is possible to “smash fear,” “learn anything” and “have it all.” In geek speak, he’s a “life hacker,” one who has collected both ardent devotees and harsh disparagers. In 2008, Wired magazine asked its readers to vote for self-promoter of the year. The winner? “Timothy Ferriss by a landslide,” the article said.Mr. Ferriss (not to be confused with the science writer of the same name) first came to national attention in 2007 with the publication of his self-help-cum-business book, “The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich,” which was rejected by 26 now-rueful publishers. Four years later, it’s still on The New York Times hardcover business best-seller list.Mr. Ferris attributes much of that success to timing. Twitter had just gone mainstream. Consumers, particularly Silicon Valley types, were awakening to the idea that there would always be more information than attention or hours in the day. Mr. Ferriss, positioning himself somewhere between Jack Welch and a Buddhist monk, offered solutions to what he calls the “time-famine phenomenon.” In the process, he exposed cracks in the seemingly sacred Baby Boomer model of life, where work is supreme and travel and hobbies are deferred until retirement.“Managing that pain and finding solutions was a very high priority for people at the exact same time my book came out,” Mr. Ferriss said last month while driving to his house in San Francisco.His thoughts on simplicity and efficiency are informed by an economic principle known as Pareto’s law, which posits that about 80 percent of the results of any endeavor come from just 20 percent of the effort and time put in. Yet his broader point is that streamlining the little things frees up time to pursue more meaningful ambitions.Four years later, with Americans even more burdened by information overload, these ideas seem increasingly relevant. Take one of the more tantalizing teachings in “The 4-Hour Workweek”: how to escape the crush of e-mail. Mr. Ferriss advises setting up an automatic e-mail reply that says in an effort to get work done, you’ll only be checking your in-box twice a day, at noon and 4 p.m.Even better, last month while he was on a four-week vacation to Colombia, Panama and Jordan, anyone who sent an e-mail message to Mr. Ferriss received his “nuclear” response. It begins: “Thank you for your email. Sadly, it will be deleted. To regain sanity, I am taking a break from e-mail until March. If still relevant, please email me again in the month of March.”Another Ferriss efficiency strategy: hire “virtual assistants” from Internet companies like Your Man in India and AskSunday who, for $4 to $25 an hour, will perform all of your time-sucking tasks — be it online research or paying your bills — freeing you to pursue more significant goals.Mr. Ferriss regularly presents this sort of advice on his blog, FourHourWorkweek.com/blog, and in appearances at places like Google, Facebook and the Harvard School of Public Health. A smooth marketer who cultivated relationships with influential bloggers to make his first book a hit, he’s also an adviser to companies like StumbleUpon, the Web site that enables users to discover content based on personal preferences.“It’s ironic that he wrote ‘The 4-Hour Workweek,’ ” said Garrett Camp, 32, StumbleUpon’s founder and chief executive. “He’s the exact opposite of that.”BORN in Southampton and raised in East Hampton, N.Y., Mr. Ferriss had his first taste of globe-trotting in high school when he spent an academic year in Tokyo as part of a student exchange program. By junior year, he was eyeing Princeton because it had a strong East Asian studies program, but his school guidance counselor said he had no hope of getting in.“It was really demoralizing,” Mr. Ferriss said. “I fortunately am wired such that I got really pissed and wanted to prove them wrong.” He knew that in terms of SAT scores and grades, he couldn’t be better than other applicants. But he could be different. “So I focused my essays on things like going to a sumo practice in Japan as a foreigner,” he said, “and what I learned from that.”It worked: in 1995 he arrived at Princeton, ultimately majoring in East Asian studies. (Neuroscience was his first choice — until he learned he’d have to bleed rats to death before dissecting their brains.) Sherwood Forlee, 31, a college friend, said Mr. Ferriss was obsessed with many of the subjects that consume him today: languages, combat sports, speed reading. Before he knew how to tango, he was break dancing.After graduation, Mr. Ferriss moved to California, taking a job in sales at a data storage company. Frustrated by his salary and what he considered to be inefficiencies at the company, he began spending his days surfing the Web and building his own Internet business. About a year later, he was laid off, yet by then he had founded a sports nutrition supplements company. By 2004 he says he was making more than $40,000 a month — but he was working around the clock. That is, until his girlfriend presented him with a plaque that said, “Business hours end at 5 p.m.!”As Mr. Ferriss put it: “That was her ‘Dear John’ letter.”Thus it dawned on a young Tim Ferriss that income had little value without time. So he decided to rethink his business. He bought a one-way ticket to Europe hoping to gain some clarity. Instead he had a nervous breakdown.“Because I did not know what to do with myself,” Mr. Ferriss said, sitting on the carpeted floor of a quiet hallway in the convention center. “My identity and my activities had been so solely occupied by business for so long.”Eventually, he figured out how to streamline his company while also bouncing from city to city: London, Galway, Berlin, Buenos Aires. By the time he returned to the United States, he had overhauled his methodologies — and had begun writing a best seller.INSIDE a ballroom at the Austin Convention Center, Mr. Ferriss stood on a stage beside a replica of five pounds of fat, telling an audience of about 2,500 that biology isn’t destiny. (When he spoke there in 2007, he was an unknown, talking to about 150 attendees.)The crowd swung between giggles and gasps as Mr. Ferriss showed video footage he shot himself: doctors in Cape Town were sliding a biopsy tube the size of a pencil into his thigh. One of Mr. Ferriss’s grosser self-experiments, it showed the extraction of tissue samples to analyze muscle fibers and endurance enzymes. When the tube was removed, a bleeding Mr. Ferriss looked into the camera, smiled wide and observed that they had just made “Tim Tartare.”The man who couldn’t experiment on rats in college loves to experiment on himself. Among the devices in his home: a Zeo headband (to monitor brain waves and sleep cycles), a pulse oximeter (to check the oxygen saturation of his blood), a glucometer (to track blood sugar) and a kitchen timer (for many experiments, including breath-holding, which he can do for more than three minutes thanks to tutelage from the illusionist David Blaine).“I push myself into the realm of the absurd so that whatever my audience considers impossible suddenly by comparison seems plausible and achievable,” Mr. Ferriss said. “If I’m willing to inject myself with stem cells flown in from Israel, maybe doing five minutes of hip flexor stretches twice a week isn’t too much to ask.”Mr. Ferriss’s new book is a health and fitness tome that discusses how to triple testosterone; work out with kettle bells (Mr. Ferriss lifts a 106-pound version called the Beast); even benefit from his, er, research on the female orgasm. He claims that with practice it’s possible to achieve 15 minutes of repeated orgasm; the area to focus on is “between 1 and 2 p.m. on the clitoris.”Many people, even critics, agree that Mr. Ferriss is impassioned. He’s considered a marketing crackerjack. And he’s at the forefront of the genre of self-experimentation writing. So what is it about him that drives some people nuts?“Tim just is all about Tim,” said Penelope Trunk, the author of “The Brazen Careerist: The New Rules for Success,” who often writes about work at Blog.penelopetrunk.com. She met Mr. Ferriss at South by Southwest in 2007 when he was courting bloggers to read his first book.Some readers agree with her, which seems to stem from the audacious tone of his writing. In a review of “The 4-Hour Body” in The New York Times, Dwight Garner wrote that the book “reads as if The New England Journal of Medicine had been hijacked by the editors of the SkyMall catalog.” Mr. Ferriss’s vibe, he said, is: “I’m Superbad, bro, and I have dimples. You’re a mole person who, if you become an angel investor in my books, might someday touch the hem of my Speedo.”Of the new book’s approximately 1,200 reviews on Amazon, most are positive. (About 100 are not.) Bloggers and some Amazon critics suspect, though, that Mr. Ferriss has had virtual assistants post some of those glowing reviews. Mr. Ferriss said there’s no truth to that, or need for it. He said his blog has about a million unique visitors a month. “Even 1,000 reviews would represent just one-tenth of 1 percent of my readers,” he said, adding that he sent out more than 1,000 advance copies of the book to friends and colleagues, all of whom he asked to write an Amazon review, whether or not they liked the book.Critics have also questioned the science behind the book’s more unusual suggestions, be it gorging yourself once a week or eliminating fruit (yet not wine) from your diet. As for a 15-minute orgasm: “My first impression is wow,” said Lori A. Brotto, a psychologist who studies female sexual health and is an associate professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of British Columbia. She said there are few studies on the subject, but one defined a “long” orgasm as one lasting 20 seconds to 2 minutes. Repeated orgasms could last longer.Not surprisingly, Mr. Ferriss has a system for dealing with critics. Last year, he outlined it in a talk entitled “Tim Ferriss Scam! Practical Tactics for Dealing with Haters.” (Mr. Ferriss cleverly slipped “scam” into the title so that a Google search on his name and that word calls up his blog ahead of his detractors’ pages; a perfect example of search engine optimization.)Mr. Ferriss said he’s learned he can’t please everyone and that if he tried, he’d be boring — and insane. So he focuses on the fans and embraces the adage, “Living well is the best revenge.”He appears to be doing so. This year, he plans to introduce a project to build 100 libraries or schools in 100 hours in developing countries. He’s also exploring television opportunities, studying screenwriting, learning Arabic, training for an ultra-marathon and striving to perfect a back flip. Another thing he’d like to hack: a relationship. He’s dating but doesn’t have a girlfriend. “A bunch of land with a big dog and a wife and a kid or two would be nice,” he said.Despite his efficiency, he feels a sense of urgency.“I feel like I could very well be 14 minutes into my 15-minutes of fame,” he said, sitting on a deck at the convention center in the dying sun. When a reporter suggested he didn’t really believe that, he said he didn’t take it for granted.“Even in the best-case scenario of not having something intervene and cut your life short, you don’t have that much time,” he said. “I do think that it can all be taken away in the blink of an eye.”But not just yet. That night, fans surrounded him at an Austin bar, thrusting their cameras into the hands of a reporter, asking for photos with Mr. Ferriss. The only blink was the flash.'"
"'11-03-27,'0','Was Thomas Nagel aware that his review of “The Social Animal” (March 13) illustrated the central point he objected to in David Brooks’s book? The surface of Nagel’s supposedly rational assessment is often cracked open by the evident irritation he feels toward the author. And what is it about Brooks that irritates him? Apparently, it is Brooks’s rather impudent assumption that the forces controlling our consciousness extend well beyond the limited boundaries of rational thought. What a terribly insulting idea that must be to anyone who has spent his life believing in the supremacy of reason, especially since high school. I was about to wonder if Brooks, in return, might have been rather irritated when he read the review. But I had to smile at such a foolish thought — indeed, how could I ever know?I’m glad I bought and read “The Social Animal” before reading Thomas Nagel’s review. The book presents fairly recent findings which, taken together, suggest in a quite digestible way that we are not who we think we are. Nagel patronizingly describes what he sees as Brooks’s inability to “create characters that compel belief.” But this misses the point. The imaginary people Brooks uses to illustrate his theory — Harold and Erica — are not the subject of the book; they provide a useful framework for combining a great many ideas, while making them palatable and interesting. Bringing the characters too much to life would be a distraction.Nagel wants us to know he already understands Brooks’s arguments and, indeed, knows them better. But most people do not. “The Social Animal” is a timely book that needed to be written.'"

"'11-03-27,'0','Affordable hotel rooms are as rare as raindrops in the high-flying Middle Eastern desert emirate of Dubai. Five-star crash pads charge several hundred dollars a night for a bed — and double or even triple that for suites — while most remaining accommodations are generic business hotels or charmless dives. The tall, 260-room Media One Hotel, opened in late 2009, tries to span the gap by offering cool contemporary décor and a smorgasbord of amenities.Smack in the heart of the Media City district, the hotel offers easy access to the Dubai headquarters of CNN, Thomson Reuters and other news outlets. The Palm Jumeirah, the first of Dubai’s three huge artificial islands to open, juts into the Persian Gulf nearby. It is an easy 10-minute walk from the Nakheel station of the new and impressive Dubai metro.The hotel strives hard (occasionally too hard) to be fun and trendy. A TV screen in the elevator announces, “Welcome to our funky new world,” and the room styles have names like “Hip Urban” and “Cool Room.” My 18th-floor “Hip Room,” notable for its commanding view of the neighborhood (mainly half-built high-rises and freeway interchanges), was done in a tasteful blue-white-green color scheme with lots of Scandinavian-style blond wood surfaces. Though smallish, it packed in a large closet, a cozy reading chair and a number of other furnishings and amusements for either business or a party. You can conduct commerce by day using the desk, free stationery, two phones, high-speed Internet (though no wireless access) and flat-screen TV with dozens of foreign stations. Come nightfall you can sprawl on the comfortable bed (outfitted with nine pillows), blast music from the powerful iPod docking station, crack open a bottle of Heineken from the minibar or, if you’re a big spender, order a magnum of Champagne (1,500 dirhams, or $417 at 3.60 dirhams to $1) from the 24-hour room service menu.White, bright, clean, marbled and well equipped. The deep half-moon tub had an adjustable sliding leather headrest for comfort while reading, and the separate toilet closet contained a third telephone. A hair dryer, digital scale, magnifying mirror, bathrobe and slippers were also on hand.Miami meets the Mideast at the attractive outdoor blue mosaic swimming pool, surrounded by white canopy beds, a D.J. booth and a Laurent-Perrier Champagne bar. It’s easily the hotel’s marquee attraction, and often hosts parties, weekend barbecues and Ladies’ Nights. A sleek, neon-lighted ground-floor bar, which feels a tiny bit dated, features a signature martini (chamomile vodka, martini bianco, lime and sugar; 40 dirhams) while a red LED ticker provides news headlines (and quotes about alcohol by Ernest Hemingway). The hotel also houses the airy CafeM on the ground floor (with free Wi-Fi and comfortable couches), the eighth-floor MED restaurant (serving everything from Lebanese mezze to fish and chips) and a small but modern fitness center. Hotel guests can also use the Chill Spa in a building across the street.For those who won’t be crestfallen by the lack of a helipad, beachfront club or celebrity chef, Media One Hotel offers one of the most comfortable and complete hotel experiences in Dubai for its price range. The absence of Wi-Fi in the rooms is a small blemish, but hardly a deal-breaker. Doubles from 430 dirhams ($120), with tax.'"
"'11-03-27,'0','To the Editor: Regarding the Practical Traveler column “When to Get Your Wallet Out” (March 13): The key is to know the difference between “tourism” and actual “travel.” A tourist merely wants to get in and get out quickly with a slew of photos and cheap souvenirs. A traveler allows enough time to move among the locals and leaves a positive impression that lasts long after he’s gone. The locals can easily distinguish between a tourist who seeks instant gratification and superficial “adventure,” and a traveler, who takes the time and effort to foster mutual intercultural respect in his destination of choice.To the Editor: These suggestions are creative and interesting, but they still give me the heebie-jeebies. I don’t have much experience traveling in remote places, but I have spent 20 years living around the world. When I travel, it’s not for “ethical” reasons. I try to maintain a low profile, learning as much of the language as I can, reading about history and culture before I go. What I offer is respect, curiosity and appreciation.What I bring home is invisible. I don’t have a house full of trinkets or prized photos. I just try to use what I’ve learned to change and deepen my understanding of the world. When I shop or tip, which is an inevitable part of travel, I simply follow my heart. It seems to work fine for me. Barbara Cornell'"
"'11-03-27,'0','The couple met in 1999 in Seville, Spain, but they had seen each other a year earlier at a friend’s New Year’s Eve party in Los Angeles.“I saw her from a distance and noticed her because she had very short blond hair,” Mr. Wolf said, “but I never got the opportunity to meet her. But I had asked about her, so I knew who she was.”They were introduced on Ms. Wissot’s first night in Spain by the same friend. Ms. Wissot was spending her junior year abroad, and Mr. Wolf was teaching English.“I don’t know if it was love at first sight,” he said, but the attraction was palpable — and mutual.Ms. Wissot had “wanted to be on my own and experience life abroad,” she said, “and then I fall in love with an American.”Mr. Wolf said that he “became inseparable with her, and it was something I didn’t really try to fight, despite it not being my plan.”She returned to Wisconsin to finish college, but they both found themselves in New York in 2000. They dated seriously but broke up in 2002.“We loved each other,” he said, but added: “We were both immature. It was sad when we broke up because she felt like the person I should marry, but I just knew I wasn’t ready to be with the person I would marry.”Though they dated others, Ms. Wissot’s elder sister, Michele, married one of Mr. Wolf’s best friends, so they kept tabs on each other even after he moved to Philadelphia for law school.In spring 2007, both were unattached when they arrived at a barbecue at the home of Ms. Wissot’s sister. It was their first serious interaction in a long time.“For both of us it was slightly awkward,” Mr. Wolf said. “We both felt a slight rekindling, and that started developing over the summer, but we were proceeding very cautiously with each other.” He described it as a weird limbo period during which they started to get to know each other again, going to lunches and seeing each other. “A more formal courtship than we had had before, which was funny since we had dated for years before.”That August, Mr. Wolf invited Ms. Wissot to join a trip he and his friends were taking to Turkey.“It was a very big deal that he asked me to go,” Ms. Wissot said. “That’s when we felt like our relationship started. We knew this was it. Being together at this point in our lives means we’re not breaking up again.” PAULA SCHWARTZ'"

"'11-03-27,'0','“I never thought of Ed as attractive or anything more than my husband’s boss,” said Ms. McCoy, 31, who remembered being stationed with her husband in Germany and having had occasion to interact with Sergeant Rossman through a support group she came to lead that sought to help war wives and their children.“Ed seemed scary to me at first,” she said, recalling how she would overhear Sergeant Rossman loudly yelling at soldiers. “But after we were introduced, he was nice and eager to help me learn the job.”After the funeral she found that her questions weren’t being answered by the casualty assistance officer assigned to her case. Remembering the generosity Sergeant Rossman had shown her family in Germany, Ms. McCoy — whom her mother, Gena Smith, calls “a free spirit” and a “spur of the moment” sort — began a regular series of telephone conversations with him.At the time, Sergeant Rossman, now 46, was dealing with his own problems. In 2004, he was injured in a mortar attack on his armored Humvee during a battle in Baghdad with 500 insurgents — which he described as being like a July 4th barrage, but “with bullets hitting vehicles like hail.”In the destruction, he knocked his head hard on his vehicle’s metal radio mount. “I thought it was whiplash,” he said, but later learned he had damaged a disk in his neck. “There was a lot of pain, but I survived. Not everyone did.” He endured a string of operations, one before relocating to Colorado in 2005, and six more afterward. Gradually, every disk in his neck was replaced with metal.There was also the matter of the collapse of his second marriage. By the time of Sergeant McCoy’s funeral, Sergeant Rossman had finalized divorce No. 2.Nevertheless, he was happy to help Ms. McCoy in this transition from Army wife to Army widow. He fondly recalled the exchanges they had had back in Germany, and how he had been impressed with the skill Ms. McCoy had shown in dealing with other military families. “She was a levelheaded person who treated others with respect even when they didn’t treat her that way,” he said.With the approach of spring in 2007, Sergeant Rossman — emboldened by the close relationship he and Ms. McCoy had developed over the phone, and by a brief kiss in a meeting at her parents’ home in Waco that February —decided to act on his romantic inclinations. He asked her if he could visit her the following month in Waco.The feeling was mutual. “I noticed his pretty blue eyes, his good build,” Ms. McCoy said. “In the earlier months when I cried over Greg and complained about how unfair it was that my boys didn’t have their daddy, Ed was comforting and supportive.”That March visit was a whirlwind of talking, joking, going to movies and taking the boys to family restaurants.Soon they were making more treks back and forth between Texas and Colorado Springs, where he had bought a large house.Of prime importance to Ms. McCoy was that Sergeant Rossman, who had two grown children of his own, truly enjoyed being with her boys. He regaled Logan and Tyler with stories about their dad, once telling them that Sergeant McCoy had played soccer with young Iraqi boys. On another occasion, he helped Logan and Tyler write cards and make balloons to send to their father in heaven.When he asked the three of them to join him permanently in Colorado Springs, Ms. McCoy wasn’t immediately sure she wanted to uproot her family once again. And if she were to do so, she wanted assurances from Sergeant Rossman that theirs would be a complete relationship.“He gave me the feeling he would always take care of us,” she said. “Plus, the kids already called him Dad.”Logan, in fact, had played a small part in bringing them to this point. Thinking back to Sergeant McCoy’s funeral, Sergeant Rossman recalled how, as he stepped out of a car, Logan seemed to have recognized him. “The way he ran up and hugged me made me feel good,” Sergeant Rossman said. “I believe the boys have gotten to know their dad through me.”At the end of May, Ms. McCoy gathered up her sons and belongings and moved to Colorado. Ms. McCoy, now a second-grade teacher at Pikes Peak Elementary School in Colorado Springs, explained, “I decided to push forward in my life and not spend years as a crying widow, especially when I had found such an amazing man as Ed.”About six weeks later, Sergeant Rossman, who says he “loves an intelligent, butt-kicking woman,” casually proposed while they were having dinner and seeing a movie at a mall. “I fall in love with her all over again every time I see her.”The next three years proved challenging, however. His neck pain went from bad to excruciating, and in 2008 he was forced to retire from the Army. Their wedding was twice postponed for more operations, the last of which, in December 2010, left him in such constant pain that he could barely turn his head. “I fight post-traumatic stress disorder every day and ask Lori over and over if she is sure she wants to marry me.”The stress nearly overwhelmed Ms. McCoy, too, as she fetched his 19 daily pills and his pain patch and yet still watched him suffer. “I broke down and told Ed he should be grateful to be alive, not dead like Greg,” she said.“I felt bad after I said it,” said Ms. McCoy, who was quick to reassure him that she is in it for the long haul.Sara Wulfkuhle, under whom Ms. McCoy studied as a student teacher, said, “To take on the carnage of a war that killed her first husband and still have a positive attitude is remarkable.”“That is Lori,” she said. “She accepts people for what they are.”Drawing on Ms. McCoy’s strength and encouragement, the ex-sergeant began volunteering at their Y.M.C.A. and even took over a lackluster Cub Scout troop affiliated with Ms. McCoy’s school, which is in a low-income district with more than its share of broken homes. “Doctors tell me to take it easy and give up the Cub Scout troop, but I do it anyway because those boys need me,” he said.So despite the pain issues, in January the couple set a third wedding date — but not before a cold spell froze their pipes and flooded all three floors of their home, forcing them into a hotel.In the late afternoon of March 20, under mostly blue skies and gusty Rocky Mountain winds, friends and family gathered on the porch of the Cheyenne Mountain Resort’s Quail Creek Lodge in Colorado Springs. Ms. McCoy’s ivory empire-style gown drew murmurs of admiration, and then, with Dale Angelee Bowman, an interfaith minister, showing the way, Tyler, Logan and Drew Rossman, the bridegroom’s 24-year-old son from his first marriage, each joined in pouring different colors of sand into a vase, which was intended to symbolize the union of two families. Little Logan said he felt “so happy to have a new dad who cares about me.”And then all moved on to the reception room, overlooking a lake, where a five-course dinner, donated by the resort and the local community, was served. About 70 guests watched with anticipation as the bridegroom moved onto the dance floor, twirling his happy bride and dipping her slightly, twice.“Those dips are a big deal,” said Joel Rauser, the bridegroom’s physical therapist, who specializes in treating wounded veterans. “Ed’s physical state is the worst of the worst.”But he remained strong throughout, and took joy in watching as barefooted Tyler and Logan began slipping and sliding across the dance floor with their young friends.“Poetic justice” is how Syerra Bagshaw, 15, the daughter of another Army vet, described the scene. “Ed and Lori were each kind of broken and probably not ready for any kind of serious relationship, but we can see how successful their marriage will be.”It was the bride, however, who put it all in perspective: “We just need to be happy for what we have.”'"
"'11-03-27,'0','Studios in recent years accounted for about 17 percent of all apartment sales in a year, but their market share dipped to 11 percent in 2010, according to data provided by Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and a market analyst for Prudential Douglas Elliman. The last time the market share for studios dropped by such a high percentage was two decades ago, when it fell to 9 percent in 1991, from 15 percent in 1990.“Market share for studios tends to drop off when conditions are weak,” Mr. Miller said. On the flip side, he added, “when prices are rising, studio sales increase as people get priced out of the larger units, and they buy studios because that’s all they can afford.”Many of today’s lower-priced studios are in co-ops, which can have strict policies against subletting and may not allow pieds-à-terre or buyers who need financial help from family or friends. The restrictions narrow the buyer pool, forcing owners to reduce asking prices. Still, studios in the lower price range, especially in sought-after neighborhoods, are more than likely to have a drawback or two.Rado Varchola, a senior vice president of Citi Habitats, has a studio at 92 Horatio Street, in the West Village, that came on the market nearly a year ago at $399,000 and is now listed at $300,000. In a coveted area, the apartment is also in an elevator building with a live-in superintendent. Maintenance is $676 (plus an $80-a-month assessment until the end of 2011). But it only has about 330 square feet of space, and cannot be sublet until the owner has lived in it for at least two years.“I’ve talked to people on the phone who are convinced they want to buy this apartment, but then they see the size and I don’t get an offer,” Mr. Varchola said. The rental market for studios is stronger; he said that the apartment could easily rent for about $2,000 a month. “If this was a condo or the building had a more lenient sublet policy,” he said, “it would have been sold a hundred times already.”At a similar building on West 64th Street that is made up primarily of studios and one-bedrooms, Ms. Sloane advised several studio owners within the last year to rent rather than try to sell. “I told them: ‘You’re not going to get the highest prices for this building right now,’ ” she said, adding that there are dozens of studios for sale in the neighborhood.A few of them are represented by Fern Hamberger, an agent at Citi Habitats. She recently had three studios available for $245,000 at 244 Riverside Drive; two are now in contract. “That’s an unheard-of asking price for this neighborhood, right on top of Riverside Park and right near the 96th Street subway,” she said. All three apartments, which are owned by an investor and need renovating, came on the market in early 2010 at $315,000. “Last year wasn’t so hot,” Ms. Hamberger said. “But we lowered the price and now we are at the right price.”Michael Murphy, a vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said the owner of a studio in Chelsea, at 101 West 23rd Street, tried selling it two years ago, then rented it out for a while, and has decided to list it again, even though he will probably take a loss. “It would be easier to rent than sell,” Mr. Murphy said, “but the owner is just ready to move on.”The apartment, in a doorman building, came back on the market last summer at $255,000 and was recently reduced to $199,000. With approximately 550 square feet of space, it is one of the roomiest studios available in this range, but it has a hefty maintenance fee of $1,257 a month.Mr. Murphy said most of the people who had checked out the place were young first-time buyers looking to move out of a rental and to start building equity in a home. The buyer pool is much the same for the $279,000 studio at 304 East 73rd Street represented by Jennifer Ferland, an agent at A. C. Lawrence. That apartment, in a prewar elevator building, has about 480 square feet and a wall of windows that overlook 73rd Street. Its largest drawback may be that it is steps from Second Avenue, which has been overrun by subway construction.“A lot of the people who have come to look are first-time buyers,” Ms. Ferland said. “And they’re looking because they feel they should be looking and they think it’s time to buy.”Frazier, a 33-year-old interior designer, fits that description. He started his search in the middle of 2010 and saw dozens of studios south of 34th Street for under $350,000. “It was a little depressing, because for that price I could have a very large house anywhere else,” said Mr. Frazier, who is from . “And here I was looking at one room, sometimes with no separate kitchen or any kind of closet.”But with prices and rates down, Mr. Frazier felt it was time to move out of his one-bedroom rental in Astoria and to buy in Manhattan, even if it meant less space. He wound up buying a “teeny tiny” studio in the heart of Greenwich Village for less than $300,000. He has been living there since late December and plans eventually to redo the kitchen and bathroom. “It suits the lifestyle I have right now,” he said. “I’m never home; I just need a nice place to lay my head.”Lisa Holland-Davis, a vice president of Halstead, has several studio listings on the Upper East Side. She said they had attracted both first-time buyers and people looking for a pied-à-terre. “They want someplace in the city to hang their hat, but not have heavy overhead,” she said.One of her listings is a studio at 345 East 77th Street, a prewar elevator building with a live-in superintendent, asking price $235,000. The monthly maintenance is $503. The apartment has a Pullman kitchen and looks out on a dark interior courtyard. An apartment with a view, Ms. Holland-Davis said, would naturally cost more. “Most apartments in this price range are in walk-up buildings that don’t have a laundry or a resident super,” she said. “What $235,000 buys you is a piece of Manhattan.”On the Upper West Side, a few studios are available for around $300,000 in prewar doorman buildings right on Central Park West.Margaret Bay, a vice president of Brown Harris Stevens, has a studio at 257 Central Park West listed at $275,000. “It hasn’t been touched since the mid-1970s,” Ms. Bay said, explaining why her listing does not show any photos of the interior. “But there’s been enormous activity on it because the location is great.”A few blocks away, at 225 Central Park West, is a studio with a “sidelong view of Central Park” that was listed at $319,000 last December with a maintenance of $840. It is now in contract. Brian Lewis, an executive vice president of Halstead, was the listing agent.“We had to be really attractive with the price,” he said, because the building, known as the Alden, requires a 35 percent down payment and does not allow pieds-à-terre, investors, guarantors, or parents buying for children. “Those kinds of restrictions protect the building’s share value,” he said, “but they can be very limiting for small apartments.”The limits did not keep Timothy Dawson from his recent purchase of a $280,000 studio in the building. Mr. Dawson, an equity trader, lives in a one-bedroom on the Upper West Side but was looking to downsize after a divorce. His new place faces west and has wide-open city views, but it was the location that won him over. He and his Labrador retrievers, Butter and Sable, take daily walks in Central Park.Noting that the comedian owns a place next door at the Beresford, Mr. Dawson said, “You can buy a home with great light and views for under $300,000, be one block north of Seinfeld, and feel pretty good.”'"

"'11-03-28,'0','From her customary blue seat in the front of the No. 47 bus to the right of the driver, Sandra Brown watches the drab suburban scenery — the Bodega Hispana and Jasmine’s Beauty Hut, chiropractors and storefront churches, dollar stores and middle-class homes — as part of her long daily ride to work.It’s three buses from her home in Rosedale, Queens, to East Meadow in Nassau County, where she works as a home health aide. It’s three buses back. She leaves home at 1 p.m. and gets to work at 4, sleeping over. She leaves work at 7 a.m. and gets home at 10. Then she does it all over again.But maybe for not much longer. “As of July 3, 2011, this bus will no longer be running,” reads the orange sign in front of her seat. The No. 47 bus is one of the routes scheduled to be canceled in budget cuts that would eliminate more than half of the 48 Long Island Bus lines, Nassau County’s bus system, which serves 100,000 riders daily. About 16,000 riders would be affected.“People have to get to work,” Ms. Brown said in a light Jamaican lilt. She was bundled up against the cold in a brown overcoat and brown knit cap. “And for a lot of people, this is the only way they can get there,” she added. “A lot of people aren’t going to have any job if they can’t take these buses. What are they going to do then?”In our imploding world, big disasters trump little ones; thousands of budget cutbacks make nearly all of them invisible, unless, of course, it’s your job, your office, your bus.More than 300 riders and advocates showed up to protest the cuts at an impassioned public hearing at Hofstra University on Wednesday, but many others figured they might as well save their breath. “You could get an ulcer, all stressed out, complaining about it, but it’s not going to change anything,” said Lyndelle Bradley, who caught the bus at the Nassau University Medical Center.'"
"'11-03-28,'0','Visitors to the Bronx Zoo were greeted with locked doors when they tried to enter the reptile exhibit this past weekend, and with good reason: a venomous snake was on the loose.“The World of Reptiles is closed today,” a sign explaining the closing said. “Staff observed an adolescent Egyptian cobra missing from an off-exhibit enclosure on Friday.”The Egyptian cobra, a favorite of snake charmers — and probably the asp whose venom Cleopatra used to commit suicide — is a dark snake with a narrow hood, and grows up to two yards in length. (The missing animal was only 20 inches, a zoo employee said.) Native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, it usually preys on toads and birds, not humans, but zookeepers notified the public in an abundance of caution. The snake’s toxins can cause respiratory failure.The director of the zoo expressed confidence that the snake was still in the reptile house and said the snake would probably avoid open areas. “To understand the situation, you have to understand snakes,” Jim Breheny, the director, said in a written statement. “Upon leaving its enclosure, the snake would feel vulnerable and seek out a place to hide and feel safe. When the snake gets hungry or thirsty, it will start to move around the building. Once that happens, it will be our best opportunity to recover it.”Until the creature slinks into view, zoo visitors should plan to skip the reptile exhibit, and maybe keep an eye on their ankles.“Of course it happened on the day I come,” said Andrea Regan, 26, of Granby, Conn. “I wasn’t scared, but snakes aren’t my favorite thing, so I wasn’t too excited about that.”Her friend was excited, however. “I wanted to see it, take a picture with it and run,” said Nick Christiana, 27, from Bristol, Conn.'"
"'11-03-28,'0','In what passes for self-restraint these days, House Republicans have been insisting that they do not intend to repeal last year’s Dodd-Frank financial reform law.Not in one fell swoop, anyway.A direct assault on Dodd-Frank would be so blatantly biased toward that it would be sure to provoke a public backlash. So the Republican plan is to delay and disrupt reform. The effort is partly ideological — an insistence that regulation is unnecessary, no matter the evidence to the contrary. It is also a campaign fund-raising ploy, because Wall Street will reward the opponents of reform. Of course, Democrats are themselves not indifferent to Wall Street campaign cash, which raises the question of how effectively they will counter the Republicans’ aims. Here are areas to watch.DERIVATIVES Budget cuts could cripple the and the — which share the vital task of regulating the multitrillion-dollar derivatives market. The budget impasse in Washington has already frozen the agencies’ budgets, even as their rule-writing duties have exploded. Worse, prevailing Republican rhetoric, adopted in part by Democrats, portends more budget cuts, which would leave the agencies unable to enforce current rules, let alone new ones. Settling for less than ’s requested amounts for the agencies would be acquiescing in the derailment of Dodd-Frank.CONSUMER PROTECTION The , arguably the most innovative of the reforms, has been under constant attack by banks — and Republicans. Most recently, a House hearing on the bureau that was billed as an oversight session was instead a hazing of , the law professor and consumer advocate chosen by Mr. Obama to set up the agency. Republican objections boiled down to charges that the agency — and Ms. Warren — have too much power. Ms. Warren’s rebuttals were clear and persuasive. Mr. Obama could define the debate further — and demonstrate his professed support for the bureau — by going on the offensive and nominating Ms. Warren as its official director. Senate Republicans have said that they would object, but it is their own credibility that would be at risk in opposing so qualified a candidate.REPEAL BY ANOTHER NAME House Republicans have unveiled several bills to undo Dodd-Frank piece by piece. One would rewrite the law so that the C.F.P.B would be run by a five-member bipartisan board, rather than one director, a recipe for delay and division. Another would exempt an array of derivatives users from the new rules, perpetuating the deregulated market.Yet another bill would repeal a requirement for firms to register with the S.E.C, in effect ignoring the systemic risks in leveraged pools of private capital. And one would repeal a requirement that publicly traded companies disclose the ratio of a chief executive’s pay to that of a typical employee, a move that would deprive analysts of data to detect bubbles that correlate to skewed pay. The list goes on.'"
"'11-03-28,'0','Mark Burnett, the most successful reality producer in television, with “Survivor” and another business show, “The Apprentice,” on his résumé, jumped at the chance to produce “Shark Tank” both because he was familiar with the show from British television (where it was called “Dragon’s Den”) and because of his personal entrepreneurial experience.“I emigrated here from England and started out selling T-shirts on the beach,” Mr. Burnett said. “I can really identify with these entrepreneurs.” He said he had also produced a pilot for VH1 about “business turnarounds.”Last year, “Shark Tank” was a marginal success on Sunday night. This year, it is playing regularly on Friday nights and has added some celebrity juice to its panel of venture capitalists, in the form of the comedian Jeff Foxworthy and the prominent businessman — and sports franchise owner — Mark Cuban.Mr. Cuban certainly believes in the concept of putting up his own money for entrepreneurial ideas. He said in a telephone interview, “I get amped up about a lot of things, as people know, but this was exciting.” One of the aspiring entrepreneurs managed to get the bidding up to $4 million, a sum that Mr. Burnett said was probably “the biggest amount ever available in a nonfiction TV show.”“Dragon’s Den” began in Japan, and the format is owned by Sony. Steve Mosko, the president of Sony Pictures Television, said the format for “Dragon’s Den” had been sold in 38 countries, and had become a hit in many. (The most recent editions are in Poland and Saudi Arabia.) Mr. Burnett changed the title thinking that, in the United States, dragons would not conjure the image of tough venture capitalists as well as sharks would. “Blood in the water and all that,” Mr. Burnett said.Mr. Mosko said it should be “the perfect format” for American audiences, given the whole “American dream thing.” From a business point of view it has another advantage, as one former reality-show producer noted: it’s cheap to make.At a production cost of only about $750,000 for an hour (in part because the millions in commitments for the business ventures come from the investment sharks, not the network) the show is such a bargain it could stay on the air even with less-than-stellar ratings, said the executive, who asked not to be identified in order to preserve relationships with the network.“America’s Next Great Restaurant” doesn’t have the advantage of extremely low cost. NBC formed a partnership with Steve Ells, the founder of the Chipotle Mexican Grill chain, to create the show, which challenges chefs to endure tests to prove they are worthy of serious investment in their restaurant ideas.The network and Mr. Ells have committed to creating a new restaurant chain with the winner of the contest and have already started building three restaurants in what Mr. Telegdy called “prime locations” in New York, Los Angeles and Minneapolis.Mr. Telegdy, who is British, hatched the restaurant idea partly because he too watched “Dragon’s Den” on the BBC. He said the format seemed promising, but he wondered about the breadth of the appeal of some of the winning ideas, like an ankle bracelet that sends distress signals for an overboard yachter.“Whatever 21st century capitalism is in a kind of post-bank-apocalypse, post-bailout world, America can’t forget it is really good at innovating and starting businesses,” Mr. Telegdy said.Mr. Burnett said all the business people being portrayed on reality shows might help counter the persistent image on fictional television of the executive as a villain, though Mr. Cuban didn’t entirely agree.The regular folks “chasing the dream” are the people worth watching, Mr. Cuban said. “Everybody has that idea: this could be it. That’s what people will empathize with and rally around.”“Big business people really are villains,” he added. “They’re idiots. They nearly drove this country into a depression.”'"
"'11-03-28,'0','In a technology-crazed nation where many people were glued to cellphones and accustomed to the Internet’s nearly instantaneous access to information, being cut off has proved disorienting and frightening. Many local governments in the hardest-hit areas, desperate to reach residents with important emergency information, have reached into the past for more tried-and-true means of communication, including radios, newspapers and even human messengers.“When cellphones went down, there was paralysis and panic,” said Shoji Ogasawara, the head of emergency communications at Miyako’s City Hall, where the tsunami filled the first floor with foul-smelling mud. “Everyone was running around asking, ‘What happened to the nuclear plant? What happened to our town?’ ”Throughout the country, people have turned to low-tech alternatives in their sometimes frantic search for news of loved ones in quake-affected areas. They have posted notices on bulletin boards and recorded tearful pleas on television. Even in Tokyo, normally a high-tech showplace for the nation, residents have turned to improvisation.A small shop near Tokyo Station that specializes in products from Fukushima Prefecture, the site of the stricken nuclear plant, suddenly founded itself crowded by people who came because it carries newspapers from that region, which are hard to find elsewhere in Tokyo. About 500 people now visit the store each day to scan the newspapers’ lists of names of those in Fukushima’s refugee shelters, a manager, Yutaka Suzuki, said.While Tokyo’s cellphone service has been restored, much of Miyako remains cut off from cellphones and the Internet.The city’s main way of releasing the names of survivors of the disaster is to tape printed lists on the walls of City Hall. Lacking e-mail, officials deliver by hand these lists to other city offices for posting.To warn residents in the event of another tsunami, Miyako relies on a network of more than 300 outdoor loudspeakers and sirens, some of which date to the end of World War II.Waves from the 25-foot tsunami also knocked out roads and electricity. As a result, city officials say, radio has proven to be the most reliable medium to get information to survivors scattered over a wide area.Within a week of the earthquake, a group of residents got permission from the city to create a small, emergency radio station, Miyako Disaster FM, which began broadcasting on Tuesday from what had been an unused room in a building run by the national farm cooperative. They equipped it with a few microphones on a folding table, and a transmitter whose signals reach up to nine miles.While large stations provide national news, Miyako Disaster’s founder, Hisao Hashimoto, said his fills a need for very local information: stores that are open, goods that are for sale and above all, messages from people looking for missing friends and family members.“In a disaster, radio has been the best way to get real-time information,” said Mr. Hashimoto, a 56-year-old magazine editor who said he had long dreamed of starting a radio station. “All you need is a hand-held receiver and batteries, or a car radio.”On a recent morning, a wave of excitement filled the cramped studio: minutes after broadcasting a message from a relative looking for a woman named Noriko Yamaguchi, someone from a refugee center called to say Ms. Yamaguchi was there, and safe.“These are the moments when you realize how much the community is depending on us,” said Ayako Kimura, 34, an office worker whose role as chief on-air personality has quickly transformed her into a local celebrity.As Internet service is restored, Mr. Hashimoto has begun to use services like Twitter to spread word about the broadcasts. But radio, he said, remains the most important medium for another reason: the large number of elderly in Japan’s rapidly aging rural communities in the north who shy away from the Internet.That was evident at Sokei Elementary School, one of 61 makeshift shelters housing Miyako’s some 4,900 survivors of the tsunami, where many of the 130 people sleeping on the gymnasium floor are middle-aged or older. Many said they had become loyal listeners of Miyako Disaster’s twice-daily broadcasts.“My generation doesn’t use the Internet,” said Emiko Okubo, 57, a restaurant worker whose home was washed away.Many shelters are also printing their own mini-newspapers. In his free time, Katsutoshi Maekawa, a city employee who works at the Sokei Elementary shelter, produces the Sokei Community Daily, a one-page newsletter that tells refugees here about events at the shelter and surrounding neighborhood.“Paper can be read right away and passed around,” Mr. Maekawa, 34, said. “No turning on a monitor, no online connections, no keyboards.” Even younger Japanese like Mr. Orui, who prefer to go online, say weeks of being cut off from the Internet have made them realize how reliant they had become on new technologies that could be so easily disrupted.“Cellphones and the Internet were the first things to go,” said Eri Itobata, 17, a high school student who volunteered to help Miyako Disaster radio. “Thankfully the old technologies were still around.”'"
"'11-03-28,'0','The sharp arguments are a testament to the central role that social framework analysis has come to play in scores of major employment discrimination cases. Describing what was at stake in such cases, a 2009 article in The Fordham Law Review defending Professor Bielby said the debate was “about the existence of unconscious or implicit bias, the continued seriousness of discrimination as a force in the modern workplace and the appropriate reach of legal remedies to challenge discrimination.”The Supreme Court is not considering whether Wal-Mart, the country’s largest retailer and biggest private employer, in fact discriminated against women who worked there. For now, the question before the justices in the case, Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, No. 10-277, is only whether hundreds of thousands of female workers have enough in common to join together in a single suit.To make that case, the plaintiffs submitted 120 sworn statements describing what they said was anecdotal evidence of discrimination. They also offered statistics showing what they said were suspicious gaps in pay and promotion between men and women.Wal-Mart disputes the plaintiffs’ evidence as unrepresentative and unreliable. But even if all of it were established fact, anecdotes and statistics would not be enough. Supreme Court precedent also requires lawyers pursuing a class action to identify the common policy that they say led to unlawful discrimination.For that, the lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Wal-Mart case turned to Professor Bielby, who teaches at the University of Illinois at Chicago and has testified in scores of similar cases.Social framework analysis gives courts general information — a framework — drawn from social science. Testimony about the reliability of eyewitness identification can, for instance, serve a valuable role in cases in which prosecutors seek to rely on such evidence.Professor Bielby, who declined a request for an interview, told the trial court that he had collected general “scientific evidence about gender bias, stereotypes and the structure and dynamics of gender inequality in organizations.” He said he also reviewed extensive litigation materials gathered by the lawyers in the case.He concluded that two aspects of Wal-Mart’s corporate culture might be to blame for pay and other disparities. One was a centralized personnel policy. The other was allowing subjective decisions by managers in the field. Together, he said, those factors allowed stereotypes to infect personnel choices, making “decisions about compensation and promotion vulnerable to gender bias.”The methodology he used, Professor Bielby explained, was social framework analysis. He cited the seminal work of the two law professors at the University of Virginia, Professors Walker and John Monahan, in the first of 123 footnotes in his 41-page sworn declaration in the case.But Professors Walker and Monahan contend in their academic writing that Professor Bielby has misused social framework analysis. It is fine, they say, to give courts general information about social science research. But it is improper, they continue, to draw conclusions about the matter in dispute without conducting first-hand research.“This is a case about a missing link,” Professor Walker said of the Wal-Mart litigation. “You can make the link, if you do the research. But what’s holding this class together is — nothing.”That position, also set out in a 2008 article in The Virginia Law Review by Professors Walker, Monahan and Gregory Mitchell, has prompted sharp responses.The Fordham article, by Professors Melissa Hart and Paul M. Secunda, said that Professors Walker and Monahan “seem to suggest that their coining of this phrase gives them a unique right to define the terms and content of expert testimony offered in employment discrimination cases.”Professors Hart and Secunda added that the third author of the Virginia article, Professor Mitchell, is affiliated with a firm that has provided expert witness services to defendants in employment discrimination suits.Professor Mitchell said in an e-mail that he was “against bad science whether offered by plaintiffs or defendants” and that his firm’s work “has been for defendants in employment cases because ‘social framework analysis’ has become so popular among the experts used by plaintiffs.”He added that if his academic critique of social framework analysis was accepted by the Supreme Court, “then the likelihood of me being asked to testify against bad social science experts will go down.”“And I would welcome that development,” he said.For their parts, Professor Walker said that he and Professor Monahan “don’t have a dog in this hunt,” adding that “we’re working purely on keeping the methodology proper.”Laura Beth Nielsen, a sociologist and lawyer who worked on the American Sociological Association’s brief defending Professor Bielby, said “it is tremendously important that jurors and judges understand what we know about the world.” But, she added, “you have to be cautious.”In the Virginia Law Review article, Professor Walker and his colleagues said Professor Bielby had been far from cautious. In particular, they said, “Dr. Bielby’s report provides no verifiable method for measuring or testing any of the variables that were crucial to his conclusions.”At his deposition in 2003, Professor Bielby was asked “how regularly stereotypes play a meaningful role in employment decisions at Wal-Mart.”Asked whether he could give any guidance in “a range between, you know, .5 percent of the employment decisions and 99.5 percent,” he said no.Should the Supreme Court allow social framework evidence like that presented by Professor Bielby, many large employers could be vulnerable to class-action claims, Professor Walker said. “If this is enough,” Professor Walker said of Professor Bielby’s declaration, “this opinion is perfectly transportable.”In a brief supporting Wal-Mart, lawyers for Costco agreed. Certifying a class in the Wal-Mart case, they said, would mean that “employers with decentralized business models will have few avenues available to escape a Bielby-enabled certification order, other than resorting to surreptitious quotas.”'"
"'11-03-28,'0','WITH the world’s attention on the uprisings in the Middle East, repressive regimes elsewhere are taking the opportunity to tighten their grip on power. In China, human rights activists have been disappearing since a call went out last month for a Tunisian-style “Jasmine Revolution.” I know what their families are going through. Almost a year ago, the Chinese government seized my husband and since then, we have had no news of him. I don’t know where he is, or even if he is alive.In 2001, the Ministry of Justice listed my husband, Gao Zhisheng, as one of the top 10 lawyers in China. But when he began representing members of religious groups persecuted by the government, he became a target himself. His law license was revoked, and our family placed under constant surveillance. In 2006, he was convicted of inciting subversion based on a confession he made after his interrogators threatened our two children. He received a suspended sentence, but was briefly detained again a year later for writing an open letter to the United States Congress documenting human rights abuses in China.Zhisheng wouldn’t give up his work, and yet he was frightened for me and our children, so I fled with them to asylum in the United States. Soon after we left, in February 2009, he was seized by security officials, and that time held without charges for more than a year. International pressure persuaded the government to release him. But two weeks later, as soon as the world’s attention moved elsewhere, he was abducted again. That was last April. No one has heard from him since.We have good cause to fear that he is suffering. My husband has been tortured many times. In 2007, officials subjected him to electric shocks, held lighted cigarettes up to his eyes and pierced his genitals with toothpicks. In 2009, the police beat him with handguns for two days. He has been tied up and forced to sit motionless for hours, threatened with death and told that our children were having nervous breakdowns.Though his treatment has been especially harsh, my husband is only one of many political prisoners in China. Among them are Liu Xiaobo, the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who is serving an 11-year sentence for subversion, and his wife, Liu Xia, who is under house arrest. A human rights group reports that more than a hundred bloggers and rights advocates have been interrogated or detained in connection to the “Jasmine Revolution.” And especially ominous have been the disappearances of other prominent human rights lawyers, like Jiang Tianyong, Teng Biao and Tang Jitian.In President Obama’s speech to the United Nations last year, he said that “freedom, justice and peace for the world must begin with freedom, justice and peace in the lives of individual human beings.” The Chinese government must not be allowed to claim that China is a nation operating under the rule of law while persecuting those who try to ensure that it respects the law. And when the government silences dissent, the international community must speak up.Indeed, I am excited to have just learned that the United Nations has demanded that my husband be released, and hopeful that it will take a stand for the other prisoners as well. I appeal to Mr. Obama — a father, lawyer and leader of the country that has become my family’s new home — to make sure it does so. At the very least, he should ask President Hu Jintao to let Zhisheng contact us.'"
"'11-03-28,'0','The N.C.A.A. tournament is introducing the world outside the West Coast Conference, where Gonzaga reigns like Godzilla, to Vandersloot, who has led the 11th-seeded Bulldogs (31-4) to their first regional final appearance. Gonzaga, the lowest women’s seed to advance to the Round of 8, will face top-seeded Stanford, a perennial West Coast powerhouse, on Monday at Spokane Arena, with the winner advancing to the Final Four next week in Indianapolis.“If you’ve never seen Courtney play, she’s mesmerizing,” Graves said. “It’s hard to take your eyes off her.”He added: “Her vision on the basketball court is amazing. She is a step ahead of everybody.”With seven assists in Gonzaga’s 76-69 victory Saturday night against Louisville in the Round of 16, Vandersloot surpassed the 24-year-old single-season N.C.A.A. record of 355 held by Penn State’s Suzie McConnell.In the Bulldogs’ second-round upset of U.C.L.A., Vandersloot became the first N.C.A.A. Division I player, male or female, to amass career totals of 2,000 points and 1,000 assists. She is averaging 19.6 points and 10.2 assists a game.By comparison, Bobby Hurley finished his Duke career with 1,731 points and 1,076 assists. Vandersloot’s childhood idol, Sue Bird, who plays for the Seattle Storm, had 1,378 points and 585 assists at Connecticut.“Quite frankly, I’ve run out of adjectives to describe what she does,” Graves said.To play alongside Vandersloot, who is averaging 30.7 points and 10.3 assists in the tournament, is to learn very quickly to keep one’s hands up in the air on offense. “You may not think you’re open,” Katelan Redmon, a junior swingman, said, “and the next thing you know, the ball’s flying at you.”Kayla Standish, a 6-3 junior forward, learned the hard way to always be prepared for Vandersloot’s passes. At her first day of practice as a freshman, she said, she was struck in the face by a ball zinged to her by Vandersloot during a five-on-five drill.“I remember her saying: ‘What are you doing? Why didn’t you catch that ball?’ and thinking: ‘Holy cow. I don’t know how I’m going to be able to do this,’ ” Standish said.This teeth-baring portrait of Vandersloot is at odds with her shy, off-court persona, an incongruity she ascribes to her competitiveness.“On the floor, I don’t consider myself shy at all,” she said. “I just want to win.”It is a huge responsibility to shepherd the career of a once-in-a-lifetime talent, which is how Graves describes Vandersloot. During her sophomore season, Graves asked Stockton, who returned to his hometown after his 2003 retirement, if he would be willing to work with Vandersloot.“I kind of ran it by John,” Graves said, “then gave Courtney his number and said, ‘I can be a great coach to you, but he can help you with things I can’t see.’ ”Stockton was amenable, but N.C.A.A. rules prohibited him from contacting Vandersloot. It took her several days, she said, to overcome her shyness and make the initial call.“But he made me feel so welcome,” Vandersloot said. “He just wanted to help, and that’s the best thing about him is that he wants to share his knowledge.”Vandersloot eventually joined Stockton’s son, David, a redshirt freshman guard at Gonzaga, at the gym to work with Stockton, who has instilled in her the belief that if you have enough confidence in your skills, there is no such thing as a low-percentage play.Asked when she realized her court vision separated her from her peers, Vandersloot said: “I don’t think it was very long ago. I really just assumed I was getting all of the assists because of the people I was surrounded by.”Her teammates know better. “She’s the best player I’ve ever been around,” Bowen said.'"
"'11-03-28,'0','Many older artists, however, whose contracts predate digital music and have not been renegotiated, stand to profit significantly from the decision.“This is life-changing,” said Joyce Moore, the wife of Sam Moore of Sam & Dave, the duo that had hits in the 1960s like “Soul Man.” “If we were being paid a nickel a download, as opposed to 35 cents — that’s a huge amount of money for a guy that is on a fixed income or has to run up and down the road at 75 years old.”The lawsuit argued that record companies’ arrangements with digital retailers resembled a license more than it did a sale of a CD or record because, among other reasons, the labels furnished the seller with a single master recording that it then duplicated for customers.“Unlike physical sales, where the record company manufactures each disc and has incremental costs, when they license to iTunes, all they do is turn over one master,” said Richard S. Busch, a lawyer for F.B.T. and Mr. Martin’s company, Em2M. “It’s only fair that the artist should receive 50 percent of the receipts.”A federal jury ruled in favor of Universal in 2009, but that decision was overturned on appeal last year. The label petitioned to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case.Universal said the implications of the decision were limited.“The case has always been about one agreement with very unique language,” the company said in a statement. “As it has been made clear during this case, the ruling has no bearing on any other recording agreement and does not create any legal precedent.”Although current hits get more attention, older music still represents a huge portion of overall music sales, and over time durable hits can rack up significant sales. Last year there were 648.5 million downloads of “catalog” singles in the United States, meaning songs more than 18 months old, compared with 523 million for current tracks, according to Nielsen SoundScan.Fred Wilhelms, a lawyer in Nashville who specializes in collecting royalties for musicians, said that sales of older music had provided the labels with steady income at low cost.“The labels make tens of millions of dollars a year from the deep catalog without paying a penny in promotion costs,” said Mr. Wilhelms, who estimates that the Eminem ruling might apply to tens of thousands of artists. “Anybody who ended their recording career before 1978, and probably before 1992, is in the decision,” he added.Royalty rates vary, but today most acts get 10 to 15 percent of their music’s net sales, minus packaging and other deductions, lawyers say. In the 1970s and before, the rates were often even lower. But for decades, licenses of music — to movies, television or other third parties — gave artists a 50 percent share, without the same deductions, on the principle that a third party was bearing the relevant costs.Jason M. Schultz, an assistant professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, who helped write a friend of the court brief on behalf of the Motown Alumni Association — a group that represents Motown acts but is not associated with the label — said that recording contracts made in the early days of digital music reflected the labels’ failure to recognize that technology’s potential.“The record companies would strike these deals with artists in a way that favored them,” Mr. Schultz said. “But when the digital revolution came around, those contracts ended up favoring artists. The record companies guessed wrong.”Although sales of digital music around the world now represent 29 percent of record companies’ revenue, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the Eminem case, and several others like it, stem from the mid-2000s, when the potential value of digital music was first becoming clear. According to court papers, the Eminem case had its origins in an audit of accounting records that F.B.T. and the rapper conducted in 2005, two years after Apple opened the iTunes store.In separate cases, the Allman Brothers have sued Universal and Sony BMG Music Entertainment over similar contractual issues. The Sony case, filed in 2006, was expanded to a class-action suit, and earlier this month the parties informed the judge in the case that they had “reached an agreement in principle.” (The Allman Brothers and Cheap Trick, which joined the case, both settled their claims.) The Allmans’ suit against Universal, filed in 2008, is still pending.For million-selling acts like Eminem and the Allman Brothers, the stakes are high. But plenty of other artists stand to gain from the decision as well.“For people who had a single hit, who couldn’t afford to chase $100 in owed royalties,” Mr. Wilhelms said, “they are now looking at a couple thousand. It’s worth a couple phone calls and an angry letter or two.”'"
"'11-03-28,'0','There was encouraging evidence on Friday night that the struggling New York City Opera is making smart moves and continuing to rebound. It was the premiere of “Monodramas,” a triple bill of one-act works that are not operas in any traditional sense. Before the performance so many ticket buyers, including noticeable numbers of young people, were lined up in the lobby of the David H. Koch Theater waiting to get inside that the curtain had to be delayed more than 20 minutes to accommodate them.As presented here, in a surreal and visually beautiful production by Michael Counts, these strange and strikingly diverse monodramas, each a monologue for soprano and orchestra, made for an engrossing evening of musical drama. Under its general manager and artistic director, George Steel, City Opera has done a good job of building interest in this adventurous presentation.In approaching “Monodramas” it is best to switch off the part of your brain that needs to know what an opera is about. The program begins with John Zorn’s volatile 10-minute “Machine de l’Être” (“Machine of Being,” 2000), textless as well as plotless. The longest work, at nearly 60 minutes, comes last: Morton Feldman’s gurgling, murky and haunting “Neither” (1976-77), his musical rendering of an elusive 87-word text by Beckett.Compared with those two works, Schoenberg’s 30-minute “Erwartung” (“Waiting,” 1909), with a text by Marie Pappenheim, may at first seem a cogent story. A woman prowls a forest on a warm evening searching for her lover and finds him dead. But with its nightmarish music and harrowing text, is “Erwartung” a dream? Has anything the woman describes actually happened?Mr. Zorn has long been a hero of the downtown contemporary-music scene, a rebel who willfully combines, tweaks and otherwise appropriates into his brash, audacious pieces whatever kind of music suits him. In a recent interview with The New York Times he expressed surprise at finding himself, at 57, courted by an uptown company at Lincoln Center. But “La Machine de l’Être” comes across here as an uptown score, pulsing with fits of astringent atonality, fidgety contrapuntal writing and boisterous percussion, over which the soprano must sing all manner of “ah” sounds, flitting from melodic fragments to orgasmic outbursts. The excellent Finnish soprano Anu Komsi threw herself into the music. The conductor George Manahan led a colorful and bruising performance.But what is going on? Mr. Counts, a visual artist as well as a stage director, provides some guidance in the surreal production he has created with the choreographer Ken Roht and the costume designer Jessica Jahn — like Mr. Counts, making their City Opera debuts — and the lighting designer Robert Wierzel.'"
"'11-03-28,'0','Mr. Gates said the strikes so far have taken place without significant civilian causalities — in fact, he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that he had trouble getting any confirmed reports of civilians that had been killed as a result of the United States intervention.Instead, he said, Defense Department authorities were told that Colonel Qaddafi’s supporters placed dead bodies at some of the sites targeted in an effort to create a false impression.The joint appearance by two of Mr. Obama’s top cabinet secretaries — each of whom had clear talking points that they emphasized repeatedly – illustrated a sensitivity in Washington over the fact that the president, long a critic of United States military intervention in the Middle East, was sending American military into a new conflict.The mixed messages, that the military mission was to stop attacks on rebels but that the Obama administration separately was calling for the ouster of Colonel Qaddafi, also has evoked questions about whether the mission in Libya is sufficiently clear.Mr. Gates said the military has no ambiguity about what its role is and insisted that it is not about regime change, but simply imposing a no-flight zone to stop attacks on rebels and civilians.“That is it,” Mr. Gates said on “Face the Nation.” “You don’t want ever to set a set of goals or a military mission where you can’t be confident of accomplishing your objectives. And as we’ve seen in the past, regime change is a very complicated business.”Mrs. Clinton said the situation reflects a recognition by the Obama administration, in collaboration with other nations, that it could not allow a repeat of the mass slaughter of civilians like in Rwanda in 1994 or Kosovo in the late 1990s.“We learned a lot in the 1990s,” Mrs. Clinton said, speaking about a time when her husband was president. “We saw what happened in Rwanda. It took a long time in the Balkans, in Kosovo, to deal with a tyrant.”Senators John McCain and Joseph I. Lieberman both spoke Sunday in support of the allied campaign in Libya and the imposition of a no-flight zone, arguing that the effort has prevented a mass slaughter of Libyans by the forces loyal to Colonel Qaddafi.“He said himself he would go house to house and kill and murder people,” Mr. McCain, the Arizona senator and Republican presidential candidate in 2008, said on “Fox News Sunday. “Thank God, at the 11th hour, with the no-fly zone, we prevented that from happening.“If you had allowed Qaddafi to do that, that would be a signal to the other leaders in the Middle East, dictators and not, that it’s O.K. to massacre your own people to stay in power,” he added. “And, finally, well, this is a moment of historic proportions. And this will give us a golden opportunity to help with democracy and freedom throughout the Arab world.”Mr. Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who appeared on the same show, agreed, saying that “in going to Libya, we are saying we are with the ‘Arab spring’ ” and “taking a side of the freedom fighters in Libya against one of the most totalitarian regimes that has ever existed.“The only acceptable way for this to end in Libya is for Qaddafi to go,” he said.Pressed to explain why the United States is involved in a military strike in Libya, but not in Yemen or in Syria, where civilians and protesters have also been killed, Mrs. Clinton said in Libya, the government is using its military forces in an organized strike against its own people.“That crossed a line that people in the world had decided they could not tolerate,” she said on ABC.As to how long the military campaign with the involvement of the United States would continue in Libya, Mr. Gates and Mrs. Clinton were reluctant to predict.“We have prevented the large-scale slaughter that was beginning to take place and was taking place,” Mr. Gates said on ABC. But would the intervention by the United States and others be over by the end of the year?“I don’t think anybody knows the answer to that,” Mr. Gates said.But Colonel Qaddafi should not expect to remain in power indefinitely, Mr. Gates said, even though he said removing him that was not the military’s mission.“I wouldn’t be hanging any new pictures if I were him,” Mr. Gates said on CBS.'"

"'11-03-29,'1','“It damages the image she has spend years building,” said Woody Cozad, a former chairman of the Missouri Republican Party. “She has positioned herself as tough on law and order as a former prosecutor and tough on how public money was used and cared for as a former auditor. That took her out of the mold of a Nancy Pelosi Democrat and made her more of a Missouri moderate Democrat.”The revelations, which were widely covered in the news media, were seized upon by Republicans and have stirred renewed interest in her 2012 re-election race.Though Ms. McCaskill still has plenty of time to dress her wounds — and has proven adept at surviving controversy in the past — political strategists in both parties were mystified at how she could have allowed such a significant oversight, particularly given that Republicans have been focusing attention on the plane for years.“This was a big mistake, and it certainly is going to create a big challenge for her,” said Richard Martin, who managed her winning Senate campaign in 2006 and was executive director of the state Democratic Party. “But it was always going to be a challenging race.”Over the past few weeks, Ms. McCaskill has paid back the costs of the flights, which were first reported by Politico, and the back personal property taxes, which she disclosed as interest in the plane grew, while offering a string of apologies.She has maintained that the tax delinquency, as well as the flight to a political event, were oversights, noting that she was continuing to pay sales taxes on the plane and could have kept it in Illinois rather than move it to St. Louis if she wanted to avoid the property taxes.In an interview on Monday she called the matter “a big, serious, sloppy mistake,” but said that she deserved credit for her response and that she hoped voters would put the incident in context with her whole career.“I found the problem, I owned the problem and I got the problem fixed very quickly,” she said. “There are a lot of people I could blame for this, but I know better.”She is also using her own controversy as evidence of the need for the open government policies she has championed, including her effort to require senators to publicly disclose more information about their overseas travel.“This is a good lesson that transparency works,” she said. “And it makes me want to recommit my efforts.”Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a national group that lobbies for tighter government ethics rules, said he was disappointed by Ms. McCaskill’s actions but pleased that she had admitted her mistakes.“She may be even more of an advocate of good government now that she has had her fingers caught in the cookie jar,” he said.The senator’s troubles have raised the confidence of Republicans about their chances in a state that has continued to shift to the right.In 2006, a good year for Democrats, Ms. McCaskill narrowly ousted the incumbent Republican senator, Jim Talent.Republicans had already been planning to use her votes for legislation like bailouts, stimulus, and health care reform to tie her to President Obama. She vigorously supported Mr. Obama in the presidential election but he narrowly lost the state. (She has recently been more critical of his policies, saying the health care legislation went too far).Now, armed with the catchy nickname for Ms. McCaskill — “Air Claire” — Republicans are likely to make personal hypocrisy a central theme, said Lloyd Smith, executive director of the state Republican Party, which has filed two ethics complaints in the Senate against her.Republicans have also worked for years to focus attention on the business interests of her husband, Joseph Shepard, a millionaire developer with numerous businesses, including some in fields that are regulated and subsidized by the government, like affordable housing.Ed Martin, one of two Republicans to have officially declared he is running for Ms. McCaskill’s seat, said he still expected her to be a formidable opponent. “This is not a candidate who is unaccustomed to adversity,” he said. “She has won hard races and lost hard races.”Indeed Ms. McCaskill has earned a reputation for finding herself in tricky situations and then getting herself out of them, sometimes from her habit of straying off script, and other times because of personal associations.When she was county prosecutor, her husband was arrested for marijuana possession (after they divorced, he was shot to death, a case that remains unsolved). Several years ago it became public that her brother had not paid property taxes on a condominium belonging to her in which he lived. (The brother was arrested last year on drug charges.)There have been steady attacks on her current husband over his business dealings.“She’s a character and very animated,” said Steve Glorioso, a Democratic consultant who has been a longtime adviser to Ms. McCaskill. “And it seems that she almost always has a problem, almost always personal, that comes up in almost every election. And she always overcomes it.”'"

"'11-03-29,'1','ATLANTA — Pink azaleas? Check. Caddies in white jumpsuits? Of course. Green jackets? Well, it wouldn’t be Augusta National Golf Club without them.On Tuesday, Augusta National, the exclusive, all-male club that hosts the Masters tournament, will take an unexpected step toward modernity and release a video game. Developers have spent years replicating the course in exact detail. Every tree has the correct number of branches, and weather is determined by real conditions, so if it rains in Augusta, Ga., it rains on your screen.But that has not stopped golf purists from questioning the wisdom of selling a video game version at all — even one that is so stunningly accurate. The Masters is almost sacred among golfers, and the club is normally so wary of commercialism that it allows only a few minutes of televised advertising during each hour of the lucrative tournament.“Certainly a video game doesn’t square with Augusta’s long-standing image of stuffiness and propriety,” said Alan Shipnuck, a Sports Illustrated writer and author of “The Battle for Augusta National.”But the club is slowly changing, at least technologically. Although it does not admit women and only began allowing blacks in 1990, it has reached out aggressively to younger, tech-savvy golf fans. It created a free iPhone app for the Masters. And last year, spectators in the news media tent could watch the tournament in 3-D.'"
"'11-03-29,'1','LONDON (Reuters) — The drug company AstraZeneca said on Monday that it had reached an agreement with tax regulators in the United States and Britain to pay $1.1 billion to resolve outstanding issues.The company said that under the settlement, which dates back more than a decade, it will pay a net amount in 2011 to resolve all transfer pricing issues in the United States — significantly less than it had set aside in provisions.AstraZeneca said that as a result of the settlement, its effective tax rate this year will be some six percentage points lower than thought at about 21 percent, and AstraZeneca now expects 2011 core earnings to be $6.90 to $7.20 a share, up from the $6.45 to $6.75 indicated previously.The news is a boon to the company’s profit line as it faces increasing challenges to some of its top-selling drugs from generic competition.The settlement follows an agreement with the British tax authorities on transfer pricing in February 2010, which also resulted in payments that were less than had been provided for, increasing 2010 earnings.Transfer pricing concerns the price at which one unit of a group sells goods or services to another unit of the same group. Such practices are receiving increased attention as tax authorities around the world seek to limit any abuse of intracompany transfers of expenses or profits.'"
"'11-03-29,'1','The earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan have inspired benefit concerts across New York City. One of the first to be announced was held on Sunday night at Miller Theater at Columbia University.It was organized by the saxophonist and composer John Zorn, who has lived and performed in Japan and for decades has collaborated with, promoted and released albums by Japanese musicians. The program, headlined by Yoko Ono and Sonic Youth, reaffirmed longstanding ties between what were (in the 1970s and ’80s) known as New York’s downtown improvisers and their Japanese counterparts and co-conspirators. Sold out in two hours, the concert was also broadcast on Japanese television and to Columbia students. It raised $34,000 for Japan Society’s Earthquake Relief Fund.The musicians have stationed themselves where genres blur: noise, jazz, rock, funk, electronics. The program juxtaposed straightforward songs with open-ended improvisations. And, from Sonic Youth, an amalgam of both, as terse, punky verses dissolved into scrabbling, squalling, ringing guitar passages, cataclysmic and monumental.The bands overlapped: Ms. Ono’s Plastic Ono Band shared its musicians, including Sean Lennon on guitar, with Cibo Matto, the noisy, lighthearted New York band that sings most often about food.Ms. Ono, who flashed peace signs as she entered and exited, channeled loss and trauma into primal vocal sounds: shrieks, sobs, cackles and ululations over her band’s enveloping stomps and drones. Seemingly fragile at first, she was anything but as she strutted across the stage and turned into an electronically looped banshee. On this occasion she was commemorating not personal sorrows but public ones.'"
"'11-03-29,'1','LONDON (Reuters) — China is believed to have put to death thousands of people in 2010, the human rights group Amnesty International said Monday. The estimate dwarfs the number of recorded executions in other countries, which the group says dropped from 714 in 2009 to at least 527 last year.The group said, as it has in past years, that China, which classifies executions as state secrets, was thought to have executed far more people than the rest of the world combined. At least 23 countries carried out judicial executions in 2010, four more than the previous year, Amnesty said in its annual report on the death penalty, which it wants abolished.China has scrapped the death penalty for 13 nonviolent crimes including smuggling historic relics and tax fraud-related offenses, but capital punishment will still apply to 55 offenses, Chinese news reports said last month.”A number of countries continue to pass death sentences for drug-related offences, economic crimes, sexual relations between consenting adults and blasphemy, violating international human rights law forbidding the use of the death penalty except for the most serious crimes,” Amnesty’s secretary general, Salil Shetty, said in a statement.Of the 527 executions recorded in 2010, at least 252 were carried out in Iran, at least 60 in North Korea, at least 53 in Yemen, 46 in the United States, at least 27 in Saudi Arabia, at least 18 in Libya and at least 17 in Syria, Amnesty said, noting that only a few countries published official figures.'"
"'11-03-29,'1','Other cable television operators say they are coming out with their own streaming apps soon. Cablevision’s app could come out this week.But some channel owners say that companies like Time Warner Cable should be consulting with them more closely before introducing new products. “Portability is a different business proposition,” said an executive at one of the major channel owners, suggesting that there should be a premium paid for the ability to take a TV show into bed or into the bathtub. One commercial for Time Warner Cable’s app actually shows a person watching TV on a tablet while taking a bath.The executive said Time Warner Cable should have “worked out the business issues” with channel owners before coming out with the app. The chief issue is counting the audience: another executive said there had been a “stampede” of channel owners asking the Nielsen Company to include iPad streaming in its ratings of programs.The channel executives spoke only on condition of anonymity because their parent companies had refused to comment on the dispute.But Scripps, the owner of HGTV and the Food Network, said earlier this month that it “has not granted iPad video streaming rights to any distributor and is actively addressing any misunderstandings on this issue.”Melinda Witmer, an executive vice president at Time Warner Cable, said in an interview last week that she thought the current dispute was “fundamentally about money and leverage,” not about the language of contracts. “I already bought these rights,” she said.Ms. Witmer compared the complaints of channel owners to a person who waves a gun around and winds up shooting themselves in the foot. For distributors that depend on monthly subscription checks from customers, new products like iPad apps are ways to keep the payments coming — and that revenue, of course, is ultimately shared with the channel owners.Some channel executives said Viacom, the owner of MTV, VH1 and other channels, is taking the most aggressive stance against the streaming app. One of the complaints is that the app now includes only a portion of all the channels that are available through the traditional set-top box. Time Warner Cable is offering 32 channels for the iPad.Cablevision is expected to change that. Its app will transplant every existing channel and video-on-demand option to the iPad, literally making it into a TV set. The company declined to comment Monday.Verizon and Comcast have said that they were also working on streaming apps for iPads. But for now, the Time Warner Cable skirmish may make other cable companies or distributors think twice about replicating TV on tablets. Comcast, for instance, has not added live streaming to its iPad app yet; instead, it has focused on adding on-demand programming.Comcast is the nation’s largest cable company; Time Warner Cable is No. 2.The cable distributors have trod lightly into an area that will most likely prompt more fighting with channel owners: out-of-home viewing by customers.Not every channel owner is arguing against the streaming notion, however. Time Warner, which was separated from Time Warner Cable two years ago, is comfortable with the current app, and its recent contract renegotiation with Comcast specifically included tablet streaming rights.Ms. Witmer of Time Warner Cable said she thought some of the resistance by channel owners stemmed from a lack of understanding of the technology. “In fairness, truthfully, to all the executives in this industry that are trying to run businesses that are part of this ecosystem, it is exhausting — exhausting — keeping up with everything that is changing rapidly,” she said.'"
"'11-03-29,'1','Stocks fell on Monday as the corporate outlook was clouded ahead of earnings and uncertainty from abroad remained a concern, while volume hit its lowest level of the year.A warning from the hotel operator Marriott International hurt hotel and other consumer shares amid expectations of other negative corporate earnings preannouncements.“Corporations now have several excuses that seem to resonate on Wall Street, from bad weather in January to the Middle East to the Japanese earthquake impacting the supply chain or sentiment,” said Adam Parker, chief United States equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, in a client note.Stocks spent most of the day in positive territory, with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index hitting a session high near 1,320 for a second consecutive session, driven by strength in the telecommunications sector and consumer spending data.Japan’s natural disasters and nuclear crisis along with civil unrest in the Middle East and Libya have increased market volatility in recent weeks.'"
"'11-03-29,'1','BEIJING — A United Nations human rights agency has demanded that the Chinese government immediately release a prominent Chinese human rights lawyer who has been detained for nearly a year, according to a statement released on Monday by an advocacy group. The lawyer, Gao Zhisheng, had said he was tortured during previous rounds of detention.The agency, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, also said in a written statement that the Chinese government should “provide for reparation of the harm caused” to Mr. Gao. A feisty Christian who has been repeatedly detained, Mr. Gao has defended practitioners of Falun Gong, the banned spiritual group that came under a brutal crackdown by Chinese security forces.“The U.N. Working Group held that the detention violated international law because Gao’s disappearance was punishment for exercising his fundamental human rights and because the government failed to meet even the minimum international standards for due process,” the group said in its statement. That statement was first sent to the Chinese government in July, and was made public on Monday by Freedom Now, an advocacy group that has worked on Mr. Gao’s case.In making its statement, the working group was chastising one of the countries with the most influence at the United Nations — with one of the five permanent seats, China wields a veto in the Security Council. The Web site of the working group studying detention lists five members, from Senegal, Pakistan, Chile, Norway and Ukraine. The group files reports to the United Nations Human Rights Council.The Chinese Foreign Ministry had no immediate response.Mr. Gao’s case has drawn intense scrutiny from human rights advocates because he said he was tortured when he was detained in 2007, and again for 14 months that ended in March 2010.During the earlier confinement, he was beaten with electric batons, and burning cigarettes were placed near his eyes, he told people after being released. The second time he was detained, security officers beat him with holstered handguns during one particularly horrific two-day spell, he told The Associated Press last April. Two weeks later, he disappeared again, and he has not been heard from since.In the interview with a video producer and reporter from The A.P., which was conducted in a Beijing teahouse, Mr. Gao described being moved from one site to another in Beijing, Shaanxi Province and the far western region of Xinjiang. He said he was hooded at various times, tied up with belts, made to sit motionless for up to 16 hours and threatened with death. He said one captor told him in September 2009: “You must forget you’re human. You’re a beast.”'"
"'11-03-29,'1','Rates of melanoma among young white women have more than doubled in the past three decades, and wealthier, more educated women appear to be at greatest risk. Experts aren’t sure why, but a new study suggests that these women may be at increased risk because they are spending more leisure time outdoors.Researchers at the Cancer Prevention Institute of California studied 3,842 cases of melanoma in 3,800 white women younger than 40 who received the diagnosis between 1988 and 1992 and between 1998 and 2002, incorporating census data and ultraviolet radiation exposure measures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The analysis, published in Archives of Dermatology, was limited to invasive cancers. Melanoma rates increased significantly during the study periods only among higher-income women, the researchers found. Women from the highest-income areas were nearly six times as likely to have malignant melanoma as those in the poorest areas.“We think this has to do with cultural preferences in higher-income groups for tanning, having the time to tan and the means to pay for tanning beds, and sun exposure on vacations in the middle of winter,” said Christina A. Clarke, senior author of the paper.'"

"'11-03-30,'1','House Republicans have already won so much in this year’s standoff that they could easily declare victory and put an end to the maddening and dysfunctional cycle. Previous Congresses would have noticed that millions of people are still struggling in an economic downturn and tried to help, but Republicans have succeeded in shutting off that conversation.They have won the philosophical war, compelling Democrats to agree to tens of billions in spending cuts. Yet that does not seem to be enough for the Republicans who now control the federal steering wheel.With a hard deadline looming, talks to prevent a government shutdown have been stymied for a week because members of the House have demanded everything: not just some of their cuts but almost all of them, and not just a reduction in spending but a reduction only in the programs they don’t like. Many are insisting Democrats also agree to nonbudgetary riders, like ending the financing of or .They simply will not accede to anything that looks like a compromise with . Caught in this position, Speaker knows the public is likely to blame Republicans for the pain of a shutdown, once it sees that the Democrats offered difficult compromises that his caucus rejected. That is the price he pays for riding to power on the backs of people who don’t understand that government cannot be built out of ideological rigidity.If Mr. Boehner cannot persuade his members that the public does not want a government shutdown and will blame them, then much of the government will close its doors on April 8, when the current stopgap funding measure runs out. So far, the Republicans have wrung $10 billion in cuts from earlier deadlines, but their bill to butcher the current year’s budget with $61 billion in radical cuts was voted down in the Senate.Democrats have put together a package of $20 billion in cuts, on top of the $10 billion already agreed to. They have not released the details, but officials say they could include some current spending and some mandatory programs, like agriculture subsidies. This package is likely to be far more painful than the last one and will almost certainly pull back the reins much further than is prudent when the economic recovery is still sputtering. But in the split-the-difference culture of Washington, it will get them halfway toward the Republican goal line, further than imaginable just a few weeks ago.'"
"'11-03-30,'1','Mrs. McCormack won 238,000 votes in 18 Democratic primaries, and 22 delegate votes at the Democratic National Convention.Her success prompted criticism that she had misused amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 that mandated matching money for presidential candidates. Critics said the amendments, adopted in 1974, were never meant to finance single-issue campaigns.Congress responded in March 1976 by requiring a candidate for a presidential nomination to receive more than 10 percent of the vote in two consecutive primaries to qualify for matching money.Mrs. McCormack responded in 1980 by running as the presidential candidate of the Right to Life Party, qualifying for the ballot in Kentucky, New Jersey and New York and winning more than 32,000 votes. This time, she did not apply, nor was she eligible, for matching money.Eleanor Rose Cullen (she preferred to be called Ellen) was born in Manhattan on Sept. 15, 1926. In her early 20s she married Francis McCormack, who became a deputy inspector in the New York Police Department. He died in 1993.The couple lived in Merrick, on Long Island, where Mrs. McCormack, a Roman Catholic, focused on the abortion issue when the procedure was legalized in New York State in 1970. In an interview with The New York Times in 1976, she said she saw slides of fetuses at the time and “was convinced it was a human life being taken.” Her political involvement started with her book discussion group and progressed to membership in the Pro-Life Action Committee.She never became a household name. Newsweek reported that not even her next-door neighbor knew she was running for president. She had never held office in a local P.T.A.“We thought our legislators would take care of it,” she said of the abortion issue in an interview with The Times in 1978. “But they didn’t. We found very early that it’s in politics that the big decisions are made. So we decided to run our own candidates.”As Mrs. McCormack traveled the nation, she did take positions on issues other than abortion. She favored Soviet-American détente, opposed busing to integrate schools and said neither Israel nor Egypt should be sold American arms.She also made a strong pitch for her view of traditional values. “The feminists have convinced politicians they represent all women,” she told The Times in 1976. “But I am a woman, too. I differ with some of their beliefs. I believe in child care for the poor, but I don’t favor child care for the middle class. I think we are teaching working mothers it is more prestigious to work than be home with their children.”In addition to her daughter Kathleen, Mrs. McCormack is survived by two other daughters, Anne McCormack and Ellen Stapleton; a son, John; 11 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.In 1976, Mrs. McCormack emphasized that she was fighting for bus drivers and janitors and continued to run her household despite her hectic campaign schedule. Her husband underscored the point in an interview with Newsweek, saying, “We need more ordinary people like my wife running for president.”'"
"'11-03-30,'1','But it has done little to abide by this legislative bargain. Almost immediately, as permitted by the broad language of the act, Treasury’s plan for TARP shifted from the purchase of mortgages to the infusion of hundreds of billions of dollars into the nation’s largest financial institutions, a shift that came with the express promise that it would restore lending.Treasury, however, provided the money to banks with no effective policy or effort to compel the extension of . There were no strings attached: no requirement or even incentive to increase lending to home buyers, and against our strong recommendation, not even a request that banks report how they used TARP funds. It was only in April of last year, in response to recommendations from our office, that Treasury asked banks to provide that information, well after the largest banks had already repaid their . It was therefore no surprise that lending did not increase but rather continued to decline well into the recovery. (In my job as special inspector general I could not bring about the changes I thought were needed — I could only make recommendations to the Treasury Department.)Meanwhile, the act’s goal of helping struggling homeowners was shelved until February 2009, when the Home Affordable Modification Program was announced with the promise to help up to four million families with mortgage modifications.That program has been a colossal failure, with far fewer permanent modifications (540,000) than modifications that have failed and been canceled (over 800,000). This is the well-chronicled result of the rush to get the program started, major program design flaws like the failure to remedy mortgage servicers’ favoring of foreclosure over permanent modifications, and a refusal to hold those abysmally performing mortgage servicers accountable for their disregard of program guidelines. As the program flounders, foreclosures continue to mount, with 8 million to 13 million filings forecast over the program’s lifetime.Treasury Secretary has acknowledged that the program “won’t come close” to fulfilling its original expectations, that its incentives are not “powerful enough” and that the mortgage servicers are “still doing a terribly inadequate job.” But Treasury officials refuse to address these shortfalls. Instead they continue to stubbornly maintain that the program is a success and needs no material change, effectively assuring that Treasury’s most specific Main Street promise will not be honored.Finally, the country was assured that would address the threat to our financial system posed by large banks that have become effectively guaranteed by the government no matter how reckless their behavior. This promise also appears likely to go unfulfilled. The biggest banks are 20 percent larger than they were before the crisis and control a larger part of our economy than ever. They reasonably assume that the government will rescue them again, if necessary. Indeed, incorporate future government bailouts into their assessments of the largest banks, exaggerating market distortions that provide them with an unfair advantage over smaller institutions, which continue to struggle.Worse, Treasury apparently has chosen to ignore rather than support real efforts at reform, such as those advocated by , the chairwoman of the , to simplify or shrink the most complex financial institutions.In the final analysis, it has been Treasury’s broken promises that have turned TARP — which was instrumental in saving the financial system at a relatively modest cost to taxpayers — into a program commonly viewed as little more than a giveaway to Wall Street executives.It wasn’t meant to be that. Indeed, Treasury’s mismanagement of TARP and its disregard for TARP’s Main Street goals — whether born of incompetence, timidity in the face of a crisis or a mindset too closely aligned with the banks it was supposed to rein in — may have so damaged the credibility of the government as a whole that future policy makers may be politically unable to take the necessary steps to save the system the next time a crisis arises. This avoidable political reality might just be TARP’s most lasting, and unfortunate, legacy.'"

"'11-03-30,'1','Despite improvements, more than half of the Pentagon’s big weapons systems still cost more than they should, with management failures adding at least $70 billion to the projected costs over the last two years, government auditors said Tuesday.The Government Accountability Office, a Congressional watchdog, said the biggest program, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, accounted for $28 billion of that increase. Other systems also had significant cost overruns, the agency said, adding that the increases could force the Pentagon to cut the number of ships and planes it buys.The auditors said many of the problems occurred because the Pentagon began building the systems before the designs were fully tested.The findings were significant because Congress and the Obama administration have promised to change many of the practices that have long allowed weapons costs to spiral out of control.President Obama signed a law in 2009 to improve contracting. The accountability office said that Pentagon officials had done a better job in starting new programs. But the agency also found that most of the new programs were not “fully adhering” to the best procedures, leaving them “at a higher risk for cost growth and schedule delays.”'"
"'11-03-30,'1','As they consider the deal, regulators may look abroad to see how competition affects wireless markets. With only three major network operators, the market in the United States would function similarly to some European markets, like France, which also has three operators, said J. Scott Marcus, the former chief technology officer at the telecommunications company GTE and former Internet policy adviser at the Federal Communications Commission.“It will definitely become an oligopoly market,” Mr. Marcus said. “That will be less good than what one had before, but not awful.”Of course, using other countries as a guide to how consolidation may play out is tricky, because every market is shaped by local cultural and business factors.In Japan, for example, the average amount that consumers spend on data is the highest in the developed world — but not because of a lack of competition in the mobile industry. Japanese cellphone owners like to do a lot of browsing on their cellphones, and they are prepared to pay for that, said Steven Hartley, an analyst at Ovum, a research firm in London. Mr. Hartley said over 40 percent of mobile operators’ revenue in Japan comes from data services, compared with 25 percent in the United States.Americans tend to talk nearly twice as much as people in most other developed countries, which led to the popularity of bigger buckets of voice minutes. And plans that offer nationwide calling with no roaming fees have also kept prices low. In Europe, which in theory is one market but is actually divided into many smaller national markets, roaming charges are a frequent and bothersome reality.Europeans and Asians were quicker than Americans to embrace so-called prepaid phone service, in which customers do not have a contract and pay for chunks of voice minutes and data capacity as they go. This means phone owners are generally not tied to a single wireless company and have more flexibility to switch among services. Some even carry around multiple SIM cards, the fingernail-size chips that activate a cellphone for use, and decide which one to install based on which offers the cheapest rate for the country they are calling or visiting. For example, someone living in Spain who often visits family in France might purchase SIM cards for wireless services in both countries.And phone customers outside the United States tend to have more handset choices, since cellphones are less likely to be “locked” for use with one particular carrier. But they have fewer opportunities to upgrade cheaply, because carriers are less likely to offer a free or discounted phone to those who commit to a one- or two-year contract.Some of that is beginning to change, said Chris Jones, an analyst at Canalys. “Smartphones are beginning to get more popular in the U.K., so more people are buying smartphones and the contracts that come with them,” he said. Even so, those contracts can cost around £30 or £35 a month, or $48 to $56, and they do not include data, he said.In general, the breadth of options in Europe has not yet led to significantly cheaper service, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics in Dedham, Mass. “It only drives down prices if competitors are willing to compete on price,” he said. “The market is more or less equally divided up, so there isn’t the same hypercompetitiveness that we have in the U.S.”Heike Troue, the director of a public policy institute in Berlin, said that she was satisfied with the range of mobile choices available there. An iPhone 4 owner, she pays T-Mobile 90 euros a month, or $127, for her all-inclusive contract, which provides 1,000 calling minutes, three gigabytes of data transfers and 1,500 text messages. Since she signed up for the plan last November, she has never hit those limits. “One can only talk so much,” Ms. Troue said.At times, high costs abroad have prompted lawmakers and regulators to step in. European and British telecom companies are bowing to such pressure by lowering or planning to lower termination fees — the fees that the caller’s carrier must pay to the recipient’s carrier. The goal is to give carriers more flexibility to compete by selling more generous packages with larger chunks of talk time, text allotments and cheaper data services.European regulators have also ordered that limits be placed on roaming charges for calling and texting, and are working on a similar limit on data roaming charges.In South Korea, the government has put pressure on the three major carriers — SK Telecom, KT and LG Telecom — to cut rates on text messages and calls, and it also limits the amount of subsidies the companies can offer on new phones.Regulators in the United States could require AT&T to make some concessions for the T-Mobile deal to be approved, like giving up wireless spectrum in some cities. The review by the Justice Department and the F.C.C. could take several months, and analysts say it could be a year before the full effect of the deal is clear. Some analysts say that the combined company might actually lower prices to better compete with Verizon. But others warn of side effects.Mr. Paltridge of the O.E.C.D said that the overall consequence of combining AT&T and T-Mobile might be broader than most consumers think. For example, it would leave only one American carrier using GSM, the world’s most common cellular standard. That means AT&T could raise rates for Americans using their phones overseas and for foreigners visiting the United States.“If the two merged, there would be an international angle to the competition issue,” he said.'"
"'11-03-30,'1','Yet complex negotiations over just what policy riders will ultimately be reflected in a final spending package are already woven into the protracted budget fight that has seized the Capitol over the last three months and now threatens to lead to a partial shutdown of the federal government at the end of next week.Republicans say they will battle to retain every one of the scores of riders — which range from one that would strike the word “arctic” from a provision of the Clean Air Act to another that would end money to carry out the health care law — that were included in a version of the budget bill the House passed this winter.“The speaker has been clear with the White House and Senate leadership that the House-passed bill, which includes significant policy provisions, is our starting position,” said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner.Democrats are sending more mixed signals about their willingness to negotiate. While the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said Tuesday that “this is a funding bill and a budget bill and it’s not the place for extraneous ideological or political policy to be addressed,” the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, stepped back from his former hard-line position against riders.“We’re happy to look at the policy riders,” Mr. Reid said Tuesday. “There aren’t many of them that excite me. But we’re willing to look at them. In fact, we’ve already started looking at some of the policy riders.”On Tuesday evening, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the chamber’s No. 3 Democrat, said on MSNBC that the Senate would reject all riders concerning Planned Parenthood and the E.P.A.For many Republicans, particularly freshmen who ran on small-government platforms, choking off financing for the health care overhaul is a top priority. Nine riders on that issue passed in the House Republican spending plan that died in the Senate, in addition to a stand-alone bill to repeal the entire act, which also failed in the Senate.Equally high on the list, however, may be the goal of unraveling the vast array of environmental regulations promulgated by the E.P.A. and other government agencies, which Republicans insist overburdens businesses, particularly the ones that take on carbon emissions.The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental activist group, counted 19 amendments that deal with air, water or land regulations. “These riders take aim at a broad range of environmental protections,” said David Goldston, the group’s director of government affairs.It seems increasingly possible that riders that cut back environmental regulations might find greater support than those that attack the health care overhaul because some Democrats on both sides of the Rotunda have expressed an interest in curbing some of those rules.The Senate is expected to vote this week on three proposals — two of which come from Democrats — to curb some regulations. That could serve as a bit of a test of where members stand. There could also be horse trading in any negotiations between the administration and Congressional Democrats and Republicans.“The White House has been clear that their goal is to have a bill without riders,” Mr. Goldston said. “But these are negotiations that are tricky and take place in private. We obviously want to keep the pressure on.”Perhaps most complicated are amendments supported by fewer — but very vocal — House Republicans that would cut off federal money for abortion providers, particularly Planned Parenthood. Of near equal importance to people who focus on abortion is a rider known as the Dornan Amendment, which would ban taxpayer financing of abortion in the District of Columbia.The Dornan Amendment, named after former Representative Robert K. Dornan, Republican of California, was enacted many years ago but was repealed in 2009; under the Republican plan, it would be reinstated.“I think most Americans overwhelmingly say we ought not to be spending taxpayer dollars for abortions,” said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader. “I think that pretty much says where most of Americans are and where most of our members are.”In addition to the policy proposals, Republicans and Democrats sparred Tuesday about the dollar amount of spending cuts that should be included in any final package and how far apart they were on the reductions, even as Democrats said they were willing to move toward the Republican demand for $61 billion in cuts for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.Mr. Reid said Democrats had developed a proposal that amounted to $20 billion in spending reductions from current levels on top of $10 billion already approved by Congress. He said the offer put Democrats within $6 billion of a figure the House leadership had indicated it could accept in earlier budget talks.But Republicans said they had yet to see the details of the Democratic offer and disputed the claim that any agreement on total spending reductions had been struck, particularly in the absence of a resolution of what to do about the multiple policy riders.“There are a lot of numbers that have been discussed and thrown around,” Mr. Boehner said. “The fact is, there is not an agreement on a number. And secondly, nothing’s agreed to until everything’s agreed to. It’s just not cutting spending.”'"
"'11-03-30,'1','Yet setting aside that contradiction, what legal observers say is notable about Governor Parnell’s administration is the degree to which it is following up its words of resistance with legal action — all at once and on many fronts. It is involved in high-profile issues, like protections for polar bears and overturning the health care law, but also in more obscure matters like the fate of wood bison or a small population of caribou on a remote island.“There’s a lot more litigation,” said Mayor Bruce Botehlo of Juneau, a Democrat who served as attorney general under two governors. “It reflects a deep conviction on the part of the Parnell administration that the federal government has overstepped its bounds.”The same week that the Department of Law released its report, Mr. Parnell, addressing a Rotary Club meeting in Fairbanks, Alaska, outlined what his office called his “strategy to fight federal overreach.” In February, speaking at the National Press Club in Washington, he said the federal government was “openly hostile” to oil production in Alaska.“I used to think we in Alaska were the only ones being ill-treated by the federal government,” he said this month in a meeting here with reporters.Underscoring Mr. Parnell’s commitment is that he recently named his former attorney general, Dan Sullivan, who led many fights against the government, as commissioner of the state agency that promotes oil production.But Mr. Parnell, who succeeded Sarah Palin as governor, said his perspective broadened after he spoke with Republican governors from other oil-producing states, including Texas and Oklahoma. “I think you’re seeing a new alliance of states that are crying foul,” he said.That is about as blustery as Mr. Parnell gets. He is not floating threats of secession. (“Don’t get me wrong. We are thankful to be part of this great republic, the United States of America,” he told the crowd in Fairbanks.) Mostly, say people who have been involved in legal issues in Alaska for decades, he is just serious.Resisting Washington is “part of the cultural fiber of Alaska, but it has definitely been taken to a new level by this administration,” said Tom Waldo, a staff lawyer here for the environmental law firm Earthjustice.“You see this particular eagerness to respond even to imagined provocations.”He pointed to a lawsuit that the state filed last year seeking to block a federal moratorium on offshore oil drilling in Alaska that did not actually exist. The state filed the case after the United States secretary of the interior, Ken Salazar, suggested during a news conference that a moratorium would be put in place, but it was never carried out.In dismissing the suit, Judge Ralph R. Beistline of Federal District Court in Alaska, wrote that “the court interprets this claim as a request that the court require Secretary Salazar to formalize a moratorium on oil drilling in Alaska so that the state has something which can be appealed under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). The court lacks the authority to issue such an order.”Alaska is also among the states whose lawsuit against the federal health care law led a judge in Florida to strike down the overhaul. When the judge later clarified that the law should remain in effect pending appeals, Mr. Parnell issued a statement saying that Alaska would decide how to put the law into effect “on a case-by-case basis,” with the goal of using “state resources for state-based health care solutions to increase access and improve affordability, rather than become more entangled.”Entangled with the federal government, that is.Yet nothing seems to generate more legal work here than Alaska’s wildlife. The more federal protections for wildlife there are, the harder it can be for the state to develop natural resources. And while the Parnell administration has attacked the growth of the federal government, it has grown a bit itself in fighting back. It recently created a new position for a lawyer who deals specifically with issues involving the Endangered Species Act.In 2010 alone, the state fought (sometimes against the federal government and sometimes with it) over polar bears, beluga whales, ribbon and other seals, humpback whales, Steller sea lions, wood bison, caribou, wolves and salmon. In some cases the state was simply challenging a decision through administrative channels. In others, like with protections for polar bears, it filed lawsuits.States, of course, have been fighting the federal government since the nation’s birth. California has a history of successfully pushing for more regulation, not less. For Alaska, winning or losing might not be determined by the outcome of a single case.“If all people ever do is roll over, then agencies can become more and more aggressive in their rule-making,” said Stewart Jay, a constitutional law professor at the University of Washington School of Law. “But whenever you’re dealing with agencies that are expecting to be sued, you can expect to have a lot more care taken in the process.”'"
"'11-03-30,'1','The blood evidence would have proved Mr. Thompson innocent of a 1984 armed robbery. Soon after he was convicted on that charge, prosecutors tried him for an unrelated murder. After the failure to turn over the blood evidence came to light in 1999, prosecutors dismissed the armed robbery charges. A state appeals court later reversed the murder conviction, reasoning that Mr. Thompson’s armed robbery conviction had dissuaded him from testifying in his own defense in the murder case. In 2003, Mr. Thompson was retried for the murder and found not guilty.“The role of a prosecutor,” Justice Thomas wrote, “is to see that justice is done.”“By their own admission,” he continued, “the prosecutors who tried Thompson’s armed robbery case failed to carry out this responsibility. But the only issue before us is whether Connick, as the policy maker for the district attorney’s office, was deliberately indifferent to the need to train the attorneys under his authority.”The answer to that question was no, Justice Thomas wrote, given what he said was an absence of proof concerning a pattern of misconduct.Justice Scalia, in a concurrence joined by Justice Alito, said the misconduct in the case was the work of a single “miscreant prosecutor,” Gerry Deegan, who suppressed evidence “he believed to be exculpatory, in an effort to railroad Thompson.” No amount of training, Justice Scalia wrote, would have countered such willful wrongdoing.In her dissent, Justice Ginsburg wrote that “no fewer than five prosecutors” were complicit in a violation of Mr. Thompson’s constitutional rights. “They kept from him, year upon year, evidence vital to his defense.”The prosecutors’ conduct, Justice Ginsburg wrote, “was a foreseeable consequence of lax training.” Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined the dissent.At a news conference on Tuesday, Leon A. Cannizzaro Jr., the current district attorney in New Orleans, expressed relief over not having to pay a judgment that with interest was approaching $20 million, more than his office’s annual budget. He said his office “should not be held financially responsible for the intentional, unethical and illegal acts of a rogue prosecutor.”Mr. Thompson expressed frustration about the Supreme Court’s ruling in his case, Connick v. Thompson, No. 09-571.“If I’d spilled hot coffee on myself, I could have sued the person who served me the coffee,” he said. “But I can’t sue the prosecutors who nearly murdered me.”'"
"'11-03-30,'1','“Absolutely, we would like to be able to have demand for our products be such that we’ll be able to turn those plants back on,” Ms. Clegg said.Mr. Ashton and Ms. Clegg said G.M. already was planning to call back all of the approximately 2,000 workers on layoff status by year’s end and would undoubtedly need to hire some additional workers, but they declined to say how many or where.They spoke to reporters after a training demonstration at G.M.’s Orion assembly plant, which is preparing to build a pair of subcompact cars, the Chevrolet Sonic and Buick Verano, later this year. G.M. considered closing the plant, located north of Detroit, but reversed course after the U.A.W. agreed to a deal that allows 40 percent of its 1,550 hourly workers to be paid about half as much as the others.G.M. said the arrangement was necessary so it could profitably build such small, inexpensive cars in the United States, something none of its competitors do. The deal expands on a 2007 provision in the U.A.W.’s contracts with G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group that allows newly hired workers to earn about $14 an hour instead of the standard rate of about $28.No current workers have been moved down to the lower tier, and Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who specializes in labor relations, said he expected the union to prevent that from happening because it would anger the membership.The two-tier wage system was controversial within the union when it was created, but comments by Mr. Ashton and by the U.A.W.’s president, Bob King, last week, signaled that the union was increasingly embracing it as a means of creating jobs.“The U.A.W. leaders clearly do not like the two-tier wage,” Mr. Shaiken said. “But they view the creation of domestic jobs as urgent. I think the tradeoff they’re looking at is that it is far easier to raise that wage in future negotiations than to reopen plants that have been permanently shuttered.”At a convention of union leaders from across the United States in Detroit last week, Mr. King acknowledged his opposition to two-tier wages but suggested that the union would not press for its elimination anytime soon.He noted that, because workers on the second tier can be moved to the first when positions open up, the system can encourage automakers to bring some work in-house that had been done by suppliers or in other countries. The Chevrolet Aveo, which the Michigan-built Sonic will replace, is imported from South Korea.'"
"'11-03-30,'1','The complaints assert that the defendants made just under $2.3 million in direct profits and avoided an additional $1.3 million in losses.In a statement announcing the case, Lanny A. Breuer, the assistant attorney general for the criminal division, said: “Cheng Yi Liang was entrusted with privileged information to perform his job of ensuring the health and safety of his fellow citizens. According to the complaint, he and his son repeatedly violated that trust to line their own pockets.”Law enforcement veterans said the case was unusual on several fronts. First, it is uncommon for insider-trading investigations to involve the F.D.A., despite the significant amount of market-moving information that passes through the agency each year. The agency maintains a rigorous ethics code and imposes significant restrictions on stock ownership and trading by its employees.The case is also noteworthy, Mr. Breuer said, for its application of computer technology. Investigators used hidden software installed on Mr. Liang’s computer to track his visits to the confidential database and match those visits against his trading activity in accounts he had set up in the names of friends and relatives in Maryland, China and Japan.It is not clear from the complaint what drew the attention of law enforcement, but clearly, something in January prompted investigators to install tracking software on Mr. Liang’s computer.According to the complaint, the hidden software revealed that Mr. Liang had tapped into the database on Jan. 18 and reviewed an internal F.D.A. document recommending approval of Viibryd, an antidepressant drug submitted to the agency by Clinical Data.The complaint asserted that, within minutes, several accounts controlled by Mr. Liang and his son had bought 4,875 shares of Clinical Data’s stock. According to prosecutors, the Liangs accumulated 48,875 shares of Clinical Data stock before Viibryd’s approval was announced on Jan. 21, and subsequently sold their entire stake for a profit of more than $379,000.The complaint also accuses the Liangs of trading in advance of a May 6, 2009, announcement by Vanda Pharmaceuticals that the F.D.A. had approved its drug Fanapt.  Using Andrew Liang’s account and several other accounts, the Liangs are accused of netting more than $1 million, for a profit of nearly 800 percent.The other companies whose stock was affected by the trading were Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Middlebrook Pharmaceuticals and Momenta Pharmaceuticals.The S.E.C. complaint accused the elder Mr. Liang of illegally trading ahead of more than two dozen F.D.A. announcements involving drug applications by 19 companies. It seeks to recover profits from him, from his son and from five other defendants, including Mr. Liang’s wife and mother.'"
"'11-03-30,'1','The plaintiffs’ theory is that a centralized companywide policy gave local managers too much discretion in pay and promotion decisions, leaving Wal-Mart vulnerable to gender stereotypes. The plaintiffs have presented sworn statements and statistics to support their claim.Wal-Mart calls that evidence unrepresentative and unreliable. The company says its policies expressly bar discrimination and promote diversity. In any event, the company says, the plaintiffs — who worked in 3,400 stores in 170 job classifications — do not have enough in common to warrant class-action treatment.Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the theory about how the company discriminated — through a central policy conferring local discretion — was internally inconsistent. “Your complaint faces in two directions,” he told a lawyer for the plaintiffs.But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said Wal-Mart could be held accountable if it failed to take action in the face of reports of discrimination from its stores. “Should central management under the law have withdrawn some of the subjective discretion in order to stop these results?” Justice Breyer asked.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed, saying that companies had a responsibility to make sure that women were treated fairly in local workplaces. And Justice Elena Kagan said that “excessive subjectivity” may be a policy that violates the civil rights laws.“I’m getting whipsawed here,” he told the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Joseph M. Sellers. “On the one hand, you say the problem is that they were utterly subjective, and on the other hand you say there is strong corporate culture that guides all of this. Well, which is it?”Mr. Sellers responded that “there is this broad discretion given the managers” but that “they do not make their decisions in a vacuum.” Managers, he went on, “are informed by the company about how to exercise that discretion.”That did not satisfy Justice Scalia. “If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion,” he said, “you don’t have discretion.”Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Wal-Mart, said the handful of women named as plaintiffs who seek to represent the entire class did not have typical experiences at the company.“Each of the plaintiffs have very different stories,” he said. “One of them was promoted into a managerial position. One was terminated for disciplinary violations. One was promoted and then had a disciplinary problem and then was demoted.”He added that “this class includes at least 544 store managers who are alleged to be discriminators and victims.”“What seems to me a very serious problem in this case is, how do you work out the back pay?” Justice Ginsburg asked.Mr. Sellers said the trial court could rely on statistics culled from company databases, which he said were more reliable than the evidence that might be presented in individualized hearings given the available information about particular pay and promotion decisions. Memories have faded, he said, and Wal-Mart did not keep good records.Given that, Mr. Sellers said, Wal-Mart’s personnel decisions were “standardless” and “recordless.”Justice Kennedy responded with a point about the suitability of the case for class-action treatment. “If it’s standardless and recordless,” he said, “then why is there commonality?”Mr. Boutrous said Mr. Sellers was trying to have it both ways.“The problem here, Mr. Sellers says, is that the records are not available,” Mr. Boutrous said. “Then he says we’re going to have a proceeding where the district judge relies only on the records that he says are inadequate, to allow a reconstruction of the decision. That is not a process known to our jurisprudence. It doesn’t comport with due process.Several justices voiced concerns about how many companies could be subject to class-action suits if they allowed the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.“Is it true,” Chief Justice Roberts asked Mr. Sellers, “that Wal-Mart’s pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?”Mr. Sellers said that was not the appropriate comparison. “The comparison that’s relevant,” he said, “is between men and women and Wal-Mart.” He added later that “Wal-Mart was behind the other large retailers.”The chief justice also asked Mr. Sellers “how many examples of abuse of the subjective discrimination delegation need to be shown before you can say that flows from the policy rather than from bad actors?” After all, he said, “you’re going to have some bad apples” given Wal-Mart’s thousands of stores.Mr. Sellers responded that “there is no minimum number” in court decisions.Justices Kennedy and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they were concerned about companies whose pay and promotion gaps mirror national numbers where there is no proof of a discriminatory policy.“So, you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American work force,” Justice Alito said. “Then you would say every single company is in violation of Title VII” of the Civil Rights Act?“That could very well be the case,” Mr. Sellers said.'"
"'11-03-30,'1','Eleven cities hit a new low for the downturn, including Charlotte, N.C., Miami, Tampa, Fla., and New York. Prices in New York have fallen 23 percent from their peak.Analysts expected a rough winter, but not quite so brutal. “We are more negative on housing than we were three months ago,” said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. Any recovery will be delayed from this fall until next year, she said.Buying a house is a mix of faith and necessity, but that first element is scarce these days. The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index tumbled 8.6 percent in March, the first drop in six months and the largest in a year. Only 15 percent of respondents thought their incomes would increase over the next six months.Among the troubles facing the market is a pervasive sense that houses are a bad bet. If prices still have further to fall, if loans are tough to get, if interest rates are no longer plunging, why not put off a deal if you possibly can?Yet as Mr. Case suggested, things could be worse. The market is not falling at nearly the rate it was in 2008. All but the gloomiest analysts think the market is much closer to the end of the process than the beginning.An element that is paradoxically working to shore up the market is the millions of foreclosed houses that are not coming back for sale and contributing to the abundance of inventory. Too much inventory pushes down prices.Lenders, who are wrangling with policy makers over reforms, placed 21 percent fewer homeowners in foreclosure in January than they did in November, even as the number of loans in severe default was holding steady, according to data released Tuesday by LPS Applied Analytics.One reason for fewer foreclosures is that more struggling borrowers appear to be making deals with their banks. The percent of severely delinquent loans returning to paid-up status rose to 22 percent from 10 percent over the last year, LPS said.For many of the rest, foreclosure is less a process than a destination, the data indicates. Three out of 10 homeowners in foreclosure have not made any payment in at least two years.Case-Shiller is a three-month moving average, which means it is resistant to quick changes. On a seasonally adjusted basis, January’s drop was 0.2 percent, the same as in December. In the slower winter months, the adjusted numbers are considered less indicative of the market’s true condition.Prices were down 3.1 percent from their levels a year earlier. Only two of the 20 cities in the index recorded price increases during that time: Washington and, barely, San Diego.First-time buyers, a critical force in the market, have become scarcer since a stimulus program involving tax credits came to an end last spring.“That really motivated a lot of people to act,” said Steven Thoele, a broker with Keller Williams Realty in Portland, Ore. “Eight grand in your pocket went a long way to making the numbers work.”Portland reached another low for the current downturn in January. Prices there fell 1.8 percent from December. They are now down 27 percent from their 2007 peak.“You do kind of wonder where the bottom is,” said Mr. Thoele. “Sellers know in the back of their mind that their home is worth less than at the peak, but they’re still a little surprised when you tell them their $400,000 house is now worth $300,000.”Atlanta, Cleveland, Detroit and Las Vegas are now below their average prices of 11 years ago, and Phoenix is nearly there. Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas and Minneapolis are not doing much better. After adjusting for inflation, the struggles in these cities are even more pronounced.The Case-Shiller release capped a run of weak housing reports. Existing-home sales were down in February by nearly 10 percent from January, the National Association of Realtors reported last week, much worse than expected.New-home sales in February were 14 percent below forecasts, according to the Census Bureau. At an annual rate of 250,000, sales were the lowest since the advent of comprehensive record-keeping in 1963.In one hopeful note, the National Association of Realtors said this week that pending home sales rose 2.1 percent in February. Those deals, which will become final in March and April, indicate that sales are unlikely to continue to tumble, which could help stabilize prices.“The spring market could have some good surprises,” said Mr. Case, the economist.“I say that with absolutely no conviction.”'"
"'11-03-30,'1','The Chinese government, in the harshest crackdown in years, is holding scores of human rights advocates, political writers, lawyers and dissidents. The roundup began in late February after calls for a revolution modeled on the protests in Tunisia surfaced on the Internet in Chinese. At least 25 people are being held for what Chinese officials call criminal investigation, but many others are being detained for no stated reason.On Tuesday, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, said she had never heard of Mr. Yang when she was asked about him at a scheduled news conference in Beijing.China recently detained two ethnic Chinese businessmen with Australian passports, Matthew Ng and Stern Hu. Mr. Ng has been charged with embezzlement. Mr. Hu, an executive at Rio Tinto, the Australian mining company, was sentenced last year to 10 years in prison after confessing that he had received bribes from Chinese steel mills.Mr. Yang was born in Hubei Province and studied law at the prestigious Fudan University in Shanghai, according to a short biography on one of his blogs. He worked at the Foreign Ministry, then moved to Sydney and began writing spy novels. One popular novel, “Fatal Weakness,” about espionage and government corruption involving China and the United States, was the first in a trilogy; it has been published on the Internet.Mr. Yang writes frequently on personal blogs on at least five major Chinese portals, and some of his essays have been translated into English on his Web site. His writings place him firmly on the liberal end of the political spectrum in China, but his critiques of the government are not uncommon among reform-minded Chinese thinkers.In one entry dated March 17 on Netease, a popular Web portal, Mr. Yang wrote that the numerous Chinese television dramas about the Communist revolution skewed history, and “our education and propaganda spread hate every moment and every time” in order to “find legitimacy for itself.”Mr. Yang’s last blog entry on Netease is dated March 27, the day he vanished. The entry criticizes Peking University in Beijing for a new policy that aims to re-educate students who are deemed to have “radical” thoughts.In a 2008 video interview with Danwei.org, a popular English-language blog about China, Mr. Yang said that he liked to keep his blogs on a number of Web sites “to get my writing out as widely as possible, to spread some ideas.”He said the Internet allowed the Chinese to learn about major events quickly and openly. He mentioned how he had been able to write that year about controversial topics like Tibet, the Sichuan earthquake and Western democracy without running up against overbearing censorship.“Now, when bad things happen, if the government screws up or mishandles something, as soon as it is exposed, it cannot be hidden or covered up,” he said. “The only thing they can do is block the information, and that is not very effective.”Mr. Yang’s followers on the Web have begun leaving messages about his disappearance on his blogs. One entry says, “The people need intellectuals like you,” and another reads, “There is no sense of security living in China.”'"

"'11-03-30,'1','On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Bachus released a seven-page document titled “Perspectives on Settlement Alternatives in Mortgage Servicing,” which, in a letter to Ms. Warren, he said demonstrated that she had a larger role than she had indicated to the committee.“It is plain that the C.F.P.B. has done more than provide ‘advice’ on the proposed servicing settlement,” Mr. Bachus wrote. The letter requested that Ms. Warren consider “if there are any aspects of that testimony related to the C.F.P.B.’s role in the mortgage servicer settlement negotiations that you wish to clarify or correct.”The letter was co-signed by Representative Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia and chairwoman of the subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer credit.Jen Howard, a spokeswoman for the consumer agency, said that Ms. Warren correctly characterized her participation. “As Elizabeth Warren testified to Congress earlier this month, the consumer bureau provided advice to various officials involved in the mortgage servicing law enforcement matter,” Ms. Howard said in a statement. “She is aware that not everyone agrees with that advice or how to address the serious deficiencies at some of the nation’s largest mortgage servicing firms.”Mr. Bachus, a consistent critic of both the consumer agency and Ms. Warren, filled that role again Wednesday when he addressed the Chamber of Commerce conference immediately before she spoke.Noting that he has introduced a bill to change the governance of the consumer bureau from a single director to a five-person, bipartisan commission, he characterized the powers given to the head of the consumer agency as unmatched in government.“They regulate all financial products and services, so if it involves a dollar changing hands, they can regulate it, or she can, because she actually has total discretion” over consumer financial products, Mr. Bachus said. “If George Washington came back today, or Abraham Lincoln or Warren Buffett signed up, I wouldn’t give that person total discretion.”Ms. Warren was followed by Thomas J. Donohue, president and chief executive of the chamber, who warned that the consumer agency could choke off economic growth in the United States.“If not used carefully, the C.F.P.B.’s tremendous power to go after bad actors could cause serious collateral damage to America’s job creators,” he said.Ms. Warren has disputed the notion that the consumer agency has unbridled power. “There are plenty of checks in place,” she said, including a law governing how federal agencies write and adopt new regulations. Its rules, like those of any agency, can be overturned by Congress or federal courts.In addition, she said, the consumer bureau is “the only bank regulator — and perhaps the only agency anywhere in government — whose rules can be overruled by a group of other agencies,” specifically the Financial Stability Oversight Council, composed of nine regulatory agency heads and an independent insurance industry expert. A two-thirds vote of the council is required to overturn a consumer agency rule.Ms. Warren also warned against making the agency subject to annual appropriations of Congress, saying it would inject politics into the regulatory structure and cause banks and other regulated agencies to lobby for looser oversight.Regulation and competition are not, she said, mutually exclusive. “In fact, when done right, they support each other,” Ms. Warren said. “Are the Chamber’s members, as citizens or business owners and executives, in a better place today because the F.A.A. regulates air safety, because the states regulate insurance companies, because the federal government enforces antitrust statutes? Of course they are. And so is this country.”'"

"'11-03-31,'0','The plot of “Super” has a lot in common with “Kick-Ass,” in which the title character, a high-school dweeb and his sidekick, Hit-Girl, wreak gory havoc. Mr. Gunn, who wrote and directed “Super,” is an alumnus of the B-movie studio Troma, for whom he wrote the screenplay for the midnight cult hit “Tromeo and Juliet.” That movie and his 2006 comic horror movie, “Slither,” have a facetious, let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may attitude and fondness for excess; the more splatter is better.Initially Frank’s attempts to right the world’s wrongs using only his fists and ungainly body are ludicrous, foolhardy exercises that end in cuts and bruises at the hands of stronger and more ruthless foes. Realizing he needs weapons, Frank consults Libby (Ellen Page), an eager, fresh-faced clerk in a comic-book store, for appropriate tools. She guesses his alter ego after news reports of the Crimson Bolt’s antics, and the two become a team.Frank returns to action wielding a pipe wrench, which he uses to bash people in the face. The smallest rudeness can trigger a violent reaction. A man who cuts in line outside a movie theater winds up in intensive care. An acquaintance of Libby’s who may or may not have defaced a friend’s car is savagely attacked in his home.“Super” doesn’t pretend to be realistic. Violent acts go unpunished. It thrashes about in a comic-book limbo where basic laws of cause and effect don’t necessarily apply.The Crimson Bolt eventually commands a formidable arsenal of firepower that includes bombs and grenades as he and Libby, now nicknamed Boltie and appropriately costumed, lay siege to Jacques’s lair.“Super” rides on the carefully bent performances of its stars. Mr. Wilson’s Frank is a psychotic chip off the blockhead, Dwight, he plays in “The Office.” The film magnifies the quietly fuming, injustice-collecting Dwight into an avenger of monstrous grandiosity. Flashbacks to Frank’s persecution during childhood and adolescence trick you into sympathizing with him long after he has gone around the bend.A nervous, fidgety crybaby who in moments of abject self-loathing falls on his knees and prays for deliverance from his miserable condition, Frank is ultimately abhorrent despite a mawkish soft ending. You can see exactly why Sarah left him for the loathsome Jacques. There is no getting around the fact that slithery bad boys are sexier than crazy goody-goods. And Mr. Bacon’s sleaze ball oozes an oily reptilian charm.Even more disturbing is Ms. Page’s transformation from helpful eager beaver to demented vixen whose perky enthusiasm escalates into manical bloodlust. Together Frank and Libby become the newest screen incarnation of those archetypal cinematic lovebirds known as natural-born killers.Written and directed by James Gunn; director of photography, Steve Gainer; edited by Cara Silverman; music by Tyler Bates; production design by William Elliott; costumes by Mary Matthews; produced by Miranda Bailey and Ted Hope; released by IFC Midnight. Running time: 1 hour 36 minutes. This film is not rated.WITH: Rainn Wilson (Frank), Ellen Page (Libby), Liv Tyler (Sarah), Kevin Bacon (Jacques) and Nathan Fillion (the Holy Avenger).'"

"'11-03-31,'0','European supporters of Airbus had focused much of their complaint on research contracts that Boeing received from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Pentagon since the late 1970s to develop lightweight carbon composite materials that the manufacturer subsequently used in the design of the Dreamliner. As much as 50 percent of the 787’s primary structure, including the fuselage and wings, is made of composite materials, more than any other large civil aircraft.Mr. Kirk said $2.6 billion of the subsidies that the panel found were from NASA and that the Pentagon contributed only $110 million.In addition, he said, 20 of the 23 claims about Pentagon contracts were rejected, with the panel ruling that they were legitimate procurement contracts rather than research grants.In its report, which was submitted confidentially to American and European trade negotiators at the end of January, the W.T.O. largely agreed that, “absent the aeronautics R&D subsidies, Boeing would not have been able to launch an aircraft incorporating all of the technologies that are incorporated in the 787.”It also found that Boeing’s introduction of the 787 program in 2004 had forced Airbus to lower the price of its A330 wide-body aircraft to maintain market share. However, it rejected the claim that the 787 had an impact on the price that Airbus was able to command for its forthcoming challenger to the 787, the A350-XWB.Several weeks ago, the United States Defense Department awarded Boeing a $35 billion contract to supply the Air Force with new aerial refueling tankers. Analysts said Boeing’s victory in that contest would probably blunt the sting of the W.T.O.’s findings for Boeing’s supporters in Washington and expressed hope that the two sides would eventually move beyond this dispute toward a negotiated settlement.“It has not been a very edifying spectacle,” said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst and managing partner at Agency Partners, a London-based consultancy. ”It’s a lot of sound and fury signifying very little.”In a case decided last June, the W.T.O. found that Airbus had benefited from four decades of improper subsidies to vault past Boeing to become the world’s top jet builder.That ruling, which has been appealed by both sides, concluded that Airbus had received the subsidies, including $15 billion in loans from European governments at below-market interest rates and several billion dollars in grants, to produce the A380 superjumbo and five other best-selling models. But the W.T.O. stopped short of a wholesale condemnation of government loans — known as “launch aid” — that are repaid largely through export sales.The W.T.O. is expected to rule on the appeal of that ruling next month.Airbus said in a statement Thursday that it was pleased with the findings of the W.T.O. report but that it expected the European Union to appeal a number of issues relating to legal interpretation.Analysts said they hoped the publication of the report would bring an epic battle over subsidies in the aircraft industry to a close and eventually pave the way for new set of ground rules among the world’s makers of large civil aircraft — a field that has grown substantially since the United States and European governments began their dispute nearly seven years ago.Embraer of Brazil and Bombardier of Canada, which for decades have specialized in smaller jets with fewer than 100 seats, have begun to develop larger planes with the range and capacity approaching that of the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737 — single-aisle planes that are the bread and butter of most of the world’s airlines. Mitsubishi of Japan and United Aircraft of Russia also expect to build planes that can carry up to 200 passengers around the middle of this decade, while China’s C919 jet is projected to enter commercial service in 2016.Last month, the Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair — which currently operates a fleet of 250 Boeing 737s — confirmed it was talking with the Chinese and Russians, as well as Boeing and Airbus, about future jet orders.“It’s no longer a bipolar world,” said Mr. Cunningham of Agency Partners. “You can’t go down this puritanical road of no government funding for aerospace. You have five up-and-coming competitors who aren’t going to play that game.”Single-aisle jets are expected to represent more than half of the roughly $3.6 trillion in anticipated new aircraft sales over the next 20 years, according to industry estimates.'"

"'11-03-31,'0','Instead, they said their goal was to examine the network’s methods and model to see whether they could be replicated widely. Among other findings, the study concludes that KIPP schools enjoy significant financial advantages over traditional public schools.By analyzing Department of Education databases for the 2007-8 school year, the researchers calculated that the KIPP network received $12,731 in taxpayer money per student, compared with $11,960 at the average traditional public school and $9,579, on average, at charter schools nationwide.In addition, KIPP generated $5,760 per student from private donors, the study said, based on a review of KIPP’s nonprofit filings with the Internal Revenue Service.The study does not offer an explanation for why KIPP schools would get more government financing than regular public schools.“We can’t explain it, but that’s what the data shows,” Dr. Miron said.Mike Wright, a senior finance official at KIPP, said the study had produced an inflated estimate of the network’s government revenues, partly because charters get most of their financing from states, which differ significantly in how much money they give charter schools for each student.Because the study used a sample of KIPP schools that did not include any schools in California, which provides only meager financing to charters, it had produced an exaggerated picture of average government financing for the schools nationwide, Mr. Wright said.He estimated average government financing nationwide at between $9,000 and $10,000 per KIPP student.The study significantly inflated private revenues, Mr. Wright said, because KIPP itself had miscategorized some government money as private revenues in its reporting to the I.R.S.In addition, the Michigan researchers mixed private donations earmarked for school construction with donations for operating expenses, thereby further inflating the study’s estimate of per-pupil operating revenues derived from philanthropy, Mr. Wright said.He estimated KIPP’s private revenues in the 2007-8 year at about $2,500 per student, compared with the $5,760 cited in the study.KIPP schools operate on a no-excuses model that pushes students to improve their achievement and to take responsibility.Parents must sign a pledge that they will check students’ homework and make sure they get to school on time, among other commitments. The schools run on an extended school day during the week, and students must attend Saturday classes every other week.Steve Mancini, a spokesman, said it cost the KIPP network, on average, $1,200 to $1,600 per student to provide the extended weekday hours, Saturday classes and other extra learning time.The new study generated some instant debate.Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California, Berkeley, called the study’s financial analysis “eye-opening.”“As wealthy donors have invested in KIPP, they have helped to demonstrate how a well-endowed, inspirationally run charter school can lift poor children,” Mr. Fuller said. “The question raised by this study is whether the model could be replicated if wealthy donors were to walk away.”Grover Whitehurst, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who is a former research director at the Department of Education, also said the study’s financial analysis made a “significant contribution.”But other parts of the report, especially its findings on student attrition, Dr. Whitehurst said, “use questionable data sources and analytic techniques to push a position that is antagonistic to KIPP.”The Western Michigan study concluded that KIPP schools have substantially higher student attrition rates than the school districts from which they draw students.But Dr. Whitehurst said it based that finding on a flawed methodology. Another study of attrition carried out last year by Mathematica Policy Research, he said, used far more sophisticated research techniques to conclude that, on average, KIPP schools did not have significantly higher or lower numbers of students leaving before completion than nearby public schools.'"

"'11-03-31,'0','The Microsoft complaint, Professor Cusumano notes, is also a reminder of the comparative speed with which fortunes can shift in fast-moving technology markets. “It doesn’t happen instantly, but it does happen faster than in most industries,” Professor Cusumano said. “It took Google about a decade to really turn the tables on Microsoft.”For years, the swaggering giant of personal computer software battled competitors and antitrust regulators in America and abroad, parrying their claims that it had bullied rivals and abused its market muscle. In the United States, it suffered rulings against it and in 2001 reached a settlement that prohibited Microsoft from certain strong-arm tactics. In Europe, Microsoft absorbed setbacks and record fines from regulators and judges.Still, irony has no place in antitrust doctrine. Microsoft’s complaint must be weighed on the merits, as part of a wide-ranging antitrust investigation of Google, begun last year and led by Europe’s competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia.The litany of particulars in Microsoft’s complaint, the company’s lawyers say, includes claims of anticompetitive practices by Google in search, online advertising and smartphone software. But a central theme, Microsoft says, is that Google unfairly hinders the ability of search competitors — and Microsoft’s Bing is almost the only one left — from examining and indexing information that Google controls, like its big video service YouTube.Such restraints, Microsoft contends, undermine competition — and thus pose a threat to consumer choice and better prices for online advertisers.When told of the Microsoft claims, Adam Kovacevich, a Google spokesman, denied that the company had done anything wrong and said its practices did not deny Microsoft access to Google technology and content.Though it is making an antitrust claim, Microsoft is also claiming a bit of hypocrisy on Google’s part. In an interview, Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel, cited Google’s stated mission to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”“That is a laudable goal,” Mr. Smith said. “But it appears Google’s practice is to prevent others from doing the same thing. That is unlawful and it raises serious antitrust issues.”Google’s strategy, he adds, seems to be to “wall off content so that it cannot be crawled and searched by competing companies.”In smartphones — sources of increasing volumes of search traffic — Microsoft says Google is withholding technical information needed to let phones using Windows Phone 7 software have a rich, full-featured application for YouTube. That technical information, Microsoft says, is available not only in Google’s Android software but also Apple iPhones, as part of a deal dating back to when Google’s chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, was on the Apple board. (He resigned in 2009, after the Federal Trade Commission raised questions about the arrangement.)Mr. Kovacevich said that about two years ago, the company decided to make an improved version of YouTube available for all mobile devices instead of tailoring it to each company on smartphone applications, as it did earlier with Apple.Microsoft also contends that Google has set up what amount to technical roadblocks so that Microsoft’s Bing search service cannot examine and index up to half of the videos on YouTube.Another Microsoft claim focuses on Google’s ad contracts. Its contracts prohibit advertisers and online agencies from using third-party software that could instantly compare results and move advertisers’ data from one ad platform to another — from Google’s Adwords to Microsoft’s Adcenter, for example.The Google spokesman said the company does allow advertisers freedom to move data freely, and the restraint on third-party software is to maintain the consistency of Google’s ad service.Microsoft sees current cases involving Google in the United States through a similar prism. In rejecting Google’s settlement with groups representing authors and publishers last week, a judge in Federal District Court in New York said the plan to scan and digitize millions of books raised antitrust concerns.The settlement, wrote Judge Denny Chin, would “arguably give Google control over the search market.” Later in his ruling, the judge wrote, “Google’s ability to deny competitors the ability to search orphan books would further entrench Google’s market power in the online search market.”The Justice Department is reviewing Google’s planned $700 million purchase of ITA, an airline flight information software company. Microsoft’s Bing, along with specialized travel Web sites like Hotwire, Kayak and Orbitz, use ITA’s data. And Microsoft and others have urged the Justice Department to make approval of the deal dependent on Google’s allowing others continuing access to the data, on terms similar to those before the acquisition.Google has pledged to do that, Mr. Kovacevich said.The Justice Department has stepped in twice to challenge Google — on the proposed Yahoo deal in 2008 and in opposing Google’s book deal last year.Microsoft has urged regulators and Congress to curb Google in the past, including Microsoft’s public opposition to Google’s bid for Yahoo and its successful acquisition of DoubleClick, an online advertising specialist, for $3.1 billion in 2008.Microsoft, Mr. Smith said, is filing its complaint in Europe partly because it has an overall antitrust investigation of Google under way. In Washington, antitrust reviews of Google have focused on individual business deals rather than a pattern of conduct. (The Texas attorney general’s office is also conducting an antitrust investigation of Google. Other states have also shown interest.)But Mr. Smith noted that Google’s market share in search in Europe is higher than in the United States — more than 90 percent in most nations in the European Union, compared with 65 percent in the United States. “The search market in Europe is substantially less competitive than it is in the U.S.,” Mr. Smith said.Microsoft, he added, plans to make sizable investments and efforts in the European market. “But if we’re going to get a more competitive market there, European regulators are also going to have to take steps to establish a level playing field.”Google’s large market share in search, legal experts say, does invite antitrust scrutiny. If Microsoft’s claims are accurate, they could raise issues for Google, especially in Europe, where antitrust regulators tend to move more quickly to restrain the behavior of dominant companies.Still, antitrust regulators look for evidence of not only an unfair advantage but also of less consumer choice and higher prices.“You do need to show consumer harm,” said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Iowa College of Law. “That becomes more difficult with search engines, where it is easy for consumers to switch to another search engine. That is different than in PC operating systems in the Microsoft case, where the technological lock-in was more obvious.”'"
"'11-03-31,'0','For example, Dr. Eisner and Dr. Meinwald showed how male bella moths used plant toxins to attract mates.Dr. Eisner was actually studying a different insect — orb-weaving spiders — when he noticed a brightly colored moth flying in a web. The spider, instead of pouncing on the moth and eating it, cut it out and set it free. Intrigued, he caught more bella moths and threw them into the web. The spider set them free, too.To understand why, Dr. Eisner and Dr. Meinwald studied the bella moth more closely. They found that the males carried distasteful chemicals known as alkaloids that they had ingested as larvae from plants. The alkaloids leave a very bad taste for spiders and other creatures that would eat the moths.Further, the scientists observed that female moths found the toxins attractive. When they mated, the male bestowed the alkaloids to its mate, which then passed them to the eggs, making the offspring less tasty and more likely to survive.“The father is able to protect the next generation chemically,” Dr. Meinwald said. “That’s one story both Tom and I liked.”Thomas D. Seeley, a Cornell biologist, said Dr. Eisner and Dr. Meinwald “really did open this whole dimension of chemistry in the natural world.”Dr. Eisner also studied the bombardier beetle. Even before Charles Darwin studied them, biologists knew that the beetle shot out a hot liquid as a defense mechanism. But they did not know how the beetle did it or what it was shooting.In his research, Dr. Eisner and his colleagues showed that the beetle, in effect, makes a form of rocket fuel — boiling hot, no less — by combining two separately stored chemicals, then steers the stream by rotating the tip of its abdomen.“Insects are the most versatile chemists on Earth,” Dr. Eisner said in a 1989 interview.Thomas Eisner was born in Berlin on June 25, 1929. His family was Jewish and moved to Barcelona, Spain, in 1933 when Hitler came to power in Germany. The violence of the Spanish Civil War led them to move to Uruguay, where, Dr. Eisner recalled, he was surrounded by a panoply of bugs.After the Eisners moved to the United States in 1947, he enrolled at Champlain College in Plattsburgh, N.Y., and transferred to Harvard two years later. It was at Harvard that he took his first entomology course and realized that his love of insects could grow into a career. (As Harvard graduate students, he and Professor Wilson went on a two-month road trip to collect insects around the country.)After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in 1951 and a doctorate in 1955, Dr. Eisner joined the faculty at Cornell. However, he never forgot that Cornell had rejected him as an undergraduate and displayed the rejection letter in his office.Dr. Eisner was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and in 1994 he received a National Medal of Science, the highest scientific honor in the United States. He was also an ardent conservationist and served on the boards of the National Audubon Society, the National Scientific Council of the Nature Conservancy, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the World Resources Institute Council.In 1991, he brokered an agreement between Merck, the pharmaceutical giant, and the National Biodiversity Institute of Costa Rica. The institute provided samples of Costa Rican plants, insects and microbes that Merck would test for possible use in new drugs. A percentage of any profits that Merck might make would go back to Costa Rica for conservation efforts. None of the 1,000 compounds that were analyzed, however, resulted in a new drug.Dr. Eisner is survived by his wife of 58 years, Maria; three daughters, Yvonne Eisner of Pelham, N.Y., Vivian Eisner of Warwick, R.I.; and Christina Brown of Wheaton, Ill; and six grandchildren.Dr. Eisner’s life could have taken a different turn had he not listened to his piano teacher, the German conductor Fritz Busch. Though Dr. Eisner became an accomplished pianist, Busch told him he would never reach the top echelons of the music world.Still, Dr. Eisner continued to play throughout his life, and he kept an upright piano in his laboratory.Even as Parkinson’s began to sap his physical abilities, Dr. Eisner found new avenues of expression, creating art with a color photocopier using insects, flowers and other objects and turning them into images of startling clarity.“I simply imagined how the component parts of a given arrangement might fit together,” Dr. Eisner said in 2006, “and laid out the parts in accord with the vision. It was like playing with a Lego set.”'"
"'11-03-31,'0','Mr. Raynor said that current leaders of the service employees’ union were trying to push him out, along with several other officials who had supported Anna Burger, the union’s former secretary-treasurer, during her unsuccessful campaign against the official who won the S.E.I.U’s presidency, Mary Kay Henry, succeeding Andy Stern.The charges were filed against Mr. Raynor on Monday, just three days after he presided over the main ceremony commemorating the centennial of the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire. Workers United, the successor union to the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union, sponsored the ceremony, held at the site of the factory, one block east of Washington Square, and attended by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and several thousand others.The charges accuse Mr. Raynor of falsely stating that he had 10 meals, costing $186 to $275, with a male union lawyer instead of the person he had actually dined with: Alex Dagg, a female executive vice president of Workers United and one of its Canadian directors.The charges call for ousting him from his Workers United and S.E.I.U. posts, and state that he  falsified union records and made improper personal expenses.Mr. Raynor said he did not list Ms. Dagg’s name, as he had often done before, because S.E.I.U. officials had told her not to involve him in efforts to negotiate a settlement to the nasty turf war in Canada between Workers United and Unite Here.“By not putting her name down, I was simply protecting her from political retaliation,” he said.Inga Skippings, a spokeswoman with the S.E.I.U., said that the charges against Mr. Raynor were not political retaliation. “This is about the enforcement of an ethics policy that was put in place to protect our members’ resources,” she said, “and, quite frankly, Mr. Raynor can share with the hearing officer whatever he’d like to share. This is truly about our ethics policy and trying to maintain the highest standards possible in the organization.”Mr. Raynor is a well known but divisive figure in the labor movement. He was one of the lead organizers in the 17-year campaign to unionize 3,500 textile workers at J. P. Stevens in the 1970s, a campaign that inspired the 1979 movie “Norma Rae.”'"
"'11-03-31,'0','Far too many states are putting new obstacles in the way of women seeking legal abortions. But South Dakota’s new law stands out for its intrusiveness and its abuse of women’s rights.About half the states, including South Dakota, require women to wait 24 hours after an initial doctor’s visit before terminating a pregnancy. The South Dakota law, which takes effect on July 1, now extends that waiting period to three days, making it the nation’s longest.As a practical matter, the 72-hour wait is likely to stretch to a week or more. With no local doctors willing to perform abortions, the sole provider of nonemergency abortions in the state, a Planned Parenthood clinic in Sioux Falls, flies in doctors from Minnesota once a week. The new law will further compound the hardship for low-income women who must travel long distances to reach the clinic and who will be forced to make several trips or arrange to stay away from home between appointments.The new law’s intrusions don’t stop there. All women seeking abortions, including victims of rape and incest, will be forced first to attend a counseling session at one of the state’s crisis pregnancy centers. These are unregulated facilities run by private groups with the aim of discouraging abortions, typically by displaying graphic photos or with ideological or religious messages or medical misinformation about psychological or physical risks.We trust the courts hearing the inevitable legal challenge will agree that this is Big Brother gone wild. Women considering an abortion need facts and medical expertise, not a mandatory visit with anti-abortion activists, the compromising of their privacy or a prolonged waiting period that pushes the procedure later into pregnancy.'"
"'11-03-31,'0','In a few instances, their corporate partners are known — as with the billionaire Koch brothers’ support of Americans for Prosperity, one of the most visible advocacy groups. More often, though, their nonprofit tax status means they do not have to reveal who pays the bills.Mr. Langer would not say who financed his Indonesian paper initiative. But his sudden interest in the issue coincided with a public relations push by Asia Pulp & Paper. And the institute’s work is remarkably similar to that produced by one of the company’s consultants, a former Australian diplomat named Alan Oxley who works closely with a Washington public affairs firm known for creating corporate campaigns presented as grass-roots efforts.For the institute, the embrace of a foreign conglomerate’s agenda is a venture into new territory — and distinguishes it among Tea Party advocacy groups. The issue, Mr. Langer asserted, is important to working Americans who might have to pay more for everything from children’s books to fried-chicken buckets made of coated paper from Asia. He said the institute had not accepted money directly from Asia Pulp & Paper, though it was possible the company had paid others who then contributed to the institute.“I suppose it could be,” he said, but added, “I don’t know about anybody else who may have gotten money from Asia Pulp & Paper who’s given money to us.”Those on the receiving end of the institute’s attacks — strange bedfellows like Greenpeace, Staples and Asia Pulp & Paper’s American competitors — are unified in their skepticism of its motives.“If you can spend as much money as you want and remain anonymous, then it doesn’t matter if you’re an overseas company or the Koch brothers, you pay the same network of anti-regulatory front groups,” said Scott Paul, director of Greenpeace’s forest campaign.Like many other nonprofit organizations on the Tea Party bandwagon, the Institute of Liberty predates the movement. It was created in 2005 by Jason Wright, an author of best-selling inspirational novels who had worked for Frontiers of Freedom, a conservative policy group.In his three years at the institute, Mr. Wright said in an interview, he was often approached by public relations consultants pitching projects for clients. Typical, he said, were overtures from two consultants who wanted him to advocate for opposing positions on the regulation of “payday” loans, widely criticized for usurious terms that hurt low-income borrowers.“A P.R. firm in D.C. offered me a ton of money to take the wrong side of that issue,” he said. “I did end up taking some corporate donations from the side of the issue I believed in — that the industry had completely lost control and had to be reined in.”One of his most visible stands was opposing net neutrality, a tenet of Internet policy criticized by broadband suppliers who want the right to charge for different levels of service. With the rise of the Tea Party movement in 2009, the institute, by then under Mr. Langer, helped inject the issue into the national dialogue, and soon signs equating net neutrality with government oppression became a staple at Tea Party rallies.Mr. Langer had arrived the previous year from the National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business lobbying group. An enthusiastic, talkative man of 40 who dabbles in Republican politics in Maryland, he quickly saw potential in the Tea Party phenomenon. Working with FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity, the institute co-sponsored early Tea Party events in Washington and published a guide called “How to Brew a Tea Party.”Mr. Langer can seem disarmingly candid when discussing his work. In a recent interview, he explained how the institute pitched its services to opponents of the Obama health care plan, resulting in a $1 million advertising blitz.“A donor gave us some money, and we went out on the ground in five states in the space of like six weeks,” he said.He would not identify any donors, and, as a nonprofit “social welfare” organization, the institute does not have to release such information. Because the institute is a tax-exempt group, its I.R.S. filings are supposed to be publicly available, but Mr. Langer said returns for the last couple of years were being amended and refiled. The last available filing showed it took in $92,500 in 2007 — a fraction of what it has spent since on several major campaigns.He said he had sometimes chosen issues suggested by colleagues from an earlier job, at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market group heavily financed by business interests. The two institutes are involved in a campaign advocating a realignment of NASA’s budget that would benefit commercial spaceflight entrepreneurs. The Institute of Liberty’s contribution was a Web page called “No Space Pork!”Last year, the two groups also supported the effort by the agribusiness giant Monsanto to ease federal restrictions on its pesticide-resistant alfalfa. (In February, regulators agreed to do so.) Mr. Langer said he decided “to try out our grass-roots method on that, and frame it as a dairy issue and access to affordable food.”He got a column published in July in the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call, talking up Monsanto’s product and asking readers to consider the value of bioengineered foods as they “stroll down the aisle of the supermarket.” The institute’s Web site urged members to speak up, and Mr. Langer filed a petition with the Department of Agriculture.But a close look at that petition illustrates how a “grass-roots” campaign may be something else entirely. He submitted 8,052 comments he said were collected by telephone. The comments, under different names, were identical and began: “I was recently contacted by the Institute for Liberty and asked if I would be willing to lend my voice in support of moving these types of alfalfa to nonregulated status.” The New York Times examined a random sample of 50 names, and found that three of the people were dead when the comments were submitted. Others said they had no idea their names had been used.“I vaguely remember responding to a survey as to whether or not the affordability of food for my family was important to me,” said Romeyn Jenkins of Iowa. “But that is far different than setting myself up as an authority on specific genetically engineered crops and authorizing my name for submission on form letters.”Told of these findings, Mr. Langer said, “That’s news to me,” and attributed them to errors by a consultant he retained to solicit the petitions, whom he would not identify. “Naturally,” he said, “the law of averages dictates that not everything will be perfect, and I will contact the vendor about that.”Mr. Langer’s latest initiative, defending Asian paper imports, is the central theme of his project called the Consumers Alliance for Global Prosperity, started with Frontiers of Freedom.Domestic paper companies and their employee unions, complaining that China and Indonesia were subsidizing exported paper products, petitioned federal trade officials several years ago to slap tariffs on them. The main target, Asia Pulp & Paper, is also under attack for its logging practices; several big retailers have stopped selling its paper.Last year, with a tariff decision looming, Asia Pulp & Paper went on the offensive. It deployed lobbyists and retained Mr. Oxley, the Australian who runs a Washington-based policy group, World Growth International, which has long defended commercial forestry and palm oil interests in Southeast Asia.World Growth issued a report last June, “Green Protectionism,” asserting that groups like Greenpeace colluded with American labor unions and paper manufacturers to hobble Asian paper imports. In September, Asia Pulp & Paper released an Oxley review criticizing a Greenpeace study of the company’s logging practices.Three days later, Mr. Langer came out with his own detailed report that hewed to these same themes, and put up a Web site, pulpwars.com, to promote it. Titled “Empires of Collusion,” it reads like a brief for Asia Pulp & Paper and has been followed by reports on subjects like palm oil and American paper industry subsidies that are important to Asia Pulp & Paper and its parent company, Sinar Mas. He has worked these issues into podcasts, Facebook postings and opinion columns, often with a folksy Tea Party-friendly twist.“More regulation and U.S. corporate welfare do not benefit American consumers, Asian companies or those in Southeast Asia who desperately need employment,” he said.Although some of his material cites Asia Pulp & Paper, Mr. Langer insists that he had not even heard of the company when he was setting up Consumers Alliance last August to call attention to free trade and affordability of products. He decided to do its first campaign on paper imports, he said, because the tariffs — which were approved in October — could raise textbook prices. “Paper came up because it was the beginning of the school year,” he said, adding that no one brought him the idea.Internet domain records, however, show that pulpwars.com was created shortly before the Consumers Alliance Web site in mid-August, suggesting the paper issue was driving the project from the start. And there are intriguing links between Mr. Langer’s operation and Mr. Oxley’s.World Growth and Consumers Alliance share an e-mail marketing service. And an executive at the DCI Group, a Washington corporate affairs firm that helped Mr. Oxley set up World Growth and has continued to provide services to it, is married to Mr. Langer’s consultant on the Consumers Alliance project.The DCI executive, Trice Whitefield, has done communications work on forestry and climate change issues for World Growth. Her husband, Bret Jacobson, said he did “some Web design and initial communications efforts” for Consumers Alliance but would not talk about how he got the assignment. Neither would Ms. Whitefield, who said only that her husband “does his own thing and I do mine.”Mr. Oxley, who has previously worked with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Frontiers of Freedom and other conservative groups in Washington, denied collaborating with Mr. Langer. He attributed any similarities between his work and the institute’s to the small number of organizations promoting the issue.While acknowledging that he had represented Asia Pulp & Paper, he said he did not know if the company was financing the Consumers Alliance, but added, “It’s not unusual that economic interests who are challenged would take action in some way.”As for Asia Pulp & Paper, one of its executives seemed to suggest it was lending a hand somehow. Speaking last October to Mongabay.com, a Web site focused on forests and conservation, Ian Lifshitz said his company would continue to “support groups like the Consumer Alliance for Global Prosperity” that respect the economic rights of developing nations.Asked about that recently, Mr. Lifshitz, who is the sustainability and public outreach manager for the North American division, backtracked, saying, “We do not directly or indirectly fund” Consumers Alliance.“What I was getting at,” he said, “is that we’re just like-minded.”'"
"'11-03-31,'0','“The estimates have been consistently off and Treasury has consistently changed the metric for success,” Mr. McHenry said in an interview on Wednesday. “In the beginning, they weren’t touting payback — they touted effectiveness. Now, they are touting payback but ignoring the moral hazard this program has created.”Treasury officials say they are actually being conservative in their profit projections. But even if that roughly $24 billion estimate proves too optimistic, the trend still represents a major turnabout from the river of red ink critics predicted. The administration itself projected a $100 billion loss only a year ago.Why did the numbers move so wildly? For starters, asset prices improved as the economy rebounded. But some of the gains remain on paper, and profits that haven’t been booked have to be continually adjusted to reflect price swings in the market. Then there are the vagaries of government accounting, like how to properly value complex mortgage securities.What is more, the government’s financial rescue remains a political hot potato, drawing criticism from the left and the right, but Obama administration officials are naturally eager to portray it as a success, especially with a budget deficit of $1.5 trillion expected in 2011.“There is no historical precedent for a financial rescue this effective,” the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said in an interview Tuesday. “We are performing better than all expectations and ahead of the other countries caught up in the crisis.”At a House Oversight subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, Treasury officials once again sparred with a government watchdog over the success of the financial rescue. In his testimony, Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general overseeing the bailout program, greeted the lower cost estimates as “good news,” but warned that the“most significant legacy may be the exacerbation of the problems posed by ‘too big to fail,’ particularly given the manner in which Treasury executed the bailout.”On Wednesday, the Treasury said that KeyCorp and SunTrust Banks repaid their bailout funds, helping the government claim a $6 billion profit on the bailout program for banks. The Treasury projects it will receive another $14 billion as hundreds of smaller banks repay their bailout funds.The Treasury is also claiming it will make a $12 billion profit when it winds down its 92 percent ownership stake in the American International Group later this year, although for now that is only on paper. It also assumes that large stake can be sold at current prices, even though unloading such a big position could depress its value.Those gains could also disappear if several big losses materialize. The Treasury projects the bailouts of General Motors, Chrysler and Ally Financial could cost it about $15 billion, while losses from the government’s beleaguered mortgage modification programs, like HAMP, could wind up reaching $46 billion. (With only about $1 billion of HAMP funds disbursed so far, bailout watchers say the actual loses could be sharply lower.)Still, the TARP bailout was only one part of the government’s rescue. Counting other federal aid programs allows the administration to radically reduce its overall cost of the effort.As part of its analysis, the Treasury included in its profit estimates about $1.2 billion from fees it collected from federal guarantees on money market mutual funds during the crisis. It also included realized gains of $22.5 billion from a series of Federal Reserve emergency aid programs designed to get credit flowing again.But the bulk of its gains come from a bounce-back in the value of more than $1.6 trillion in mortgage bonds and other debt that the government bought as the financial crisis worsened between 2008 and early 2010, in an effort to prop up the housing market. The Treasury has realized about $13.5 billion in income from interest payments of these bonds through the end of 2010, while the Federal Reserve has earned about $72.5 billion on a similar portfolio of securities backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Treasury officials project they will collect at least another $16 billion over the next few years.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York rejected a $15.7 billion offer from A.I.G. to buy back mortgage securities owned by the government, underscoring Washington’s hard line in trying to maximize the value of its holdings.Even as the Treasury collects income from the mortgage securities it owns, it is still pumping tens of billions into Fannie and Freddie, the government-controlled mortgage giants, to keep them afloat. Although the Treasury recently lowered its loss estimates, its analysis project that losses stemming from government’s support of the two companies could reach $73 billion over the next decade.'"
"'11-03-31,'0','Barry Minkow, a carpet cleaning entrepreneur who served prison time for fleecing investors out of millions in the 1980s, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a new fraud charge that potentially cost the home builder Lennar more than half a billion dollars in lost stock value.In an effort to reduce a possible five-year prison sentence, Mr. Minkow is also cooperating in an F.B.I. investigation into a California developer who may have been involved in the Lennar scheme, according to Mr. Minkow’s lawyer, Alvin Entin.“We have already turned over thousands of pages of documents to the government,” Mr. Entin said in federal court.After serving prison time, Mr. Minkow became a pastor in San Diego and an F.B.I. informant who helped ferret out phony business deals through the Fraud Discovery Institute he founded.A property developer in the Lennar case, identified in court papers as Nicolas Marsch III of San Diego, has not been charged. Through his lawyer, Mr. Marsch said he had no knowledge of Mr. Minkow’s effort to manipulate Lennar’s stock price.The Lennar criticism by Mr. Minkow led to a big drop in the home builder’s stock, a loss as high as $583.5 million, said Ryan O’Quinn, an assistant United States attorney.'"
"'11-03-31,'0','Given trends in local weather (It could snow Friday? Really?) and global everything (wars, earthquakes, tsunamis, nuclear disaster), it’s hard to figure out which will end first — this winter or the world.So in the scheme of importance from 100 to 0, we’ll put New Jersey’s hot dog war between the world-famous hot dog mecca Rutt’s Hut and the upstart Mutt’s Hut at a 0.5 at best. Still, if a hot dog joint speaks to elusive warm-weather pleasures, and a legal battle over dopey names is easier on the brain than a nuclear meltdown, a few words on trademark law, deep-fried hot dogs and the Clifton Hot Dog War of 2011.Rutt’s Hut, as most New Jersey gourmands know, is on the long shortlist of the state’s esteemed hot dog palaces. It dates from 1928. Most people eat standing up at plain white linoleum counters in a squat, industrial-style brick building. The menu includes chili and fried calamari, but the main draw is the Ripper, a deep-fried hot dog cooked until the skin rips open. At its best, it seems vaguely radioactive — but in a good way. It is best eaten with an equally celebrated sweet relish made with cabbage, onions and carrots.Many New Jersey dog aficionados have other favorites: Charlie’s Famous in Kenilworth, Dickie Dee’s in Newark, Libby’s Lunch in Paterson, Galloping Hill Inn in Union, Jimmy Buff’s in West Orange, Hiram’s in Fort Lee, Johnny and Hanges in Fair Lawn among them. Still, the 2009 road food compendium, “500 Things to Eat Before It’s Too Late,” by Jane and Michael Stern, opined: “No hot dog lover can say his life is complete until he has dined at Rutt’s.”Mutt’s Hut, about five miles away and offering deli fare and grilled or boiled Sabrett hot dogs, is a good deal less celebrated. At the beginning of January, it was Adam’s Bagel and Deli, a name it still shares with Mutt’s Hutt, or Mutt’s Hut International, as the takeout menu grandly proclaims.A few days after the new Mutt’s Hut sign went up in January, Mutt’s received a letter from lawyers for Rutt’s Hut saying that the name Rutt’s Hut had a federal trademark and that the use of the name Mutt’s Hut “constitutes a willful, obvious and inexcusable infringement of our client’s intellectual property rights.” A second letter followed on Feb. 15, then a federal lawsuit on March 9 seeking damages and the removal of the name.'"
"'11-03-31,'0','Yemen, the poorest country in the Arab world, is not exactly a hotbed for business. But the demonstration has created a captive audience, or rather market, representing a wide range of society, if dominated by tribesmen from the countryside.One commonality: in a country with a 35 percent unemployment rate, many of those camped on the street here have no pressing need to be elsewhere. Some have found their inner entrepreneur. Mohamed Saleh, a skinny young man, sells Photoshopped images of Mr. Saleh for 20 cents each, one of the leader dressed as an American professional wrestler, another as Osama bin Laden. They are souvenirs of Yemen’s uprising against a man who has ruled the country for 32 years.“Of course business is good,” he said. “Many people want to buy these things.”Just down the street, Abdullah Majhady, 23, sells white headbands for 20 cents marked with the slogans and chants used here: “This is a youth revolution,” “I am the next martyr,” and a simple directive to Mr. Saleh, “Leave.”His business booms on Fridays, when even more people come to the protest for noon prayers. Many of them are working people from the capital, with a little more money for nonessentials. The headbands fly out by the score.“A new economy was created in this square,” said one student leader, Humaid Mansour, 25, who has been at the sit-in since mid-February.Carts selling egg sandwiches, corn on the cob and cucumbers are a short walk down from Mr. Majhady. Past that, a crowd of 100 men is an open-air stage, where activists make passionate speeches and recite revolutionary poetry. In the evening musicians perform songs, many with politically inspired lyrics. The young men dance.In a place where there are few recreational activities for the young, the carnival atmosphere is as unusual as the retail fever.There are touches of socialism, too. When night falls, volunteer members of a cleaning committee sweep through the sit-in area, including the line of portable toilets next to a makeshift medical clinic, setting everything to rights for another day of chanting and waiting.And however much money changes hands, the laws of supply and demand are not the only rules that apply to sellers and buyers.Shopkeepers, restaurant workers, vendors — all have been witnesses to the demonstration’s growth from a meager band of students to a mass of tens of thousands camped out day and night. Early on, they saw protesters beaten daily by plainclothes government supporters. Two Fridays ago, they saw snipers open fire. At least 50 people were killed.Abulaziz Sama pointed to the spot outside the cafeteria where he works. There, he said, a man was shot in the head by a sniper.“After that,” said Mr. Sama, “we closed the shop for the day.”'"
"'11-03-31,'0','Without a lot to discuss, talk naturally, or perhaps with a little prompting, turned toward the weather, long underwear, insulated batting gloves and sitting near the heaters on the bench. Asked how he prepared for playing in the cold, Jeter laughed.The idea of playing in a chilly rain did not excite Mark Teixeira. The good thing, he said, was that both teams have to play in it.“But anyone who’s ever played golf when it’s raining and windy, you take it inside and play cards in the clubhouse,” Teixeira said, adding that cold weather is much tougher on hitters than pitchers. “The ball doesn’t carry as well, you’re not going to be as loose, and every time you hit the ball off the end of the bat you feel like your hands are broken.”Teixeira and his teammates may have to get used to it. The forecast for the next several days does not call for much higher temperatures, and the team’s quirky early-season schedule is frontloaded with home games. Twelve of the Yankees’ first 15 games are in the Bronx, the only interruption being a weekend series in a potentially chillier clime: Boston.Through May 1, only 8 of the team’s first 28 games are on the road, and the 20 home games equal the number the Yankees are scheduled to play in August and September combined.Manager Joe Girardi said that so many late-season away games did not matter much — “Our club in the past has played well on the road, so that’s not a huge concern,” he said — but the early-season home games can create a problem if weather forces many cancellations.Swisher raised an eyebrow over the schedule.“We’re home the whole month of April, but then we have, like, nine home games in August?” Swisher said with an incredulous shrug. “Why would you do that? Why would you not start us off in warmer climates, and then once the Midwest and the East start warming up, play us there. Send us out west, send us down south, send us anywhere. But you’re going to put us here for a whole month?”The main difficulty for pitchers in the cold is maintaining a feel for the ball, so it does not begin to feel slippery, in Swisher’s phrase, “like a cue ball.”Phil Hughes, who will start the third game of the season on Sunday, acknowledged that the cold could be a factor in his using the pitch he worked hardest on in spring training: the changeup.“The first week of the season the adrenaline warms you up a little,” he said, “but it is a feel pitch, and if you can’t feel the baseball as well as you can in warm weather, it might be affected. That’s what these next couple of days are for, to get used to it, and hopefully by Sunday I’ll be all right.”Cue ball effect aside, generally the players seem to regard cold weather as a boon for pitchers as opposed to hitters.“Definitely pitchers,” Jeter said, “because pitchers are always moving.”“Pitchers, we dictate everything that’s going on,” he said. “You can get in on people’s hands.”He also made the point that before a pitcher enters the game, he warms up. “Even when it’s cold you’re working up a sweat,” he said. “We get hot just to come in.” Both starting pitchers, Verlander and the Yankees’ C. C. Sabathia, responded the same way — with a smile and a four-word sentence — when asked about playing in the cold. “Hitters don’t like it,” they said.Sabathia, the former Cleveland Indian, added: “I’m used to it, from pitching in Cleveland. I kind of like it.”Jeter said his least favorite of the elements was wind. “Windy is the toughest,” he said. “Wind makes it colder, plus you’ve got to throw into the wind, and hit into the wind. Wind complicates things.”Russell Martin, beginning his first season with the Yankees after playing in relatively sunny Los Angeles, said nobody had an advantage in the cold. It was bad for both the hitter and pitcher, he said.And then there was Mariano Rivera. You’d think, perhaps, that as a native Panamanian, Rivera, the Yanks’ nonpareil closer, would disdain low temperatures and say so. But asked if he preferred pitching in warm weather, what he disdained was the question.“What I prefer or don’t prefer, it don’t matter,” he said, speaking with characteristic quietude and gravitas. “It’s not going to change anything. We’re here. Whether it’s cold or warm, we have to live with it. We’re ready.”'"
"'11-03-31,'0','“It’s the story of his life,” said Matt Ramker, director of the Florida Rams, Rodriguez’s A.A.U. team. “He was always a kid they thought was too small, but he was tough as nails. He’s also ultraconfident. He doesn’t back down from anyone.”Rodriguez’s height is listed by V.C.U. as 5 feet 10 inches.“No, I’m not 5-8,” he said. “I take that to heart.”There is no questioning the size of Rodriguez’s heart.Reggie Kohn, Rodriguez’s coach for four seasons at Lake Howell High School, frequently plays three-on-three contests with his current and former players with one rule change: there is no out of bounds.“Whether it was a real game or just three-on-three, Joey was willing to dive headfirst into the bleachers,” Kohn said. “For a guy his size, you have to be tough. He has that willingness to fight for every possession and for every ball. His mind-set is ‘if there’s a loose ball, I’m getting it 100 percent of the time.’ Whether he has to push you into the bleachers or tackle someone. He’ll do whatever it takes.”Two years ago, Rodriguez wanted to return home to Orlando after the head coach who had recruited him, Anthony Grant, left for Alabama. Rodriguez decided to transfer to Division II Rollins College in neighboring Winter Park.“It was one of those things, kind of like when a girl breaks up with you: it has nothing to do with you — that’s what Joey told me — but it was,” V.C.U. Coach Shaka Smart said.Kohn, a four-year starter at South Florida, knows the demands and requirements of college basketball. He said he was in favor of Rodriguez’s returning home.“Life is about being happy,” Kohn said. “He wasn’t happy. College basketball is so demanding. I can’t imagine doing it and being unhappy. It must be miserable.”Rodriguez was at Rollins for one day, but he did not enroll. Smart received a call from Rodriguez’s father, Joe. After a brief conversation, Joe Rodriguez put his son on his cellphone.Smart related the conversation: “I said: ‘Joey we’d love to have you back. We believe in you, we think you’d be a great player here, but I’ve got to know that you have both feet in the circle if you do come back and you’re not going to look back over your shoulder.’ He said he would. And that was pretty much it.”Rodriguez said his V.C.U. teammates played a big part in his return.“They kept calling me and hitting me up,” he said. “I had friends in high school that were like, ‘what are you doing?’ I called Coach Smart back and he said I can come back. I’m grateful for that.”This season, Rodriguez is averaging 10.5 points a game and leads the team in assists and steals. In the Rams’ five N.C.A.A. tournament victories, he had 38 assists and only 10 turnovers while averaging 10.2 points.After the Rams defeated Florida State last week to advance to the regional final, Ramker, his former A.A.U. coach, sent Rodriguez a text message.“Are you happy you didn’t go to Rollins now?” Ramker wrote.Everyone it seems is happy about Rodriguez’s decision. Well, except, for Self, Hamilton, Painter, Thompson and O’Neill.'"
"'11-03-31,'0','There is clearly a double use of the word “epic,” said Tim Brosnan, executive vice president for business at Major League Baseball in New York, reflecting popular slang phrases like “Dude, this is epic,” as well as the idea that “there are stories that contribute to the epic nature of baseball and over the course of a season baseball has an epic sweep, if you will.”In another attempt to appeal to a more youthful audience, the campaign is changing the look of commercials and video clips. Formerly, spots celebrated the charms of baseball as a sport by offering glimpses of in-game action. The new commercials, on TV and online, offer humorous vignettes of popular players. In one spot, viewers are invited to visit the microsite for “a journey inside” the bushy beard of the reliever Brian Wilson of the San Francisco Giants.In a second commercial, the pitcher Felix Hernandez of the Seattle Mariners, who won the Cy Young Award last year, is shown winning all the stuffed animals at the Milk Jug Toss booth at a carnival. The carny inside the booth, disgusted, pulls the plug — literally — on the pitcher.In a third spot, Ubaldo Jiménez, a pitcher for the Colorado Rockies, browses the racks of miniature souvenir license plates at a gift shop but — surprise! — cannot find one that reads “Ubaldo.” A teammate frets, “The bus is waiting,” but Mr. Jiménez asks, “Do you have any more in the back?”Major League Baseball sponsors and partners like Pepsi-Cola and Fox Broadcasting have long centered campaigns on star players. So, too, have leagues for other sports like basketball and football; for example, a fanciful new “time travel” campaign for the National Basketball Association features players like Steve Nash.But M.L.B. has shied from that because far more players have local or regional profiles than national stature.“I’ve always been a proponent of emphasizing the personalities of the athletes,” said Bob Dorfman, executive creative director at Baker Street Advertising in San Francisco, who tracks the value of players as endorsers.“There aren’t as many big, national names in baseball because you tend to root for your local team,” Mr. Dorfman said, “but it makes sense to have fun with players, try to make them more attractive, so maybe you’ll get out to a game you wouldn’t otherwise see.”As for seeking younger fans to fill seats at ball parks, Mr. Dorfman said: “That’s a problem baseball has had, the aging of its market, the idea that the game is too slow for the social media generation. It’s worth trying to get that teenage and 20-something audience to think that baseball is cool.”Mr. Brosnan said that “the commitment we ask our fans to make is pretty intense,” and millions say yes each season.“We want to be a part of the discussion at the digital water cooler, day in and day out, with a younger demo than we’ve targeted in our advertising before,” Mr. Brosnan said. “And the nature of this campaign is to help them spread the word.”Hill, Holliday landed the M.L.B. account last fall after the league parted ways with its previous creative agency, McCann Erickson Worldwide in New York, part of the McCann Worldgroup unit of Interpublic.“When we pitched the business, the approach we took was that baseball has all the qualities for the modern entertainment era,” said Karen Kaplan, president at Hill, Holliday, because like the Harry Potter books and movies, “Lost” and “Mad Men,” baseball has “long-running story arcs, legends, back stories, rivalries and sprawling casts of characters, heroic characters you should be interested in, even if they don’t play for your team.”“Some things people might consider liabilities are actually assets,” she said.The focus on players “drives engagement,” Ms. Kaplan said, by capitalizing on them as “content engines,” providing grist for the social media mill with comments and videos to be shared through social networks.That is also the idea behind the MLB Fan Cave, developed by Hill, Holliday; Endemol USA; and Major League Baseball. Mike O’Hara, 37, and Ryan Wagner, 25, will watch the 2011 baseball season unfold from the old Tower Records store at East Fourth Street and Broadway in Manhattan, sharing their thoughts through Twitter (@MLBFanCave), a blog on mlb.com, Facebook, video clips and appearances on the MLB Network cable channel.The campaign will also appear on the MLB Network, Fox, ESPN and TBS, along with related Web sites.The start of the new season is bringing other baseball-related campaigns that speak with hipper voices.Old Style beer, sold by the Pabst Brewing Company, is introducing a campaign by Scott & Victor in Chicago that plays up the brand’s sponsorship of the Chicago Cubs and its bottles designed to resemble bats.The ads carry cheeky headlines like “Crack a bat,” “Tossed back by Cubs fans for 61 years” and, referring to Wrigley Field, “We were there when the ivy wall was more wall than ivy.”And StubHub, the online ticket reseller, is bringing out a campaign by Duncan/Channon in San Francisco that includes its first national TV commercials.In one spot, as an organ plays “Take Me Out to the Ball Game,” young men romp through a fantasy field of dreams; after a team mascot helps one catch a fly, he lands on grass carpeted with hot dogs.'"
"'11-03-31,'0','Others see the camp as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic standoff between Italy and France, the former colonial power in Tunisia and the place where most of the Tunisians say they want to go.Under European Union law, the country where immigrants arrive is responsible for determining their status. Italy has argued that it should not bear the brunt of the new arrivals just because it is so close to North Africa. In a television interview on Wednesday, the Italian foreign minister, Franco Frattini, criticized France for its “lack of solidarity” after it returned more than 500 immigrants to Italy after they were caught trying to cross the border into France.“It’s a political statement to France: ‘You want to start the war in Libya? We’ll give you immigrants,’ ” said Tonio Tondo, a journalist following the immigration situation for the daily La Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno. Italy, which colonized Libya in the early 20th century, stands to lose billions in investments there because of the allied intervention. Italy is taking part in the mission, but it was championed by France.Here in Manduria, officials seem nonchalant about the escapes. Asked why the Italian authorities appeared to do so little to stop the immigrants’ jumping the fence, Giuseppe Caruso, the police chief of Palermo and the special commissioner for the immigration emergency, asked rhetorically: “What should we do? Should we shoot them?”But the camp is rapidly emerging as a problem. The town’s residents protested on Wednesday, calling for it to be closed because so many immigrants had escaped. Then both the mayor and Italy’s deputy interior minister, Alfredo Mantovano, tendered their resignations after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said in a visit to Lampedusa on Wednesday that an additional 1,400 immigrants would be brought to Manduria. On Monday, Mr. Mantovano had pledged that the camp would not hold more than 1,500 people.With its neat rows of blue tents on freshly laid gravel, and dozens of uniformed officials, the camp shows the power of the Italian state. But it also reveals its fissures. The camp is a legal no-man’s land. The new arrivals’ status — are they illegal immigrants, refugees or asylum seekers? — is uncertain, making it nearly impossible for the Italian authorities to process, repatriate or detain them.Before the influx began in January, bringing about 18,000 people through Lampedusa, the immigrants who arrived there were held on the island for a few days before being sent to formal immigration or asylum centers on the mainland. The Interior Ministry says those centers are now almost full as Italy struggles with a bureaucratic backlog.Under Italian law, immigrants can be held for up to 180 days to determine their status, and much longer if they are seeking asylum. If their arrival is deemed to be illegal, and they would not be subject to persecution in their home countries, they can be sent home. But Italy’s repatriation accords with Tunisia and Libya have broken down.“We’re waiting for a directive,” said Antonio Calcagni, the chief of the immigration office at the Police Department in the nearby port city of Taranto, as he stood outside the Manduria camp. “Different countries are working on it,” he added.The immigrants have grown frustrated, too. “We’ve been here for three days,” said Omar Naim, 24, a Tunisian, as he peered through the fence. “They haven’t done anything for us.”Italian officials traveled last week to Tunisia, which still lacks a functioning government, to persuade the authorities there to honor the repatriation accords.“What’s the legal status of the camp? That’s a good question,” said Nichi Vendola, the president of the Puglia region and a leading member of the center-left opposition. “Is it a place for determining who is an illegal immigrant? A place to receive asylum seekers? A hybrid place?” He added, “The confusion is the fruit of the ideological prejudices of the Northern League, which dominates the Berlusconi government.”That party, the most powerful in the governing center-right coalition, has long drawn on fears of illegal immigration. Asked on Tuesday what should be done about the immigrants, the Northern League’s colorful leader, Umberto Bossi, used a phrase that politely translates as “get them out of our faces.”The interior minister, Roberto Maroni, a member of the Northern League, has been more diplomatic, but has repeatedly said the European Union has abandoned Italy. The Italian government is not alone in seeking a more coordinated European response. Laura Boldrini, spokeswoman for the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Italy, said it was important to distinguish between the “economic migrants” from Tunisia who were seeking work in Europe and those fleeing the fighting in Libya.“In the event of a mass influx of asylum seekers from Libya, the U.N.H.C.R. recommends that member states receive them and give them temporary protection,” Ms. Boldrini said. “It would be good to have a positive sign from Europe,” she added. “That could also help reduce tensions and calm down tones in Italy.”Back in Manduria, as bulldozers worked the ground and trucks carted in generators, the camp seemed increasingly less temporary. Mr. Calcagni, the immigration chief for the Taranto police, looking resigned, cited an often-used Italian saying: “There’s nothing more definitive than something provisional.”'"
"'11-03-31,'0','Your editorial “Natural Gas and Clean Water” is on target, but lacks a solid rationale for banning hydraulic fracturing in two of New York’s watersheds but not all. The implication that a high population should exclude an area from risks associated with new energy development is poor policy, since it is those very millions who represent the demand for more energy.Even your urban readers might agree that it would be difficult to justify a policy in which rural New Yorkers assume all the risks of new energy development in order to meet the energy demands of population centers like New York City.You argue that the issue is not whether the country should be drilling for natural gas, but rather whether it can be done safely using hydraulic fracturing. We agree, but we also believe that more than one million wells that have been drilled using hydraulic fracturing over the past six decades offer an emphatic answer to that question. Yes, it can.Under state regulation, which we support, hydraulic fracturing can continue to provide American consumers with the clean-burning natural gas they will need for decades to come. And it can continue doing so without harming drinking water supplies. Our environment is important, and that’s why we support vigorous state regulation and disclosure of the materials used in fracturing.But we cannot let unfounded fears about hydraulic fracturing deprive us of the domestic natural gas production that would be lost if hydraulic fracturing were to be banned or severely restricted — particularly in light of recent developments in Japan and the Middle East. Nor can we let exaggerated suspicions deprive the people of New York, Pennsylvania and other states of the hundreds of thousands of jobs that drilling in the Marcellus Shale is expected to generate.The Maryland House of Delegates recently passed what would be the country’s strictest law regulating hydraulic fracturing for natural gas. The bill needs Senate approval, and the governor has expressed his support.The comprehensive bill requires a scientific finding that hydraulic fracturing is not harmful to humans or the environment before any drilling takes place. It sets a reasonable time frame (two years) for completion of a state study; the federal Environmental Protection Agency is also studying the issue.It takes time to determine whether an invasive process with the potential to destroy drinking water resources is not only profitable for industry and the large landowners it relies on but also safe. Wouldn’t it be foolish to do it any other way?'"
"'11-03-31,'0','Mr. Gelb said in his statement that it would be premature to decide now whether to proceed with the opera company’s trip because the situation could change “for better or for worse” in the eight weeks before the company is to depart. “If the State Department continues to warn at that time that travel to Japan is not advisable, we will, of course, cancel the tour,” he said.The State Department’s travel advisory on Wednesday “strongly urges U.S. citizens to defer travel to Japan at this time and those in Japan should consider departing.”Alan S. Gordon, national executive director of the American Guild of Musical Artists, the union representing many in the opera company, said: “Singers are concerned about going and taking their families. We’ll have to wait and see what happens. I’m assuming some people will simply decide they can’t personally go.”Marvis Martin, a soprano in the Met chorus, said in an interview that she thought the trip would put a lot of people at risk. “There still is a little time,” she said, “and I’m hoping that the strategy is they’re just waiting to the last possible minute, hoping the Japanese will cancel, so we won’t have to. I don’t want to put my health at risk, and I think my call would be to say, ‘No, I’m sorry, I can’t go.’ But at this point I’m proceeding like I’m going, just like the Met is.”The Met’s music director, James Levine, is to conduct two of the tour’s three fully-staged operas: Puccini’s “Bohème” and Verdi’s “Don Carlo.” Donizetti’s “Lucia di Lammermoor” is to be conducted by Gianandrea Noseda. A Met spokesman said that Mr. Levine was not available to discuss the trip. But his manager, Ronald Wilford, said: “Whatever the Met decides, he will do. If the Met administration believes it can go to Japan and not risk things, then he will go, I think. I haven’t talked to him about it, and I’m not going to.”The Met would not disclose how much was financially at stake if the tour is cancelled. The trip, announced in November 2009, is to include 13 performances involving more than 350 solo singers, orchestra, chorus, ballet, and administrative and technical staff. The star singers scheduled to appear include Ildar Abdrazakov, Piotr Beczala, Olga Borodina, Joseph Calleja, Diana Damrau, Barbara Frittoli, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Jonas Kaufmann, Mariusz Kwiecien, Zeljko Lucic, Anna Netrebko, René Pape and Susanna Phillips.After Nagoya the company is to move to Tokyo for performances at the Bunka Kaikan theater and NHK Hall. The concert halls are about 170 miles from Fukushima, where nuclear reactors were damaged by the earthquake.The Met’s first Japan tour was in 1975, and the most recent was in 2006. The tour’s lead sponsor is the KDDI Corporation, a telecommunications company based in Japan. The Met’s transmissions of live performances into movie theaters have been shown regularly in Japan since the series began in 2006.A spokeswoman for the Japanese Consulate in New York, Naoko Kawaguchi, said she was unaware of any cultural group cancelling a visit to Japan. Areas away from the reactors are safe, she said, and “life in Tokyo is as it was before.”Kelly Ryan, a spokeswoman for American Ballet Theater, which is scheduled to perform in Tokyo in July, said the company was monitoring the situation. “At this time we feel it’s premature to make a decision either way,” she said.Japan Arts, the tour presenter, could not be reached for comment. But on its Web site it says it brings the world’s leading orchestras, opera companies and dance companies to Japan “based on the conviction that experiencing the power of true artistry gives human beings a zest for life.”The guitarist Slash left Japan shortly after his March concert in Osaka but went on Twitter immediately after the show: “Great gig in Osaka tonight. Great spirits, despite all that has happened.”'"
"'11-03-31,'0','But if there is less embarrassment and shame, as Mr. Perelman and others argue, why now?That seems to depend on which Mexico one sees: the romantic, or the dismal.Demographers — optimists in this case — see links between coupling and economics. Several studies have shown that compared with a generation ago, Mexicans are having more sex at younger ages, a trend that generally tracks with Mexican economic expansion. Sex and affection, some Mexican demographers argue, tend to be signs of confidence, expressions of faith that opportunities await.Salaries and culture also intertwine. Mexico’s growth has created a larger middle class that — in addition to opening up the country’s political process — has made technology and international media more accessible. The hookups on “Jersey Shore,” for instance, are now just as easy to see here as in Miami, while pornography can be downloaded at public parks with Wi-Fi.The so-called love hotels, where local couples have canoodled for decades, can no longer keep sexuality hidden. “They see it all on TV or the Internet, so they no longer feel they are the only ones doing it,” Mr. Perelman said.And, as Mr. Ruiz put it, “We don’t care as much about what other people think.”Clearly, that seemed to be the case for a teenager at a mall recently, with his lips ardently attached to, of all things, the knee of his girlfriend; or for the man on a busy corner an hour later, passionately kissing a woman while wrapping his leg around her like an ivy vine.But Mr. Ruiz and Ms. Villafuerte, who are both 40, may be more typical. They met three months ago while selling hats in an outdoor plaza, and in a year when the Mexican economy is expected to grow by 4 percent, after growing by 5.5 percent last year, they said they had taken an afternoon off to spend time together because they could afford to.Neither looked particularly sensual. Mr. Ruiz wore round glasses below a shiny balding head; Ms. Villafuerte’s blue eyeliner was her only hint of provocation. But they both said that their affection reflected a positive shift.“When we were young, people would point and gawk at you for this kind of thing,” Mr. Ruiz said. “Now, there’s more acceptance.”Pride may be a better term. Two years ago, Mexico City actually beat the world record for simultaneous smooching when 39,897 people locked lips downtown.Other couples, however, described public affection in more ominous terms. Mexico these days is essentially Jekyll and Hyde: positive economic growth is paired with a sprawling war on drug cartels that has claimed 34,000 lives since 2006.For people like Paulina Pérez, 26, who was sitting on her boyfriend’s lap during a break from in-line skating in the upscale neighborhood of Polanco, public affection reflects not a spike in happiness, but rather a deficit of trust.Mexicans, she said, have always drawn a line between formal relationships and relationships with those inside “their circle of confidence.” Hugs, kisses and warmth color the latter, while handshakes and a polite distance dominate the former.This is generally what makes amorous Mexican couples stand out. “Public displays of affection draw attention precisely because of the disconnect with the general culture,” said Rubén Gallo, who edited The Mexico City Reader, a chronicle of the capital.But the gap between the social spheres seems to be widening. While drug-related violence has made Mexicans more afraid of strangers, it has intensified their closest bonds, Ms. Pérez said. So the affection that looks to some like an opening — a more honest account of sexuality — may actually be, for others, a reflection of turning inward to fight off despair.“Affection is a way to forget,” Ms. Pérez said. “You forget your problems, and you live.”Her boyfriend, tapping her behind, said he agreed.'"
"'11-03-31,'0','Pro football may be the nation’s top spectator sport, but serious baseball nerds are the most frightening fans in the country.I’m not talking about the Bleacher Creatures at Yankee Stadium. When it comes to inebriated rowdiness, football fans are unsurpassed. (I went to several Eagles games at the old Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, including the final one played there, so I know from rowdy.)But drunken crowds don’t scare me. The guy I find terrifying is that geeky-looking dude in the stands — or, even scarier, on his couch at home — who keeps a scorecard to tally every play. Home runs, strikes and runs batted in aren’t enough for him. Oh no. This guy wants to talk about WHIP, O.P.S., WARP, DIPS, LIPS and VORP. I’m not joking; those are all actual baseball statistics for the committed (if you know what I mean).He probably doesn’t think of himself as, say, a Kansas City Royals fan, but he can tell you what’s going on with the Royals’ farm system. You know your wife’s birthday; he knows who led the National League in batting average in the late 1970s.God bless him. He may be a little scary, but at least he’s passionate about something. So Thursday, the opening of the 2011 Major League Baseball season, is like a national holiday for this guy. And thankfully a new baseball video game is available to satisfy even this most obsessed fanatic: MLB 11: The Show, made by Sony for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. (I used the PS3 version.)To be honest, this incarnation of The Show intimidated me a little. There are so many options and so much detail in every aspect of the game that I quickly began to suffer paralysis by analysis. “So wait,” I found myself thinking, “If I don’t study every opposing batter and adjust my fielder’s positioning every pitch according to both the opponents’ tendencies and the particular game situation, am I going to suffer?”'"
"'11-03-31,'0','WASHINGTON — The Central Intelligence Agency has inserted clandestine operatives into Libya to gather intelligence for military airstrikes and to contact and vet the beleaguered rebels battling Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi ’s forces, according to American officials.While President Obama has insisted that no American military ground troops participate in the Libyan campaign, small groups of C.I.A. operatives have been working in Libya for several weeks as part of a shadow force of Westerners that the Obama administration hopes can help bleed Colonel Qaddafi’s military, the officials said.In addition to the C.I.A. presence, composed of an unknown number of Americans who had worked at the spy agency’s station in Tripoli and others who arrived more recently, current and former British officials said that dozens of British special forces and MI6 intelligence officers are working inside Libya. The British operatives have been directing airstrikes from British jets and gathering intelligence about the whereabouts of Libyan government tank columns, artillery pieces and missile installations, the officials said.American officials hope that similar information gathered by American intelligence officers — including the location of Colonel Qaddafi’s munitions depots and the clusters of government troops inside towns — might help weaken Libya’s military enough to encourage defections within its ranks.In addition, the American spies are meeting with rebels to try to fill in gaps in understanding who their leaders are and the allegiances of the groups opposed to Colonel Qaddafi, said United States government officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the classified nature of the activities.  American officials cautioned, though, that the Western operatives were not directing the actions of rebel forces.The United States and its allies have been scrambling to gather detailed information on the location and abilities of Libyan infantry and armored forces that normally takes months of painstaking analysis.“We didn’t have great data,” Gen. Carter F. Ham, who handed over control of the Libya mission to NATO on Wednesday, said in an e-mail last week.   “Libya hasn’t been a country we focused on a lot over past few years.”Several weeks ago, President Obama signed a secret finding authorizing the C.I.A. to provide arms and other support to Libyan rebels, American officials said Wednesday. But weapons have not yet been shipped into Libya, as Obama administration officials debate the effects of giving them to the rebel groups. The presidential finding was first reported by Reuters.In a statement released Wednesday evening, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, declined to comment “on intelligence matters,” but he said that no decision had yet been made to provide arms to the rebels.Representative Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who leads the House Intelligence Committee, said Wednesday that he opposed arming the rebels. “We need to understand more about the opposition before I would support passing out guns and advanced weapons to them,” Mr. Rogers said in a statement.Because the publicly stated goal of the Libyan campaign is not explicitly to overthrow Colonel Qaddafi’s government, the clandestine war now going on is significantly different from the Afghan campaign to drive the Taliban from power in 2001. Back then, American C.I.A. and Special Forces troops worked alongside Afghan militias, armed them and called in airstrikes that paved the rebel advances on strategically important cities like Kabul and Kandahar.In recent weeks, the American military has been monitoring Libyan troops with U-2 spy planes and a high-altitude Global Hawk drone, as well as a special aircraft, JSTARS, that tracks the movements of large groups of troops.  Military officials said that the Air Force also has Predator drones, similar to those now operating in Afghanistan, in reserve.Air Force RC-135 Rivet Joint eavesdropping planes intercept communications from Libyan commanders and troops and relay that information to the Global Hawk, which zooms in on the location of armored forces and determines rough coordinates. The Global Hawk sends the coordinates to analysts at a ground station, who pass the information to command centers for targeting. The command center beams the coordinates to an E-3 Sentry Awacs command-and-control plane, which in turn directs warplanes to their targets.Lt. Gen. David A. Deptula, who recently retired as the Air Force’s top intelligence official, said that Libya’s flat desert terrain and clear weather have allowed warplanes with advanced sensors to hunt Libyan armored columns with relative ease, day or night, without the need for extensive direction from American troops on the ground.But if government troops advance into or near cities in along the country’s eastern coast, which so far have been off-limits to coalition aircraft for fear of causing civilian casualties, General Deptula said that ground operatives would be particularly helpful in providing target coordinates or pointing them out to pilots with hand-held laser designators.The C.I.A. and British intelligence services were intensely focused on Libya eight years ago, before and during the successful effort to get Colonel Qaddafi to give up his nuclear weapons program. He agreed to do so in the fall of 2003, and allowed C.I.A. and other American nuclear experts into the country to assess Libya’s equipment and bomb designs and to arrange for their transfer out of the country.Once the weapons program was eliminated, a former American official said, intelligence agencies shifted their focus away from Libya. But as Colonel Qaddafi began his recent crackdown on the rebel groups, the American spy agencies have worked to rekindle ties to Libyan informants and to learn more about the country’s military leaders.A former British government official who is briefed on current operations confirmed media reports that dozens of British Special Forces soldiers, from the elite Special Air Service and Special Boat Service units, are on the ground across Libya. The British soldiers have been particularly focused on finding the locations of Colonel Qaddafi’s Russian-made surface-to-air missiles.A spokesman for Britain’s Ministry of Defense declined to comment, citing a policy not to discuss the operations of British Special Forces.'"
"'11-03-31,'0','In the excerpt, Mr. Allen also takes swipes at Steven A. Ballmer, whom Mr. Gates recruited as Microsoft’s first business manager in 1980 and who replaced Mr. Gates as chief executive in 2000.Mr. Allen writes that in December 1982, after he learned he had Hodgkin’s lymphoma, he overheard Mr. Gates and Mr. Ballmer plotting to rob him of his due.“They were bemoaning my recent lack of production and discussing how they might dilute my Microsoft equity by issuing options to themselves and other shareholders,” Mr. Allen said.Mr. Allen said he burst into the room and confronted the two men, shouting: “This is unbelievable! It shows your true character, once and for all.”Mr. Allen said that they later apologized, but that he had already decided to leave the company. The book, “Idea Man: A Memoir by the Co-Founder of Microsoft,” is to be published by Portfolio/Penguin, an imprint of Penguin Group USA.In a statement, Mr. Gates said: “While my recollection of many of these events may differ from Paul’s, I value his friendship and the important contributions he made to the world of technology and at Microsoft.” A Microsoft spokesman said Mr. Ballmer declined to comment.Mr. Allen, through a spokesman, declined to comment. The spokesman, David Postman, said the memoir was not meant to be an attack on Mr. Gates. “We are going to let the excerpt that is out there stand, and hope that people take the time to read the book and get the full picture,” he said.The bitterness and sense of betrayal echo more recent complaints against Mark Zuckerberg, the youthful founder of Facebook, by Eduardo Saverin, a Facebook co-founder and Mr. Zuckerberg’s Harvard roommate, over Mr. Saverin’s reduced role and diminished stake in the company.In a series of recollections that paint Mr. Gates in an unflattering light, Mr. Allen said that after he decided to leave, Mr. Gates made a “lowball” offer of $5 a share for Mr. Allen’s stake in Microsoft. Mr. Allen asked for at least $10 a share, and Mr. Gates refused. That decision eventually turned Mr. Allen into a billionaire.“From the time we’d started together in Massachusetts, I’d assumed that our partnership would be a 50-50 proposition,” Mr. Allen wrote earlier in the excerpt. “But Bill had another idea.”During Microsoft’s early years, Mr. Gates pressured Mr. Allen to reduce his stake to 40 percent and later 36 percent as Mr. Gates’s own stake rose to 60 and then 64 percent, Mr. Allen wrote. “Bill knew that I would balk at a two-to-one split, and that 64 percent was as far as he could go,” he wrote.Stephen Manes, co-author of the book “Gates: How Microsoft’s Mogul Reinvented an Industry — and Made Himself the Richest Man in America,” said that much of what Mr. Allen recounts in the excerpt, including the fact that his ownership of Microsoft was reduced significantly, was reported in his book and others. He also said that while Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen collaborated closely, the two often argued vociferously.“People told us about shouting matches,” Mr. Manes said. “There was an epic one that began in the office, continued in the elevator and went on in the parking lot for half an hour.”After leaving Microsoft, Mr. Allen, who is 58, became known as one of the most aggressive investors in technology, though his record has been mixed. He is also the owner of the Seattle Seahawks and the Portland Trail Blazers.People who know the two men said that they had remained friends until recently, and that Mr. Gates visited Mr. Allen frequently two years ago, when he was recovering from chemotherapy to treat non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.“Paul is a creative, charming and likable person,” said Carl Stork, who worked at Microsoft from 1981 to 2002 and held several executive positions. “I don’t know what Paul is trying to accomplish by trying to take something away from Bill. I am puzzled and disappointed.”'"
"'11-03-31,'0','Mr. Assad, 45, has stayed out of sight for the past two weeks, during the most severe unrest the country has experienced in decades. That is a classic tactic for authoritarian leaders who want to heighten anticipation and appear indifferent to public pressure, political analysts said.But expectations had been raised that he would call for an end to the emergency law and to his ’s monopoly on power, or at least a transition to a multiparty state. His own aides, and others close to the leadership, said the speech would offer historic proposals.Those promises now appear to have been the wishful thinking by the aides, including his chief media adviser, Bouthaina Shaaban. Or they were part of a rhetorical bait and switch, a common practice of the Syrian government to offer and not deliver, analysts said. In reality, Mr. Assad has little room to maneuver without undermining his leadership. If he allows free speech, the demonstrations will only grow; if he ends the Baath Party’s rule, it is likely to lose an election.What the speech did accomplish was to explode a narrative that had been written about the president since he took office 11 years ago: that his efforts at reform were being blocked by holdovers from the era of his father, .“He was trying to show that he was in control, and that the stage of hope was over,” said Rime Allaf, an associate fellow at House, a research group. “ ‘We are just as strong as we always were, and you can do what you want, it will not change anything.’ That was the message.” Analysts said the president may also have been confident because the protests had not turned into a national movement and did not involve Damascus, the capital.The speech was unusually brief for Mr. Assad, who often gives ponderous and lengthy remarks in the tone of a university professor. He acknowledged that some of the public’s demands were legitimate, but said that for years reforms were stalled by circumstances beyond his control.He also said it took time to carry out changes properly. That apparently did not take into account the speed with which Parliament changed the Constitution in order for Mr. Assad to become president. He was 34 when his father died, but the Constitution said no one under 40 could serve as president. Within a day, the age limit was changed to accommodate Mr. Assad.As the president arrived at the Parliament building on Wednesday, a crowd chanted “Allah, Syria and Bashar.” When he entered the chamber, legislators stood up and shouted, “The people want Bashar al-Assad.”It was unclear how most Syrians would receive Mr. Assad’s speech.
