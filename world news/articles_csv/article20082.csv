"'08-02-01,'1','Mr. Ballmer said he had decided to pursue a takeover because friendly deal negotiations would most likely be protracted and would probably become public.“These things are hard to keep quiet in the best of times,” he said. He said his conversation with Mr. Yang was constructive, but suggested that a deal may not come easily.Yahoo said in a news release Friday that its board would evaluate Microsoft’s bid “carefully and promptly in the context of Yahoo’s strategic plans.”In a letter to Yahoo’s board, Mr. Ballmer wrote that the two companies discussed a possible merger, as well as other ways to work together, in late 2006 and 2007. Mr. Ballmer said that in February 2007, Yahoo decided to end the merger discussions because its board was confident in the company’s “potential upside.”“A year has gone by, and the competitive situation has not improved,” Mr. Ballmer wrote.As a result, he said, “while a commercial partnership may have made sense at one time, Microsoft believes that the only alternative now is the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo that we are proposing.”Mr. Ballmer met several times in late 2006 and 2007 with , then Yahoo’s chief executive, people involved in the talks said. While the talks — originally focused on the prospect of a merger or a joint venture — were initially constructive and appeared to move forward, they quickly broke down, these people said.After a series of secret meetings between both sides in hotels around and elsewhere, Mr. Semel and Yahoo’s board decided against progressing with the talks, betting that its stock would turn around as it introduced a new advertising system called , these people said. Mr. Yang, in particular, was adamantly against selling the company to Microsoft and championed the view of remaining independent, they added.Mr. Ballmer constantly consulted with , the Microsoft chairman, about the progress of the negotiations, people close to the company said, and when the talks collapsed, he decided to wait to see the fate of Yahoo’s stock price. As the stock continued to fall, they said, Microsoft’s management became emboldened and began internal meeting in late 2007 about the prospect of making a hostile bid.Despite their heavy investments in online services, both Yahoo and Microsoft have watched Google extend its dominance over Internet search and the lucrative online advertising business that goes along with it.“No one can compete with Google on their own any more,” said Jon Miller, the former chairman and chief executive of . “There has to be consolidation among the major players. It has been a long time coming, and now it is here.”In recent months, Yahoo has struggled to develop a plan to turn around the company under Mr. Yang, its co-founder, who was appointed chief executive amid growing shareholder dissatisfaction last June.Yahoo investors, however, remain skeptical. The company’s shares have slumped, and the closing price on Thursday was 44 percent below its 52-week high.Yahoo’s shares closed Friday up 48 percent, to $28.38. Microsoft’s shares were down nearly 7 percent, and Google’s shares declined nearly 9 percent.Microsoft, like Yahoo, has faced an uphill battle against Google. The company invested heavily to build its own search engine and advertising technology. Last year, it spent $6 billion to acquire the online advertising specialist . Microsoft’s online services unit has been growing, but remains unprofitable.Meanwhile, Google’s share of the search market and of the overall online advertising business has continued to grow.Announcing its quarterly earnings earlier this week, Yahoo said it would cut 1,000 jobs in an effort to refocus the company and reduce spending, and issued an outlook for 2008 that disappointed investors.The timing of Microsoft’s bid could allow the company to mount a proxy contest for control of Yahoo’s board should it try to dismiss the offer. Microsoft has discussed the prospect of mounting such a campaign, people close to the company said, and has until March 13 to propose a slate.In his letter to Yahoo’s board, Mr. Ballmer wrote, “Depending on the nature of your response, Microsoft reserves the right to pursue all necessary steps to ensure that Yahoo’s shareholders are provided with the opportunity to realize the value inherent in our proposal.”On Thursday night, Yahoo announced that Mr. Semel, its nonexecutive chairman and former chief executive, was leaving the board. Under Mr. Semel, a long-time Hollywood studio executive who ran Yahoo from 2001 to 2007, the company became more focused on its advertising and media businesses, but was unable to keep up with Google’s challenge in Web search and advertising and with the rise of social networking sites such as and .A longtime board member, Roy J. Bostock, has been named nonexecutive chairman, Yahoo said.Microsoft said it believes the Yahoo transaction could receive the necessary regulatory approvals in time to close by the second half of this year.'"
"'08-02-01,'1','SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft said Friday that it has made an offer to buy Yahoo for about $44.6 billion, or $31 a share, in a mix of cash and stock.The offer represents a 62 percent premium over Yahoo’s closing stock price of $19.18 on Thursday.If consummated, the deal would redraw the competitive landscape of the Internet consumer services business, where both Microsoft and Yahoo have struggled to compete with Google.Microsoft said the combination of the two companies would create efficiencies that would save approximately $1 billion annually. The software giant also said that it has an integration plan to include employees of both companies and intends to offer incentives to retain Yahoo employees.""We have great respect for Yahoo!, and together we can offer an increasingly exciting set of solutions for consumers, publishers and advertisers while becoming better positioned to compete in the online services market,"" said Steven A.

"'08-02-01,'1','The day that Cesar Rodriguez was charged in the beating death of his 7-year-old stepdaughter, Nixzmary Brown, he was questioned by a series of police officers and prosecutors.But at least the first two officers who asked him about Nixzmary’s death did not read him his right to remain silent, the officers testified. Mr. Rodriguez’s lawyer, Jeffrey T. Schwartz, said outside court on Thursday that even the detective who eventually elicited a written statement from Mr. Rodriguez, who is scheduled to testify Friday, did not read Mr. Rodriguez his rights until he had questioned him for half an hour.Mr. Schwartz is arguing that the delay in reading Mr. Rodriguez his rights denied him timely access to a lawyer and showed sloppy work by the police. In his statement Mr. Rodriguez admitted that he severely beat Nixzmary the night she died, but his lawyer contends that Nixzmary’s mother actually dealt the fatal blow. “Cesar Rodriguez did not have one constitutional right that they did not violate,” he told reporters in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on Thursday after an officer who was on the scene, Frank Gallagher, said under cross-examination that he never heard the first two officers who spoke to Mr. Rodriguez read him his rights. Those two officers said earlier in the trial that they did not read Mr. Rodriguez his rights because he was not in custody and spoke voluntarily.Mr. Schwartz had attempted to block the jury from hearing all of Mr. Rodriguez’s statements, arguing that the police intimidated him and that he was not read his rights soon enough. But the justice in the case, L. Priscilla Hall, ruled before the trial that when Mr. Rodriguez spoke to the police before he was read his rights, he was not under arrest and under no pressure to answer questions. The jury may draw its own conclusions.Mr. Rodriguez, 29, of Brooklyn, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of Nixzmary, who died starved and battered on Jan. 11, 2006. Her mother, Nixzaliz Santiago, faces a separate trial on the same charge.'"
"'08-02-01,'1','Mr. Romney has sought to frame himself as the true conservative and has said repeatedly that Mr. McCain’s most notable accomplishments involve leadership “for liberal causes.” At a rally Thursday in Fountain Valley, attended by several hundred people who spilled outside of a furniture warehouse, Mr. Romney described the contest as a “battle for the heart of the Republican Party.”Mr. Romney is also helped by California’s complex primary rules. Only Republicans may vote in the Republican primary, meaning that Mr. McCain will not be able to count on votes from independents and Democrats that he drew in states like New Hampshire and Michigan. In addition, the Republican Party awards three delegates to the winner of each Congressional district, no matter how many Republicans reside there.The result is that Mr. McCain could rack up large margins of moderate Republican votes in urban areas along the coast, particularly in Los Angeles and San Francisco, but still find himself competing with Mr. Romney for delegates in conservative Orange County and the state’s rural areas.“What you have to do is balance McCain’s momentum, his forcefulness on defense issues and his name ID against Romney’s born-again conservatism,” said Philip J. Trounstine, the director of the Survey and Policy Research Institute at San Jose State University, the former political editor of The San Jose Mercury News and the communications director to former Gov. Gray Davis. The race, he said, “is up for grabs.”The two men’s clashes at a raucous Republican debate on Wednesday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley bore out that calculation.Mr. Romney seemed to take pains Thursday to avoid getting into another bitter back and forth with Mr. McCain but did deliver a barb with his comment about Nixon, which he made at a news conference in Long Beach in reference to Mr. McCain’s claim — widely labeled as misleading by news organizations — that Mr. Romney once favored a timetable for withdrawing American troops from Iraq. Democrats favor such a timetable, but it is anathema to Republican candidates who support the war.Mr. Romney said that Mr. McCain’s claim was “reminiscent of the Nixon era” and that “I don’t think I want to see our party go back to that kind of campaigning.”Steve Schmidt, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain, responded to Mr. Romney by saying, “When you get into a hole of the size he finds himself in, it’s not surprising to see him lashing out.”The highlight of Mr. McCain’s day was Mr. Schwarzenegger’s endorsement, which the governor made alongside Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who had dropped out of the presidential race less than 24 hours before. Although Mr. Giuliani, who threw his support to Mr. McCain, was photographed beaming with the two men, the image of Republican unity was briefly underscored when the former mayor could be seen with a noticeably pained expression on his face as Mr. Schwarzenegger announced the endorsement.Mr. Schwarzenegger praised Mr. McCain as “a great American hero” who has “proven over and over again that he is reaching across the aisle in order to get things done.”Mr. Giuliani, a moderate like Mr. McCain and Mr. Schwarzenegger who had hoped to receive the endorsement of the California governor for himself, was cast in the role of echoing Mr. Schwarzenegger’s accolades for Mr. McCain. Mr. Schwarzenegger, who said only recently that he was not planning to endorse anyone before the California primary, said he threw his support to Mr. McCain once Mr. Giuliani withdrew from the race.“It’s all Rudy’s fault,” Mr. Schwarzenegger said when asked about why he changed his mind on an endorsement. “Both of them are friends of mine.” He added that he admired both men, and with both of them still in the race, “I felt like it was better to stay out of it.”'"
"'08-02-01,'1','But a reassuring conference call with Gary C. Dunton, the chief executive of MBIA, a leading bond insurer, helped quell investors’ fears on Thursday.Mr. Dunton said he expected his company to keep its top-grade credit rating despite recent troubles, including the worst quarterly loss in company history.Stocks began to turn around during the MBIA conference call and never looked back. Shares of financial companies surged, with big banks like Wachovia and Bank of America gaining about 5 percent. MBIA shares rose 11 percent, to $15.50.The Dow finished the day at 12,650.36, up 207.53 points, or 1.7 percent, erasing an early triple-digit plunge. The S.& P. 500-stock index closed up 1.7 percent at 1,378.55. Technology stocks lifted the Nasdaq composite index to 2,389.86, a 1.7 percent gain.Market watchers said that investors might have been looking to reverse overly pessimistic bets on the financial industry.“There is so much bad news priced in that eventually you’re going to have a snapback rally in those bond insurers,” said Ryan Detrick, a stock market strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. But, he added, “who knows where investors will go tomorrow?”Indeed, market participants remain concerned that the insurers will renege on their guarantees of bonds linked to subprime home loans, potentially leaving banks holding billions of dollars in devalued assets. That could create a ripple effect that raises borrowing costs for municipalities and state governments.On Wednesday, a leading rating agency cut its credit rating on Financial Guaranty, one of the nation’s largest bond insurers. William A. Ackman, a hedge fund manager who will profit if shares of bond insurers fall, said that two other industry leaders, MBIA and Ambac, could be forced to write down $24 billion.Just after midnight on Thursday, MBIA said it lost $2.3 billion last quarter, the worst performance in company history.The fear on Wall Street, analysts say, is driven by uncertainty: investors do not know how widespread the losses could ultimately be.“So many people know so little about what could happen,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P. “These companies, they just don’t tell what they have. It’s anybody’s guess.”While stocks enjoyed a bullish day on Thursday, the lingering uncertainty may have shown up in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite to its price, slipped 0.08 percentage point, a sign that investors were seeking safety in government bills.Investors were also jarred by a gloomy batch of economic data. New unemployment claims, a leading indicator of the labor market, reached their highest level since October 2005, the Labor Department said.The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of the nation’s economic activity, grew in December by only 0.2 percent.Inflation also remains a concern, with prices in December 3.5 percent higher than a year before.On Friday, investors will keep a close watch on the January employment report from the Labor Department, which may offer guidance on whether the United States has entered a recession.“Tomorrow’s numbers will be a key item,” Mr. Silverblatt said, “and I don’t want to be in town if it’s bad.”'"
"'08-02-01,'1','“The issue is going to first and foremost depend on looking at this and making a decision during the month of March in the context of an M.T.A. capital plan,” said Marc V. Shaw, the commission chairman, after the commission’s meeting in Midtown. With the state and city facing budget problems, he said, “I think that’ll be the best chance this program has of getting implemented.”Opposition to the plan has been strongest in Queens, Brooklyn and suburban communities, where many of the drivers who would pay the congestion fee live. State Assembly members from those areas have also been among the most vocal critics of the plan. The plan is not expected to face as much opposition in the State Senate.Speaking at a separate event a short time before the commission voted on the recommendation, Gov. Eliot Spitzer said the new capital plan would benefit those areas.“There will be significant investments in Queens and Brooklyn, Staten Island, up into Westchester and north,” Mr. Spitzer said, “to show that this is going to be a much more developed, much more efficient transportation system that will benefit all taxpayers.” He called congestion pricing “essential to the future of New York City.”The proposal approved by the commission would charge drivers with an E-ZPass $8 a day to enter Manhattan below 60th Street on weekdays from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Those drivers would also receive a credit for bridge or tunnel tolls they paid on the same day. Drivers without an E-ZPass would pay $9 and would not receive credit for tolls.The plan is similar to one proposed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg last April. That plan, however, established a northern boundary at 86th Street and included a $4 charge for car trips within the congestion zone.The federal government has pledged to give the city about $350 million for mass transit improvements in support of a congestion pricing plan, but only if the Legislature meets the March 31 deadline, and the mayor has sought to use that to pressure lawmakers.Mr. Bloomberg said in a written statement that he supported the commission’s proposal.The proposal’s difficult prospects in the Assembly were foreshadowed Thursday by the fact that the two dissenting voters were the two Assembly members in attendance, Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester County, and Herman D. Farrell Jr., a Democrat from Upper Manhattan. “We are for the first time deciding that there will be an entry fee into public space,” Mr. Brodsky said, charging that the plan favored the wealthy. “It is an extraordinary change.”Officials said that in the coming weeks, if an agreement can be worked out with leaders in Albany, lawmakers will write a piece of legislation to enact the plan. The City Council would then have to vote to request that the Legislature take action, setting the stage for a vote in the Legislature.'"
"'08-02-01,'1','That idea, Newsom said, was to supplement minor leaguers’ meager wages — usually about $8,000 for a five-month season — while building a unique bond among fans and players.“People get up and look at their players’ stats every day, and root for them as they go through the minor leagues,” said Newsom, who is considered only a marginal major league prospect because of his below-average fastball. “This can be the same type of thing, where fans have a tiny vested interest in hoping a guy does well.”Converting future earnings into upfront revenue is not new in business or sports; has sold his royalty rights in the form of offshore bonds, and young golfers are often backed by speculative businessmen. Here, rather than collect inanimate rookie cards, fans would invest in tiny pieces of real farmhands.Under the tabled plan, whereby he would have sold off 5 percent of any future major league income, Newsom would have needed to earn about $2 million for his shareholders to break even. That would have required a career of at least three full seasons, which for a player of Newsom’s caliber — he called himself the “quintessential antiprospect” — is unlikely.The average major league career lasts between four and five seasons and the average salary stands at $2.8 million. But those figures are boosted by the small minority of players who play seven-plus years and score eight- or nine-figure contracts. Most earn around $450,000 a year for a few seasons — when they are among the 10 percent of minor league hopefuls who reach the big leagues even for one day.Then again, under Newsom’s structure, a $100 investment in when he was a lowly farmhand in 1990 would have ultimately been worth about $6,000.“If you’re looking at this solely as an investment opportunity, then we’re probably not the place for you,” Newsom said. “We want to add to the spectating experience for fans, and at the same time do something good for the players.”Newsom’s plan, first reported by Baseball Prospectus and picked up by several other Web sites, caused a stir among club executives. A minor league player’s selling a piece of future earnings probably runs afoul of major league guidelines designed to insulate players from gamblers, as well as union rules regarding payments to and from agents.Officials at M.L.B. and the union would say only that they were aware of Newsom’s idea and were discussing its ramifications.If nothing else, Newsom’s venture highlights minor leaguers’ hidden financial hardships. Their annual salaries must cover housing, meals, clubhouse dues and more, leaving many minor leaguers — some of whom support families — sharing two-bedroom apartments with three or four teammates. Jon Searles, a pitcher in the system last season, joked that a trip to Quiznos was “living large.”Searles said he loved Newsom’s plan from a player and fan standpoint. But Searles, who also happens to have an economics degree from the ’s Wharton School, had some concerns about whether Newsom could attract blue-chip, profitable prospects to participate.“Don’t get me wrong — $50,000 can be everything to a player in the minor leagues,” Searles said. “But the risk of them committing 5 percent in perpetuity for a quick $50,000, there’s a break-even point where only players who aren’t characterized as prospects might do it. And rational investors will assess those percentages.”Newsom has heard the doubters and insisted his well-meaning idea is only emerging from its cocoon. He has been a little distracted, too — he has also been studying for his Law School Admission Test on Saturday.“I’m hoping I don’t have to go to law school until I finish my career at 40 or 42,” Newsom said with a laugh. “We’ll see.”His shareholders may be watching.'"
"'08-02-01,'1','WASHINGTON — An American missile strike in Pakistan’s northwestern tribal areas killed a senior commander of Al Qaeda who had been involved in planning attacks on United States and NATO troops in Afghanistan, American officials said Thursday.The commander, Abu Laith al-Libi, a Libyan who was about 40 years old, was a longtime lieutenant of Osama bin Laden, the American officials said. He played a pivotal role in recruiting and training operatives in the mountainous tribal areas of western Pakistan, they said. Al Qaeda has built makeshift compounds where both Pakistani militants and foreign fighters conduct training and planning for terrorist attacks.The American missile strike this week could signal an escalation in American covert action aimed at killing terrorist leaders and dismantling their networks in the tribal areas.Both the American military and the Central Intelligence Agency fly Predator surveillance aircraft armed with Hellfire missiles along the mountainous border of Afghanistan and Pakistan.American military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because the subject involves covert operations, said the attack early Tuesday against a safe house in Khushali Torikel, a village in North Waziristan, was not carried out by a Pentagon-operated Predator.'"
"'08-02-01,'1','AMSTERDAM (AP) — Royal Dutch Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, reported Thursday that fourth-quarter profit rose 60 percent because of the sale of some assets and higher oil prices.Net income was $8.47 billion, up from $5.28 billion in the period a year ago.Sales rose to $107 billion from $75.5 billion despite a fall in oil production.For the year, profit was a record $31.3 billion, while sales rose 12 percent, to $356 billion.Despite the record earnings, which prompted calls for a windfall tax, Shell’s fourth-quarter numbers “did miss analysts expectations by a whisker,” Richard Hunter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said in a research note.Mr. Hunter said that in addition, Shell’s refusal to disclose its proven reserves — a sensitive topic since the company was forced to restate them downward in a 2004 accounting scandal — was weighing on shares.The shares fell less than 1 percent to close at 24.05 euros ($35.29) in Amsterdam.The chief executive, Jeroen van der Veer, said the company would announce its proven reserves during its annual meeting in March.'"
"'08-02-01,'1','In Vienna, such public pressure appears to be having little effect. Chakib Khelil, the Algerian oil minister and OPEC’s president this year, told reporters on Thursday: “I don’t see what increasing the supply of oil would do for the economy.”The group’s 13 members, who account for about 40 percent of the world’s oil exports, are less eager to reassure consumers than to avoid repeating the mistake of 1997, when the cartel increased output just as the Asian financial crisis was brewing. A result of that mistimed decision was that prices collapsed to about $10 a barrel, rattling oil producers.In past years, OPEC has reduced its output during the second quarter, after the end of the surge in winter demand and before consumption picks up again for the summer, when demand for gasoline is at its highest.“There is no dilemma,” said Roger Diwan, a partner at PFC Energy, a consulting firm in Washington. “People assumed that OPEC’s next move would be to increase output, but it is very clear from looking at market fundamentals that the next move for OPEC is a cut in production. The question is when, and how much.”But cutting supplies while prices remain high could prove politically tricky for the cartel. After briefly touching $100 a barrel twice this year, oil futures have since dropped by about 8 percent. On Thursday, crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 58 cents, to $91.75 a barrel.This week, prices rebounded after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the second time in eight days, providing some hope that a recession could be avoided.The economic outlook has undoubtedly darkened recently. The International Monetary Fund recently slashed its forecast for global growth this year. On Wednesday, a government report showed that the American economy had expanded at an annual rate of only 0.6 percent from October to December, half the rate that most economists had forecast.But the picture for the oil market is markedly different from the late 1990s. Thanks mostly to growth in China and the Middle East, oil demand is expected to increase by 1.2 million to 1.4 million barrels a day this year. Last year, global demand rose by 1 million barrels a day, or 1.2 percent, to 85.8 million barrels a day.Current growth in oil supplies remains sluggish. The combination of a tight market and geopolitical tensions in many of the world’s top producers is keeping prices high.Lately, some analysts have started to think that if the economy were to slow down, oil prices might not necessarily fall much.In the last six recessions, oil demand in the United States has dropped by an average of 2.3 percent, according to Merrill Lynch. But the bank’s energy analysts say they believe that “the resilience of oil demand to a sharp downturn in the economy has increased over time.”“This time around, any oil demand drop should be moderate,” Merrill Lynch analysts wrote in a recent report. That is partly because the economy has become more efficient in its energy consumption, and partly because more than half the oil used in the United States goes to the transportation sector, where it is hard for consumers to cut back.Still, high prices do appear to have shaved consumption growth in the United States. American oil demand was nearly flat last year, growing by a modest 45,000 barrels, or 0.2 percent, even as the economy grew 2.2 percent in inflation-adjusted terms. Jet fuel consumption dropped by nearly 6 percent. Gasoline consumption rose just 0.5 percent.Gasoline prices now average $2.93 a gallon nationwide, according to AAA, the automobile club, up from $2.15 a gallon at this time last year.Kenneth S. Rogoff, former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and an economics professor at Harvard, said financial markets were underestimating the impact a slowdown might have on energy and commodity demand. For example, he estimated that the recent rise in oil prices, from $75 a barrel to close to $100 a barrel, had cost the American economy about $100 billion.“The market has been very demand-driven, and OPEC has been very successfully surfing this demand wave,” Mr. Rogoff said. “But if the United States has a really severe recession, that is going to crush oil prices. And there is nothing OPEC can do about it.”'"
"'08-02-01,'1','Economists have been warning for months that this country’s decade-long role of keeping a lid on global inflation was on the wane.“China has been the world’s factory and the anchor of the global disconnect between rising material prices and lower consumer prices,” said Dong Tao, an economist for Credit Suisse. “But its heyday is over. We’re going to see higher prices.”Chinese imports constitute 7.5 percent of spending by Americans on consumer goods, but they make up much bigger shares of several popular categories, including about 80 percent of toys, 85 percent of footwear, and 40 percent of clothing.Even when the market share held by Chinese goods is relatively small, their low prices put pressure on other producers to keep costs down.Whether Chinese factories will succeed in making wholesalers pay more for their goods and whether retailers will be able to pass much of their higher costs on to American consumers is unclear, analysts say.But companies that operate in China or buy from here are already reeling from mounting cost pressures that they say will weaken their profits and could disrupt their supply chains.Those supply lines were already called into question by large-scale recalls of Chinese exports last year, involving everything from toys to pet food to tires.“This is what I call the perfect storm,” said Alan G. Hassenfeld, the chairman of Hasbro, one of the world’s largest toy makers, during a recent visit to China. “We’ve got higher labor costs and labor shortages, plastic prices have gone way up and we’re doing more safety testing.”While no reliable figures exist on average Chinese wages, experts say that factory wages have risen 80 percent or more in many coastal areas in recent years, with the lowest wage about $125 a month.Some of the current cost pressures are actually by design — Beijing’s design.After years of complaints from the United States and Europe about China’s growing trade surplus, authorities here have removed incentives that once favored exporters of cheap goods.Starting last June, for instance, China removed or reduced tax rebates on hundreds of items for export, including toys, apparel, leather, wood and other goods, effectively taxing those industries.But the actions are also part of Beijing’s desire to move China higher up the global manufacturing chain — away from the least- finished products, like plastic children’s toys, toward more advanced exports that require skilled labor, like small electronics and even automobiles.Whatever the government’s motivation, many Chinese exporters say the timing of the rebate cut was disastrous. Their factories had been struggling to cope with problems that included power shortages, higher raw material costs, rising wages and inflation in other areas.For instance, the cost of some types of plastic has risen more than 30 percent in the last few years because of higher oil or petroleum costs. Plastic is a major component in toys and other consumer goods.Many Chinese factory owners say a tough new labor law, which went into effect on Jan. 1, complicates the hiring and firing process and threatens to raise labor costs even more, at a time when parts of the country are already plagued with labor shortages. Some factory owners say there have already been strikes and other turmoil over the interpretation of the new law and how it should be applied.“We have seen lots of brawls between employees and employers,” said Hong Jiasheng, vice president of the Taiwan Merchant Association, which represents investors in China. “We think the enactment of the new labor law is too hasty.”Analysts say Beijing is also stepping up its enforcement of environmental laws, putting added pressure on factories that had long skirted regulations. Adhering to those often ignored rules increases cost, too.These changes take place against the backdrop of a dollar falling modestly against the Chinese currency. The dollar is down about 7.6 percent in the last year against the yuan and is expected to fall further this year.The weaker the dollar, the more expensive Chinese and other goods become when their prices are converted to dollars.All in all, toy producers are among the hardest hit by the changes in law and prices. They rely on large quantities of plastic. They face heightened regulatory scrutiny after the product safety scandals last year. Indeed, some toy factories went bankrupt, squeezed between rising local costs and pressures from foreign customers to deliver a better product at an even lower price.“I’ve been in the toy industry for almost 20 years, but these past two years have been the hardest time,” said Guo Jinshen, manager of the Fenggang Fengyuan Plastic Toys Company. “Costs are rising, there are recalls, stricter regulation, more complicated inspection — all these things make it difficult.”To reduce costs, some factory owners are considering moving to inland China, where wages are lower, or to other parts of Asia, like Vietnam and Indonesia.Li & Fung, one of the biggest companies for supplying products worldwide, says its customers are already responding to Chinese inflation.“There’s a shift in sourcing driven by higher prices in China,” says Bruce Rockowitz, president at Li & Fung. “We’ve already seen a big move in furniture to Indonesia.”But while relocating production to cheaper countries could keep prices low for Western consumer goods, moving factories and complex supply chains is difficult. Such changes can take years and cost millions of dollars.In the meantime, makers of toys, apparel and footwear — highly labor-intensive industries — are being forced to consider raising prices even as growth in the United States slows, a rare confluence of events not seen in decades.Companies that began outsourcing production to China in the 1990s mostly benefited from lower costs, which translated into both higher corporate profits and lower consumer prices. Now, many Western companies have to rethink pricing.“Companies are now ordering for the spring of 2009,” says Nate Herman, director of international trade at the American Apparel and Footwear Association, based in Arlington, Va., that represents some big clothing and footwear makers. “Factories are coming back and asking for 20, 30, 40, 50 percent price increases.”Will importers pass those costs on to consumers? “It’s going to be hard to avoid some increase,” he said.'"
"'08-02-01,'1','The sale of official memorabilia is big business for the N.F.L. and the companies that are licensed to sell its merchandise. Sales of N.F.L. goods amount to more than $3 billion in retail sales a year, according to a 2007 report by License! magazine. Retail sales of Super Bowl memorabilia total between $100 million and $125 million a year, Dan Masonson, an N.F.L. spokesman, said.Although fans may not have much sympathy for the N.F.L. and the considerable profit it earns on official merchandise, local vendors who sell licensed products said they were harmed by people dealing in fake goods.“Counterfeiters are like thieves,” said Mazen Ismail, who was selling licensed T-shirts, sweatshirts and Super Bowl footballs in front of a Hooters in Glendale on Thursday. Ismail and his sister-in-law, Iman Ismail, said they recently turned away a man who wanted to sell them apparently fake T-shirts at Flag World, their store in downtown Phoenix.“It’s like a shortcut; it’s not fair,” said Mazen Ismail, who said he pays between $15 and $20 for a T-shirt he sells for $30.But customers at the Ismails’s stand seemed divided on whether buying counterfeit goods matters. While one man visiting from New York said he valued a low price above all else, Blake Heffelfinger, a Glendale resident, disagreed. “It’s like fake; it’s phony,” said Heffelfinger, 43, who later bought a $30 T-shirt from the Ismails. “That would bother me.”Troy Henley, the deputy special agent in charge of the I.C.E. Office of Investigation in Phoenix, said customers who buy phony goods also unwittingly support criminal enterprises. Much of the counterfeit merchandise sold on the streets of Phoenix are made in illegal workshops in China, he said.“Because it’s the Super Bowl and we have the N.F.L., we’re going to concentrate on the people who are selling it, but that is not our ultimate goal,” Henley said. “Our ultimate goal is to track the counterfeit goods back to the originator, the criminal outfit that produces it.”In the Mesa raid, federal agents quickly determined that the T-shirts were fake because their colors looked bright and cheaply produced, and because they did not bear the N.F.L.’s distinctive hologram sticker. Agents counted 500 T-shirts stored in the truck, at a retail value of at least $10,000.The agents did not release the name of the man who was selling the shirts, and he did not comment to a reporter. “I didn’t know they were fake,” he told an agent. The man may not be criminally charged because the number of shirts he was selling was less than 1,000, the threshold for federal criminal prosecution, agents said. However, because his truck was used to transport the counterfeit merchandise, it may be seized.Lori Marmino, whose family owns the pawn shop where the man had parked his truck, said he was a regular customer who had asked if he could sell the T-shirts there. “I had a feeling they were fake,” Marmino said. But she had little sympathy.“They take a chance,” she said. “They know it.”'"
"'08-02-01,'1','WASHINGTON — The advocacy group Human Rights Watch on Thursday said that the Bush administration was giving lip service to the promotion of democracy around the world by endorsing suspect elections while allowing human rights violations in those countries to go unchecked.In a scathing report, the organization blamed the United States and Europe for undermining human rights by allowing autocrats to pretend they are democratic. The report cited Bahrain, Jordan, Nigeria, Russia and Thailand as acting “as if simply holding a vote is enough to prove a nation democratic, and Washington, Brussels and European capitals played along.”Russia, Jordan and “even China,” the group said, have “gotten into the game” of merely using the word democracy to claim real democratic credentials.The report cited President Hu Jintao’s calls for more democracy within the Chinese Communist Party. “Yet that has not stopped him from barring independent political parties, blocking legal efforts to uphold basic rights and shutting down countless civil society organizations, media outlets and Web sites,” the organization’s executive director, Kenneth Roth, wrote in the report’s introduction.In an interview, Mr. Roth attributed much of this posturing by foreign governments to the Bush administration’s promotion of democracy while still accepting the results of dubious elections. Mr. Roth said that the Bush administration had chosen the trappings of democracy instead of human rights.'"
"'08-02-01,'1','The Stockholm City Council is expected to name a street and adjoining square in honor of Ingmar Bergman, the Swedish master filmmaker who died in July, Agence France-Presse reported. “I would be very surprised if the decision doesn’t go through,” said Mikael Soederlund, a city councilor who backs the proposal. The street and square are near the Royal Dramatic Theater, of which Bergman was the director and where he staged plays by Strindberg, Ibsen, Anouilh, Tennessee Williams and others.'"
"'08-02-01,'1','Murray, whose invitation to speak to committee investigators had been rumored but not confirmed, nodded when asked his identity by a reporter in the hallway outside the committee office. He carried a water bottle but no notes to the interview.Lawrence D. Finder, one of two lawyers with Murray, said in an e-mail message afterward, “Mr. Murray cooperated fully with the committee and answered all questions asked of him.” Finder declined further comment.Murray submitted to a transcribed interview for about three and a half hours.Keith Ausbrook, the Republican chief counsel to the committee, and Philip M. Schiliro, the chief of staff to the committee, declined to comment on what Murray said.McNamee said he spoke with Murray on three occasions about Clemens and steroids — in 2004, in the spring of 2007 and on Dec. 4, 2007. McNamee said Murray took extensive notes during the first two of those conversations.Murray’s allegiance is clearly to Clemens. Murray works for Randy and Alan Hendricks, the sports agents and brothers who made their reputation by negotiating Clemens’s record-setting contracts. Murray’s job was to tend to Hendricks clients based in New York.When McNamee called Murray on Dec. 4, 2007, to tell him about the Mitchell report, which had yet to be released, Murray secretly taped the call, according to McNamee’s lawyers. The committee has a transcript of that phone call, said a committee staff member who was not authorized to discuss the matter.Murray was accompanied by Finder and another lawyer from the Houston law firm of Haynes and Boone who declined to give his name. Finder is a former interim United States attorney in Houston and a specialist in white-collar criminal defense.As a prelude to the Feb. 13 hearing, the committee has offered witnesses a choice of depositions or transcribed interviews. The difference is small. While depositions are formally sworn statements, it is also against the law to lie in an interview with government officials.The investigation has focused on Clemens’s denial of McNamee’s accounts that he injected Clemens at least 16 times with performance-enhancing drugs in 1998, 2000 and 2001. Clemens’s denial challenges the accuracy of the Mitchell report, which Congress is relying on to pressure baseball to improve its drug-testing procedures.Pettitte and Knoblauch have not challenged the statements concerning them in the Mitchell report. McNamee said he injected Pettitte and Knoblauch with H.G.H.Deborah L. Rhode, a professor at Stanford University Law School, who worked as a lawyer for the House Judiciary Committee during former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment hearings and has followed the Clemens case, said Murray’s account could be important if there was no other corroborating evidence to support McNamee.“It’s a classic way to bolster McNamee’s credibility,” Rhode said in a telephone interview Thursday. “Otherwise, it is just two differing accounts, which we have seen a lot in this matter.”McNamee talked with federal investigators and with Mitchell under an agreement that he could be prosecuted only if he did not tell the truth. Clemens talked publicly so far, but not under oath.However, it is unclear what, if anything, McNamee told former Senator George J. Mitchell about Murray. The Mitchell report does not mention Murray even though he is now viewed as a key witness.McNamee, a longtime personal trainer for Clemens and Pettitte, said he met with Murray on two occasions to talk about performance-enhancing drugs, according to a tape of a conversation between McNamee and Clemens on Jan. 4. The tape was secretly recorded by Clemens’s lawyer, Rusty Hardin, and played at a news conference Jan. 7.“I met with Jimmy in ’04,” McNamee told Clemens in the telephone call. “I said: ‘Jimmy, I just wanted to give you guys a heads-up because you better have some information. I’d rather you be prepared than unprepared.’ ”McNamee’s lawyers said McNamee was passing on a warning to Clemens that he could fail the new urine tests for steroids that baseball was using.McNamee also told Clemens in the call that he had met with Murray shortly after it was revealed in April 2007 that Kirk Radomski, a former Mets clubhouse attendant and steroid distributor, was cooperating with federal authorities.Radomski is to appear before the committee Feb. 12.'"
"'08-02-01,'1','JERUSALEM — The prime minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, received crucial support from senior ministers of his own Kadima Party on Thursday, and leaders of a public campaign to oust him said they were not immediately planning mass demonstrations. Those developments improved Mr. Olmert’s chances of surviving a formal inquiry that found “grave failings” in the handling of the 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon.Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni was quoted as telling Kadima ministers that the government-appointed investigative commission’s findings were “harsh,” but that “we need to continue together — that is the meaning of taking responsibility.” Ms. Livni had called on Mr. Olmert to resign last May after the publication of a scathing preliminary report by the same commission.While the preliminary report assigned personal responsibility to the prime minister and other political and military leaders, the final report, released Wednesday, was more forgiving of Mr. Olmert than many expected and has been hailed by some supporters as a kind of exoneration.Even before its release, Mr. Olmert made it clear that he had no intention of resigning.Other ministers who had been critical of Mr. Olmert rallied around him on Thursday. Ronnie Bar-On, the finance minister and a close ally of Mr. Olmert, said the prime minister had “wall-to-wall support” within his party.Both the preliminary and final reports were prepared by the Winograd Commission, named for the retired judge, Eliyahu Winograd, who headed it.'"
"'08-02-01,'1','It is one of the myths of the profession that inside every journalist there is a great novel struggling to get out. For Ernest Hemingway, the myth became a reality. For Martha Gellhorn, Hemingway’s third wife, the struggle was her life story. In “The Maddening Truth,” a new play being staged by the Keen Company at the Clurman Theater, David Hay makes a case that Gellhorn ultimately won the battle.Gellhorn, who died in 1998, is one of those writers one has often heard about but rarely reads. She was a pioneer among women as a foreign correspondent, working first in the Paris bureau of United Press and then as a reporter for Collier’s magazine during the Spanish Civil War. She covered every theater of World War II, including the Allied landings on D-Day. She was at Dachau, the Nazi death camp, after it was liberated, and her account is a textbook example of reporting.For all the bravura of her journalism, however, she longed to be accepted as a novelist, and Mr. Hay’s play concerns her inner turmoil in pursuing that goal. Told in a series of scenes that move backward and forward in time, the play opens in 1972 as Gellhorn is trying to return to Vietnam. For the sake of narrative expediency, some episodes from her far-flung life and several characters are collapsed; a string of lovers, for example, is represented by one, Laurance Rockefeller.Mr. Hay captures the complexity of Gellhorn’s character. She could be sharp-tongued or sweet-talking and was not above using her sexual allure to get her way. Highly opinionated, she had a keen eye for detail but little time for objectivity in her journalism. Her defense against bad reviews for her novels and other books was disdain for all other writers.While “The Maddening Truth,” which has been smoothly directed by Carl Forsman, is fascinating as a character study, its weakness as a play is the paucity of dramatic conflict. Except for a shouting match or two with a reporter and one excellent scene in which Gellhorn, trying to write a novel in Kenya, confronts Hemingway’s ghost, the 100-minute show is mainly a chronicle of her life.Lisa Emery, nervously tapping her foot, pouring a glass of whiskey, puffing a cigarette or flirting, brings Gellhorn to life in a portrayal that lays bare her frustration and anger. William Connell, Terry Layman, Richard Bekins and Peter Benson all give fine performances in support.'"
"'08-02-01,'1','“I have no residual issue with John McCain,” Mr. Perkins said, adding that the senator needed “to better communicate” his convictions on social issues.Richard Land, an official of the Southern Baptist Convention and a longtime critic of Mr. McCain, agreed, saying, “He is strongly pro-life.”“When I hear Rush Limbaugh say that a McCain nomination would destroy the Republican Party,” Dr. Land added, “what I want to say to Rush is, ‘You need to get out of the studio more and talk to real people.’ ”How firmly conservatives reject or embrace Mr. McCain may be a pivotal variable, both in the homestretch of the Republican primary campaign, when Mitt Romney is hoping to rally conservatives to his side, and in the general election, when too much grumbling from the right in a close race could cost Mr. McCain the White House.The McCain campaign, for its part, is doing remedial work on the right. On the day after the Florida primary, it announced that Mr. McCain would speak next week at the Conservative Political Action Conference, a major gathering held each year in Washington.Last year, he drew barbs from the conservative news media for skipping the event while his Republican rivals all attended. His advisers now consider that a big mistake.“We recognize that conservatives will be instrumental to our victory in November and we are reaching out and taking their advice,” said Jill Hazelbaker, a McCain spokeswoman.Many on the right, though, say Mr. McCain has a lot of explaining to do. Not only did he vote against President Bush’s tax cuts and a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, Mr. McCain has also supported embryonic stem cell research and stricter environmental regulation. He fought for looser immigration rules. He championed campaign finance rules that many on the right consider a violation of free speech. And he made a deal with Democrats to break a deadlock on judicial nominations that many on the right considered near treasonous.Anger over that deal flared up again this week when a Wall Street Journal columnist, John Fund, reported that Mr. McCain had privately criticized Mr. Bush’s Supreme Court nominee Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. because “he wore his conservatism on his sleeve.”The McCain campaign quickly denied that he held such a view, noting that the senator voted for Mr. Alito’s confirmation and routinely praises his selection on the stump. But conservative activists say the charges nonetheless reminded them of their doubts.“Conservatives need to act now, before it is too late!” Mark R. Levin, a movement veteran and talk-radio host, wrote on the Web site of National Review, urging a “rally for Romney.” The publication was host to an online debate on Wednesday on the question “A Republican future with McCain?”A spokesman for Dr. Dobson, the influential evangelical Christian founder of Focus on the Family, said Wednesday that he stood by the position he staked out more than a year ago that as a matter of conscience he could never vote for Mr. McCain.Nor has the small-government wing of the movement swung to Mr. McCain’s side. “I have yet to see McCain make any attempts to reach out to free market conservatives,” said Pat Toomey, president of the antitax group Club for Growth, warning that “if you have a big problem with a big part of your base, you really should be mending fences.”And in his broadcast on Thursday, Mr. Limbaugh escalated his attacks on Mr. McCain as an imposter in the party.“McCain is in a lot of these places not actually the Republican candidate,” Mr. Limbaugh said. “He is the candidate of enough Republicans, but independents and moderates and probably even some liberals.”Mr. Limbaugh contended that such voters were deciding Republican primaries because other candidates had divided the conservative vote.Still, even Mr. McCain’s most determined antagonists say the animosity among conservative leaders does not necessarily extend deep into the rank and file, where not many remember the details of Mr. McCain’s views on campaign finance or judicial nomination procedures. “It is kind of inside baseball,” as Mr. Perkins put it.Mr. Limbaugh, Mr. Toomey and others are working hard to rally conservatives around Mr. Romney, who has campaigned as a by-the-book conservative despite a record of more liberal stances he took in campaigns for senator and governor in Massachusetts.In contrast to Mr. McCain, Mr. Romney has convinced conservative leaders that he is on their side through assiduous, face-to-face courtship, but he has struggled to have the same success at the grass roots.Mr. Romney also faces the problem of Mike Huckabee’s continuing campaign. A Southern Baptist pastor before he became governor of Arkansas, Mr. Huckabee has struck a chord with Christian conservatives, preventing Mr. Romney from bringing together economic and social conservatives opposed to Mr. McCain.“Romney and Huckabee divided the Bush vote,” Mr. Norquist, the tax opponent, said. “Bush was Romney and Huckabee in one body.”Meanwhile, conservatives are growing increasingly “resigned” to the idea of a McCain nomination, said David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, adding that among Washington activists, many of whom, like him, double as lobbyists, self-interest may also be a factor.“There are people who don’t like the idea of a being off a campaign or being on the bad list if the guy gets into the White House,” Mr. Keene said. “This is a town in which 90 percent of the people balance their access and income on the one hand versus their principles on the other.”'"
"'08-02-01,'1','Then, last year, Mr. Santiago had a heart attack.“It wasn’t a real big heart attack where I fell on the floor,” he said. “It was just a lot of chest pains that wouldn’t go away. I thought it was heartburn.”On July 2, he drove himself to St. Barnabas Hospital.Later that day, he was transferred by ambulance to Montefiore Medical Center. Three days later, he had surgery to unblock a clogged artery.Recovery took almost four months, and during that time Mr. Santiago could not work. Ms. Santiago does not work: She has epilepsy, and her seizures are not well controlled by medication. She cares for her husband at home.While he was hospitalized, Mr. Santiago learned that he had diabetes. He has a fear of needles, so his wife gives him his daily insulin injections, as he looks away.“I tried letting him do it himself and he got upset,” she said. “He wouldn’t do it.”The family income shrank to $340 a month in disability payments. The Santiagos soon exhausted their savings and fell behind on their mortgage payments and other bills.Mr. Santiago returned to work at the end of October. By then, they owed about $14,000 in mortgage payments and had received a notice of foreclosure. Mr. Santiago is not strong enough to resume all of his previous duties, and now works four days a week as a dispatcher, earning $350.Their monthly income is supplemented by $1,646 collected from two tenants who rent parts of the house. They also receive $772 in food stamps each month.With Mr. Santiago back at work, they were able to resume making mortgage payments. For help with bills, they turned to the Children’s Aid Society, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.In the fall, $1,388.51 in Neediest Cases money covered the family’s $910.82 Con Edison bill and a $477.69 water bill. “That was a great help because I didn’t have the money,” Mr. Santiago said.But they are still $14,000 behind on their mortgage. The bank will not allow partial payment, the couple said. They are waiting to hear if the amount they owe can be moved to the end of the payment schedule. If not, foreclosure proceedings will resume.“There are so many people that this is happening to,” Mr. Santiago said. “I didn’t really realize it until it happened to me.”'"
"'08-02-01,'1','He said the ballpark deal — in which a countywide tax would pay about 75 percent of the cost, with the Twins kicking in the rest — was enough to give Carl Pohlad, the nonagenarian billionaire owner, enough money to operate more than competitively.Rosentraub labeled Pohlad a “profit maximizer,” who would rather make money than win, unlike a “welfare maximizer,” unlike the win-first philosophy of George Steinbrenner.The Mets have long been in baseball’s council of the haves, even in frumpy Shea Stadium. They can afford Santana, Citi Field wealth or not. Citi Field will just make things more affordable. The ruling Wilpons can theoretically pledge the annual $20 million naming rights payment from Citigroup to pay for most or all of Santana’s salary.You can be certain the naming rights for the Twins’ ballpark will not attract anything close to the Mets’ deal.And that’s part of the cruelty of new-stadium economics. Pittsburgh fans, for example, have learned that PNC Park has not been a financial salvation or the pathway to stocking up on talented, expensive players who will lead them to a winning season. In seven seasons at PNC Park, the Pirates have averaged 69 wins, and their attendance of 1.7 million last year was 28 percent below the 2001 opening-season peak of 2.4 million.The Pirates have never had a “welfare maximizer” spending what is necessary to win in a market unlike Boston, where cash-rich enhancements to old Fenway Park, and a wildly popular team, demonstrate the potency of wealthy owners in a major market.The Mets, the Red Sox and the Yankees also have what the Twins don’t: their own regional sports networks with profit margins so high they’re virtually printing cash.Santana represents a valuable asset to the Mets’ SportsNet New York, which is entering its third season of operations. SNY’s Mets games last season averaged a 3.3, the highest ever for the team’s games on a regional sports network, and attracted 243,111 local households. The rating rose from a 2.9 on SNY in 2006, and a 1.5 on MSG and FSNY in 2005.Although it was no way to end a season, Mets fans were nonetheless riveted by last September’s collapse. When the Mets lost a seven-game lead in the National League East, SNY averaged a 4.0 for its 14 games (the peak was a 5.8 for Florida’s 8-7 win on Sept. 20) and Channel 11 averaged a 5.1 (the peak was a 6.8 for the decisive season finale, Florida’s 8-1 win).“There was such a taste of disappointment and a malaise going into this season,” said Bob Gutkowski, the former president of the MSG Network and Madison Square Garden. “For fans and for advertisers, it ended horribly, and it hurts your business. Bringing in Santana cauterizes the wound and really lets you go upward quickly. I think there’d be real pressure on ratings if they hadn’t gotten Santana.”If you are inclined to believe a theory advanced by the agent Scott Boras on behalf of his client Alex Rodriguez, Santana might be an “Iconic-Performance-Network” player who not only produces wonderfully on the field, but also generates revenues for the team by luring more fans to the stadium and increases the value of its TV network.Santana wouldn’t be the only factor (any more than A-Rod solely raised the wealth of the Yankees and YES), but he will be a primary reason for disgruntled fans to return to Shea (and the doubtlessly more expensive Citi Field) and to watch SNY.'"
"'08-02-01,'1','On Wednesday evening, she went on MSNBC to defend her position, which had generated an angry firestorm in the blogosphere and within her own parent organization (where senior officers have been considering a demand that she retract her statement). On her guest spot on MSNBC, there was much talk of the grass-roots perspective and women’s anger. Flirty banter was not in evidence.Far from backing Ms. Pappas’s news release, with its naked display of impolitic anger — an impulse typically associated with youthful passion — Ms. Valenti’s Web site posted a short but dismissive response. “Wow,” the posting by a Feministing.com editor read. “This is completely unhinged, and frankly, mind-boggling.” The posting added, “All I can say is, NOW-NY does not speak for me. And it does not speak for all feminists.”Although she may write in exclamation points — the recent press release had three — Ms. Pappas does not speak in them. When confronted with Feministing.com’s response, she carefully avoided any invitation to complain about the lack of fire in young women or their difficulty in understanding what’s at stake given all their privilege — the concerns so often heard from an older generation of feminists.“I grew up in the ’60s, so I understand that every generation wants to stand up and say, ‘We’re different,’ ” Ms. Pappas said, adding that she had also received e-mail messages from young women elated by her outburst.Ms. Valenti, for professional reasons, has not endorsed either Senator Obama or Senator Clinton, and although she says she does have a favorite, she herself embodies the divided young female vote — she won’t exactly be heartbroken whichever candidate wins the nomination.“There was a tone in that press release that if you don’t support Hillary, you’re not even a feminist, and that’s a generational tension that’s been happening within the campaign,” Ms. Valenti said.At the same time, Ms. Valenti had to admit that she was sympathetic to Ms. Pappas. Say something outrageous on a blog, she points out, and you can rein it in on the very next post. Issue a hot-headed press release, and it’s suddenly out there, entrenched, just like NOW itself.That’s part of why she believes the future of feminism lies in online activism, not old-school organizations. Young women today don’t need “the iconic leadership of a NOW or a Gloria Steinem,” she said. With online communities like her own, women have access to vast clearinghouses for information, support, even consciousness-raising. “We have each other,” Ms. Valenti said, “and that’s pretty important.”What she still doesn’t have is money. After almost four years of television appearances, magazine interviews, even minor celebrity, Ms. Valenti still runs the Web site on the side, working as a freelance writer to get by. Ms. Pappas, on the other hand, may not write a suave press release, or have the hip credibility to pull in young people, but in four years of fund-raising she’s taken the state chapter out of debt and put it onto strong financial footing.The two women should probably talk. Surely, there’s a message board somewhere big enough for both of them. We already know they have a lot in common.'"
"'08-02-01,'1','McCain seems to be burdened by the emotional cost of the war in Iraq, by the gravity of young people dying. But F.D.R. was a happy wartime campaigner and to compete with the Democrats in the fall, McCain will have to reconnect with the spirit of this moment. The country, the über-pollster Peter Hart notes, is not in a mood for irritation and anger. It’s thirsty for uplift, progress and hope.Second, McCain will have to clarify his vision for the future. He talks about the struggle with Islamic extremists as the transcendent foreign policy challenge of our time. But there’s a transcendent domestic challenge as well. America is segmenting. The country is dividing along the lines of education, income, religion, lifestyle and giving way to cynicism and mistrust. Government is distanced from the people and growing more corrupt.In the past, McCain has said that repairing these divisions constitutes “a new patriotic challenge for a new century.” He has hinted at a philosophy that amounts to an American version of One Nation Conservatism. It emphasizes reforming federal institutions, calling on young people to perform national service, promoting economic competitiveness and enhancing social mobility. It is a mixture of Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. This governing philosophy has lurked in the background this year, but McCain will have to make it explicit to move a nation.Finally, McCain is going to have to beef up his domestic policy offerings. He has some excellent ideas, like his plan to control health care costs, which he doesn’t explain well. But he has not yet focused sufficiently on the group that is always the key to Republican success or failure — the suburban working class.Picture a suburban townhouse community filled with families making $40,000 to $60,000 a year. Maybe there’s a single mother in one unit who hates her job but needs the benefits. Maybe there are immigrant parents with associate degrees watching their son drop out of school in another. The definition of being middle class has changed, as many have noticed. It used to be a destination. Now it’s an uncertain place. It’s a struggle just to stay there. Any candidate who can’t talk specifically to these concerns is doomed.If McCain does well on Super Tuesday, he would have pulled off one of the greatest comeback stories in modern political history. He would owe his victory to his character, his honesty and his tenacity.But already, he is being judged by different standards. Republicans are wondering how he would compete against Hillary Clinton (whom they moderately fear) and Obama (whom they fear a great deal). To unify the party, McCain will have to respect different parts of the coalition. But more importantly, he will also have to excite Republicans with the possibility of a G.O.P. victory.He will have to mine his own past and bring forward the ideals and causes that lurk there, and present them as a coherent package. He’ll have to show that winning the nomination of a dispirited Republican Party is one thing; winning the presidency and uniting a nation is another.'"

"'08-02-02,'0','Francis Choi is the chairman and chief executive of the Early Light Industrial Toy Company in Hong Kong, one of the biggest toy manufacturers in Asia. The company produces goods for some of the world's biggest toy companies, including Mattel. In an e-mail response this week to questions about the rising costs of doing business in China, he said that he expected toy prices to increase as much as 15 percent this year, but that companies like Early Light would make higher-value toys to continue to grow. He outlined the problems facing the toy industry and other companies that manufacture products in China, where costs are rising dramatically.Francis Choi writes: It is not easy to provide a general comment about the prospects for the toys business. The products require lots of innovative ideas and various factors to achieve success. If you are fortunate to have hot products, your return could be high even if the market falls on recession.In 2007, China exported approximately $10 billion worth of toys. It is estimated that the figures will be about the same in 2008. Various factors, such as the increase in raw material and labor costs, as well as the inflation of the yuan, have driven price increases in 2007. Despite these unfavorable factors, our company is lucky to sustain its business.Being an original electronics manufacturer that plays a passive role, we can only address the new pricing adjustment to our customer whenever the price is rising. As a matter of survival, our customers may pass on the price increase to the consumer. In general, we have suffered from rising costs of our own during the past three to four months in the progress of negotiating with customers. Our business could get back on track once the new price is accepted by the customers. It is expected that this type of phenomenon will persist in 2008. As they did in 2007, the appreciation of the yuan, the fluctuation of raw material prices, new regulation and a labor law implemented by the Chinese government will all affect our cost.Recently, we established a department to study all kinds of new regulations so that we could get a full picture for the cost impact. In the view of manufacturers, the toy industry is in a difficult time compared to a few years ago. In the past, the cost of raw materials, labor and the value of the Chinese currency were comparatively stable, so the price we agreed to with customers could last for a long period. But recently, we have had to review the price with our customers on a bimonthly basis.In the early 1980s, the Chinese government introduced a birth control policy to limit the population. Couples who lived in cities were to follow a one-child policy, whereas many families in rural areas were allowed to have two children. As a result, the working-age population is decreasing now. And because it is essential for the families to raise the living standard of the only child, apparently they expect children to reach a higher academic level. In addition, most of the factory workers are migrants who come from the western and northern region of China. But the development of their regions is now growing rapidly, so most of them now prefer to stay and work in their hometown. As a result, some factories are facing labor shortages. Fortunately, we do not have this problem as our workers are paid on time with standard salary and full overtime payment, which are all based on China's regulations. With good facilities in the canteen and dormitory, our workers are satisfied with the benefits we offer and they feel pleased to work at our company.Compared to other countries, it is predicted that China's labor force is still sufficient to supply the market in the coming five years. And the increase in the price of raw materials and labor are issues not just with China but also with the rest of the Asian countries. Since China is still a manufacturing base, we are very confident that we will maintain our toys business.'"

"'08-02-02,'0','“I don’t listen to him,” Mr. McCain said on his plane as he flew from an airport rally in St. Louis to one in Chicago. “There’s a certain trace of masochism in my family, but not that deep.”Still, in an attempt to assure the right that there is safety in numbers, Mr. McCain’s campaign announced endorsements almost hourly on Friday from well-known conservatives. Among them were Theodore B. Olson, the former solicitor general who supported the Bush administration’s agenda on legal and regulatory issues before the Supreme Court, and Steve Forbes, a grandson of the Forbes magazine founder B.C. Forbes and a former presidential candidate. On Thursday, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas endorsed Mr. McCain.Mr. McCain, of Arizona, who has been wooing former Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, a moderate, said Friday that he also anticipated a major endorsement in that state.“In a multiperson race with people running to your right, you’re not going to get all the conservative voters,” said Charles Black, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. “But you’ll get enough to win.”Mr. Romney was endorsed Friday by Rick Santorum, the former senator from Pennsylvania. He also has the support of the conservative commentator Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity, the conservative talk show host.Mr. McCain’s television commercial, which began showing Friday on cable channels across the country, depicts him as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and then in a meeting with President Ronald Reagan, the Republican standard-bearer worshiped by conservatives. “As a prisoner of war, John McCain was inspired by Ronald Reagan,” an announcer intones, and then calls Mr. McCain “a proud social conservative who will never waiver.”Mr. Romney’s campaign in turn released a series of blistering e-mail messages to reporters attacking Mr. McCain as a virtual Democrat. Mr. McCain was “pushing the Democrat position on immigration, taxes, energy,” one of them said.Mr. Romney, who campaigned before an overflow crowd at a car dealership in Denver, criticized Mr. McCain as knowing little about the economy, and later said that Mr. McCain, although “a man of great character,” had taken positions on key Republican issues that “are not in line with the mainstream of our party.”Mr. Romney and Mr. McCain also got into a brief stand-off over Mr. McCain’s decision not to debate Mr. Romney on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. Mr. Romney complained of the decision this week.“We’ve done 16 debates with Romney, and we’re tired of them,” Mr. Black said Friday.'"
"'08-02-02,'0','“I do have a broader definition,” Mrs. Clinton said in an interview. “Civil rights are what each of us as human beings are entitled to in relationship to our society. But it really is, at core, about the respect and dignity of each human being.”Mrs. Clinton has seen her support among blacks as central to her political identity. She has had many African-American friends and advisers, racially diverse staffs and a Senate voting record that has earned straight A’s from the N.A.A.C.P. Even her rival, Senator Barack Obama, said in a debate that he is “absolutely convinced” of Mrs. Clinton’s commitment to racial equality.But that career’s worth of good will became somewhat frayed after supporters of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign — and chiefly, her husband — were accused of racially tinged attacks and innuendo against Mr. Obama before the South Carolina primary. Mr. Obama went on to rout Mrs. Clinton on the strength of strong support from blacks, a constituency Mrs. Clinton had courted hard.The tone of the Clinton campaign deeply dismayed some African-Americans who had been close to the Clintons, including Eric Holder, a former top Justice Department official and Obama supporter. “It places their legacy at risk,” Mr. Holder said.Even as the charged rhetoric of South Carolina subsides, race will no doubt persist as a theme for as long as Mr. Obama is running, the contest is close and emotions run raw. “I think everyone is trying to find their way, here,” Mrs. Clinton said.Just as Mrs. Clinton has enjoyed the residual benefits of her husband’s popularity with blacks, she has also been tarred with the perceived failures of his administration. Any number of African-Americans, despite their support for Bill Clinton in the 1990s, still bristle over some episodes — from his criticism of the rapper Sister Souljah during the 1992 campaign to his welfare reform bill in 1996 to the number of black prisoners incarcerated during his administration.“The policy record of the Clinton administration on civil rights is more mixed than people generally acknowledge,” said Christopher Edley Jr., the law school dean at the University of California, Berkeley, who served in the Clinton administration. He cited Mr. Clinton’s unwillingness to intervene in Rwanda, where hundreds of thousands died in tribal war, and his signing of what Mr. Edley called “a horribly punitive crime bill.” Mr. Edley said he remains fond of both Clintons but is supporting Mr. Obama.Circumstances have put Mrs. Clinton in a delicate position: as the main obstacle to the first African-American with a serious shot of becoming president. “Hillary’s in a tough spot. We’re all in a tough spot,” said Representative James E. Clyburn, the Democratic House whip, and influential black leader from South Carolina. “You have two big dreams converging at the same time.”While she has built her presidential campaign on “35 years of experience making change,” her first 25 years were arguably more central to shaping her views.The city of Park Ridge, 15 miles northwest of Chicago, was mostly devoid of blacks, Hispanics and liberals — which was fine with Hugh Rodham, who was not shy about flinging prejudices across the dinner table. “He had the views that people of that age and time did,” Mrs. Clinton said.She recalled her father’s driving her through rough parts of Chicago. “We’d go by skid row, which is what it was called in those days,” Mrs. Clinton said, “and we’d see some fellow leaning against a lamp post, and my father would start in on one of his usual lectures.”Over time, she said, he mellowed. “His experience really undermined and contradicted” his earlier views on race, she said.Mrs. Clinton recalled first being aware of racism a half-century ago, at age 10, when she saw the televised images of black students in Little Rock, Ark., being blocked from attending school by order of Gov. Orval E. Faubus.""There were these pictures of these mobs, and these children trying to go to school, and it seemed so wrong,” she said in the interview, conducted by phone. “I used to go to Sunday school and sing ‘Jesus Loves the Children of the World,’ and I just couldn’t believe it.”Her biggest early influence on race was Mr. Jones, who led the youth group at Park Ridge’s First United Methodist Church. He took the teens to meet with poor black children at a community center and chaperoned the expedition to see Dr. King, whose speech that Sunday night bemoaned the indifference of the privileged to the plight of the poor. The young Hillary Rodham was inspired to volunteer to baby-sit for the children of migrant farmers.Still, she adopted her father’s staunch Republicanism, even working for Mr. Goldwater’s campaign. Today, she laughs off her “Goldwater Girl” period as a youthful indiscretion — and indeed, she was 16 at the time.“One of the first things I knew about Hillary was that she was Republican and had been a Goldwater Girl,” said Janet McDonald Hill, a black Wellesley classmate. That biographical nugget comes up surprisingly frequently among Obama backers.“Being a supporter of Barry Goldwater during the civil rights revolution is about as close to original sin as I can imagine,” said Mr. Edley, the Berkeley law school dean, who is African-American.Mrs. Clinton made her first black friend in college: Karen Williamson, one of six African-Americans in her freshman class at Wellesley. They went to church together one Sunday, which upset Mrs. Clinton’s parents and led her to question her motives. “Look how liberal that girl is trying to be, going to church with a Negro,” Mrs. Clinton wrote to Mr. Jones, imagining her reaction if she had seen another white girl doing the same thing.As a sophomore, Mrs. Clinton volunteered as a “Big Sister” to a 7-year-old black girl whose mother, a single housekeeper, needed child care. Mrs. Clinton helped the girl with homework, took her to movies, took her to dinner at Harvard.Mrs. Clinton brooded over the nature of privilege, suffering and race. In a letter to a high-school friend, John Peavoy, she spoke of “the depression that descends on a person, especially one who has led a ‘sheltered suburban life,’ when he is confronted with the realities of city life.”In the fall of 1966, she attended a “black power” meeting hosted by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee but disapproved of the group’s extreme “attitude toward civil disobedience,” as she wrote to Mr. Jones.After Dr. King’s assassination in 1968, she attended a rally in Boston’s Post Office Square. Then the college government president, Mrs. Clinton discouraged a campus organization of black women from initiating a hunger strike to protest Wellesley’s sparse African-American enrollment and (non-existent) black faculty. She pushed instead for a two-day student strike.Mrs. Clinton said she came to believe that “taking to the streets” and “giving speeches” was not enough to stir real change — a claim that would foreshadow much of her advocacy work, as well as one of her recurring critiques of Mr. Obama.After Wellesley, she went to Yale Law School. Though it teemed with radical activism in the early 1970s — and New Haven was aflame over a Black Panthers murder trial — Mrs. Clinton immersed herself in the less inflammatory field of child advocacy. She provided legal help for victims of child abuse and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services, spending months on a case involving a foster mother at risk of losing custody of a 2-year-old girl.By the time Mrs. Clinton moved to Arkansas in 1974, she had acquired a number of African-American friends and colleagues. She also had difficulty accepting what she saw as remnants of the “Old South.” She was appalled that Mr. Faubus, the segregationist governor, still had a following and opposed Bill Clinton in the Democratic primary for governor in 1986. Mr. Faubus lost with 33 per cent of the vote. (“You could put a chicken on the ballot,” she says now, “and he’d get 30 percent.”)In the interview, Mrs. Clinton recalled meeting Mr. Faubus in the mid-1970s. She described him as talented, beginning his gubernatorial career as a progressive who improved roads, schools and mental hospitals. “And then he made a Faustian bargain in 1957 because he threw his lot in with the forces of darkness,” she said.In Washington, as in Arkansas, Mrs. Clinton viewed civil rights within her broader portfolio of causes. Maggie Williams, her former chief of staff as first lady and a current campaign adviser, said that those interests were inevitably fused. “Low wages, poor health care and lack of educational opportunities disproportionately impact people of color in this country,” Ms. Williams said.Professor Lani Guinier of Harvard Law School, who is supporting Mr. Obama, said the key distinction between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton lies in how they view their relationship to power. In doing so, Ms. Guinier, whose nomination as assistant attorney general for civil rights in 1993 was pummeled by conservative groups and aborted by the White House, referred to their respective biographies.Mrs. Clinton “is the talented lawyer serving her clients,” Ms. Guinier said. Mr. Obama is the organizer, she said, “who sees the source of his power as the ability to inspire people to mobilize.”Referring to the possibility of the nation’s election of a historic first, a black or a woman, Mrs. Clinton said last week, “In a way, it’s a good problem to have. But it is a problem.”'"
"'08-02-02,'0','Via Dance Collaborative expresses a sweetly optimistic belief in group exploration. This four-year-old troupe develops “new work in a collegial, mutually supportive atmosphere,” according to the program notes for its current show at Dance New Amsterdam.So it is perhaps against Via’s core belief, and thus moot, to offer the following advice: Find someone really, really old and really, really crotchety (no cracks about critics, please) and give that person free rein to inject nasty, bothersome comments into that atmosphere. The troupe’s fine dancers have nice chemistry and plenty of varied ideas. But they need someone — crotchety outsider or no — to be absolutely ruthless with those ideas if they are to unearth the actual art within all the material they produce.Take Janice Lancaster’s “Weren’t you always distracted by expectation, as if every event announced a beloved.” It races around from thought to thought, much like a game of tag, one of the many symbols used in depicting romantic relationships.The strongest moments are diminished: for example, when a dancer thrusts her hands into tall drinking glasses, making herself into a frustrated creature both fragile and dangerous (a lover, in other words). She might shatter at any minute; when her male partner leads her offstage in torturous manner, having her step from one overturned tumbler to another as he rotates three of them on the floor, it is one of the few passages that seem to have been created by someone who has been in love and thought about what that means and how movement might express it. Then the boisterous work rushes off to tag the next idea, and this meaning is never allowed to bloom.Dawn Poirier’s “Sometimes in, Sometimes out” is less rambling, but it does not push beyond an initial idea of a loner who is set against group patterns. The final piece, Katie Swords’s “When it gets dark enough, you can see the stars ...,” set to Zoe Keating’s swelling, evocative score, is the surest. No wheels are re-invented. But this portrait of yearning women, twirling about in Renee Kurz’s swirling white dresses under Carrie Wood’s elegiac lighting, has a quiet intensity and purpose. It’s a start.Via Dance Collaborative performs through Sunday at Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan; (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com.'"
"'08-02-02,'0','President Bush’s excesses in the name of fighting terrorism are legion. To avoid accountability, his administration has repeatedly sought early dismissal of lawsuits that might finally expose government misconduct, brandishing flimsy claims that going forward would put national security secrets at risk.The courts have been far too willing to go along. In cases involving serious allegations of kidnapping, torture and unlawful domestic eavesdropping, judges have blocked plaintiffs from pursuing their claims without taking a hard look at the government’s basis for invoking the so-called state secrets privilege: its insistence that revealing certain documents or other evidence would endanger the nation’s security.As a result, victims of serious abuse have been denied justice, fundamental rights have been violated and the constitutional system of checks and balances has been grievously undermined.Congress — which has allowed itself to be bullied on national security issues for far too long — may now be ready to push back. The House and Senate are developing legislation that would give victims fair access to the courts and make it harder for the government to hide illegal or embarrassing conduct behind such unsupported claims.Last week, Senator Edward Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, and Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, jointly introduced the State Secrets Protection Act. The measure would require judges to examine the actual documents or other evidence for which the state secrets privilege is invoked, rather than relying on government affidavits asserting that the evidence is too sensitive to be publicly disclosed. Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and an important supporter of the reform, has scheduled a hearing on the bill for Feb. 13. Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, expects to introduce a similar measure in the House.'"
"'08-02-02,'0','“It is immaterial whether we are in a formal recession,” said Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, chief economic adviser to John McCain, a leading Republican contender. “We are growing way too slowly.”The unemployment rate, which jumped in December to nearly 5 percent from 4.7 percent, was essentially unchanged, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said, declining to 4.9 percent.Adding to the indications that the fall in payroll jobs in January could portend worse to come, the bureau issued one of its periodic benchmark revisions, based on more complete data. This revision showed much weaker job creation over the past year than initially reported.“They took away on average 16,000 jobs a month,” said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at Global Insight. “It suggests that income was lower than previously thought and consumers are more stressed than we previously thought.”There were other signs of a potential recession, which is generally defined as a period extending at least several months in which economic activity shrinks, resulting in fewer jobs, weaker investment and less spending. The employment report came a day after the Commerce Department said that the economy had expanded at a minuscule annual rate of 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter.The two reports convinced many on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve, trying to reverse the slide, would continue to cut the benchmark interest rate that it controls, even after the sharp reduction of 1.25 percentage points last month to 3 percent. Some analysts suggested that the federal funds rate could be reduced to 2 percent this year, putting downward pressure as it falls on mortgage and consumer loan rates.“The key story right now is whether fiscal stimulus and the Fed’s interest rate cuts can arrest the sliding economy,” said Ethan Harris, chief domestic economist at Lehman Brothers. “It’s a kind of race against time.”The economy has displayed a few bright spots lately, including an uptick in consumer confidence and a report Friday that manufacturing activity bounced back unexpectedly in January. Those reports have been overwhelmed by bleaker news elsewhere, however, like a further fall in construction spending.The jobs report only added to the gloom. The long-term unemployed — those who have been seeking work for at least six months — represented 18.3 percent of the nation’s 7.65 million men and women looking for jobs. That was up from 16.2 percent a year ago, which helps explain why Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, the two Democratic candidates for president, called on Congress to include in its stimulus package an extension of unemployment benefits beyond the present 26 weeks.“Today’s report that the economy actually lost jobs in January confirms my view that we are sliding into a second Bush recession,” Senator Clinton said in a statement, referring to the 2001 downturn, which ran, according to official accounting, from March 2001 through November. Few economists, however, blame Mr. Bush for a recession that began so early in his term.Mr. Bush called on the Senate to quickly reach agreement on a House stimulus plan and get the bill to his desk for signature. “The fundamentals are strong,” Mr. Bush said, speaking to workers after touring the headquarters of Hallmark Cards.“We’re just in a rough patch,” he added. “I’m confident we can get through this rough patch, and one way to do it is for Congress and the administration to work collaboratively and get this deal done.”Employment has been weakening for months. While employers continued to add jobs last year, they did so at an ever slower pace, averaging 95,000 jobs a month. That was down from 175,000 a month in 2006, when the recovery from the 2001 recession was still in full swing.“Taken as a whole, you clearly have a deceleration of the rate of job growth,” said Jan Hatzius, chief domestic economist at Goldman Sachs.More than half of the nation’s industries lost jobs in January, with construction, manufacturing and finance topping the list. The private sector managed to add only 1,000 jobs, in part because of gains in health services and in some upper-end hiring of accountants, lawyers, computer specialists and architects.Government employment pulled the job market into negative territory, contracting by 18,000 jobs, mostly at state universities and community colleges. The decline reflected pressure on state budgets as a weakening economy cuts into tax revenue.The monthly employment reports have served as chapter headings in the tale of a housing slump and credit crisis that gradually spread to other sectors. The December job count, originally reported as an increase of just 18,000 jobs, was the first strong signal that the overall economy was hurting. That number was revised to 82,000 on Friday. On the other hand, job creation in November turned out to be 55,000 less than initially reported.Indeed, job growth in nearly every month last year was less than initially reported, and by December there were 376,000 fewer jobs than the original total, the bureau concluded as a result of its benchmark revision. That revision is based on a once-a-year count of all jobs covered by unemployment insurance.Apart from the shrinking job numbers, inflation-adjusted wages and hours worked also declined.“It is awfully tough,” said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute, “to find a silver lining in this latest jobs report.”'"
"'08-02-02,'0','“I’m worried most about Georgia,” said the Best Friends veterinarian Dr. Frank McMillan, an expert on the emotional health of animals, who edited the textbook “Mental Health and Well-Being in Animals.” “You don’t have the luxury of asking her, or any of these animals: ‘What happened to you in your past life? How can we stop you from hurting?’“So here we are left with figuring out how to bring joy to her life,” he said of Georgia, known to lick the face of anyone who comes near. “We want to offset the unpleasant memories that dwell in her brain.”Mr. Vick, once the highest-paid player in the N.F.L., is serving a 23-month sentence in a federal prison in Leavenworth, Kan., for bankrolling his Bad Newz Kennels dogfighting operation and helping execute dogs that were not good fighters. Dogs were electrocuted, hanged, drowned, shot or slammed to the ground, according to court records. Two mass graves with the remains of eight pit bulls were found on Mr. Vick’s property in rural Virginia.Pit bulls seized from illegal fighting operations are usually euthanized after becoming property of the government. The Humane Society of the United States and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals recommended that Mr. Vick’s dogs be euthanized, but many animal rescue organizations urged the prosecutors to let the dogs live.The government agreed to give them a second chance after Mr. Vick agreed to pay $928,073 for evaluation and care of all the dogs. They were seen by animal experts, who named the dogs, and were eventually dispersed to eight rescue organizations for adoption, rehabilitation or lifetime care in sanctuaries, where they have been neutered. Only one of the Vick dogs was euthanized for aggression against people.Best Friends, which is caring for more dogs than any other organization, received about $389,000. Many of their dogs are expected to be adopted after they are rehabilitated and matched with the right families. Vick’s 25 other dogs are in foster care all over the country.“This is a great opportunity to highlight the fact that the victims in the case are the animals themselves,” said Rebecca J. Huss, a Valparaiso University law professor, animal law expert and court-appointed guardian for Vick’s dogs.Bay Area Doglovers Responsible About Pitbulls, or BAD RAP, which helped evaluate the dogs, has 10 in foster care. Donna Reynolds, the group’s executive director, said, “There are dogs that are able to handle and survive the past with a good attitude, then ones that are going to be shut down and not take it anymore.“Best Friends got the dogs that pretty much aren’t going to do so well,” she added, noting that those dogs included the known fighters and Mr. Vick’s champion pit bull, Lucas, who, by court order, will live out his days at the sanctuary.Life at Best Friends is nothing like it was at Mr. Vick’s property on Moonlight Road in Smithfield, Va., where many of the dogs were found chained to buried car axles. They slept on concrete. Their water, if any, was kept in algae-covered bowls. Most were underfed. Some showed recent lacerations.Here, they live in a 3,700-acre sanctuary that is covered by juniper trees and sagebrush, and surrounded by canyons and red-rock formations. They have food called Canine Caviar, squeaky toys, fluffy beds and four full-time caregivers. The caregiver on the night shift curls up with the dogs for naps.They are assigned to an area of the sanctuary called Dogtown Heights, what Best Friends calls a gated community. Vick’s dogs have their own building with heated floors, sound-absorbing barriers and skylights. Each has an individual dog run because, for now, the dogs must remain isolated, for safety’s sake.Little Red is a tiny rust-colored female whose teeth were filed, most likely because she was bait for the Bad Newz fighters. Handlers cannot explain why loud noises make her jumpy.Cherry, a black-and-white male, has what seems to be chemical burns on his back. His file at Best Friends says he loves car rides and having his backside rubbed. But like many of Mr. Vick’s pit bulls, he is petrified of new situations and new people.Oscar cowers in the corner of his run when strangers arrive. Shadow runs in circles. Black Bear pants so heavily that he seems on the verge of hyperventilation.All but one of the Vick dogs at Best Friends wear green collars, signaling that they are good with people. But Meryl, who arrived with a rap sheet, wears a red collar.She was aggressive toward the veterinary staff at a previous shelter. When Best Friends evaluated her in November, she lunged at a veterinary technician, snapping at him three times. By court order, she must stay at Best Friends forever.Mr. Vick paid $18,275 for the lifetime care of each of his dogs here but one. Denzel was deemed highly adoptable, so his fee was only $5,000.The actual cost for personnel and medical staff to care for the dogs, said Best Friends officials, is much higher at the sanctuary, a no-kill, nonprofit facility for 2,000 animals. For example, Denzel needed a blood transfusion to treat a tick-borne virus. Donations must make up the difference.John Garcia, the assistant dog care manager of Dogtown, which houses about 500 dogs, said pit bulls that are withdrawn or aggressive toward humans break his heart because they are bred to be people-friendly. “With most of these dogs, even Meryl, their actions are based on fear,” said Mr. Garcia, who communicates with the dogs in soothing baby talk. “The biggest job we have with these guys is teaching them that it’s O.K. to trust people. It may take months or years, but we’re very stubborn. We won’t give up on them.”Because the dogs are still adjusting to their surroundings, it is difficult to predict how many of them will become adoptable. They arrived Jan. 2 from Richmond, Va., on a chartered airplane, stressed after eight months in shelters. In initial evaluations last September, many lay flat and looked frightened. Now, many respond to caregivers by wagging their tails and giving sloppy kisses.“They have improved by light-years,” Mr. Garcia said, adding that it would take patience and a lot of time for these dogs to be happy and safe in an adoptive home.Caregivers walk the dogs several times a day and spend time in their kennels, praising and caressing them. It is progress when a dog like Cherry does not need to be carried, because he is afraid to walk on a leash. It is monumental when Shadow approaches them instead of retreating.“We want to get them to understand that being around people isn’t necessarily a bad thing; that we won’t hurt them,” Mr. Garcia said. “The worst thing we could do is push them too hard, too fast.”Mr. Garcia, an expert in working with aggressive dogs, said getting some of these pit bulls accustomed to other dogs would be the toughest task. Initially, 10 were evaluated as aggressive toward other dogs.So far, there has been only one fight. Layla was put accidentally into the same dog run as Ray. She immediately attacked, biting his shoulder in a death grip.One of their main caregivers, Carissa Hendrick, pried Layla’s jaws from Ray. She said it would take a lot of positive reinforcement to teach these dogs to coexist.“There’s just so much we don’t know about them, and that’s frustrating,” Ms. Hendrick said, adding that she wished she could talk to the men involved in Mr. Vick’s operation to find out what these dogs have endured. “Oh, Ellen Belly, what happened to you?”Ellen arrived at Best Friends overweight, looking more like a sausage than a fighter. She was a breeding dog but had spent time in the ring. One side of her face droops from nerve damage, but she is still affectionate and loves to offer her belly for rubs.Lucas was Vick’s champion, a 65-pound muscular brown dog with a face mottled with dark scars. He is so friendly and confident that his trainers suspect he was pampered.“I bet you ate steak every day, didn’t you, Lucas?” the caregiver McKenzie Garcia, who is married to John, said. “I bet they took care of you because you made them money.”Every Vick dog here has a Personalized Emotional Rehabilitation Plan. Caregivers rate each dog in several categories. How fearful was Little Red today? How confident was Black Bear? How much did Meryl enjoy life?Recording the dogs’ progress will help Dr. McMillan, the veterinarian, track their well-being. “DogTown,” on the National Geographic Channel, also plans to follow the progress of several of Mr. Vick’s dogs, including Georgia.“The successful rehab rate for these kinds of dogs is unknown because nobody has ever studied it until now,” Dr. McMillan said. “You might see an incredibly friendly dog, but does that dog’s personality change over several weeks, over several months, after psychological trauma? Are they hard-wired to be aggressive, or can they change? What’s the best way to work with them?”The plan is to determine how to keep these dogs happy, even if a real home is not in their future.Whether Georgia will find happiness is a big question. Dr. McMillan said she exhibited behavior that might be coping mechanisms for past trauma.Georgia gnaws on her doghouse. She flipped her bed over so much that her handlers removed it. When toys are around, she often ignores people. Georgia, who was called Jane at Bad Newz Kennels, was sold to Mr. Vick in 2001 to help start his dogfighting business. She is thought to be his oldest dog, but her handlers can only guess that she is about 7. Dogs’ ages are usually estimated by examining their teeth, but she has none.Having those teeth extracted, Dr. McMillan and other vets said, must have been excruciating. Even with medication, dogs are in pain after losing one tooth, which may take more than an hour of digging, prying and leveling to pull.“These dogs have been beaten and starved and tortured, and they have every reason not to trust us,” Mr. Garcia said as Georgia crawled onto his lap, melted into him for an afternoon nap and began to snore. “But deep down, they love us and still want to be with us. It is amazing how resilient they are.”'"
"'08-02-02,'0','The lights of New York did, however, inspire his most famous piece, the “Jazz” bowl, commissioned by an anonymous client in 1930. Originally trained as a ceramicist, Mr. Schreckengost was then working for the Cowan Pottery Studio in Rocky River, Ohio. One day he picked up what looked like a routine order for a punch bowl with a New York theme.Mr. Schreckengost made a large bowl, glazed in black and vibrant blue and decorated with stylized images of that city’s Jazz Age revelry: skyscrapers and ships, stars and neon signs, a Champagne bottle and a tray of cocktails. The fact that it was still Prohibition did not deter him.The client, a woman named Eleanor, was delighted with the bowl, Mr. Schreckengost learned. Her husband, Franklin, liked it too. Mrs. Roosevelt, then the first lady of New York State, ordered two more “Jazz” bowls from Mr. Schreckengost, one for her home in Hyde Park, another for a house on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington that she fully expected to occupy in 1933.The bowl was later put into limited production, selling for $50; fewer than 50 bowls of this kind are known to have been made. Widely photographed, the “Jazz” bowls are considered signal examples of Art Deco style. In 2004 Sotheby’s sold one of the $50 bowls at auction for $254,400.Victor Sebring Schreckengost was born on June 26, 1906, in Sebring, Ohio. His father was a commercial potter, as were two uncles. Victor and his siblings cheerfully made their own toys from the lumps of clay their father brought home; melted crayons made fine glaze.In 1929 Victor Schreckengost earned a diploma in design, with a minor in ceramics, from the Cleveland Institute of Art — or, more precisely, from the Cleveland School of Art, as it was then known. He did further study at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Vienna. There everyone spelled his first name with a “k,” and Mr. Schreckengost became so accustomed to it that he kept the spelling ever after.Returning to Cleveland, Mr. Schreckengost joined the School of Art faculty in 1930; in 1933 he created the industrial design program there, the first of its kind in the country. He taught generations of well-known industrial designers, among them Joe Oros, chief designer the 1965 Ford Mustang. In World War II Mr. Schreckengost served in the Navy, in which he helped design radar-recognition systems and, at the war’s end, artificial limbs.Mr. Schreckengost’s first wife, the former Nadine Averill, whom he married in 1935, died in 1975. He is survived by his second wife, the former Virgene Nowacek, known as Gene, whom he married in 1991; three stepsons, Chip Nowacek of Cleveland Heights, David Nowacek of Milwaukee and Douglas Nowacek of Tallahassee; and eight step-grandchildren.His other well-known designs include the “Flower Shop” china pattern and Jiffy Ware line of ceramic food containers for American Limoges in the 1930s; the first cab-over-engine truck, designed in 1933, which added five feet to the hauling area; spectacular streamlined pedal cars from the late 1930s and afterward, shaped like race cars, jet planes and atomic missiles; and the Sears Spaceliner bicycle, from the mid-1960s.Mr. Schreckengost’s design credo — function first, form after — was perhaps nowhere more evident than in the creation of his “Beverly Hills” lawn chair, made in 1941. The chair comprised two pieces of brightly colored stamped steel on a tubular base. To mold a comfortable seat, Mr. Schreckengost cut a barrel to the appropriate height, put eight inches of soft clay on top and covered the clay with a thin sheet of plastic. He promised a drink to each person who sat on the mound of clay.Four hundred twenty-eight democratic derrières later, Mr. Schreckengost had the mold for his very functional seat.'"

Some are in high-risk areas perhaps best turned into green space. But other properties are in the middle of healthy, recovering neighborhoods.Selling these at below-market value would accomplish three things: increase housing supply at the low end of the housing market; save the state maintenance costs; and cure the jack-o’-lantern effect that stalls neighborhood recovery.Keeping viable properties in the Louisiana Land Trusts risks further depreciation of nearby homes.

"'08-02-02,'0','A doctor who left her home in Lower Manhattan on Sept. 10, 2001, and never returned died in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center the next morning, a state appellate court in Manhattan has ruled.In a 4-to-1 decision on Thursday, the five-judge panel of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court ruled that the doctor, Sneha Anne Philip, 31, an internist, probably passed the World Trade Center at the time of the attack after a night out, and that her gregariousness and medical training would have predisposed her to stop and help.She and her husband, Ronald Lieberman, lived nearby, at 225 Rector Place.A court-appointed guardian for Dr. Philip suggested in a lower-court proceeding that she met with foul play because she had alcohol and drug problems and because she sometimes went home with people she met in bars, the ruling said.But the majority on the appeals panel dismissed that conclusion as based on hearsay.“There is no question that they had a happy marriage, and importantly, there was no evidence that his wife’s nights out involved any risky behavior,” the majority said, granting her husband’s petition to have her death attributed to the Sept. 11 attack so she could be officially recognized as a 9/11 victim.The ruling reversed a June 2006 decision by Surrogate Renee R. Roth, which found a statutory presumption of death three years after Dr. Philip disappeared, on Sept. 10, 2004, but refused to declare her a victim of the attack.In his dissent, Justice Bernard J. Malone Jr. said that the majority ruling was based on “speculation,” and that it was “equally probable” that professional and personal problems had led to Dr. Philip’s “unfortunate fate.”'"

"'08-02-02,'0','A binge of borrowing and expansion left them with a surfeit of capacity heading into the recession of 2001-2, and their stocks tanked. Utility stocks usually hold up far better during recessions than the broad market, but this time they underperformed.“A lot of them had gotten into trouble building new plants, then demand for power greatly declined,” said Justin McCann, a utility analyst for S.& P. “People stayed away from utilities because there was a real stench to them.”They began smelling sweeter in the economic rebound that began in 2002. The stocks continued to race higher along with energy prices. With regulatory constraints removed, the generators have traded much like conventional oil and gas companies — even more so for owners of coal and nuclear plants.THESE utilities may not be the havens they once were if a recession and bear market are at hand. The decline in energy prices and demand for fuel that might accompany an economic downturn would do the unregulated generators no favors.“The current situation makes them not nearly as defensive as they have been for the last 60 years,” said Paul Justice, who follows the sector for Morningstar. “Typically utilities are not at the end of a five-year bull market when a recession starts.”The outlook may seem brighter for the more highly regulated distributors, but Mr. Justice has doubts. Lower interest rates have provided an excuse for regulators to reduce the return on capital that the utilities are allowed to earn, he said.Despite that outlook, he recommends unregulated utilities like Exelon, NRG and Entergy. Among more traditional regulated businesses, he likes PG&E, Consolidated Edison and the Southern Company.Mr. McCann said that the distributors’ high yields should underpin demand. But his view of the utility sector generally is only “cautiously positive.”His favorite generators include the Public Service Enterprise Group, Exelon, Constellation Energy and Entergy, companies that he expects to benefit from hedging exposure to falling energy prices. Among more tightly regulated utilities, he likes Edison International, which owns Southern California Edison.Robb J. Parlanti, an analyst and fund manager at Turner Investment Partners, is neutral on the sector. He holds stock in Constellation, Allegheny Energy and NRG because he likes the companies, not the industry.He wonders whether the utility business has changed faster than public understanding of it. He noted that utility stocks were comparatively strong during the volatile second half of last year.Investors would “always flock to them in a flight to safety,” Mr. Parlanti said. But when the sector sharply underperformed after the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cuts, it suggested to him that safety might not be where they take off to next.'"
"'08-02-02,'0','Q. Have you loosened any guidelines to make loans easier?A. No, but what happens is that banks will use our loan guarantees if it is a business that maybe needs longer payback periods, or maybe an unconventional structure or may not quite meet their credit standards. So in a situation where banks are pulling back on credit somewhat, having our guarantee becomes more important in reaching those businesses.Q. Can you do anything to push them to be more lenient?A. We have a nationwide effort going on right now to spend time with banks to make sure that they are looking at using all of our products where they are relevant. I personally am getting involved in outreach to major banks to make sure they are helping get capital to small business.Q. The economic stimulus would double the amount small business can deduct for expenses. Why is this a good idea?A. It encourages small businesses to make investments now, and provides them with the financial incentive to do so. And those investments fuel the economy. Secondly, they are making those investments to expand their business, or to leverage their employees through capital investments, or they’re upgrading their equipment.Q. Is S.B.A. proposing anything for the upcoming government budget to shore up small businesses?A. The uncertainty about whether the tax cuts, which are set to expire in 2010, will be extended, is hurting small business right now in terms of investment and understanding what their ability to deploy cash is going to be. If those taxes go up, they’re going to have less money to hire, less money to expand and less money to invest in their business.Another very important thing is putting in place policies that reduce health care costs for small business. The president has been a strong advocate of small-business health plans, which allow small businesses to band together and buy health care through buying groups. It’s a simple way they can leverage size. In addition, he has proposed giving small businesses the same tax benefits that large businesses have in buying health care.And we need to open foreign markets for small business. Right now, for example, small businesses represent 35 percent of our exports to Colombia. We want to open those markets so small business can expand their revenue base and increase our competitiveness.Q. Why are these free trade agreements important?A. One reason is that they provide better intellectual property protection so if you’ve got a technology product or a knowledge-based product, you’ve got to make sure they’re protected when they go overseas. And these agreements simplify the administrative process and make it faster to get goods over the border.Q. What more can the agency do to counter criticism that it’s not doing enough to help small businesses, particularly those that are female-owned, to win government contracts?A. Our contracts to women-owned small businesses reached $11.6 billion in 2006, a record level. It was also the largest growth in history, by $1.5 billion. The federal government hasn’t reached its 5 percent goal for purchase of its good and services from women-owned businesses, but we’re hitting records every year.We are holding more outreach events and events to match businesses with buyers. We also have goals for all district offices to hold those events, and those have been ratcheted up this year. We are also providing technology tools so agencies can find the right small-business vendor to meet their particular need, and putting more S.B.A. people on site with federal contractors. We retrained the entire field network to help small businesses in the contracting arena.So we are doing more than we ever have before — some of it’s people, some of it’s technology and some of it is extended outreach.'"

"'08-02-02,'0','Now, if only his team can have such a winning week. The sole tidbit of news concerned receiver Plaxico Burress, who is hobbled with more than the chronically sore ankle that prevented him from practicing most of the season. Burress, the team’s top receiver, now has a sore knee, too, which kept him from practicing all week. He is listed as questionable for the game.“It’s a day-to-day thing with Plaxico right now,” Coughlin said. “He was better yesterday than he was the day before, and hopefully he’ll be better even today. He does have the ankle, which has been an issue all year long. And whether it has anything to do with it or not, a knee that he has had problems with in the past bothered him. He had some swelling. And that swelling has reduced somewhat.”Defensive end Osi Umenyiora (thigh), guard Rich Seubert (knee) and cornerback Kevin Dockery (hip) are all listed as probable.Most of the 30-minute news conference had a more relaxed, hopeful tenor. Coughlin was asked about how the Giants, with few championship expectations when the season began, had excelled as underdogs. Surprising detractors has become a rallying cry for the Giants, who are 12-point underdogs against the unbeaten Patriots on Sunday.“Whether or not I have to utilize it verbally to the team, it’s there,” Coughlin said. “It’s very much of a part of us. We have been underdogs pretty much every time we have played. Going on the road, we have been underdogs. We’ve been underdogs at home. So it’s kind of been a natural thing. The main theme that comes out of that is having something to prove.”Coughlin took softball questions lobbed to him to expound on his admiration for the Mara and Tisch families, which share ownership of the Giants; his evolving relationship with defensive end Michael Strahan, who has emerged as one of Coughlin’s loudest supporters; and his memories of the Giants’ coaching staff in the late 1980s, when Coughlin and Patriots Coach Bill Belichick were assistants under Bill Parcells.A Hungarian reporter asked Coughlin about what he screamed to kicker Lawrence Tynes in Green Bay two Sundays ago, after Tynes missed a fourth-quarter field-goal attempt in sub-zero temperatures at Lambeau Field. Coughlin, in the type of angry outburst for which he had long been known, shouted at Tynes as he came off the field.“I actually yelled, ‘How’s the weather out there?’ ” Coughlin said. “Because over on the side where I was, it was cold.”At one point, a reporter said that Coughlin’s players had noted their coach’s use of the words “fun” and “enjoyment” for the first time in his four-year stint as Giants coach. The reporter asked Coughlin if he could simply utter “fun.”Coughlin smiled, then bent to the microphone. “Fun,” he said.After the last question was asked, Coughlin posed behind a table holding a shiny Giants helmet, a Patriots helmet and the Lombardi Trophy, the prize for Sunday’s winning team.He picked up the Giants helmet and posed at the behest of an army of photographers. Flashes lit the room like a strobe light. Someone shouted out for Coughlin to grab the Lombardi Trophy.He did not touch it. He put the helmet down and walked back into the shadows.'"
"'08-02-02,'0','Microsoft stuck to that formula for years with its Internet search and advertising — without success. It did buy an online ad agency, aQuantive, last May for $6 billion, a sizable move given Microsoft’s tradition of making small, niche-filling acquisitions.The losses, however, continue to mount in Microsoft’s online business, while Google makes billions in profit.The Google challenge to Microsoft extends beyond online search and advertising. Google is at the forefront of companies offering software as online services, including Web-based alternatives to Microsoft’s lucrative desktop products like word processing, spreadsheets and presentation programs.Mr. Gates, Microsoft’s largest shareholder, has said that Google is the company that most reminds him of Microsoft in terms of its broad ambitions and demanding corporate culture. Mr. Gates, who is spending more time on philanthropy these days, blessed the Yahoo bid, but it is Mr. Ballmer’s brainchild.And Mr. Ballmer clearly views the Yahoo bid, and the Google threat, in broad terms. A Yahoo deal, he said, would represent “the next major milestone in Microsoft’s transformation.”Microsoft, too, is moving to offer more software features as Web-based services, though it sees a future that revolves around both personal computer software and online services.Microsoft has been forced to adopt a new strategy for a different kind of threat than it has confronted, and usually dispatched, in the past.“This shows just how worried Microsoft is by Google,” said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. “Microsoft has faced competitive threats before, but none with the size, strength, profitability and momentum of Google.”In the conference call, Mr. Ballmer conceded that Microsoft needed a big move to try to catch up in the online business. “The market continues to grow, and the leader continues to consolidate position,” he said.Microsoft, analysts say, finds itself in a battle where improving its search algorithms and online ad software is not going to be enough. Google has impressive technology, to be sure, but it also enjoys the torrid growth that falls to the leader in highly networked businesses like Internet search and ads.Google’s edge in search traffic then attracts more advertisers and Web publishers, so there are more ads in Google’s auctions, which makes them more efficient. Each advantage reinforces the other, in what economists call “network effects.”One measure of the network advantage, analysts estimate, is that Google collects 40 percent to 100 percent more revenue per search than either Yahoo or Microsoft.Microsoft, of course, is no stranger to the power of network effects. It was the master of that strategy in the personal computer era. Its early lead in PC operating systems, and its efforts to encourage independent software developers to write applications for Windows, paved the way for Microsoft’s dominance.More programs ran on Windows than on any other operating system, so more users bought PCs running Windows. Apple, by contrast, never built up the developer network as Microsoft did.In the Internet era, network effects are working against Microsoft as it battles Google.With the Yahoo bid, analysts say, Microsoft is trying to buy a big enough share of the market to be a credible alternative to Google with online advertisers.In the most recent quarter, Microsoft had online revenue of $863 million, compared with $4.8 billion at Google. Yahoo and Microsoft together had more than $2.6 billion in revenue, still trailing well behind Google but in a far stronger competitive position.But the trends in online advertising are working to Google’s advantage as it continues to gain share. The more Google’s momentum accelerates, the more difficult it will be for Microsoft to catch up, no matter how much it might improve its search technology.While $44.6 billion is a hefty price tag, many analysts say it will be worth it if Microsoft can close the gap with Google. On Wall Street, Microsoft suffers from the perception that it is several steps behind in the march toward the Internet future.Microsoft, analysts note, has grown solidly for years, but investors give it little credit. Its stock price has long been stagnant, despite the company’s extremely profitable businesses. The Office division alone had quarterly revenue of $4.8 billion — equal to Google — and an astronomical $3.2 billion in operating profits. The Windows unit is even more profitable.“Microsoft needs to show that it is going to make the online business work, and this is about shaking things up that needed shaking up,” said Charles di Bona, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.Asked whether the move amounted to an admission of failure of the company’s earlier strategy, Mr. Ballmer replied that some people might take that view.“But I made the judgment that for the long-term health of this company, and for the long-term interests of our shareholders, that acquiring Yahoo is a good thing,” he said.'"
"'08-02-02,'0','Each company has persistently tried to best Google but failed. “No one can compete with Google on their own anymore,” said Jon Miller, the former chairman and chief executive of AOL, which itself is struggling to compete in online advertising. “There has to be consolidation among the major players. It has been a long time coming, and now it is here.”If consummated, the deal would instantly redraw the competitive landscape on the Internet. And it would escalate the rivalry between Microsoft and Google, already the most intense high-stakes battle in the technology world, over who will dominate the booming online advertising business.The offer of $31 a share represents a 62 percent premium over Yahoo’s closing stock price of $19.18 on Thursday, a far cry from its peak of $118.75 right before the dot-com bubble crash. The offer includes stock and cash and is likely to put intense pressure on Mr. Yang and Yahoo’s board, which ended earlier merger discussions with Microsoft about a year ago.Microsoft shares fell 6.6 percent Friday, to close at $30.45; Yahoo rose 48 percent to close at $28.38.Yahoo has spent billions of dollars in recent years to develop better search and advertising technology, and started a clumsy effort to create Hollywood-style entertainment for the Web. But Yahoo’s growth has lagged, prompting Mr. Yang, who was appointed chief executive last summer amid growing shareholder dissatisfaction, to announce major layoffs this week — 1,000 of its 14,300 workers. He also warned investors that a turnaround was not likely until 2009.For Microsoft, the bid underscores both the company’s urgency and its determination to succeed online. “I personally thought long and hard about this,” Mr. Ballmer said Friday morning after the bid was announced. The bid for Yahoo, he said, was “the right path.”The two companies, distant No. 2 and No. 3 players in Internet search, previously considered combining into a more powerful force that would have the power and audience to take on Google, No. 1 by a wide margin in both Internet search and online advertising.Mr. Ballmer met several times in late 2006 and early 2007 with Terry S. Semel, then Yahoo’s chief executive, people involved in the talks said. After a series of secret meetings between the sides in hotels around California and elsewhere, Yahoo’s board decided against progressing with the talks, betting that its stock would turn around, these people said. Mr. Yang, in particular, was adamantly against selling the company, they said.Mr. Ballmer constantly consulted with Bill Gates, Microsoft’s chairman. Then this week teams of bankers and lawyers holed up in two low-slung podlike buildings on Microsoft’s campus plotted how much to bid. After Yahoo reported weaker-than-expected earnings on Tuesday and its stock fell, Microsoft, which had been considering a bid in the mid-$30 range, settled on $31 a share. “A year has gone by, and the competitive situation has not improved,” Mr. Ballmer wrote in Thursday’s letter to the Yahoo board. Yahoo said Friday that its board would evaluate Microsoft’s bid “carefully and promptly in the context of Yahoo’s strategic plans.”Analysts say few companies, other than Google, would have the resources to compete with Microsoft’s bid. On Friday, Yahoo’s bankers — Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers — were canvassing behind the scenes for other suitors, putting out feelers to the likes of News Corporation, AT&T and others.And Google is not likely to enter the fray because of probable antitrust objections. A Google spokesman said Friday that it would be “premature to comment.”The proposed merger, if accepted by Yahoo’s board, could bring renewed antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft, which spent years in court battling the Justice Department.Even if it is ultimately approved, the deal could face lengthy delays. It took the Federal Trade Commission nearly nine months to clear Google’s far smaller proposed buyout of the advertising specialist DoubleClick. That deal, announced in April, remains under review in Europe.“This is an order of magnitude larger and will require much more scrutiny and data,” said Carl W. Tobias, the Williams professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, in Virginia. Professor Tobias said, “Obviously Google will try to weigh in and try to persuade regulators that it does raise serious questions.”A Microsoft-Yahoo merger would give Web publishers and online advertisers “a more competitive and compelling No. 2” to Google, thus enhancing competition and consumer welfare, said Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel.The combination of Yahoo and Microsoft would create a more powerful counterweight to Google. Yahoo’s audience, already the largest on the Internet, would be bolstered by the tens of millions of users of Microsoft’s services, creating a much larger online display advertising business. In Internet search, the market share of the two companies would rise to 31 percent of the American market, according to comScore. That would still be far below Google’s 58 percent share, but would help the companies attract more advertisers and higher prices for ads.Microsoft executives said the merger would provide it with more engineering talent and technology infrastructure, and would result in annual savings of $1 billion.The combination will also bring Microsoft relationships with a long list of publishers and advertisers, bolstering the company’s quest to become a leading seller of ads not only on its site, but on sites across the Web.Microsoft, which paid $6 billion last year for the online advertising specialist aQuantive, already sells ads on popular sites like Facebook and Digg, as Yahoo does on eBay, Comcast and the sites of hundreds of newspapers. Google, for its part, beat out Microsoft for deals with MySpace, AOL and others. The challenge of integrating the two companies could well become one of the most complex undertakings in Microsoft’s history. “In the world of mergers and acquisitions, this is as tough as it gets,” Mr. Yoffie added.In an interview, Mr. Ballmer acknowledged that a merger review and the integration of the two companies would take time, but he said that Microsoft would keep forging ahead in the meantime.“We’ll keep the pedal to the metal,” he said. “I assume Yahoo will keep the pedal to the metal.”'"

"'08-02-03,'0','The latest set of numbers “reinforces our sentiment that the market has, in fact, turned,” Daniel Baum, the chief operating officer of the company, said in the report.Economic distress signals are not nearly as widespread as they were in the early 1990s, and economists are still debating whether there will even be a recession this time.Nonetheless, the long advance and subsequent retreat in house prices in the region bear an eerie resemblance to the rise and fall of two decades ago. It is too soon to tell just how deep the current decline will be. But James W. Hughes, who has tracked the market for homes around New York City through cycles of boom and bust, said he expected it to be worse than — maybe twice as bad as — the fallout from the “real estate bubble” of the 1980s.Mr. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said that housing prices in New Jersey rose 145 percent from 1980 to 1988, then fell about 9 percent by 1992.The pattern for the suburbs in New York and Connecticut was similar, he said. That flow and ebb left people who stayed in their houses during that period with property values that more than doubled, on average.But the people who bought near the peak in 1988 faced significant losses if they had to sell quickly. Indeed, it took 10 years for house prices in New Jersey to return to their 1988 level, Mr. Hughes said. (Taking inflation into account, the recovery was not complete until 2002, he said.)“A lot of the pain was felt by peak-of-market buyers that bought in ’88,” Mr. Hughes said. “Those are the ones that really got stuck.”From 1998 to 2006, the suburban housing market was sizzling again, with prices of homes in New Jersey rising 135 percent during that period, he said. According to the data that Mr. Hughes uses, prices in the region peaked in mid-2007.Figures for Long Island show a similar pattern. In Nassau and Suffolk Counties, median home prices peaked in August and were lower by the end of the year than at the end of 2006, according to data compiled by the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island.Compared with most of the country, New York City property values have held up better. During the 12 months ending in November, prices in the metropolitan area fell 4.8 percent, according to Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices. But that was not as bad as the 7.8 percent drop in the Washington area and far better than the declines of more than 12 percent in Miami, San Diego, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Tampa, Fla.Property values in Sun Belt cities grew faster than those in New York in the latest run-up. That was a reversal of the pattern of the 1980s, when house prices in the New York area rose faster and higher than in the rest of the country, then sank faster and farther.Within the region, the closer to Manhattan, the better the situation looks.Homes in suburbs within a one-hour commute have not lost value as fast as those in the outer suburbs, said Jeffrey Otteau, president of the Otteau Valuation Group in East Brunswick, N.J. And Mr. Otteau forecasted that the closer suburbs would suffer only half of the decline of the outer suburbs by the time the market hit bottom early next year.“Up to this point, the state of the market is worse now in the outlying suburbs than it was in the ’89-’92 correction,” Mr. Otteau said.By his measure, those prices fell 15 percent during that recession and already are down almost 15 percent since they peaked in 2005, he said. In all, he predicted that prices in the outlying suburbs would decline by about 19 percent and would not reach their previous peak again until about 2014.Homeowners who are waiting for the market to rebound to sell their houses will regret that decision, Mr. Otteau said.“For those sellers who’ve decided to wait until spring to get what they think their house is worth, the spring they’re waiting for is a very long time off,” Mr. Otteau said. “Unless you have the ability to wait this out for five years, waiting is a losing game.”Mr. Hughes of Rutgers relies on a different set of numbers than Mr. Otteau cites, but both concluded that house prices in the region would drop by at least 15 percent in the current correction, despite the recent decline in interest rates.Although the local job market has not been battered by widespread layoffs as it was in the early 1990s, Mr. Hughes said he believed the housing market would suffer more this time because of the reckless lending practices that allowed so many people to buy homes with little or no money down.“I think the excesses of the subprime lending and extraordinarily low interest rates, as well as all those other exotic loans, really helped inflate the bubble,” Mr. Hughes said. “The correction from that and the fallout from the credit meltdown globally probably portends a more severe correction.”'"
"'08-02-03,'0','Some Sunnis opposed the legislation when it was up for a vote, fearing the new language would actually drive out some Baathists who remained in the government. But other Sunnis voted for it.The United States initially said little when the legislation was passed, and American officials said recently that they were still trying to figure out its implications.On Saturday, Ahmad Chalabi, a Shiite politician who has led efforts to ensure the Baath Party could not return to politics, said that all former Baathists now serving in the security services would lose their jobs, a total of 7,000 people.Although both Sunnis and Shiites were Baathists, more were Sunnis, particularly at the more senior levels in the party.In a news conference Saturday, Mr. Chalabi said Parliament only had itself to blame for approving the legislation.“This went through committee,” he said. “People should pay attention to what they are discussing and voting on.”Mr. Chalabi also announced that he had asked the prime minister to accelerate the payment of pensions for former Baathists. Under the legislation, the main benefit for former Baathists would be that virtually all of them would receive their pensions.Also on Saturday, the Interior Ministry raised the toll from the bombings Friday of two pet markets as more bodies were found and badly wounded people died, bringing the total to 98 dead and 123 wounded.A stream of cars carrying simple wooden coffins traveled to the southern city of Najaf, where those who are Shiite are usually buried, as Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and other high-ranking Iraqis strove to reassure Iraqis of their commitment to fighting such attacks.Using language similar to that employed by Western leaders in the wake of terrorist attacks, Gen. Aboud Qanbar, who is in charge of carrying out Fard al-Qanoon, the law enforcement plan for Baghdad, described those organizing the bombings as increasingly desperate, without religious faith and as killing “only to prove that they are here.”General Qanbar said that the only way to defeat attacks like these was to have more tactics to detect and stop the terrorists than the terrorists have to elude them. “If the terrorist has one tactic, we must have nine tactics we can use against them,” he said. “So what is left to the enemy now is making improvised explosive devices out of Pepsi-Cola cans and using ignorant people and deceiving them. This is a cheap and desperate way.”Maj. Gen. Jeffery Hammond, the commander of United States troops in Baghdad, said there were indications that the two women who carried out Friday’s attacks were mentally disabled, and he accused the insurgent group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia of duping them into the bombings. Iraqi security forces made similar statements about the women on Friday. Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia is a homegrown group that American officials say has foreign leadership.An American military officer in Baghdad told The Associated Press that medical experts had reviewed photographs of the bombers and thought their appearance was consistent with those of people suffering from Down syndrome.Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and its affiliate groups, which are blamed by the American military for most large-scale suicide bombings, have recently used women wearing suicide vests and, in at least one case, a young teenager, to carry out strikes.Suicide bombers like those on Friday, who were on foot, can more easily penetrate areas that are now hard for bombers driving cars to reach because of the increased number of blast walls and checkpoints.The bombings on Friday appears to have touched off a renewal of violence in two Shiite areas. The Interior Ministry said Shiite gunmen that it believed to be linked to the Mahdi Army militia had clashed with Iraqi security forces, killing two civilians and wounding three others. The Mahdi Army is the armed wing of the political movement of the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr.The report comes as some Shiites have been urging Mr. Sadr to renounce a six-month cease-fire and to have the militia take up arms again.'"
"'08-02-03,'0','But cervelas (pronounced sair-vuh-LAH) is also the food of choice for fans at soccer games, much as the hot dog accompanies baseball or football. This summer Switzerland will play host with Austria for the European soccer championships, for which additional hundreds of thousands of cervelas will be required. “There will always be cervelas,” Mr. Büttiker, who is also a deputy in Parliament, said over coffee. “But what we had to fear is that it would be without zebu intestine.”The name cervelas — Switzerland’s jumble of languages yields other spellings, including cervelat, zervelat and servelat — is derived from cerebellum, Latin for brain, since the sausage originally consisted of pork and pigs’ brain. Today, it is made of beef, bacon and pork rind, mixed with ice to cool it during mincing; it is lightly smoked and briefly boiled.The use of zebu intestine as a casing is actually a child of mass retailing and the need of supermarkets for cervelas that were alike in color, size and flavor. But it was also a result of the rising cost of cattle intestines in Switzerland, where farmers were increasingly unwilling to clean the innards of their slaughtered cattle for the sausage industry.“No one wanted to clean and prepare the cow intestines” that were previously used, said Jürg Schletti, managing director of Proviande, an organization that links cattle raisers and meat packers. “And there was cheaper labor in Brazil.”A committee of experts was named to seek possible alternatives, including pig and sheep intestines, and even a synthetic casing made of seaweed. All were rejected.The zebu intestine, Mr. Schletti explained, is the ideal casing for sausage. It has a uniform diameter, is not too fatty, is slightly curved, has an appetizing color and does not burst when grilled.Swiss diplomats are negotiating in Brussels with the European Union to seek an exception for zebu intestines. At the same time, Swiss veterinarians have gone to Brazil seeking material to prove that the intestines pose no threat of transmitting mad cow disease, and hence should not be excluded from Europe.The emotional attachment of the Swiss to cervelas goes deep. “As a girl — we were three children — my parents would take us for a picnic in the woods, and there would be bread and potato chips and salad and grilled cervelas,” said Karin Gerber, for 27 years the manager of Kauffmann, downtown on Spitalgasse. Kauffmann is one of the city’s biggest sausage shop, with more than a dozen varieties, including cervelas. The roots of the Swiss attachment to cervelas, she said, reach back to childhood.There are exceptions. Mr. Schletti, asked whether he had fond youthful memories of steaming cervelas replied, “Never.” He was a farmer’s son, he said, and cervelas was city food. Indeed, leftists in Switzerland often promoted cervelas as the sausage of the urban proletariat. “In the 20th century, cervelas was synonymous with the people’s sausage,” he said, adding: “Beef was too expensive. They called cervelas ‘the people’s filet.’ ”The news of the possible demise of cervelas visibly upset the Swiss, a normally even-tempered people. In a survey, the newspaper Tribune de Genève asked 1,090 people whether cervelas, as they knew it, had to be saved, and fully 72 percent said it did. Only 7 percent had no opinion.Of course, there were dissenters. On the paper’s blog, a Swiss living in Portugal, Vincent Massard, wrote that cervelas was one of the few things Swiss for which he felt absolutely no nostalgia. “Let them bury cervelas,” Mr. Massard wrote. “I will not go to weep at the tomb!”Erwin Wenger agreed. Asked on leaving Kauffmann with a bundle of meat under his arm whether he had purchased cervelas, Mr. Wenger, 65, a retiree, replied: “No, I seldom eat it. It has a lot of fat and is not terribly healthy.” When he ate sausage, he said, he preferred the raw smoked variety.But Ulrich Stücki disagreed. For 18 years, Mr. Stücki, 62, has tended his flower stand, called Petit Fleur, across from Kauffmann’s store window, and at times, he said, “I can no longer bear the sight” of the sausages displayed there. But he makes an exception for cervelas. “I like it grilled over an open fire, with the ends cut open so that it looks like a butterfly,” he said, his eyes glistening.“For every decent Swiss,” he went on, “cervelas gives you a feeling of childhood.”'"
"'08-02-03,'0','LOS ANGELES — When California voters go to the polls on Tuesday, they will weigh in on a spate of ballot measures and referendums, the majority of them on financial issues.Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger recently declared a fiscal state of emergency and asked the State Legislature to address a $3.3 billion budget deficit as he proposed a $141 billion budget, down $4 billion from last year.The most publicized referendums would ratify gambling agreements that the state has with four Indian tribes.Under four separate propositions, the referendums would allow tribes to operate additional slot machines and exempt some of their gaming projects from the scope of the California Environmental Quality Act as well as add millions of dollars in new payments to the state, which is why they have the support of the governor.Proponents say that the state would get billions in the next two decades to help support public services and that new casino jobs would be created. But opponents are concerned that the state would become home to some of the largest casinos in the world, and that the proposals would hand over control of one-third of Indian gaming in the state to only four tribes out of more than 100.'"
"'08-02-03,'0','This split has deep roots in American political history, and each side can claim a long, noble and successful tradition. For many years after World War II, under the unifying pressure of the cold war, consensus ruled as presidents of both parties, starting with Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, governed in stable if not always perfect alliance with partners of the other party. Hard as it is to imagine now, comity really was, at least sometimes, more important than seizing the last inch of ideological territory. This manner of politics was so prevalent that in 1965 Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. wrote in his journal that President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had come of political age in the postwar Senate, “has no idea of his own but consensus.” Mr. Schlesinger was deriding this as a pitiable lack of political vision. But it was precisely Mr. Johnson’s gift for legislative compromise that produced landmark accomplishments, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.The long postwar consensus collapsed in the fires of the 1960s, as racial unrest, Vietnam and, finally, Watergate polarized the nation. From those ashes emerged Reagan, the modern archetype of a president committed to a distinctly conservative orthodoxy; that is, a few strongly held ideas — opposing Communism, limiting government, encouraging free enterprise — from which he never deviated.Ever since, as the Republican debate on Wednesday night reminded us, Reaganism has been Republican orthodoxy — “mainstream Republicanism,” in Mr. Romney’s phrase. It has also been the dominant political force in the country, forcing even Bill Clinton as president to tack in that direction in order to govern effectively. This is what Mr. Obama was acknowledging in the remarks the Clintons seized upon.Now the 2008 election seems likely to signal a final transition from the Reagan era. A simple view is that orthodox Reaganism has come crashing down in the troubled presidency of George W. Bush. But that would be to miss several larger tides of politics and opinion. For one thing, there is the difference between Mr. Reagan himself and some of his successors. Mr. Reagan, for all the clarity of his beliefs, was also a pragmatist, usually willing to negotiate (whether the man on the other side of the table was Tip O’Neill or Mikhail Gorbachev). Some of his political followers — Mr. McCain is not a bad example — adopted his ideology and his pragmatism. But others took the ideology without Mr. Reagan’s flexibility, or his charm, an approach captured by the title of Tom DeLay’s memoir, “No Retreat, No Surrender.”So in the 1990s the partisan warfare deepened. The central political figures of that era were, of course, the Clintons themselves. They are both masters of political combat, and Mrs. Clinton, even more than her husband, has made clear that she believes there are orthodox Democratic positions that need to be fought for. She seemed almost exasperated on this point after losing in South Carolina to Mr. Obama and his promise to unite the country around a common purpose. “Of course, I believe very strongly in finding common ground; that’s what I’ve done in the Senate,” she said. “But I also believe in standing our ground against some of the very poorly thought out and ill-conceived policies and ideas that we’ve had to fight against.”Mrs. Clinton cited health care as a place to draw a line and insist on mandatory coverage. “It is so important that as Democrats we carry the banner of universal health care,” she said. Mr. Obama’s plan, she suggested, was perhaps too much the product of consensus. “So it’s not that he is against mandatory provisions,” she said, “it’s that he doesn’t think it would be politically acceptable to require that for everyone.”The implicit choice facing voters today in both parties is whether the next president should govern from an orthodox ideological position or more in the manner of the postwar presidents who led through bipartisan consensus.Certainly Americans have learned that the manner of campaigning does not guarantee the manner of governing. Mr. Bush ran on the promise that he would be a uniter, not a divider. But if the nature of a campaign is any signal, the current ones show clear distinctions on this question of partisanship.The divide is visible in all sorts of ways. Just as Mrs. Clinton pilloried Mr. Obama for indiscreetly suggesting that Mr. Reagan had ideas, Mr. Romney attacked Mr. McCain because the 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, John Kerry, considered inviting Mr. McCain to be his running mate. What was Mr. McCain’s mistake, according to Mr. Romney? “He gave that some thought.” A mistake Mr. Romney says he would never have made: “Had someone asked me that question,” which as far as we know no Democratic candidate ever has, “there would not have been a nanosecond of thought about it.”So there it was. Even thinking about working with the other team, let alone praising its ideas, can be a grievous political sin (which Republican loyalists feel Mr. McCain has committed any number of times on any number of issues, as Mr. Romney well knew and hoped to reinforce just before the primary in Florida).The sincerity of Mr. Romney’s own commitment to Republican orthodoxy has been challenged, but with the zealotry of a convert, he has stepped up the pressure on Mr. McCain since Florida. He describes the race with Mr. McCain as “this battle for the heart of the Republican Party” and is ever ready with a list of issues on which Mr. McCain has strayed from Republican orthodoxy — immigration, campaign finance, tax reduction, same-sex marriage.American politics has been so polarized for so long now that it is hardly surprising that veteran politicians like Mr. Romney and Mrs. Clinton fall back on standard political tools (like casting doubt on their opponents’ partisan bona fides) to motivate the party base, particularly in what is, after all, still a party nominating fight, not a general election. Mr. Obama spoke last week of bad political “habits” of divisiveness and partisanship, which he said were not the fault of any one campaign. In their political careers these candidates have never really seen much else.WHAT is perhaps more revealing is that for all their experience Mr. Romney and Mrs. Clinton are campaigning as if they had missed the extraordinary shift in national mood.Not so Mr. Obama or, to a considerable extent, Mr. McCain. Mr. Obama’s campaign has clearly been tapping a pervasive disenchantment with the nation’s condition and its politics. And Mr. McCain has been running against the conservative establishment, the seat of its orthodoxy.“I don’t know that we have seen in the last 50 years two candidates who have so openly tried to move beyond their party base before the nomination as Obama and McCain,” said Meenekshi Bose, professor of presidential studies at Hofstra University.Indeed, for much of last year Mr. McCain tried to mute the ways he differed with the base of the Republican Party, and his campaign foundered. But more recently his “Straight Talk Express” has picked up steam as he has been more explicit in acknowledging those differences. In Wednesday night’s debate, Mr. Romney accused Mr. McCain of holding views “outside the mainstream of Republican conservative thought.” Mr. McCain replied that he was proud of his conservative record. “It’s one of reaching across the aisle to get things done for the American people.”Much was made last week of the comparison between Mr. Obama and John F Kennedy and his 1960 campaign for president. Certainly, Mr. Obama’s allure to younger and independent voters comes in large measure from his promise of a politics akin to the politics not only of John F. Kennedy but also of his brother Robert, whose campaign in 1968 excited talk of a “new politics” that would energize younger voters. Whichever Kennedy Mr. Obama more resembles, the mood of the country today is clearly more than a little like the mood of America in 1968.“Of course, the war cannot bear responsibility for all our other ills. It has contributed to them by draining off resources and energies and, most of all, by blunting our sense of moral purpose. But to a large extent it has only catalyzed an awareness of more profound problems.”That sounds as if it was written last week about Iraq and America’s national disillusionment. But in fact it was written just as 1968 ended by Richard Goodwin, who had been a speechwriter for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, to capture a year that began with the insurgency of Eugene McCarthy, was shattered by the assassinations of both Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and ended with the election of Richard Nixon. All the while the war raged on in Vietnam, but the national unhappiness was rooted in deep societal alienation, Mr. Goodwin argued, brought on by everything from suburbanization to the dawn of the computer age.The sources are different today. But alienation again fuels frustration and disenchantment. Government seems distant and ineffective to many voters. Even a government as powerful as America’s seems inadequate to crucial challenges — from the physical threat of terrorism to the economic wrenching of globalization. The political world, to many, seems out of joint.“It is too easy — and too partisan — to simply place the blame on the policies of President George W. Bush,” wrote a man who could hardly be blamed if he did, Al Gore. In a book published last summer, Mr. Gore captured part of the mood when he wrote that “American democracy is now in danger” because public debate has been hollowed out by a vicious cycle of partisanship and shallow media. “It is simply no longer possible to ignore the strangeness of our public discourse,” Mr. Gore wrote.Across the political spectrum Americans say they feel that something is wrong. For many years, poll takers have been asking Americans the standard question of whether they think the country is going in the right or wrong direction. The numbers this winter are about as bad as they have ever been. Nearly 7 in 10 of those surveyed say the country is on the wrong track. Indeed, says the poll taker Peter D. Hart, the country has gone through Vietnam, Watergate and impeachment without a period of sustained negativity that equals this.Writing this from the other side of the Atlantic, I’m well aware that the disenchantment is not limited to the United States. Western democracies in general are facing a crisis of confidence, says Stein Ringen, professor of social science at Oxford University. Professor Ringen has studied the major Western democracies, the ones usually thought of as the most robust, and concluded that “citizens are turning away; they care less for democracy, believe less in it, participate less in it and have less trust in its governance.”Robert Reich, President Clinton’s labor secretary, contends that economic globalization has undercut the ability of voters to feel they can influence events through their government even as the same forces have strengthened the hands of consumers and investors (who, to some extent at least, can be the same people).These are the winds of disenchantment that have been lifting Senators Obama and McCain with their promise of a different kind of politics. But a groundswell for change, even a soaring promise of change, does not by itself produce change. The candidates still must triumph in the very political system they are criticizing.“The real split, it seems to me,” said the historian and Thomas Dewey biographer Richard Norton Smith, “is between those Americans, a majority in my opinion, who at least say they want to see politicians trying to work across the aisle and the political system as it has actually evolved, with gerrymandered districts and talk radio and much of the media coverage reinforcing the tyranny of the base.”It would be easy in the current political climate to presume that the bipartisans are the good guys and the party fundamentalists the bad. But that would be to assume that what is politically attractive at the moment will also be politically effective or even right.Mr. Smith picked his words precisely. Americans say they want to see politicians working across party lines. But do they really mean it? One voter’s consensus is another’s fatal compromise. Are you actually willing to give up some cherished goal, or part of it, to achieve more unity?Mr. Hart, the poll taker, notes that while voters agree that the American house needs repair, half want to shore up the floorboards and the others want to fix the roof. They may all want to unite, but unite around what?Indeed, you could look at Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Romney as the realists. They confront politics as it is, rather than engaging in flights of fancy about what it might be. They aren’t just pandering to the base because they need core party voters to win the nomination. They are fighting for principles that separate their side from the other.There is a strong cadre around Mrs. Clinton who believe that this is the moment for Democrats to do what the Republicans did so well for nearly 30 years: seize the high ground of ideas, offer strong proposals and push them through. In other words, the goal, as Sidney Blumenthal, a Clinton adviser, put it in a recent interview with The New Yorker, is not transcending partisanship but “fulfilling it.”With the tide running for the Democrats this year, the campaign season will show whether it is the misfortune of partisan Democrats that their moment has arrived just as the country has had it with partisanship.'"
"'08-02-03,'0','Since the 1970 census, Glendale’s population has grown to almost 250,000 from 36,228, city officials said. They said they hoped that corporate executives visiting for the Super Bowl would be enticed to book future conventions or construct offices and factories. Around town, signs say “Glendale’s Got Game.”The community appears to be soaring in the manner of the F-16 fighter jets that lift upward from Luke Air Force Base, which is in the city limits and is Glendale’s largest employer.“In 1999 and 2000, you would have been hard pressed to convince me that government should be getting involved with professional sports and all the hoopla that goes with them, all the glamour and whatever,” Mayor Elaine M. Scruggs said. “But I was really wrong.”Ed Beasley, the city manager, said the city pursued its aggressive sports facilities program even during the economic recession that followed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He said the possibility of a new recession did not discourage him.During a financial downturn, Beasley said, labor is plentiful and cheap, and construction can proceed without delays. “People always turn to sports when things aren’t going so well,” he said. “It’s been that way since the Romans and the Greeks.”Scruggs and Beasley said Glendale was fortunate because it offered land that was almost unoccupied, except for farms and ranches, and was near a new freeway. “God only made land once,” Beasley said. “If you can control it, you’ve got something of value.”Ted Ferris, the president and chief executive of the Arizona Sports & Tourism Authority, said that the stadium’s economic ripple effect to the region was worth about $1.6 billion annually. “The real benefit is to the macroeconomy,” he said.Ferris said the figure was produced by an economic impact study before the stadium was built.But not everyone in the area supports spending public tax money on private facilities for sports businesses. Tim Weaver, who ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 2002, said in an e-mail message in response to questions that because tax revenue paid for the $455 million stadium, the Cardinals and the N.F.L. “received all of the benefit and took none of the risk that is usually associated with private business ventures.”He added: “Regardless of its success or failure, or the amount of money it pumps into the economy, it is, and will continue to be, an inappropriate use of public funds. Where are my tax dollars to subsidize my business?”Ferris said that the sales tax on hotels and rental cars in the county paid for about two-thirds of the stadium costs. The rest is generated by sales taxes at the stadium itself, he said.Byron Schlomach, an economist at the Goldwater Institute in Phoenix, which he described as a research group that urges limits on government involvement in the free market, said it was difficult to quantify the public benefits from arenas.“It’s roughing the taxpayer with no instant-replay review,” Schlomach said in a telephone interview. “It’s fundamentally unsound to base an economy on big government projects. The benefits are fairly concentrated and the costs are spread out.”Glendale’s aggressive growth astounds longtime residents, including those who support it. Manny Martinez, 79, the vice mayor, remembers picking crops in Glendale in his youth when migrant workers passed through during the harvest.“On my first work day here, I picked cotton and I made 60 cents,” Martinez said. He added that he would shop in Phoenix as a boy and head home to see a sign at the city limits that said “Glendale, Population 5,000.”John Akers, 38, grew up in Glendale and works at the Sahuaro Ranch, a fruit farm established in 1886, six years before Glendale was established as a town. He is a historian who shows tourists an adobe building on the ranch and tells them of the region’s roots.“It’s exciting,” Akers said of the development. But he added: “Growing up here, there were always farms on the horizon. You could see the hay barns. I do miss that. Probably in 10 years, there won’t be any farms left.”Growth picked up during World War II, when the air base was established to train pilots. After the war, Glendale became a bedroom community for workers in Phoenix and for retired military personnel.The current pilots fly training missions to the Barry M. Goldwater Range, 65 miles to the southwest. Capt. Miki Gilloon of the Air Force said the stadiums were a diversion for the airmen because they provided entertainment.Doug Moss, the president of the Coyotes, said he would like to see more of them because attendance was down to about 12, 500 a game. “We’re still losing money, but we’re on the way into the black,” Moss said. Wayne Gretzky coaches the team.But Moss and others disputed the perception that the arena was too far from the Phoenix population center, saying that the metropolitan area was shifting and that Glendale would eventually be the center of the region.Perhaps that will come true. But there is a cautionary tale about 40 miles to the east, in Goldfield, Ariz., where gold was discovered in the 1890s and drew thousands to mine for it. It now exists only as the rebuilt tourist attraction, Goldfield Ghost Town.Bob Schoose, one of the owners, said there was little comparison between gold mining in the 19th century and sports businesses in the 21st century except for the danger of overbuilding because of too much optimism.“In Goldfield, there were about 50 different mines operating, but only 4 or 5 were successful,” Schoose said. “The rest were hoping and spending money. Eventually, people gave up and went back with their tails between their legs.”The key for Glendale’s sports and entertainment business, he said, is to keep booking events to fill those new arenas, hotels and restaurants. “I don’t see any bad side, unless the economy takes a hit,” Schoose said. “It’s all about the economy.”'"
"'08-02-03,'0','John McEnroe’s brief tenure as the United States Davis Cup captain was marked by his frequent laments about how tough it was to get Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi to play for his team.McEnroe’s successor, his younger brother Patrick, has no trouble getting the current crop of top Americans to participate — which probably is why he finally won a championship. And when the United States opens defense of its first Davis Cup title since 1995 this week, he will once more be able to rely on Andy Roddick, James Blake, and the twins Bob and Mike Bryan.“I’ve been extremely lucky,” McEnroe said. We’ve got a group of guys that love to play for their country, that love supporting each other and that have answered the call every single time I’ve asked them. That’s pretty amazing, considering the world we live in. I certainly understand the players that do skip matches here and there.”The series from Friday to Sunday in Austria will be the record ninth consecutive time that Roddick, Blake and the Bryans will comprise the United States team.No other American quartet has participated in more than three Davis Cup series in a row.“I’d love to take the credit, but to be quite honest, the credit goes to them, because they really do enjoy it and they really do enjoy the weeks together,” McEnroe said.'"
"'08-02-03,'0','“We’re jelling right now, we’re having a lot of fun,” Hartnell said. “We’re just having a great time winning games.” Hartnell scored his 17th goal of the season Tuesday to beat Los Angeles in overtime. The goal came as he drove to the net in pursuit of a pass from his linemate, the holdover Mike Richards. With 21 goals and 57 points, Richards is well on his way to doubling his best output.In addition to four balanced lines — a rarity in these days of the salary cap when a fourth-liner’s greatest asset can be affordability — Philadelphia has the No. 1 power play, quarterbacked by Timonen, who spent the past five seasons playing under the radar in Nashville.“Everyone’s contributing,” Hartnell said. “You don’t have one or two guys that you lean on every night.”With the Toronto Maple Leafs near the bottom of the standings, all eyes turn to the man hired to reprise his rescue.Cliff Fletcher, hired as the interim general manager after the firing of John Ferguson Jr., traded the Leafs back to respectability in the early 1990s. His best trading chip this time is the Leafs’ captain and the face of the franchise for 12 years, Mats Sundin, who turns 37 on Feb. 13.Sundin has a no-trade clause in his contract, which is to expire July 1, leaving him an unrestricted free agent. He has said he does not want to leave Toronto, but Fletcher has indicated that he would broach the idea of Sundin’s waiving the clause.The question may be timing — when to abandon all hope of the Leafs’ making the playoffs for the first time in three seasons. The Islanders earned the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference last season with 92 points, a point ahead of the Leafs. Toronto would have to earn 41 points in its final 28 games to reach 92.If Sundin, having one of his best seasons, was packaged as a playoff rental for one of the true Stanley Cup contenders — Detroit? Anaheim? Ottawa? — the Leafs would surely flat line. But perhaps earning the right to draft the speedy Steven Stamkos first over all would be just the thing for Fletcher’s Operation Maple Leafs.On Wednesday, Pittsburgh’s Jarkko Ruutu rammed the Atlanta star Ilya Kovalchuk into the boards in the second period of the Thrashers’ 4-1 victory, injuring Kovalchuk and triggering a fight. Ruutu was given a kneeing major, a fighting major and a game misconduct.It was the latest in a string of incidents involving Ruutu, going back to when he received a five-game suspension as a 21-year-old in the Finnish SM-liiga in 1997. Here are the biggest ones:¶2001-2 N.H.L.: Ruutu, playing for Vancouver, hits Colorado’s Stéphane Yelle in open ice and receives a kneeing major and a game misconduct. Later in the season, he elbows San Jose’s Bryan Marchment from behind, knocking him cold, and receives an elbowing major and a game misconduct.¶2004-5 SM-liiga: Ruutu, playing for HIFK Helsinki, receives majors and game misconducts for two illegal hits, including one in which he rams Lukko’s Toni Porkka into the boards from behind.¶2006 Olympics: Ruutu, playing for Finland, injures the Czech Republic’s Jaromir Jagr with a blindside hit into the end boards. Ruutu receives a game misconduct.¶2007 world championship: Ruutu injures Russia’s Petr Schastlivy with a blindside hit into the side boards. Ruutu receives a game misconduct.In December, Ruutu was for once the victim, when the Islanders’ Chris Simon used his skate to stamp at Ruutu’s lower leg. Simon got a 30-game suspension.But last week, Ruutu, who has never scored more than 17 points in an N.H.L. season, was back in his accustomed role. Kovalchuk was expected to miss two games with a minor knee injury. The N.H.L. took no disciplinary action against Ruutu.Last week, the big news off the ice was the impending return of two retired stars: Teemu Selanne, 37, who rejoined the faltering Anaheim Ducks, and Peter Forsberg, 34, who announced in Sweden that he wanted to return to an N.H.L. club by the Feb. 26 roster deadline.But the big story on the ice involved a young superstar, Alex Ovechkin, who had four goals and one assist for Washington in a 5-4 victory over Montreal on Thursday after taking a puck to the face that split his lip and a check into the boards that broke his nose.“Today was special day,” Ovechkin said afterward in his thick Russian accent. “I broke my nose, I have stitches, I score four goals.”'"

What if I don’t want him to stay?A “A roommate cannot claim a tenant’s rent-stabilized apartment after two years of occupancy over the objection of the tenant,” said Thomas P. Higgins, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.While the Rent Stabilization Code does provide “succession rights” to partners and family members, generally after two years, these rights don’t apply to roommates who have no personal or shared financial relationship with the tenant, Mr. Higgins said.A roommate is considered a licensee — that is, someone who has a revocable right to occupy the apartment. “A licensee’s right to the apartment is always subordinate to the tenant’s right to the apartment,” Mr. Higgins said.'"
"'08-02-03,'0','Nearly all of us agreed it was O.K. to “crush out” on someone, and even to tell our partner or husband (or our couples therapist) about it in an effort to be honest, and thus mature, in our relationships. The unspoken assumption was that it was not O.K. to act on it.Despite my general attitude of acceptance when it comes to people questioning their most troubling emotions, I’ve learned to tread carefully on the conjoined subjects of fidelity and monogamy. My experience tells me that it’s a minefield and that no one except Dr. Phil-inspired talk-show exhibitionists and the admittedly polyamorous are ready to talk openly about it.I don’t belong to either of those groups. But, to be fair, I’ve given polyamory my best shot.In graduate school, when my boyfriend then — a touchy-feely, anarchist performance artist type — announced he wanted to see other people because monogamy was “a bourgeois construct,” I reluctantly went along with him for about a year, thinking that dismantling the dominant paradigm was the right, countercultural thing to do.Mostly what it did, however, was make me paranoid about getting a sexually transmitted disease, despite our practice of safe sex. I began to imagine every woman I encountered in his circle of friends as the one who might have had sex with him just hours before.My respect for him dwindled as I viewed his need to see other women less as a political stance than simply his sexual overdrive combined with a lack of impulse control. We eventually split up, and I looked for someone who wanted to have an old-fashioned relationship. The emotional trafficking that being “poly” required was just too exhausting, using up energy I needed for school and two jobs. I saw no benefit, anyway: the men I broached the idea with were just freaked out by it.Later, when I found the man I wanted to spend my life with, and he and I started talking about marriage, we discussed our worries of signing on to something that had an almost 50 percent failure rate. We wanted to believe in marriage as a viable option without being duped by the fairy tale expectations of it. I know people who have been married three and four times, and it always makes me wonder: Why keep marching down the aisle and making the same promises?Historically, of course, marriage was a business arrangement, with infidelity (at least for men) being the acceptable loophole. It wasn’t until the 18th century that love gained credibility as a reason for marriage. And now, in the 21st century, marriage is supposed to do it all for both husband and wife — love, companionship, family and work — a supposedly one-size-fits-all answer to a couple’s every emotional and sexual need for 40, 50, even 60 years.Skeptical of buying into such grandiose promises, we approached marriage with an open mind, knowing that we loved and trusted each other and that we were determined to be honest no matter what, even if that meant admitting that we might occasionally be attracted to other people.Sublimating our inner desires seemed like a recipe for obsession and deceit. We were just trying to be realistic about an institution we had always viewed as being a little sanctimonious, one that made more sense when human life expectancy was about 43, and when, financially speaking, women needed to be taken care of.So, several years into our marriage, when a good friend of mine told me that she had a crush on my husband (and I’d sort of figured that his interest in her photography career had developed into more of an interest in seeing all of her tattoos), I knew that all of our theorizing about what makes a successful life partnership was about to face its first real-life application.I didn’t feel particularly threatened by this friend. I trusted her, and I never imagined her to be a woman for whom my husband would leave me. In fact, I never thought he would leave, period. I reasoned that since he and I could be so open with each other, our marriage must really be invincible. And if I were to give the two of them permission to “explore their feelings,” it would also give me a chance to dawdle in the feelings I’d developed for a colleague at work. We’d all take baby steps — nothing dramatic — and see how it went.But we immediately faced logistical concerns. If my husband was out with her, what should I be doing? Did I need to plan my time with my colleague to coincide with the time he spent with her? Did my husband and I need to tell each other whenever we planned to spend time with the other person?A FEW solid rules would have been helpful, but without knowing how either relationship might progress, we didn’t know how to set them. It seemed odd and presumptuous to be negotiating rules for relationships and situations that were themselves unknown and unpredictable. So what would the boundaries be? Was kissing allowed? More?We knew lying was not an option. We had agreed that lying is what made it “cheating,” leading to hurt and distrust and causing the real damage to the relationship. But how much truth could we realistically handle? I wasn’t sure how much I really wanted to know about what they were doing.As it turned out, he had nothing to worry about with me. My flirtation quickly died under the weight of my friend’s moral discomfort. After a few lunches he grew uneasy about the gray zone we had entered. There was one late evening of sushi and cocktails, but it was I who felt guilty and decided to go home so my husband wouldn’t be waiting and wondering. The next day my colleague called and told me he couldn’t do it anymore. His friends had advised him against the situation; he didn’t want to get hurt.Meanwhile, my good friend and my husband were continuing to have good times taking pictures and going back to her apartment to develop them and continue their mild flirtation. Then one night, when it had gotten too late for my comfort zone, he called to say our Volvo wagon wouldn’t start. I knew the car to be unreliable, but I couldn’t deny a nagging doubt: Could he be lying about the car just to spend the night with her?That, for me, was the breaking point. It didn’t matter if he was telling the truth. I doubted him anyway, so the result was the same. I further realized that I couldn’t handle the thought of them spending the night together, sleeping in the same bed, even in a Bert and Ernie arrangement. My imagination ran wild. I felt as if I were imploding.What had I expected? That spending the night with her would send him running back to me? That honesty would override any feelings of possessiveness or hurt?Several arguments and 10 therapy sessions later, we thanked each other for allowing that kind of creative romantic safari into our lives but vowed never to do it again. We weren’t bored with each other. And despite our ostensibly progressive notions about marriage, we were not impervious to the full range of human emotions — rage, jealousy, fear of abandonment — that tend to surface when we cross the boundaries of love.As one might imagine, the good friend and I did not remain good friends. That bond was the weaker one, it turned out. She and I tried several times to talk it through in the hope of preserving our friendship, but we finally agreed that once the door had been left open, too many flies had come in and spoiled the ambience.I’ve known many people who have had successful open marriages, and I admire their intentions — some of them, anyway. You have to want to go the distance on that emotional seesaw, and it takes great courage. You have to commit to spelling out every rule and consideration clearly and with great enunciation. You can’t just glide over the syllables.Back at the pub, our ladies’ night out was breaking up, and I offered to walk the confessor home. I didn’t tell her about my experiences. Instead I asked what marriage meant to her. Could she let go of the “rules” and her expectations enough to at least be O.K. with everything she was feeling?She didn’t know, but we both agreed that having a crush gives you a much-needed adrenaline rush. Somebody is treating you the way your spouse did oh-so-many years ago, looking into your eyes without wondering if you cleaned his favorite shirt, or paid the mortgage on time, or will turn out to be his mother. Looking at you with nothing but passion and a sense of possibility.Tonight I’m going to try to look at my husband the same way. He’ll probably be watching one of our favorite shows, “Big Love,” in which case I’ll watch with him and we’ll laugh at the same lines. We love to laugh together. It keeps us sane.'"

"'08-02-03,'0','One of the many qualities of Howard Hawks’s 1959 western “Rio Bravo” is that it serves as the perfect illustration of the Four Ages of the Movie Star. First comes the rebellious young adult (Ricky Nelson, as a cocky gunfighter) who evolves into the conflicted middle-aged professional (Dean Martin, as the deputy with a drinking problem), who turn into the trustworthy elder statesman (John Wayne, as the self-sufficient sheriff), who eventually gives way to the lovable old coot (Walter Brennan as, well, the lovable old coot).This, Hawks suggests, is the life cycle of the movie star the way nature intended it to be. Wayne, 52 at the time of filming, had been a leading man for almost 30 years. Having matured on screen, from the impossibly handsome youth of “The Big Trail” (1930) through the perils of parenthood (as in John Ford’s 1950 “Rio Grande”), he here makes no effort to hide his sagging jowls, and the skill and experience of his character is etched into every line of his face. In “Rio Bravo” his John T. Chance is still on top of his game but aware that he will soon start to slip. Wayne would go on to achieve cootness, and his long-deserved Oscar, as the broken-down Rooster Cogburn of “True Grit” (1969).Many male stars of Wayne’s generation followed the same path: Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, James Stewart and Henry Fonda managed to reinvent themselves every 10 to 12 years, holding old fans and gaining new ones as they aged. For women the path was rockier and generally shorter, and only the strong, like Bette Davis and Barbara Stanwyck, survived.But these careers reflected a time of different demographics, when movies possessed a nearly universal appeal. Once that grand public began to fragment, with the introduction of television and the bewildering array of new media that has followed, marketing departments learned to tailor production toward ever more narrow niche audiences, mostly based on age and gender.The stars who emerged in the 1960s and early ’70s — before cable television, home video and the Internet began to divide the audience into discrete demographic groups — will likely be the last generation to make it into coothood with their popularity more or less intact: Clint Eastwood (now 77), Jack Nicholson (70), Al Pacino (67). The rebels of New Hollywood have largely managed to move on with the times and according to their age, from “Five Easy Pieces” to “The Bucket List.”But for stars who arrived after the advent of HBO (b. 1972) and VHS (1976), the options are narrower. Many (like Eddie Murphy, Michael Keaton and Kevin Costner) no longer pack the box-office muscle they did in the 1980s; the survivors are those, like Messrs. Stallone, Willis and Ford, strongly attached to specific series. Flesh may age, but a franchise is forever.In “Rio Bravo” terms the current crop of stars is dominated by Ricky Nelsons — a generation of baby-faced “kidults” that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Will Smith. As much as they may have matured as artists in the last several years, they seem genetically incapable of physically growing older. Mr. Damon will always look like the captain of the high school wrestling team, Mr. DiCaprio like the editor of the student literary magazine. Tom Cruise, the 1980s prototype for this generation, continues to play younger than his 45 years, although the illusion is becoming harder to maintain. Jumping on couches is one thing when you’re 25; for a middle-aged man, it reads just a little bit weird.Happily, we do have a few Dean Martins out there. George Clooney — at 46, only one year older than Mr. Cruise — went Cary Grant gray a long time ago and has not shied away from age-appropriate roles. Tom Hanks once appeared exempt from aging — Sally Field, who played his love interest in “Punchline” (1988) was cast as his mother in “Forrest Gump” (1994) — but now, at 51, he is plausibly playing congressmen (“Charlie Wilson’s War”) and university professors (“The Da Vinci Code”). And Russell Crowe, perhaps because he became a star (in “L.A. Confidential”) at the late age of 33, has always seemed to possess a maturity (on screen if not off) missing in many of his peers.But of John Wayne, not a trace.'"
"'08-02-03,'0','“We’ll never know, will we?” Rooney once said with a smile.Just as we will never know if those Steelers or those Packers would beat these Patriots. You are talking about different teams from different eras who operated under different rules, notably the blocking techniques of offensive linemen and the coverage techniques of defensive backs.As a group, the Patriots are mostly much bigger and faster than those Steelers and Packers, but are they better? We will never know.And what about the other dynasties? The George Halas Bears of the ’40s, with Sid Luckman at quarterback, won four titles in seven seasons, beginning with their 73-0 embarrassment of the Redskins in the 1940 championship game. In avenging a 7-3 loss to Washington during the season, the Bears opened with running back Bill Osmanski’s 68-yard touchdown run on the second play from scrimmage and intercepted 8 passes, returning 3 for touchdowns.As dazzling as the 49ers of the ’80s, built by Coach Bill Walsh with Joe Montana at quarterback and Ronnie Lott at safety, were in winning four Super Bowls, it took them nine seasons. After their third triumph, Walsh stepped aside in 1989 and George Seifert succeeded him, but Montana remained the common denominator. In a 55-10 rout of the Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV, he fired five touchdown passes.“Montana is certainly bright enough,” Walsh once said. “But more important, he has athletic intelligence and outstanding spontaneous instincts, which help him identify opportunities and solve problems the instant they occur in a game.”The Jimmy Johnson-Barry Switzer Cowboys of the ’90s won three Super Bowls in four seasons with an offense featuring Troy Aikman at quarterback, Emmitt Smith at running back and Michael Irvin at wide receiver.The House of Belichick won three Super Bowls in four seasons in this decade (all three by the margin of an Adam Vinatieri field goal) and the Halas Bears of the ’40s also won three N.F.L. titles in four seasons.During the ’50s, the Cleveland Browns and the Detroit Lions each won three N.F.L. titles in six seasons. Counting the Browns’ four straight All-America Football Conference championships from 1946 to 1949 before joining the N.F.L., they reigned as the best team in their league in 7 of 10 seasons (and went to the championship game in the other three), but N.F.L. records do not include statistics from the A.A.F.C. years.In the N.F.L.’s early years, the Curly Lambeau Packers won five championships in 11 seasons: two in the 1936 and 1939 title games and three in a row from 1929 to 1931, when the champion was determined by the best record.But the Patriots’ assault on the N.F.L. record book may have only begun. If they get past the Giants on Sunday and upstage the Don Shula Dolphins of the ’70s, who had a 17-0 record — or even if the Patriots lose — their next historical target will be the 32-2 two-season record put together by those Dolphins, who also won Super Bowl VIII, the best streak over consecutive seasons in N.F.L. history.That streak ended when the Dolphins lost their 1974 opener, 34-24, at, yes, New England, where, win or lose Sunday, the House of Belichick will be waiting next season.'"
"'08-02-03,'0','The Prius, at 48 m.p.g in the E.P.A. city test, is the mileage champ among new cars, with a considerable advantage of 8 m.p.g. over the Civic Hybrid in urban conditions. But its hybrid system, which shines brightest in stop-and-go driving, offers less of a benefit on the open highway. As is the case with any car when it passes its most efficient cruising speed, the Prius’s mileage gets worse the faster it goes.The Civic, with a hybrid system that Honda calls Integrated Motor Assist, equals Toyota’s Hybrid Synergy Drive in E.P.A. highway economy, at 45 m.p.g. I discovered on this personal fuel-economy run over public roads that with just a little restraint in using the accelerator, it would give even better results.There is little to argue about picking Lamborghinis as guzzlers. With their V-10 or V-12 engines, Lamborghinis naturally finish low in the E.P.A.’s fuel economy rankings.This year, Lamborghini added to its line a new family member: the Gallardo Superleggera. The Super does have one thing in common with frugal fuel-sippers — it is a meticulous weight-watcher. The Superleggera uses lightweight carbon fiber composites to replace a number of aluminum body panels, and it has been stripped of some creature comforts to trim away 154 pounds.Its V-10 engine produces 523 horsepower, 11 more than the standard Gallardo. Despite its lower curb weight, the Superleggera is thirsty like its stablemates, with E.P.A. ratings of 11 m.p.g in the city and 17 on the highway. Its hard-drinking big brother, the 12-cylinder Murciélago, tops the E.P.A.’s bad-guy list at 8 city and 13 highway.The route I chose headed north from Long Beach for 150 miles on a stretch of road once known as Route 6, and then back to Long Beach.This face-off was rigged in the Civic’s favor. The Civic Hybrid was allowed to travel in the High Occupancy Vehicle lanes on Los Angeles freeways, even though I was alone. In the Gallardo, I was restricted to motoring with the riffraff in the non-H.O.V. lanes.The 190 m.p.h. Superleggera has a decided speed advantage over the 110-horsepower Civic. But that made no difference because each contestant was obliged to obey all posted speed limits. (I know, where’s the fun in that?)The Civic seemed in its element, motoring on cruise control along the Southern California freeways. But it struggled to maintain the speed limit through mountainous sections and the route’s many elevation changes, often forced to dawdle behind slower vehicles. The Lamborghini never hesitated going uphill or zooming around clots in the traffic flow.Better yet, no matter how tortuous the mountain curves, I never needed to lift off the accelerator; the Superleggera caressed each curve while the Civic just wallowed through them. One comment from my logbook: “The Lamborghini felt safer going through a curve at 55 m.p.h. than the Civic felt at 35 m.p.h. through the same curve.”On the other hand, the Lamborghini was dreadful in stop-and-go traffic, even with its e-gear automated manual transmission. (Gears are shifted with paddles behind the steering wheel.) The reaction of the gas pedal was abrupt enough to cause whiplash. The brakes were even worse — probably the grabbiest on any production car I’ve tested in the last 10 years.But the bottom line here was all about money. The Lamborghini, despite the pampered drive, averaged only a fraction more than 10 m.p.g. To go 300 miles, it needed 30 gallons of premium unleaded. The Civic averaged 52 m.p.g. (Yes, that is better than its E.P.A. rating.) Over the same distance, it needed a little less than six gallons of regular unleaded.On a stretch of road that was long, straight and flat, the Civic actually averaged 61.2 m.p.g., traveling at an average speed of 61 m.p.h. for 61 minutes. That’s six times the Superleggera’s mileage.With the extra time spent on the road, the driver of the $23,000 Civic Hybrid can ponder what to do with the savings in gas costs and lease payments. An even better use of the time might be to consider the larger implications of leaving behind the smog-trapping Los Angeles basin, if only temporarily.A year’s driving in the Civic Hybrid consumes 8.8 barrels of crude oil, the government estimates, producing 4.4 tons of carbon dioxide. A Lamborghini Gallardo, meanwhile, accounts for 26.3 barrels of crude over the same number of miles, generating 14.1 tons of the greenhouse gas. In that light, the difference in cost between driving these cars seems far greater than the $85 out-of-pocket expense.'"
"'08-02-03,'0','Opened in 2005, the 16-story, 1,020-bed Danhostel Copenhagen City trumpets itself as “Europe’s biggest city hostel” and as a “five-star hostel.”It’s a curious boast. Like “gourmet fast-food” or “luxury trailer park,” “five-star hostel” sounds like an oxymoron plucked from The Onion.Then again, in a country that has elevated stereo speakers and sugar bowls into futuristic art forms (thanks to Bang & Olufsen and Georg Jensen), a style-conscious youth hostel seems almost plausible. And in a superpricey place like Copenhagen, any new, affordable place to stay automatically warrants attention.Very practical. On the edge of the Copenhagen city center, the Danhostel is less than five minutes’ walk from the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek art museum, the Tivoli amusement park and the Danish Design Center. It’s also less than 10 minutes from Central Station.My room, 706, was a four-person room that I had booked as a single. “Spartan” is too extravagant an adjective. A barren white box with a blond wood floor, the small space held a hard foam double bed and two bunk beds that folded down from the wall. It felt like a prison cell designed by Ikea. There was no TV, no phone, no closet and not even a freestanding lamp. The room’s marquee feature was its view, which looked out over Copenhagen.'"
"'08-02-03,'0','To thrive in the tropics you need cotton.This is the delight of the Bliss boutique: fabric. Not only does Bliss have clothes you can actually wear in the middle of the day — cascading petal-weight skirts, slouchy linen trousers, cool pink gingham blouses — it is piled high with stunning cottons, silks and linens from across Asia. These are sewn into clothes, pillows, quilts and cute little bags you can bring home to your friends.Cassandra McMillan, 37, opened Bliss in 1996. Today, the shop, which added a spa four years ago, is at the heart of Phnom Penh’s growing expatriate life on Street 240, where you can also find a new chocolate shop, a wine store and a bar run by two former New Yorkers.Bliss is a fine, neo-colonial sort of place, housed in a century-old villa that used to belong to a Chinese-Khmer merchant. Today, it has an admirably worn wooden staircase, small tile elephants, rose petals strewn languidly about and a plunge pool surrounded by frangipani trees. The Bliss spa also gives what just could be the best bikini wax in town — an important consideration for those long afternoons by the pool, coconut in hand — thanks in large part to the quality of the wax, which, like Ms. McMillan herself, comes from Australia.Ms. McMillan, whose mother is a professional quilter, likes to blend. There are chartreuse paisleys from Australia; ravishing Indian bridal quilts hand-stitched from antique saris; silvery silks from Cambodia, Korea and China; and bright geometric floral prints from Japan.“A lot of these are one-offs,” she said. “Once it’s gone, that’s it.”The prices, cited in dollars as is common in Cambodia, are fairly ridiculous by the country’s standards — some of those fat pillows cost $72, more than many garment factory workers make in a month — but this is all part of the grand, gin-fueled illusion of expatriate life.One must also pay to escape the tyranny of Asian sizes. Go to a Cambodian dress shop and try to tug those Size 4 zippers over your ribs and you’ll be told: “But sorry, ma’am, it’s a big size already.” Go to Bliss and you’ll be right back home again, mercifully, in a size small. That’s worth at least one gin and tonic, isn’t it?'"
"'08-02-03,'0','But Google appears to want to focus the debate, at least in part, on issues other than advertising, where it is dominant. Mr. Drummond noted that the combination of Yahoo and Microsoft would create a company with an “overwhelming share” of the instant messaging and e-mail markets.“Could a combination of the two take advantage of a PC software monopoly to unfairly limit the ability of consumers to freely access competitors’ e-mail, IM, and Web-based services?” Mr. Drummond asked. Yahoo and Microsoft also run two of the most heavily trafficked portals on the Internet, Mr. Drummond noted.Google’s reaction suggests the Internet search giant may be preparing to do its best to derail or delay any merger. If so, the strategy would mirror Microsoft’s own actions with respect to Google’s proposed acquisition of online advertising specialist DoubleClick for $3.1 billion.“Google can tap into all of the ill will that Microsoft has created in the last couple of decades on the antitrust front,” said Eric Goldman, director the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University School of Law. Mr. Goldman said that regardless of Google’s actions, regulators will have “to look at all the markets that the companies are in and look at the effects of the combined companies on those markets.”Like Microsoft’s $44.6 billion offer for Yahoo, the Google-DoubleClick deal was announced on a Friday, and Microsoft lost no time objecting. By the weekend, Microsoft, working in conjunction with AT&T and others, had begun urging antitrust regulators to scrutinize the deal.Microsoft claimed that the Google-DoubleClick combination would reduce competition in the online advertising business and put too much consumer data into the hands of Google, raising concerns about possible intrusions into user privacy.As that merger began to undergo review by regulators and faced inquiries from Congress, Microsoft, which itself had bid for DoubleClick but lost, remained one of its most vocal opponents. In September, Microsoft’s general counsel, Bradford L. Smith, for instance, told a Senate subcommittee dealing with antitrust matters that the deal would give Google “sole control over the largest database of user information the world has ever known.” And Microsoft filed some of the most detailed objections to the merger with the Federal Trade Commission, the agency in charge of reviewing it.Despite the efforts of Microsoft and others, the F.T.C. finally approved the deal in December without conditions. But the agency’s review delayed Google’s hopes to close the transaction, which remains under review in Europe. A decision is expected by April.'"

"'08-02-04,'0','From his new home in New York, Clinton had named Berger as his representative from the NSC in dealing with the special congressional committee that had been set up in early 2002 to investigate intelligence failures before September 11. Berger assumed he would later fill the same liaison role for Clinton if the 9/11 families overcame fierce opposition from the Bush White House and managed to pressure Congress to establish an independent commission to investigate the attacks. Before Berger talked with any outside investigators, he needed to remind himself what was in his files and in the files of the rest of his NSC staff.Berger thought it was just so typical that he would be left with the assignment. He brought it on himself, he knew. “Just leave it to Sandy” had been a mantra in the Clinton White House, and Berger had never protested enough when he heard it.Since 9/11, he had been forced to become the Clinton administration’s de facto spokesman again, responding to all of the reporters who wanted to know whether Clinton and his White House team felt they bore any responsibility for the attacks, whether Clinton had done everything he could during his eight years in office to kill bin Laden. Many of Ber-ger’s former colleagues in the administration had ducked the reporters’ calls — “Everyone else stepped back from the questions,” he said — but not Berger. He guessed he had spent hundreds of hours answering reporters’ calls since 9/11; that work was all unpaid, of course.But if annoyance was his first reaction to the assignment in the archives, his second was fear. And that, too, was typical of Sandy Berger. Beneath his gruff amiability, there was deep insecurity that, even he admitted, bordered on paranoia.Was there something in the White House documents that might embarrass Berger? Was there some e-mail that would give his enemies a chance to argue that Berger and his NSC staff had left the nation vulnerable to attack by al-Qaeda? If he found embarrassing documents in the files, what would he do?Was this the day he first considered smuggling classified documents out of the archives — in his pockets, in his socks — to try to protect himself?Berger entered the lobby of the archives, passed through the magne-to-meter, and was ushered into the comfortable private office of Nancy Kegan Smith, a senior archivist responsible for White House documents. Berger carried his cell phone and a leather portfolio that had a notepad inside. His use of Smith’s office to review the documents was a violation of several government rules on the handling of classified documents. He should have been placed in a secure reading room, where he might have been monitored by a guard or a surveillance camera. He should have been forced to leave his cell phone behind. But the archives had long made exceptions for former senior officials like Berger. He might be out of government now, but the archives staff knew that in Washington’s revolving door, Berger was likely to be back in power in a future Democrat administration — Hillary Clinton’s secretary of state, some thought — and able to make trouble for the archives and its budget requests. Keep him comfortable. Keep him happy.Berger took a seat next to a coffee table in Smith’s office. For his first day of the review, five boxes had been placed on a metal cart that was wheeled up next to him. The boxes contained documents taken from the “W” library; the 153 boxes that made up the “W” library held some of Clinton’s most secret White House intelligence files. The archives staff said Berger made a special request to see one of the boxes, W-049, that contained Richard A. Clarke’s personal office files. Clarke had been the NSC’s counterterrorism director since early in the Clinton presidency — a job he continued to hold in the Bush administration. Berger knew that Clarke’s files would be the definitive record of how the Clinton White House had dealt with the -al-Qaeda threat.Whatever the headaches of spending so much time in the archives, friends thought that Berger should have taken comfort from the assignment. He was being reunited with paperwork that, they believed, showed that Berger had mostly done his job at the White House when it came to al-Qaeda. Certainly he had a lot less explaining to do than others. During the Clinton presidency, Berger had been as obsessed with bin Laden and the terrorist network as anyone in the administration. As obsessed as Clarke, the White House’s “Chicken Little” on al-Qaeda. As obsessed as George Tenet, the director of central intelligence, who liked to say that his “hair was on fire” when it came to bin Laden.It had been Berger who helped convince Clinton in the -mid-1990s, at a time when bin Laden and his terrorist training camps barely registered with the Washington press corps and not at all with the public, of the danger posed by al-Qaeda. It was Berger who requested that the CIA prepare a daily report for the White House with all of the agency’s overnight intelligence on bin Laden. It was Berger who made Clarke a member of the White House Principals Committee when it met to discuss terrorist threats, allowing an otherwise -middle-ranking NSC bureaucrat to treat Tenet and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as equals (which the empire-building Clarke was pleased to do). Berger had worked through Christmas Day 1999 and the following New Year’s Eve, waiting to respond to the -al-Qaeda attack that had been predicted for the millennium.At 3:00 a.m. on January 1, 2000, Berger called Clarke. “Can I breathe now?” he asked. Clarke believed the fact that there was no attack probably had something to do with Berger’s hard work.“Sandy got it,” Tenet would say of Berger, his sometime friend, sometime adversary, on the question of al-Qaeda. It occurred to more than a few people at Tenet’s CIA that the world would be different if Berger had still been national security adviser in the spring and summer of 2001 — and not Condoleezza Rice, Berger’s successor, who had seemed so astonishingly incurious about the agency’s drumbeat of warnings in the months before 9/11.But Berger was not a man to take comfort from the facts. Facts could be spun, he knew; they always were. He had always been a worrier. Friends said it was a trait that dated from childhood; his father died suddenly when Berger was only eight, leaving his widowed mother to struggle to run the family’s small department store in upstate New York. In Bill Clinton’s frenetic White House, Berger’s worrying became obsessive; he had become a catastrophizer.Even by the standards of Washington workaholics, Berger was exceptional. His -fifteen-hour workdays at the NSC alarmed his staff. They worried that his perennial weight problems mixed with exhaustion would one day end up with him clutching his chest in a heart attack; Berger hid his paunch beneath -well-tailored, dark business suits. He seemed to think that if he went home, if he was away from the White House even for a few hours, something would go terribly wrong, and he would be left to take the blame. Reputations could be destroyed in a single news cycle. He had seen it again and again.Investigators believed Berger had wanted to review box -W-049 for a special reason, although he certainly did not share that reason with Nancy Smith and the other archivists. He wanted to find a copy of a highly classified fifteen-page report that he had asked Clarke to prepare in early 2000; it reviewed what had gone right and wrong in the government’s efforts to respond to millennium threats. It was clear that major attacks by al-Qaeda and its sympathizers had been thwarted in December 1999, including the bombing of Los Angeles International Airport. The Algerian-born terrorist who intended to carry out the bombing, Ahmed Ressam, was arrested by an alert customs agent as he tried to cross the border from Canada.Berger’s assignment to Clarke to write the “after-action report,” which included a list of twenty-nine recommendations for overhauling government antiterrorism programs, might have been seen as one more bit of evidence of Berger’s admirable focus on the threat.But in his paranoia, Berger could see that the report might be read differently — would be read differently — if it became public. Certainly it would be read differently at the Bush White House and among congressional Republicans eager to find a Democratic scapegoat for 9/11. Since several of Clarke’s recommendations had not been acted on before Clinton left office, Berger had reason to fear it would be seized upon as proof that he had not done all he could to prevent a terrorist attack. All of his hard work at the White House, all of his obsession with bin Laden, would be beside the point.Berger’s first day at the archives ended in frustration. He feared he would have to come back. He had seen only a small fraction of the documents in the files. He had not found a copy of Clarke’s 2000 after-action report. Eight years of e-mails and paperwork! How could he possibly get through it all, even if he devoted several more days to the task? It was doubly frustrating because the archives’ rules required Berger to leave behind the pages of handwritten notes he had taken that day. Since the notes were based on classified documents, they, too, were classified.It was during the second and third visits that, Berger later confessed, he decided to begin to break the law.His second visit, on July 18, 2003, came more than a year after his first. He had returned to the archives to prepare himself to answer questions from the newly created independent commission — the 9/11 commission, as it was being called — and to review the NSC files before they were turned over to the commission’s staff. The special congressional 9/11 committee had been blocked from seeing NSC files, on -separation-of-powers grounds. But the White House had reluctantly agreed to make them available to the 9/11 commission.During this visit, Berger decided that whatever the archives’ rules, he would take his notes with him. It seemed crazy to return to his office empty-handed, as if he could have otherwise remembered what was in the thousands of pages of documents he had reviewed. Removing the notes seemed innocent enough. It wasn’t as if he were stealing the documents themselves, he argued to himself. And most of the documents were from his own files, so this was secret information he had already seen.He needed to create a distraction and asked Smith, who sat at her desk working on her computer, if he could have a few minutes of privacy to make a phone call. His secretary at his newly opened consulting firm had called him about six times that day with messages from clients. He needed to call them back. He still had a business to run. Smith agreed, leaving Berger alone in her office.He moved quickly. He ripped off the top fifteen pages of his handwritten notes from the pad, folded them into thirds, and placed them in one of the inner pockets of his jacket. He left two other pages behind in hopes that would throw the archivist off the trail. He hated to leave any notes behind, but he was pleased to have something he could review in his office. Some notes were better than none, he thought.It was on his third visit, on September 2, 2003, that Berger began to steal the documents themselves. He had finally found a copy of Clarke’s 2000 after-action report; it had been faxed to the archives a few weeks earlier from Clinton’s presidential library in Little Rock, Arkansas.He created the same distraction with Smith, claiming he needed to make a phone call for business. She obliged. But Berger turned out to be a lousy thief, and he was detected almost immediately. Another archivist, John Laster, bumped into him on his way to the men’s room. “Okay, I know this is odd,” Laster wrote to Smith in an e-mail later that day. He explained that when he passed Berger in the hallway, he saw him “fiddling with something white, which appeared to be a piece of paper or multiple pieces of paper” that had been “rolled around his ankle and underneath his pant leg, with a portion of the paper sticking out underneath.”Smith was alarmed. She tried to convince herself there was an innocent explanation. In a return e-mail, she speculated that Laster had seen something else — maybe a white compression sock, the sort used for phlebitis and other circulatory problems; maybe the sock had the same color as white paper. Berger was overweight. He had seemed agitated. Maybe there was some health problem.Surely Berger wasn’t stealing classified documents, she thought. She prayed. For an archivist responsible for classified documents — and few documents were as highly classified as the ones Berger was reviewing — the idea was almost too much for Smith to bear. Taking secret documents was a crime, of course. Surely it would ruin Berger, ending his hopes for another important government job; he might even be sent to jail. And there was every reason to think the archives staff would be punished — fired? — for having allowed it to happen.It was too late to try to reconstruct the files Berger had already gone through; they had never been fully cataloged, so it was impossible to know exactly what he might have stolen.Much as she dreaded the idea, Smith decided that she would have to test Berger on his next visit to the archives. He was due to return on October 2. Smith and her staff gathered the files that Berger had asked to see on the next visit and carefully numbered each document on the back in a light pencil. If he took something, Smith could detect it instantly.'"

"'08-02-04,'0','Now his goal is to stand with a foot on each side of the divide. He wants to maintain his role as an independent-minded candidate who offers endless access to reporters and “straight talk” to voters in intimate settings. But at the same time, he must mend the deep rifts within his own party, convince wary conservatives that he can be counted on when it comes to issues like judicial appointments and tax cuts, and run a national campaign aimed not just at the White House but at helping his party in Congress.“He’s trying to run this writ large in the way he ran in New Hampshire,” said Mark Salter, one of Mr. McCain’s closest aides, on a flight Saturday when Mr. McCain flew to rallies in Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia, without a single town-hall-style meeting. “What he will resist is turning this into a bubble.”But Mr. Salter and Mr. McCain’s other advisers acknowledge that they do not have a plan for how to do that after Tuesday’s nominating contests. “It took a lot of energy and creativity to get to this point,” Mr. Salter said. “You’re going to have to give us a few weeks to figure it out.”The logistics alone will be daunting, as was clear on Friday when Mr. McCain tried to recreate the rolling media seminar of his campaign bus in the narrow aisle of his chartered plane. As a large crowd of reporters climbed over seats and pushed and squeezed to try to get close to him, Mr. McCain, en route from St. Louis to Chicago, acted as media handler and traffic cop. “If you will lift that boom a second,” he told one television sound technician.“This is the problem with not having a bus,” Mr. McCain added. “We should have gone to Chicago by bus.”But the more substantive challenge for Mr. McCain is how to retain independents and moderate Democrats as he increasingly woos the right to try to rally the party around his candidacy. Last week, he released his first national television commercial, “True Conservative,” which showed him in a meeting with Ronald Reagan and declared that he was “a proud social conservative who will never waver.”Mr. McCain, who has long opposed abortion rights, has been announcing endorsements from leading conservatives almost hourly — the former presidential candidate Steve Forbes and Theodore B. Olson, a former solicitor general, came on board Friday — although he still faces intense opposition from many conservatives, including Mr. Limbaugh, the talk radio host, who is one of his most vocal critics. Still, Mr. McCain’s aides say they believe voters know who he is and insist he will not cater to the right as he tries to secure the nomination.“We are acutely aware that McCain has a unique brand,” said Trey Walker, Mr. McCain’s South Carolina political consultant. “The brand is working right now, and if you try to inject a new Coke into this presidential race, we’ll lose to the Democrats.”With the nation facing the possibility of recession, Mr. McCain’s aides also acknowledge that he will have to become as fluent in economic policy as he is in his specialty, foreign affairs. In the primary races in Michigan and Florida last month, Mr. McCain often had Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, at his side to answer questions from voters about the subprime mortgage crisis. At a hot-tub plant in Orlando, Ms. Fiorina served as Mr. McCain’s moderator at an economic forum.But even in such a setting, Mr. McCain could not seem to help himself from veering into foreign policy. When he was asked in Orlando about what he would do about rising oil prices, he first wandered into a discourse on the confrontation in the Strait of Hormuz between three American warships and five Iranian speedboats last month and then segued into talk of the evidence that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, was supplying Venezuela with ammunition.Charles Black, a veteran of every Republican presidential campaign since 1976 and one of Mr. McCain’s senior advisers, said that Mr. McCain would sit down with his economic team after Tuesday and burrow into more policy detail. “He’ll get more in depth about the micro issues,” Mr. Black said.Mr. McCain will also travel this weekend to Germany, where he will attend an annual NATO meeting in Munich on security policy. Mr. McCain is expected to meet with Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain and perhaps with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France.Although Mr. McCain attends the conference every year as part of his Senate business, this year there will be far more attention on him. His advisers anticipate that he will make other foreign trips this year to promote his foreign policy credentials to voters who are just now tuning in.In the meantime, Mr. McCain sounded like a good party man in an appearance on “Fox News Sunday” and also at a Friday night stop in suburban Chicago at the annual dinner of the DuPage County Republicans.“The first thing we have to do after Tuesday,” Mr. McCain told the cheering crowd in Chicago, in a sentiment he carefully echoed on Fox News, “is unite this party.”'"
"'08-02-04,'0','Size is also an issue. For many young engineers, the future is in tiny start-ups, which offer a cozier work environment and greater ownership over a project, as well as the potential for a big payoff if the company is bought or sells shares to the public.Ben Newman, 23, who expects to graduate from Stanford in June with a master’s degree in computer science, is among those young pedigreed engineers who prefer the intimacy and excitement of a smaller company over the security of a large, established one.A merged Microsoft-Yahoo “definitely decreases my interest in either company,” said Mr. Newman, who interviewed with Facebook, the start-up of the moment, but took a job with Mozilla, creator of the Firefox browser.Bill Beer, a recruiter with Daversa Partners in San Francisco, said the job market was “more competitive in the Valley right now than I’ve ever seen it.” That is because of the battle for talent among behemoths like Google and Microsoft, but also because of what Mr. Beer describes as the appeal of working for “the almost endless supply of companies that are five guys in a garage with a really promising-sounding idea.”Money, of course, is a factor in almost any engineer’s job-choosing calculus. Many of those students descending on recruiters from Google and Facebook were no doubt motivated by the idea of becoming rich in exchange for just a few years of hard work.Yet in Silicon Valley there is also the cool factor, and the prospect of potentially working on the hot new thing.Josh Becker, a venture capitalist with New Cycle Capital in San Francisco, said Microsoft’s profile in the Valley would be significantly raised “if they took over an iconic company like Yahoo.” But, he added, “whether that would translate into a sense that Microsoft is a cool place to work remains to be seen.”Microsoft, which declined to comment for this article, has cast its bid for Yahoo as a classic case of the No. 2 and No. 3 in a market teaming up to challenge the leader. If the deal is consummated, a combined Microsoft-Yahoo would no doubt pour resources into the fight, and it might start closing the gap with Google in the race for online ad dollars. That would help its stock price and its recruitment effort.“If Microsoft manages to keep talent and gains some traction, then it could help attract talent to its business,” said Michael Morell, an executive recruiter with Riviera Partners in Palo Alto, Calif. Attracting brain power to its cause is critical if it is to keep pace with Google, which has hired thousands of Ph.D.s and other software jockeys in the last few years to devise clever algorithms and add features aimed at pleasing users and advertisers alike.On the other hand, Mr. Morell said, Microsoft might be vying to pay a large premium for a company already past its prime. “People look at Yahoo and think it might have already seen its best days,” Mr. Morell said.One risk for Microsoft is that it could spend billions to buy Yahoo only to find that many of its most talented people have already left. That is one of the perils of high-priced acquisitions in the talent economy, where the real prize is often the collective abilities of a company’s employees.Silicon Valley, after all, is a place where large companies have been known to pay vast sums for smaller ones largely to buy the commitment of a few gifted engineers. But like others interviewed for this article, Mr. Becker of New Cycle Capital said he was already hearing about Yahoo employees, loath to work for an even larger corporation whose bosses are around 850 miles away in Redmond, Wash., reaching out to friends working at other companies.On the other hand, one Yahoo employee, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Microsoft news had the opposite effect on him and other members of his team, which has been working on Yahoo’s core search technology.“I heard the news Friday and thought, ‘I’m staying,’ ” he said. “We really want to beat Google. And if Microsoft is equally determined to beat Google, then sign me up.” He described the exodus of people from Yahoo over the past couple of years as a “bloodbath,” but also said the search group, a relatively small group of a few hundred employees, has remained largely intact.Even Google, with 17,000 employees, has lost some of its luster as a top spot for engineers as the potential for big gains in its share price has begun to diminish. The company still receives more than 20,000 résumés a week, or two every minute, according to Sunny Gettinger, a Google spokeswoman. But it is also starting to lose engineers to start-ups and budding Valley stars like Facebook, including engineers like Pedram Keyani.Mr. Keyani, 30, started work at Google in June 2005, then left last summer for Facebook, which then had around 300 employees. He said at least a dozen engineers have left Google for Facebook over the past year.“When I joined Google, there were around 3,000 employees, and in two years that number basically bubbled up to 16,000 employees,” Mr. Keyani said. “When you go from a company of 16,000 to a company of 300 people, you effectively have 50 times more impact on the direction of the product and on the company.”Yet since Mr. Keyani’s arrival just six months ago, the Facebook staff has swelled by 50 percent, to 450. It seems a matter of time before Facebook, a leader of the social networking world, is replaced by the next “it” company, pushing the likes of Yahoo and Microsoft further down the list of the area’s most desirable tech factories.“Facebook will be hot for a while, and then there will be other hot places that come along,” said Mr. Demas, the former Microsoft and Yahoo employee. “People want to have an impact, and it’s hard to make an impact when you’re being hired as employee No. 90,000.”'"
"'08-02-04,'0','The Queensland Gas Company, an Australian producer of natural gas from coal seams, and the BG Group of Britain plan to invest about 8 billion Australian dollars ($7.2 billion) in an export project in northeastern Australia to tap rising demand for the fuel.The partners plan to build a liquefied natural gas project near Gladstone with a capacity of three million to four million metric tons a year, with deliveries starting in 2013, Queensland Gas, which is based in Brisbane, said Sunday. The investment will include the development of coal seam gas fields, a 236-mile pipeline and a production plant.Demand for liquefied natural gas is expected to more than double to 400 million metric tons a year by 2015 as utilities in north Asia, Europe and the United States increase imports for power generation. The investment will give BG, the biggest importer of L.N.G. into the American market, its first supply of the fuel in the Pacific Basin, the largest import market.BG, based in Reading, England, said on Friday that it had agreed to pay £299 million ($588 million) for a 20 percent interest in coal seam gas assets owned by Queensland Gas and 9.9 percent of the Australian company. BG, whose market value is 33 times greater than the Australian partner’s, will own 70 percent of the L.N.G. plant.'"
"'08-02-04,'0','The album Marcus Roberts recreated from start to finish at the Allen Room over the weekend is 18 years old, but its mannerisms don’t come from any particular era. The key to “Deep in the Shed,” that record of six concisely written pieces in blues form, is its natural shuffling of elements from jazz’s entire life.It’s also one of the greatest cultural artifacts that owes its existence to Jazz at Lincoln Center. “Deep in the Shed” is a product of that organization’s artistic forces: Mr. Roberts started working with Wynton Marsalis’s groups in 1985 and shortly thereafter became one of the first important pianists in the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra.The album wasn’t pedantic, explicitly connecting style X with style Y or pulling you through a chronological history of jazz. And it never became redundant either. It shifted keys and tempos, masked its blues form in the theme sections and could sound ancient — older than the Delta blues for instance — or modern.One thinks of it in the past tense. At the Allen Room the album was performed on Friday and Saturday, twice each night, in separate seatings. That allowed about 2,000 people to hear its music in total. But for now its rediscovery will be limited. The album is out of print, which is strange; it’s not a record that should be shrugged off.The playing in Friday’s early set, by a nine-piece band with only one of the album’s original musicians — Wessell Anderson, the saxophonist — was a little restrained, but the beauty of the compositions came through clearly. There were Ellington-esque saxophone voicings, rhythm-section passages that suggested the John Coltrane Quartet, and semi-Arabic scales. Each piece was carefully arranged and packed with incident and contrast.One of the album’s pieces most easily remembered across 18 years is “E. Dankworth,” if only because the recorded version included Mr. Marsalis playing a charged, perfectly one-upping trumpet solo under the pseudonym of its title. (Mr. Roberts kept up the ruse, identifying E. Dankworth in his introduction as “a trumpet player from London who sounds a lot like Wynton.” Mr. Marsalis was in Los Angeles, performing with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra.)'"
"'08-02-04,'0','Those research scientists are far outnumbered by the thousands of Microsoft engineers working in advanced development and direct product development.“The outcome of basic research is insights, and what development people do is take those insights and create products with them,” Dr. Chayes said. “The two things are very different.”Microsoft is adamant about retaining a pure research department reminiscent of the old Bell Laboratories, whose scientists were awarded six Nobel Prizes over the years.""Microsoft is probably the sole remaining corporate research lab that still values basic research,"" said Maria Klawe, a mathematician who is president of Harvey Mudd College.Google employs 100 scientists in its research labs. Many employees are encouraged to spend 20 percent of their time on something they are passionate about that may not be directly related to their main project.The new Microsoft lab, which will be next door to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is scheduled to open in July. Dr. Chayes will be joined at first by three other Microsoft scientists, including her husband, Christian Borgs, who is also a mathematician and who will be deputy managing director of the Boston lab.Dr. Chayes will be one of the first women to direct a research lab run by an American corporation. She was a tenured professor of mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles, when Microsoft hired her to do research. Dr. Chayes was skeptical, she said, and wondered why Microsoft would want a mathematician whose work might not pay off for many decades. But the company promised her that she would have full academic freedom and support for unconventional work.Dr. Chayes has since built her group in Redmond, called the Theory Group, into one of the most eminent research groups on or off a university campus. “Anyone who’s anyone in theoretical computer science visits her laboratory,” said Lenore Blum, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University.Richard F. Rashid, a former Carnegie Mellon computer scientist who is senior vice president of research at Microsoft, said Dr. Chayes’s work is valuable.""If you look at her research, it’s very theoretical,"" said Dr. Rashid, who holds a doctorate in computer science. At the same time, he said, two areas of her expertise have proved useful for Microsoft.The work she did in developing simple models of certain liquids and solids turned out to be useful in the study of random, self-engineered networks like the Internet.

Unlike other companies with intellectual property interests to protect, she said, Microsoft does not require internal prepublication review of academic papers written by its researchers.Dr. Chayes, who works with groups that help bring more young women into the sciences, said she hoped to serve as a role model for young women considering a career in computer science or math, two fields that have long suffered a dearth of women.'"
"'08-02-04,'0','But they certainly made the most of their shortened time, holding rallies, starting new television advertisements and, in Mr. Obama’s case, accepting another endorsement from the Kennedy family. Maria Shriver, the wife of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and daughter of Eunice Kennedy, announced her support, adding force to Mr. Obama’s growing strength in that state.Ms. Shriver appeared at a rally in Los Angeles with Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey and Caroline Kennedy that reflected another attempt by Mr. Obama to undercut Mrs. Clinton’s advantage among female voters.Mr. Romney, in a last-minute switch of plans, decided to fly to California on Monday. His aides argued that Mr. McCain had left that flank vulnerable by deciding to head to Massachusetts. And Mr. Romney tried to discredit Mr. McCain among conservatives by attacking his record on immigration and the environment.“Yesterday, Barack Obama said there’s not a dime’s worth of difference between he and Senator McCain on illegal immigration,” Mr. Romney said at a rally outside Chicago. “I’m afraid it’s going to be real hard to win the White House if there’s not much difference between our nominee and theirs, and that’s why I’m going to make sure that we stand for Republican ideals and win the White House on that platform.”Mr. McCain was already looking to the future, incorporating an unusual attack on Mrs. Clinton as part of his standard denunciation of federal budget earmarks. He made the remarks in Fairfield, Conn., where he was escorted by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat-turned-independent.“In her short time in the United States Senate, the senator from New York, Senator Clinton, has gotten $500 million worth of pork-barrel projects,” Mr. McCain said. “My friends, that kind of thing is going to stop when I’m president of the United States.”Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama both tussled, at a distance, over which of them would be the better general election candidate in a campaign that many Democrats now think will be waged against Mr. McCain, a Republican with a history of drawing strong support from independent voters. Mrs. Clinton, her voice hoarse and raspy, responded to a question about this by pointing to her unexpected victory in her first Senate race.“You know, I hear all these folks talking about who is and isn’t electable — and they said all the same things in New York,” she added, noting that voter support for her grew and deepened over time. “I trust the voters — frankly, that’s who matters.”“One thing about me, I’ve already been through tough campaigns, and I think that says something about me,” she said. “My opponent hasn’t had to go through that baptism of fire. And in a general election, you know what’s going to happen to our nominee. Let’s not kid ourselves.”Mr. Obama raised similar questions about Mrs. Clinton as he, too, raised the specter of a McCain candidacy this fall and reminded his audience that Mrs. Clinton had initially voted to support the war in Iraq.“If John McCain is the nominee, then the Democratic Party has to ask itself, Do you want a candidate who has similar policies to John McCain on the war in Iraq or somebody who can offer a stark contrast?” Mr. Obama said. “See, when I’m the nominee, John McCain won’t be able to say that “You were for this war in Iraq,’ because I wasn’t. He won’t be able to say I followed the Bush-Cheney doctrine of not talking to leaders we don’t like, because I don’t.”A blizzard of state and national polls showed Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama in a tight race, but with significant voters still undecided about what they were going to do. In the CBS News poll, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama are each the choice of 41 percent of the Democratic primary voters. Mr. Obama has narrowed the gap in a number of key states voting Tuesday.The polls this weekend suggest the Republican contest is less in flux, with Mr. McCain having staked out a significant lead over Mr. Romney and a third candidate, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas.Mr. McCain was endorsed Sunday by Pete Wilson, former governor of California, Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota and the editorial page of Newsday.“It’s not over yet, but it is certainly trending that way,” said Todd Harris, who was a senior adviser to Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee, who dropped out of the race on Jan. 22. His view was echoed throughout the day by Republican leaders outside and inside Mr. McCain’s camp.Mr. Romney’s situation was complicated by Mr. Huckabee, who — apparently seeing an opening should Mr. Romney falter — vowed again on Sunday to stay in the race. Mr. Huckabee, a Baptist minister, has drawn conservative support from Mr. Romney and challenged his conservative credentials.“I want to say something to Mitt Romney: The people who support me are supporting me because they know where I stand on human life and they don’t know where you stand,” he told reporters in Georgia.Mr. McCain made a pre-Super Bowl stop at the Green Dragon, a Boston pub. The visit was a display of confidence by the senator from Arizona, given the spare number of days left before the vote. It reflected the calculation of Mr. McCain’s advisers that a loss by Mr. Romney in his home state on Tuesday could, if combined with other losses in other big states, effectively force him from the race.Mr. Romney dismissed the visit as a stunt as his aides warned that Mr. McCain would come to regret flying to Massachusetts rather than spending time in California.“I don’t know why he’s campaigning in Massachusetts — there are 22 states voting,” Mr. Romney said. “I expect that I’m to win in Massachusetts. I’m going to where I think the most delegates are up for grabs. To me this is not about trying to tweak somebody or get in their head. This is about getting delegates and becoming the nominee.”Mr. Romney and his aides planned an aggressive final 24 hours, including using automatic telephone calls by prominent supporters to raise questions about Mr. McCain’s conservative credentials and his temperament — including one taped by Rick Santorum, the former senator from Pennsylvania.“John McCain voted against the president’s tax cuts, worked with Ted Kennedy to pass what many people call amnesty for illegal aliens,” Mr. Santorum says in the call, adding, “As a conservative, I don’t agree with McCain on many issues, and I don’t think he has the temperament and leadership ability to move the country in the right direction.”On the Democratic side, Mr. Obama, flexing his financial muscle, bought Super Bowl advertisements in 24 markets to present an advertisement highlighting his opposition to the war and pledging to fight global warming. “We want to turn the page,” Mr. Obama says in the spot, speaking under a musical track that is faster-paced than most political advertisements. “The world as it is is not the world as it has to be.”At Mrs. Clinton’s campaign event in Missouri, a woman used a profanity in describing Mr. Bush as she accused him of signing a secret agreement to merge the United States, Mexico and Canada into a new country. Mrs. Clinton did not respond to the cursing; she appeared to grin slightly at first as the crowd cheered, and her face went blank before assuring the questioner that her fears about the merger were ill-placed.“Let me say I’ve heard that story and there’s not a lot of truth to it,” she said. “If I am president, if I discover there is such an agreement, it’ll be gone in a bird-dog minute.”The Republican National Committee quickly sent around a news report noting that she said nothing when the woman swore about the president.'"
"'08-02-04,'0','In addition, several Google executives made “back-channel” calls over the weekend to allies at companies like Time Warner, which owns AOL, to inquire whether they planned to pursue a rival offer and how they could assist, these people said. Google owns 5 percent of AOL.Despite Google’s efforts and the work of Yahoo’s own bankers over the weekend to garner interest in a bid to rival Microsoft’s, one did not seem likely, at least at this early stage.For example, a spokesman for the News Corporation said Sunday night that it was not preparing a bid, and other frequently named prospective suitors like Time Warner, AT&T and Comcast have not begun work on offers, people close to them said. They suggested that they did not want to enter a bidding war with Microsoft, which could easily top their offers.A spokesman for Time Warner declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Comcast. A representative for AT&T could not be reached.In the meantime, people close to Yahoo said that the company received a flurry of inquires over the weekend from potential suitors. Some people inside Yahoo have even speculated about the prospect of breaking up the company. That could mean selling or outsourcing its search-related business to Google and spinning off or selling its operations that produce original content, these people said.“Everyone is considering all kinds of options and a deal on search is one of them,” a person familiar with the situation said.One person involved in Yahoo’s deliberations suggested that “the sum of the parts are worth more than the whole,” arguing that its various pieces like Yahoo Finance, for example, could be sold to a company like the News Corporation for a huge premium while Yahoo Sports could be sold to a company like ESPN, a unit of the Walt Disney Company.Executives at rival companies were less optimistic about such a breakup strategy. “No one can get to a $44 billion price,” one executive at a major media company said, “even if you split it into a dozen pieces.”In making its bid for Yahoo, Microsoft is betting that past antitrust rulings against it for abusing its monopoly power in personal computer software will not restrain its hand in an Internet deal.In the United States, a federal district court in Washington ruled in 2001 that Microsoft had repeatedly violated the law by stifling the threat to its monopoly position posed by Netscape, which popularized the Web browser. The suit, brought during the Clinton administration, was settled by the Bush administration. But as a result of a consent decree extending through 2009, a federal court and a three-member team of technical experts monitors Microsoft’s behavior.In 2006, for example, after Google complained to the Justice Department and the European Commission that Microsoft was making its MSN search engine the default in the most recent version of its Web browser, Microsoft modified the software so that consumers could easily change to Google or Yahoo.In Google’s statement on Sunday, it said that the potential purchase of Yahoo by Microsoft could pose threats to competition that needed to be examined by policy makers.Google’s broadly worded concerns lacked detailed claims about any anticompetitive effects of the deal, and the company did not publicly ask regulators to take specific actions at this time.“Could Microsoft now attempt to exert the same sort of inappropriate and illegal influence over the Internet that it did with the PC?” asked David Drummond, Google’s senior vice president and chief legal officer, writing on the company’s blog.Yahoo and Microsoft declined to comment Sunday on Google’s actions. Earlier on Sunday, Microsoft’s general counsel, Bradford L. Smith, said in a statement: “The combination of Microsoft and Yahoo will create a more competitive marketplace by establishing a compelling No. 2 competitor for Internet search and online advertising.”Google’s effort to derail or delay the deal on antitrust grounds mirrors Microsoft’s own actions with respect to Google’s bid for the online advertising specialist DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, announced in April.The strategy is not surprising, considering that any delays would work to Google’s benefit. “Google can tap into all of the ill will that Microsoft has created in the last couple of decades on the antitrust front,” said Eric Goldman, director the High-Tech Law Institute at the Santa Clara University School of Law.The outcome of any antitrust inquiry will hinge, in part, on how regulators define various markets. Microsoft-Yahoo, for instance, would have a large share of the Web-based e-mail market, but a smaller share of the overall e-mail market.“The potential concern would be that Microsoft, if it acquires Yahoo, could do on the Internet what it did in the personal computer world — make technical standards more Microsoft-centric and steer consumers to its products,” said Stephen D. Houck, a lawyer representing the states involved in the consent decree against Microsoft.Yahoo has not made a public statement about the proposed deal since Friday, when it said it was weighing Microsoft’s offer as well as alternatives and would “pursue the best course of action to maximize long-term value for shareholders.”Carl W. Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, said an antitrust review of the Microsoft-Yahoo deal could take a long time and “may well bleed into a new administration with an entire new view on antitrust than the Bush administration.”'"

"'08-02-05,'0','LONDON — BP, the British oil giant, announced on Tuesday that it would cut an additional 5,000 jobs by the middle of next year, part of plan by the chief executive, Anthony B. Hayward, to slim management and make the company more efficient.The company also announced a fourth-quarter profit that missed analyst estimates, but its shares surged after it said it would raise its dividend 31 percent, citing an “increasingly robust” outlook.Profit in the last three months of 2007 rose 53 percent to $4.4 billion, from $2.88 billion, in the period a year earlier. Excluding gains or losses from holding inventories or one-time items, profit was $4 billion or about 10 percent less than analysts expected.But BP said overall oil and gas production was expected to grow this year, justifying the increase in the dividend, to 13.5 cents a share. “The rise reflected the company’s increasingly robust view of the future and greater confidence in its ability to deliver sustained dividend income to shareholders,” Mr. Hayward said.Mr. Hayward, who took over from John Browne last year, is trying to improve performance and efficiency by streamlining operations, removing management layers and cutting jobs. Some investors hope Mr. Hayward can help BP leave behind its recent past, which is marred by a fatal explosion at a Texas refinery in 2005 and leaks of crude oil from pipelines in Alaska.'"
"'08-02-05,'0','In London, the FTSE 100 closed down 2.6 percent. In Frankfurt, the DAX was down 3.4 percent, and the CAC 40 index in France was off 4 percent.Confidence among European investors had also been undermined by weaker-than-expected European economic data. Economists said the data suggested that the economic weakness was no longer solely a problem in the United States but was spreading to Europe.“The weak European data is starting to become more prevalent,” Mr. Shapiro said. “The concept of America as an island and everyone else being fat and happy is no longer clear.”In the United States survey, businesses complained of rising costs and falling orders. In responding to the survey, 42 percent of businesses said they felt worse about the next 12 months compared with 2007; only 16 percent felt better.For the first time, the institute published a new monthly composite index to provide a broader measure of the non-manufacturing sector, taking in the measures of business activity, new orders, employment and supplier deliveries. This index was 44.6 in January, indicating a contraction.Some economists warned against reading too much into the extraordinary weakness of the indices since the series has been published only since 1998, but taken together with other recent economic statistics they appeared to point to a gathering economic slowdown.According to the new non-manufacturing report, only three non-manufacturing industries reported growth in January, while 14 contracted.The index was released earlier than the institute had planned before the market opened on Tuesday morning, the institute said, because of a possible leak of information. Analysts said rumors that the figures were going to be poor had circulated earlier in the markets and may have been one of the reasons for the early weakness in stocks.In the report, the institute’s chairman, Anthony Nieves, said, “The overall indication in January is that non-manufacturing has come to the end of a long-term period of growth and has contracted for the month of January.""“The figures are terrible,” said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at Global Insight. “This clearly makes it more likely that it’s not just a slowdown but a recession in the first half of this year. The general picture emerging is that the economy is contracting.”Mr. Gault said that during earlier slowdowns, the index had declined gradually over several months, but that this time the index had dropped extraordinarily sharply.The latest survey followed the publication of government figures Friday showing that the nation’s employers eliminated 17,000 jobs in January, the first decline in the work force in more than four years, and adding to the evidence of a severely weakening economy.Howard Silverblatt, an analyst at Standard & Poor’s, said the sell-off in the stock market was broad-based, though financial, telecommunications and energy stocks were the hardest hit. They had recovered in recent sessions but lost ground Tuesday on the evidence that the slowdown was spreading more widely across the economy.“There’s a lot of worry out there about the economy,” Mr. Silverblatt said. “The biggest difficulty is we don’t know how bad it is.”In a telephone interview, Mr. Nieves of the Institute for Supply Management said he had been surprised by the numbers because until now “the non-manufacturing sector has been very resilient with regards to what is going on with the rest of the economy.”He said most worrying was a fall in employment reported in the sector but he said businesses had been surveyed before the recent slight decline in oil prices and the latest cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which may have led to an improvement in conditions since then.The signs of possible recession pose an awkward challenge for Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve.Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, a research and trading firm, said the survey released Tuesday was probably a snapshot of confidence at what was the tail end of a slowdown in the economy. It was therefore catching them at their gloomiest, and was not a good guide to business conditions going forward.He pointed to rising commodity prices, a steepening of the yield curve and a relative outperformance by small-cap stocks as signs that conditions might be set to improve. The risk is that the Fed’s monetary policy stand might then be too accommodating and fuel inflation, he said.“My expectation right now is that we are in the most vulnerable period for the economy, and going forward we are probably close to the equity market shaking itself out of this funk,” he said.'"
"'08-02-05,'0','Mr. McConnell’s overall assessment, representing the consensus view of the country’s intelligence agencies, was decidedly mixed.The report noted that there were no major terrorist attacks in much of the world over the past year, and suggested that Al Qaeda’s global image was “beginning to lose some of its luster.”“There was no major attack against the United States or most of our European, Latin American, East Asia allies and partners,” the report said.Mr. McConnell noted the unraveling of several terror plots in Europe. And he said that the recent reported death of Abu Laith al-Libi, a senior Al Qaeda military commander, in a missile attack in Pakistan was the most serious blow to the group’s top leadership since December 2005, when its external operations chief, Hamza Rabia, was killed.But the new report warned that Al Qaeda remained a serious threat, and said that its affiliate in Iraq was beginning to export militants for attacks in other countries.“I am increasingly concerned that as we inflict significant damage on al-Qa’ida in Iraq, it may shift resources to mounting more attacks outside of Iraq,” Mr. McConnell wrote, referring to the Iraqi terrorist group that has claimed allegiance to the international Al Qaeda network.But the report said that intelligence gleaned from documents captured in Iraq suggested that fewer than 100 ofit’s the Iraqi group’s militants had moved from Iraq to establish cells in other countries.Mr. McConnell expressed concern about the ways in which globalization had broadened the numbers of threats facing the United States.“For example, as government, private sector, and personal activities continue to move to networked operations and our digital systems add ever more capabilities, our vulnerability to penetration and other hostile cyber actions grows,” the report said.The report attempted to calibrate its assessment of the Iranian nuclear threat, following the National Intelligence Estimate last year that concluded that Iran had probably suspended its nuclear weapons work in the fall of 2003. That finding appeared to undercut American diplomatic efforts to press Iran on the nuclear issue.“We remain concerned about Iran’s intentions and assess with moderate-to-high confidence that Tehran at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons,” the report said.“We assess with high confidence that Iran has the scientific, technical and industrial capacity eventually to produce nuclear weapons,” it said, adding that the only plausible way to prevent Iran from producing such weapons was “an Iranian political decision to abandon a nuclear weapons objective.”On North Korea, the intelligence analysts judge “with at least moderate confidence” that the regime in Pyongyang continues its uranium enrichment efforts today. But it said that the North “probably views its capabilities as being more for deterrence and coercive diplomacy than for war-fighting, and would consider using nuclear weapons only under certain narrow circumstances.”Further, the report concludes that the North’s Taepo Dong-2 missile, which failed in a flight test in July 2006, “probably has the potential capability to deliver a nuclear-weapon-sized payload to the continental United States.”“But,” it added, “we assess the likelihood of successful delivery would be low, absent successful testing.”The committee chairman, Senator John Rockefeller, said in prepared remarks that he was concerned that the Al Qaeda threat had “actually grown since last year’s threat review, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan.” American officials have expressed reservations about the ability of the Pakistani government to keep militants out of the rugged area along the Afghan border.“Al Qaeda has used this border safe haven to reconstitute itself and launch offensive operations that threaten to undo the stability brought to Afghanistan and undermine, if not overthrow, the Pakistan government,” said Mr. Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat.This, Mr. Rockefeller added, gave Al Qaeda “a base of operations from which to plot and direct attacks against the United States.”At the same hearing, Gen. Michael Hayden, head of the Central Intelligence Agency, confirmed the identities of three men who were videotaped being interrogated by the agency using “waterboarding,” a technique that simulates drowning.General Hayden said the men were Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001; a senior Al Qaeda operative, Abu Zubaydah; and another man suspected of being a senior operative, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.General Hayden said they were waterboarded in 2002 and 2003 for two reasons: because the C.I.A. knew very little about Al Qaeda operations, and because the agency feared that more terror attacks were imminent. Both those considerations, he said on Tuesday, have since changed.Attorney General Michael Mukasey, whose department is investigating the destruction of the agency’s tapes of those interrogations, has refused to rule out the future use of waterboarding. But Mr. McConnell, in his testimony on Tuesday, said that new procedures were in place to limit authorization for using the technique: General Hayden would have to notify Mr. McConnell, who would have to ask Mr. Mukasey, who in turn would have to obtain the president’s approval before authorizing a waterboarding.'"
"'08-02-05,'0','PHOENIX -- Perhaps it was inevitable, given the stakes and the presence of thousands of Giants and Patriots fans side by side, that some of the energy in the 64,000-seat University of Phoenix Stadium would funnel into the intense Boston-New York sports rivalry. Chants of ""18-1"" increased Sunday night as the Giants' Super Bowl upset became secure, a mockery reminiscent of the ""1918"" chant Yankee fans inflicted for so many year on their Red Sox counterparts. There were predictable retorts: ""Yankees Stink"", or its equivalent. When they played ""New York, New York"" over the loudspeaker after the award presentation, it must have reminded New Englanders of the swagger that accompanied so many Yankee victories over the years.But this wasn't swagger, or gloating. What struck me as I stood watching the glittering confetti blanket the field and the presentation of the Super Bowl trophy was how intense and communal the accomplishment seemed for most of the Giant fans there -- a shared joy and amazement at what they had just witnessed. For many, the Patriot fans might as well not have been there. Instead, the emotions were turned inward, toward one another, members of an exclusive club. It said much more than ""The Giants humbled the not-so-perfect Patriots."" It said, with some sense of marvel, ""We did it.""Giant fans are a tough lot, but this result brought them face to face, as Fitzgerald wrote, ""with something commensurate to their capacity for wonder."" Sports can still do that sometimes. That's not an emotion you inject with venom and use against the enemy. No, on this occasion it was manifest in the shouts of glee, and the rippling No. 10 jerseys that burst from the stadium into the cool Arizona night. So many of them were draped on kids, boys and girls with huge smiles and a big bounce in their steps. No school for them the next day. But those jerseys would find their way into home room on Tuesday for sure. Spike Lee high-fived people as he moved through the crowd (he had finally found a winner, and not at 33rd and 8th), and strangers stopped to rhapsodize with one another about David Tyree's otherworldly catch.Both teams' fans behaved well. If there were any of the small inter-rivalry scuffles that routinely break out in the upper reaches of Yankee Stadium, I didn't notice them. This seemed less like a salvo on the Boston-New York battleground than a singular night of shocking achievement, one that Giant fans could savor like a great shared meal at the family dinner table. And this time, it was all gravy.'"

"'08-02-05,'0','Hispanics regard voting this year as a strategy of self-defense, said Sergio Bendixen, a pollster based in Miami. For many of them, Mr. Bendixen said, “the immigration debate has not been about immigration policy; it has been about whether Hispanics belong in America.”Hispanics “feel they need to vote to show they are a group that cannot be abused or discriminated against,” said Mr. Bendixen, who surveys Hispanics for the Clinton campaign.On Tuesday, 24 states that include nearly 60 percent of the nation’s Hispanic electorate will be voting in primaries or caucuses. Voting that day will be 7 of the 10 states with the highest percentages of Hispanics among their voters, including New Mexico, where Hispanics constitute more than one-third of the electorate (Democrats will caucus there); California, where they are about 23 percent; and Arizona, where they are about 17 percent.The electoral energy has been channeled by a voter registration campaign that has built new links between local Hispanic organizations and major Spanish-language media, led by Univision, the national television network.Both Republican and Democratic strategists say that strong immigration enforcement and tough talk against illegal immigration by the Republican candidates, with the exception of Mr. McCain, have antagonized Hispanics in general.“The hard-line rhetoric on immigration is turning off all Latinos,” said Lionel Sosa, a Republican advertising executive in San Antonio who handled Hispanic outreach in the presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan and both President Bushes. “When people talk about building a wall and sending those Mexicans back, it comes off as anti-Latino. We say: ‘You’re talking about my family, and I don’t like it.’ ”One newly energized and mobilized Hispanic voter is Silvia Benitez, 45, who was born in Mexico but has been living in Arizona for more than a decade. A community outreach worker in a federal preschool program in Phoenix, Mrs. Benitez sat on the sidelines in the elections of 2004 and 2006 as a legal immigrant.This election, she said, will be different. Among several recent immigration measures Arizona adopted were the nation’s toughest sanctions against employers who hire unauthorized workers, which took effect Jan. 1.“We don’t feel safe as a community,” Mrs. Benitez said. “Some people judge you now because of how you appear, your skin color, your English accent.”Frustrated that President Bush, in her estimation, had failed to push through a bill to give illegal immigrants a path to become legal, Mrs. Benitez applied for citizenship last year and took her oath as an American in October.With her measured voice and folded hands, Mrs. Benitez does not look like a firebrand. But she is talking like one. “It is about time for us to take action and make a big movement of political change for Latinos,” she said.Another Phoenix resident, Silvia Trinidad, 20, is among a fast-growing group of young Hispanics who have recently reached the voting age of 18. A legal Mexican immigrant since she was a child, Ms. Trinidad is studying criminal justice in college and working for the county sheriff as a detention officer, hoping to become a police officer. She signed up last fall to become a citizen.“Every vote counts,” Ms. Trinidad said, “and I will be able to vote against the laws they are trying to make now against the immigrants.”Ricardo Tavizón, 29, a recently naturalized citizen who sells used cars in South Phoenix, said he wanted to vote to challenge immigration enforcement and to represent other immigrants who are not citizens.Eliseo Medina, executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, said he was surprised by the response to the voter registration campaign, called Ya Es Hora, Ve y Vota or “Now is the time, go and vote.” .“In 42 years of organizing, I’ve never seen this level of interest in an election,” said Mr. Medina, whose union is part of the drive.After helping hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants apply for citizenship last year, the campaign now aims to persuade six million unregistered Hispanics to sign up to vote by November, he said. An estimated 18.2 million Hispanics are eligible to vote.That goal is plausible, Hispanic leaders said, because of the coordination between community groups, and the newspapers of ImpreMedia, which include El Diario La Prensa of New York, and Univision. The television network is running five public service advertisements about the registration drive, while the newspapers print guides to voter registration. The campaign includes major groups like the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, a bipartisan organization, and the National Council of La Raza.Hispanic voters may cast deciding votes again on Tuesday. Nationwide, Senator Obama has pulled to a tie with Senator Clinton, at 41 percent each, according to a CBS News poll released Sunday. In Arizona, Mr. Obama is ahead among Latinos, by 53 percent to 37 percent for Mrs. Clinton, according to a poll by Mason-Dixon for McClatchy/MSNBC. But in California, where Hispanics make up nearly one-fourth of Democratic voters, Mrs. Clinton has a lead of 52 percent to 19 percent for Mr. Obama, a Field poll conducted from Jan. 25 to Feb. 1 found.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama support giving legal status to illegal immigrants. But she has far stronger name recognition among Hispanic voters, polls show.In the Republican races, Mr. McCain holds a wide margin of support among Hispanics over Mr. Romney, who promised tougher action against illegal immigrants. But Mr. McCain may pay for his Hispanic support by losing ground with conservatives. On Monday, Roy Beck, the president of NumbersUSA, one of the biggest groups battling illegal immigration, sent out an e-mail alert that he said went to 1.5 million supporters, urging them to vote against Mr. McCain.Based on recent trends, a surge in Hispanic voter registration would strongly favor the Democratic Party in November, since 57 percent of registered Hispanics identify themselves as Democrats while 23 percent align with the Republicans, according to a study in December by the Pew Hispanic Center, a Washington research group. While immigration is a litmus-test issue for many Latinos, it is not their only concern. Polls show that the war in Iraq, the economy and education are also on their minds.With the voter registration drive just starting, its full force will not be felt until November. But Hispanic leaders’ goals are clear.“It is not inconceivable,” said Cesar Conde, executive vice-president of Univision, “that Hispanics will have the key role in electing the next president of the United States.”'"
"'08-02-05,'0','An enduring example is The Daily News’s Page 1 in 1975 after President Gerald R. Ford rejected federal help for New York City during its worst fiscal crisis. The headline remains a classic: “Ford to City: Drop Dead.” Within weeks, Mr. Ford switched gears and lent the city a hand. But it was too late for him, politically speaking. A year later, New York State voters told him to drop dead. Losing the state, he later acknowledged, cost him the presidency.The stardom implicit in a catchy tabloid nickname is not something Mr. McCain always enjoyed.When he ran for president in 2000, he ran afoul of New York’s Republican leaders, whose approach to politics was much the same as Vladimir V. Putin’s. They’ve never liked the idea of anyone’s qualifying for their primary other than their designated candidate. In 2000, their choice was George W. Bush.News articles chronicled Mr. McCain’s ultimately successful struggle to get on the ballot. But the tabloids did not feel he was known enough in these parts to merit a “Mac” or a “McC.” “McCain” he remained.Times have clearly changed for him, as they have for other candidates. Consider Senator Barack Obama. “Obama” may not be the longest name ever, but it can still give tabloid headline writers fits. The News met the challenge with “Bam.”“ ‘Bam’ is just so cool,” said Adam Sommers, the newspaper’s copy desk chief. “You can do so much with ‘Bam.’ It’s a little gift from the tabloid gods.”Let’s say the Illinois senator fares poorly. “Bam — You’re Out” might work. The Post did a neat turn with the nickname when Senator Edward M. Kennedy endorsed Mr. Obama last week. “Bamalot,” the Page 1 headline cried.But in New York’s relentless tabloid war, The Post resorts to “Bam” hesitantly, if only because The News got there first. It has begun experimenting with “O” for Mr. Obama. A single letter is nice and easy. Look at the way “W” works for Mr. Bush. But Barry Gross, The Post’s copy desk chief, is not sure that “O” is a keeper. “We’re still feeling our way around it,” he said.“Mitt” for Willard Mitt Romney speaks for itself. When it comes to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, the tabloids are at odds. For some reason, she is “Hill” in The Post and “Hil” in The News. Her husband, the former president, is an unsurprising “Bill” — when he isn’t “Bubba,” that is.Mike Huckabee cannot be “Mike,” because that’s reserved for New York’s mayor, a k a “Bloomy.” By default, the former Arkansas governor morphed into “Huck,” a nom de tab that has lent itself on occasion to an unfortunate winking salaciousness.“Mac” creates a host of possibilities for enterprising headline writers. Let Mr. McCain carve up an opponent, and he can be “Mac the Knife.” Or he may launch a “Big Mac Attack.”When he won the Florida primary last week, Newsday teamed his triumph with the crushing defeat of Rudolph W. Giuliani. “McCain,” read the headline alongside a picture of the senator. Below it was a photo of a grim Mr. Giuliani with this text: “& Unable.”That was the day bound to live long in tabloid-speak as “Goodbye Rudy Tuesday.”'"
"'08-02-05,'0','There is much about Grand Central Terminal that puts one in mind of an earlier New York: the Oyster Bar, the racket stringing kiosk, the watch repair counter that sells striped grosgrain watchbands, proximity to the Yale Club and Paul Stuart, and the fact that commuters boarding the Metro-North trains for points in Westchester and Fairfield Counties can buy beer and cocktails from carts at the base of the platforms.What does not come to mind is a presidential aspirant stumping for the primary. But on Monday, as a retrenched primary schedule saw candidates genuflecting to the region’s newfound February relevance, Senator John McCain of Arizona stopped by Vanderbilt Hall (inside the terminal, near the 42nd Street taxi line) for a hastily scheduled campaign appearance.The dozens of supporters gathered for Mr. McCain’s visit was equaled, if not outnumbered, by television cameras (and also joined by a handful of Hillary Rodham Clinton supporters, who hoisted what was by far the largest campaign sign in the room). Scheduled for 3 p.m., the event did not even hit the hint of the evening rush.“Here? Now? This is the quiet time of day,” said Carlos Arenas, a waiter at the Oyster Bar, who was taking his lunch of fried chicken at the counter. (“They only give us fish on Fridays,” he said.)Mr. Arenas said that he did not plan to attend the McCain event, but that he was going to tell his daughter the senator had been there, since she is following the 2008 campaign so avidly. She went to the Meadowlands on Monday to see her favored candidate, Senator Barack Obama, he said.No traffic ground to a halt to accommodate Mr. McCain — not rail, nor road, nor foot — but a significant klatch of what might pass for a regional, moderately conservative establishment stood behind him: former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Gov. George A. Pataki, former Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato of New York and current Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. And more than a few people took notice.Tom McCoy, a Metro-North conductor who works on the Harlem line, wandered by when he saw the crowd. Officials at the railroad gave “no advance warning” of the visit, Mr. McCoy said.'"
"'08-02-05,'0','Overlooking the warnings by Eurex about Mr. Kerviel was only one of a series of missteps by Société Générale that led to his staggering loss.The 144-year-old bank allowed a culture of risk to flourish, creating major flaws in its operations that enabled the rogue trader’s activities to go undetected, according to bank officials, investigators and traders who worked with Mr. Kerviel.Far from being discouraged from placing big bets, Société Générale traders were rewarded for making risky investments with the bank’s money. It was not uncommon for traders to briefly exceed limits imposed on their trading before pulling back, despite controls meant to prohibit this.“I have a suspicion that this was inevitable, given the way things were engineered,” said Yves-Marie Laulan, a former chief economist at Société Générale and a longtime Paris banker. “It’s a necessary warning that these things are so complicated that they are hard to control.”While management depicts the 31-year-old Mr. Kerviel as a lone operator who spiraled out of control, interviews with current and former Société Générale employees suggest that he was also the product of an environment where risk taking was embraced, as long as it made money for the bank.“If this scam had been uncovered in November, when he was still up, he would have been fired but I suspect we would have heard very little about it,” said a French financial official who insisted on anonymity because of his role in the investigation.The damage wrought by Mr. Kerviel comes in the wake of two trends that reshaped Société Générale: the explosive growth of its derivatives business and its use of its own money to make bets on the market, known as proprietary trading.Throughout Société Générale’s sprawling derivatives business, said one current employee who used to work with Mr. Kerviel, traders were encouraged to make proprietary bets, even on desks that specialized in what top executives called “plain vanilla products,” like the team where Mr. Kerviel worked, Delta One.“You must take positions, even if you are not a proprietary trader,” said this employee, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. “During appraisals by bosses, they made it clear you were judged by how well you did your basic job, as well as how much money you made on prop trades.”Mr. Kerviel told French prosecutors as much. Asked if his superiors knew of his activities, he said, “at the beginning, just as at the end of my maneuvers, they didn’t want to intervene,” adding, “They know the machinery.”Kinner Lakhani, an analyst with ABN Amro in London: said, “Unlike some of their peers, Soc Gen was not shy about taking proprietary trading risks. Perhaps such businesses grew faster than risk management could cope.”Within Société Générale’s corporate and investment bank, according to Mr. Lakhani, the percentage of revenue from market-making and proprietary trading rose to about 35 percent by mid-2007 from 29 percent in 2004.The derivatives group started in the 1980s as a small team of highly trained and highly regarded engineers and mathematicians from the best schools. They quickly became known as “les moines-soldats,” the soldier-monks. And as their importance inside the bank grew, their confidence, even arrogance, grew with it.Like the devout and disciplined fighters they were named for — the monks who fought in the Crusades — the soldier-monks of Société Générale prided themselves on rising above the passions that moved the masses.Similarly, Société Générale’s soldier-monks believed that they could manage both the risk inherent in betting on the markets — through complex computer models — and the ardor of their regular traders, through controls.Their hubris was having too much faith in their power to do either.But they were dedicated to making Société Générale a world-class power in derivatives and, like the knights of old, they were fiercely competitive, both on and off the trading floor.“We considered it a mission,” recalled Antoine Paille, who recruited Jean-Pierre Mustier, now the head of Société Générale’s corporate and investment bank. It was Mr. Mustier who ultimately confronted Mr. Kerviel after his fraud was discovered on Jan. 18.While based in the United States in the 1990s, Mr. Mustier and another derivatives executive, Luc François, organized a sailing competition with other banks and steered the Société Générale boat to victory. Mr. François eventually rose to head the derivatives business but reportedly left last month after the revelation of Mr. Kerviel’s trades.Mr. Kerviel was never viewed as soldier-monk material. He was a provincial from decidedly middle-class stock — the son of a hairdresser and a metal- shop teacher — but he possessed an advantage that his better-bred superiors did not.In his five years toiling in the back office before being promoted to Delta One in 2005, he had become expertly familiar with the proprietary system Société Générale used to book trades, known as Eliot inside the bank. While the risk-control department did monitor the bank’s overall positions very closely, it did not verify the data Mr. Kerviel entered into Eliot. And Mr. Kerviel knew the timing of the nightly reconciliation of the day’s trades by Eliot, so he was able to expertly delete and then re-enter his unauthorized transactions without being caught.Mr. Kerviel’s method of entering trades was one red flag cited by Eurex in its initial warning, along with questions about two “large” positions — one net short position in DAX futures and one net long position in Euro Stoxx 50 futures. In the same letter, they asked what his investment strategy was and why these transactions were often entered through a London-based Société Générale subsidiary called FIMAT Futures Limited. Eurex even inquired whether Mr. Kerviel had entered the transaction automatically or manually.“Please explain the background for this procedure,” two Eurex officials wrote to Xavier de la Maisonneuve, a compliance officer at Société Générale who has been questioned by investigators.Vincent Duclos, another compliance officer in the equity derivatives division, not yet questioned by the police, provided the Nov. 20 and Dec. 10 responses to Eurex. His replies in part were based on accounts provided by Mr. Kerviel and his supervisor, as well as a compliance officer at FIMAT, said Jean Veil, a lawyer for Société Générale. Mr. Kerviel’s “supervisor had signaled that there was no anomaly whatsoever,” Mr. Veil said.Mr. De la Maisonneuve, who received the initial query on Nov. 7, said the bank gets 15 to 20 queries from different exchanges each year, many of them from Eurex.In a telephone interview Monday night, he insisted his team had been in telephone contact with Eurex after their two letters in November to ensure it would fully answer their queries.“Their questions were based purely on strategy and procedure,” he said. “At no moment of these conversations was there any mention of abnormal volumes. They considered our second written response adequate and satisfying.”He added that Eurex did not take up Société Générale’s offer of a conference call to further discuss the matter after the Dec. 10 letter.A top official at Société Générale, who insisted on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said that in the weeks after the Eurex warning, Mr. Kerviel was shaken, and took additional steps to cover his tracks. He tried to manipulate areas of the internal risk-control system he was unfamiliar with, which ultimately led to the discovery of his suspected fraud in mid-January.In his testimony to the police, however, Mr. Kerviel identified two members of the Delta One team he said were familiar with his activities going back to last April. These colleagues, according to lawyers familiar with the case, were Martial Rouyère, head of the Delta One trading desk, and his deputy, Eric Cordelle. Mr. Rouyère has since been questioned by the French authorities. Mr. Veil said he expected Mr. Kerviel’s “entire hierarchy,” including Mr. Mustier, to eventually be questioned by the police.Given that Mr. Kerviel was able to exceed trading limits and evade detection for so long, as well as Société Générale’s handling of Eurex’s November warnings, “we can easily infer that the internal controls were either inadequately designed or have not been operating effectively and efficiently,” said Francis Hounnongandji, a corporate governance expert who is also president of the French chapter of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners.That conclusion is being echoed at the highest levels of the French government. On Monday, Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said, “Very clearly, certain mechanisms of internal controls of Société Générale did not function, and those that functioned were not always followed by appropriate modifications.”In meetings with investors in recent days, Société Générale’s chief executive, Daniel Bouton, has admitted his bank’s internal systems did not keep up with the pace of growth in the derivatives business. “He told them while our derivatives business was going 130 miles an hour, risk control was only going 80,” according to one analyst who covers Société Générale but insisted on anonymity.He added that with traders making so much money, the analyst added, ”they were untouchable; they had the power.”Pascal Decque, an analyst who covers Société Générale in Paris for Natxis, agreed that the bank was more willing to take risks than any of its French rivals, including BNP Paribas, which is rumored to be considering a bid for Société Générale.As an example, he cited Société Générale’s loss of 2 billion euros stemming from subprime-related investments — twice the size of the hit BNP Paribas took, even though BNP is larger.The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Robert Day, an American Société Générale board member, violated insider trading rules by selling shares worth 45 million euros before the bank’s audit committee was informed of the subprime loss.Société Générale and a spokesman for Mr. Day said last week that the share sales by Mr. Day and his family’s trusts occurred in several transactions from December 2007 to Jan. 18, during a predetermined window when directors were allowed to exercise options. Both statements said all required disclosures were made, and “no inside information was used in any way” with respect to these sales.As for Société Générale, the price of its hubris is still to be tallied. Like many observers, Mr. Decque believes it likely that the bank will eventually lose its independence as a result of Mr. Kerviel’s losses, most likely via an acquisition by another French bank.“Soc Gen was brilliant in their achievement, they were the world leader in derivatives,” Mr. Decque said. “Maybe when you are that good, you think you will never fail.”'"

"'08-02-05,'0','“Coal has been removed in many places as an option,” said Art Holland, a vice president of Pace Global Energy Services, a consulting firm in Washington that advises utilities. New nuclear plants are on the drawing board but will take at least a decade. Sun and wind power, though growing, remain a small part of the nation’s electricity mix, and they provide only intermittent power.“We’re having by default to fall back on gas, as though we learned no lesson from the gas-fired boom,” Mr. Holland said.A wave of public opposition to coal-burning plants, motivated partly by broad fears about global warming and partly by local aesthetic concerns, is making their construction more difficult. On Monday, Wall Street weighed in: Three big investment banks announced that in deciding whether to make loans for new coal plants, they would calculate the projects’ financial viability, taking into account potential future charges for carbon dioxide emissions.Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley said they had negotiated this policy with seven major utility companies, most of them major coal burners, and two advocacy groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense. The policy will not automatically block financing for coal-burning plants, but the banks are expected to query utilities closely about the potential costs before agreeing to finance such plants.Power generated with natural gas is already sold at a premium. In Florida, for example, where five coal projects have been derailed in the last year, Barry Moline, the executive director of the Florida Municipal Electric Association, looks at Tallahassee’s municipal utility as an indicator of the future.It is nearly 100 percent gas fired, he said, while Gulf Power, to the west, is 70 percent coal. Tallahassee’s electricity rates are about 40 percent higher than Gulf Power’s.Companies that have canceled coal plants have two immediate options other than building gas plants. They can work to hold down customer demand, though most would have to do so on a far more ambitious scale than before. Or they can wait to see what happens.Experts say electricity shortages are a distinct possibility in coming years.“There’s going to be a lot of white knuckles, frankly, as building does not go forward aggressively on any kind of plant, and demand keeps going up,” said Ernest J. Moniz, a physics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former under secretary of the Department of Energy.Government statistics lag too much to have captured the shift toward gas-fired power plants, but anecdotal evidence abounds. Tampa Electric in Florida, Pacificorp in Wyoming and Utah and Southwestern Power Group in Arizona are among the companies planning or studying gas-fired plants.Coal companies, while acknowledging some high-profile plant cancellations, say they expect continued growth in coal-fired generating capacity, albeit at a more moderate rate. Pace, the consulting firm, recently cut by a third its projection for new coal-fired generating capacity from now to 2025, while doubling its estimate of the amount of gas-fired capacity likely to be built.“Prior to 2007 there was a buildup, and a momentum for people planning to go in the direction of pulverized coal-fired plants, and during ’07 there was definitely a downturn,” said Ronald J. Ott, the director of coal plant construction at Black & Veatch, an engineering and construction company specializing in electricity projects. Amid concern about coal emissions linked to global warming, he said, his company’s clients have tripled the number of natural gas projects under discussion.Barry K. Worthington, executive director of the United States Energy Association, a trade group in Washington, said that some coal plants may have been canceled because of fear of carbon dioxide emissions or fear of future carbon taxes, but another factor was a rapid rise in construction costs for power plants.“The cost of everything has just skyrocketed,” he said. Natural gas plants have less steel and concrete than coal plants and require less labor to build.Florida Power and Light is a good example of the shift. The company has 4.5 million customers; it is adding about 85,000 a year, and demand from existing customers is rising. Last June, the Florida Public Service Commission killed the company’s plan for a big coal-fired plant near Everglades National Park that would have come into service in 2013 or 2014.The utility began looking immediately at two sites for solar power and at other renewable options, but could come up with enough of those to replace only a fraction of the power it would have generated at the coal plant. So the company decided to accelerate construction on a long-planned addition to an existing gas plant.Gas may appear to make sense for individual utilities, said Revis James, the director of the Energy Technology Assessment Center at the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility consortium. The problem will come if many utilities pile into gas-fired electricity generation at once, he said, driving up demand, and prices.Environmental groups argue that utilities should focus on cutting demand for power, rather than build new capacity.Meanwhile, some utilities have decided to wait for a clear global-warming policy to emerge from Washington.'"
"'08-02-05,'0','The shedding of Nike Bauer, with annual sales around $160 million, is not expected to affect Nike’s financial reports significantly. The company posted revenue of $16.3 billion last year; it does not break out profit by unit.But Nike’s decision to step away from hockey at the same time it is increasing its presence in soccer shows that financial muscle and marketing power do not always give it the ability to dominate the field, or the ice.“Nike has been a good competitor,” said Denis Drolet, president of Groupe Drolet, which owns Sher-Wood, a hockey-stick maker in Sherbrooke, Quebec. “Bauer is a great name, they have a great line of skates. But the hockey market is not growing.”Mr. Drolet’s pessimism about the potential for his industry is widely shared. But that was not the case when Nike entered the hockey business. Hockey participation in the United States, the world’s second-largest market, after Canada, was then rising. An expansion by the National Hockey League into several American cities had fueled expectations.Perhaps most attractive to Nike was the popularity of in-line skating in the mid-1990s. The company hoped that by promoting hockey played on rollerblades rather than skates, it could overcome a significant obstacle to the sport’s development in the United States: a lack of ice rinks.After buying Canstar, Nike followed a pattern that had brought it success in other sports. It sponsored prominent players and became the official jersey supplier to the N.H.L. It closed Bauer factories in Ontario and moved their production to Asia, while the unit’s head office left Canada for New Hampshire.While the Bauer name was retained, Nike used its own for the unit’s premium products. In a sport where skates come in pretty much any color provided they were predominantly black, Nike introduced models with white boots and bold graphics.The vivid styling that had worked for Nike in basketball did not score on the ice. Players, other than those sponsored by Nike, shunned the white boots, a color associated with women’s figure skates. And unlike sneakers, Mr. Lemos of Morningstar said, boldly styled hockey skates were never purchased by the fashion-conscious as casual footwear.Critics also say that Nike’s attention to product design did not extend to the performance of the skates, which were priced at a premium of several hundred dollars, and were unusually sized for North American feet.“Their high-end skate was cutting people’s heels and causing blisters,” said Mr. Bovair, a former professional player. “It was a bad, bad launch.”Even Nike competitors acknowledge that the company eventually sorted out the performance issues, and toned down its styling. “They brought in new materials and new processes for manufacturing,” said John Pagotto, president of TPS Hockey, a Canadian maker of sticks and protective gear.But it came too late to save Nike as a stand-alone hockey brand, forcing the compromise that resulted in a logo with Nike’s swoosh but Bauer’s name.Not all American newcomers to hockey have been humbled in such ways. Easton, a maker of aluminum baseball bats, came to dominate the hockey stick market by introducing models made from carbon fiber-reinforced plastic rather than wood.With their emphasis on exotic materials, Nike Bauer and Easton succeeded in raising prices for hockey equipment. While $400 had once seemed the limit for skates, Nike Bauer managed to find a market for $750 pairs by using lightweight, high-performance material.Spokesmen for Nike declined to make anyone available to speak about the company’s decision to sell the hockey unit, which it calls profitable. In a quarterly conference call with analysts in September, Nike’s chief executive, Mark Parker, said, “We felt that there’s other entities within the portfolio that need yet more focus and can deliver more longer-term growth potential.”Indeed, some analysts look toward a decline in equipment sales. Player registrations for USA Hockey, the governing body, rose last season by 3.3 percent over the previous period. But the increase was largely caused by previously unregistered adult players who joined for insurance reasons. Youth memberships, the indicator of the sport’s future, fell 0.5 percent.Mr. Drolet, the stick maker, traces the lack of growth largely to the premium prices Nike and others achieved. “The price of equipment keeps going up, making it hard for families,” he said.Yet most analysts expect Nike to find a buyer, if at a fire sale price, before its self-imposed deadline of the end of May. Reebok, which is owned by the rival Adidas, has been mentioned. But such a deal might raise antitrust issues because its Reebok-CCM Hockey unit is a major force in the market. A spokeswoman for Reebok declined to comment.'"
"'08-02-05,'0','A former Credit Suisse banker accused of leaking confidential information about several major deals, including the $45 billion buyout of TXU, as part of a $7.5 million insider trading scheme was convicted Monday in Federal District Court in Manhattan.After three days of deliberation, the jury found the former banker, Hafiz Muhammad Zubair Naseem, 37, guilty of one count of conspiracy and 28 counts of insider trading for relaying insider information to Ajaz Rahim, a high-level banker in Pakistan and once Mr. Naseem’s boss.From the beginning, the case against Mr. Naseem was notable for its scope and the way it coincided with a two-year boom in mergers. In the last two years, prosecutors have filed insider trading cases, some involving broad schemes, involving bankers at nearly all the top securities firms.But none roped in financiers as high-ranking as Mr. Rahim, the former head of investment banking at Faysal Bank in Karachi and one of the most successful traders in Pakistan. And few involved deals as big as the acquisition of TXU, the Texas power giant that was bought by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and TPG Capital.“We respectfully disagree with the jury’s verdict,” a lawyer for Mr. Naseem, Michael F. Bachner, said Monday, adding that Mr. Naseem would file an appeal.Mr. Naseem came to the United States in 2002 to earn a business degree at New York University. He worked briefly at JPMorgan Chase before moving to Credit Suisse’s energy group in March 2006.'"
"'08-02-05,'0','Barry Morse, famous for his portrayal of the cold-hearted detective who relentlessly pursues the wrongly convicted Richard Kimble for four seasons in “The Fugitive,” one of the biggest TV hits of the 1960s, died Saturday in London. He was 89.His death was confirmed by Robert E. Wood, a friend and a co-author of Mr. Morse’s autobiography, “Remember With Advantages: Chasing ‘The Fugitive’ and Other Stories From an Actor’s Life,” (McFarland & Company, 2007).The slim, angular-faced Mr. Morse was trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London and played hundreds of roles on stage and screen in his seven-decade career but never quite escaped his role in “The Fugitive.” As Lt. Philip Gerard, he hounded David Janssen as Richard Kimble, the doctor from the fictional town of Stafford, Ind., who was convicted on flimsy evidence of murdering his wife. For 120 episodes, from 1963 through 1967, Lieutenant Gerard pursued Dr. Kimble, who had escaped — on the lieutenant’s watch — when the train taking him to death row derailed. The innocent doctor’s only hope was finding the real killer, a one-armed man.Gerard actually appeared in only 37 of the episodes, but his image was used in the opening credits, and the threat of his sudden appearance was never far from the mind of the fugitive or the audience.For years after the series ended, Mr. Morse joked that “he was the most hated man in America,” Mr. Wood said of his friend on Monday. “Little old ladies would come up to him in airports and whack at him with their purses, screaming, ‘Why didn’t you leave that man alone?’ ”'"
"'08-02-05,'0','The New Jersey attorney general’s office issued subpoenas Monday to two companies involved in the development of the Prodisc, an artificial spinal disk for the lower back.The Prodisc was the subject of an article in The New York Times last week about surgeons who had conducted the clinical research leading to the device’s approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 2006. Doctors at about half of the 17 research centers involved stood to profit if the Prodisc succeeded, according to confidential information from a patient’s lawsuit settled last year.While the companies have said the researchers’ financial interests had no impact on the findings, it is unclear whether the disk’s maker had fulfilled the legal obligation to inform the F.D.A. of the researchers’ stakes.New Jersey Attorney General Anne Milgram said her office had issued a subpoena to Synthes Spine, a unit of the Swiss device manufacturer that now owns the Prodisc, and to the Viscogliosi Brothers, the New York investment firm that helped found the original maker of Prodisc in the United States. The firm operated several funds in which the clinical researchers were investors.Calls to Synthes, the Swiss parent company, and to Synthes Spine were not returned. In a statement, the Viscogliosi firm said, “Viscogliosi Brothers are proud of the fact that so many distinguished surgeons have invested in our funds,” adding that “we at all times met all of our disclosure obligations.”The state is looking into whether all disclosures were made regarding surgeons, including some licensed in New Jersey.'"
"'08-02-05,'0','Preschoolers who witnessed the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center or saw its victims were at high risk of developing lingering emotional and behavior problems if — but only if — they had had a previous frightening experience, like seeing a parent fall ill, researchers are reporting Tuesday.The study, the first of its kind among such young children in the wake of the attacks, found that more than 40 percent who had such sequential traumas suffered from depression, emotional outbursts, poor sleep or some combination three years later.By contrast, children who saw the attack or its victims but had no earlier trauma showed few if any psychologically scars.The study, appearing in The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, suggests that very young children respond to trauma in the same ways that adults do. If they are nursing a previous emotional wound, the impact of some new scare or crisis is multiplied.The findings “make a lot of sense, given what we know about how the brain becomes sensitized to a traumatic event, and how there can be a cumulative effect,” said Dr. Bruce McEwen, director of the neuroendocrinology laboratory at Rockefeller University, who was not involved in the research.In the study, researchers from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Jewish Board of Family and Children’s Services in New York surveyed the parents of 116 children who were 1 to 5 years old on Sept. 11, 2001, and lived or went to school near the World Trade Center. Some were in school very close to the site and saw people jumping from the buildings, or a tower fall.'"
"'08-02-05,'0','Any optimism about the proposed budget is tempered by experience. In the past two years, Mr. Bush also proposed significant increases for the physical sciences budget, but the increases largely vanished by the time Congress finished the final spending bills.“It was glorious for ’07 and it was glorious in ’08, and in neither case was it realized,” said Persis Drell, director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, which is laying off about 120 workers, including some scientists, from its staff of 1,600 in the next couple of weeks, because of this year’s budget cuts.For the same reason, Fermilab is moving ahead with plans announced in December to lay off about 10 percent of its staff of 1,940.“If I just looked at the president’s budget, one could imagine doing a number less than that,” said Piermaria Oddone, director of the lab.Dr. Oddone said he had to plan for more dire possibilities, because of the uncertainties.The 2007 budget fell apart entirely after Democrats won control of both houses of Congress in the November 2006 elections. Instead of trying to complete an already delayed budget, Congress decided to finance the federal government via “continuing resolutions,” which largely maintained financing at 2006 levels.Last year, Mr. Bush again sought sizable increases for physical sciences research as part of his 2008 spending plan, in line with a promise to double financing by 2016. The increases for physical sciences research were offset by cuts elsewhere, including a cut for the National Institutes of Health.Members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, seemed to agree with the physical sciences increase but added back money to N.I.H., as well as programs looking at near-term energy technologies and climate change.Those additions were part of the Senate and House versions of the budget that were billions of dollars higher than the president’s.With Congress and the president seeming to be in agreement on the science increases, national laboratories like Fermilab planned their spending accordingly. And when the 2008 fiscal year began Oct. 1 last year, they began spending, even though the final federal budget had not been passed and signed.In last-minute negotiating in December, Mr. Bush promised to veto a bill that did not rein in spending to his original spending target, and Congress relented. In science research, physical sciences bore much of the cut.Fermilab, which had expected its budget to increase to $372 million from $342 million, instead absorbed a cut, to $320 million. Congress reduced the United States’ contribution to Iter, the international fusion project, from $160 million to zero.This year, the president’s proposal provides no increase at all for the National Institutes of Health. That may set up a replay of last year, with the large percentage increases for physical sciences offering an inviting target for budget cutters.“It’s the same scenario going forward for the third year in a row,” said Kei Koizumi, director of the R&D Budget and Policy Program at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “With not enough money, there really is no way to make everyone happy.”Further complicating the process is the presidential election. There is widespread speculation that the Democratic-controlled Congress will delay passage of the budget bills in hopes that the next president will be a Democrat and more amenable to its priorities.If that happens, the government would again run on continuing resolutions, continuing financing of operations at the current 2008 levels, and not the hoped-for higher levels of 2009.“Every expert I talk to says, ‘Get ready for the continuing resolution,’ ” Dr. Oddone of Fermilab said.Dr. Orbach said although the president’s budget could put his programs back on track, a repeat of the past couple of years could be a turning point to a downward trend in those fields. International collaborators might turn to similar experiments in other countries. Graduate students might decide to switch careers.Dr. Orbach said that the decisions of Congress reflected the views of the public and that physicists needed to be more active in advocating for their research.A decision this year to roll back the increases again “will lead to a flat investment scenario for the indefinite future,” Dr. Orbach said. “To me, that’s falling off a cliff. If that is the will of the people, we are in real trouble.”'"
"'08-02-05,'0','Via Dance Collaborative expresses a sweetly optimistic belief in group exploration. This four-year-old troupe develops “new work in a collegial, mutually supportive atmosphere,” according to the program notes for its current show at Dance New Amsterdam.So it is perhaps against Via’s core belief, and thus moot, to offer the following advice: Find someone really, really old and really, really crotchety (no cracks about critics, please) and give that person free rein to inject nasty, bothersome comments into that atmosphere. The troupe’s fine dancers have nice chemistry and plenty of varied ideas. But they need someone — crotchety outsider or no — to be absolutely ruthless with those ideas if they are to unearth the actual art within all the material they produce.Take Janice Lancaster’s “Weren’t you always distracted by expectation, as if every event announced a beloved.” It races around from thought to thought, much like a game of tag, one of the many symbols used in depicting romantic relationships.The strongest moments are diminished: for example, when a dancer thrusts her hands into tall drinking glasses, making herself into a frustrated creature both fragile and dangerous (a lover, in other words). She might shatter at any minute; when her male partner leads her offstage in torturous manner, having her step from one overturned tumbler to another as he rotates three of them on the floor, it is one of the few passages that seem to have been created by someone who has been in love and thought about what that means and how movement might express it. Then the boisterous work rushes off to tag the next idea, and this meaning is never allowed to bloom.Dawn Poirier’s “Sometimes in, Sometimes out” is less rambling, but it does not push beyond an initial idea of a loner who is set against group patterns. The final piece, Katie Swords’s “When it gets dark enough, you can see the stars ...,” set to Zoe Keating’s swelling, evocative score, is the surest. No wheels are re-invented. But this portrait of yearning women, twirling about in Renee Kurz’s swirling white dresses under Carrie Wood’s elegiac lighting, has a quiet intensity and purpose. It’s a start.'"
"'08-02-05,'0','It will also pay up to $362 million more if certain milestones are achieved in development, plus royalties on sales of the drugs in Japan. Takeda is also buying Amgen’s Japanese subsidiary, Amgen KK.For Takeda, known most for its diabetes drug Actos, the deal moves it further into biologics — protein-based drugs made in living organisms. The company, based in Osaka, Japan, has concentrated mainly on pills made from chemicals.Mr. Sharer said the deal validated the value of Amgen’s pipeline. But some analysts said that pulling back from its Japanese operations could eventually diminish the company’s prospects.“They are basically capitulating on having any real stake in the Japanese market,” said Geoffrey C. Porges, biotechnology analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “It’s definitely a retrenchment, as well as all the retrenchments they’ve gone through.”Japan, with its unique regulatory requirements and marketing issues, has been a tough market for some drug companies to penetrate on their own. Amgen’s existing drugs are all sold in Japan by partners.Over all, the market reaction was subdued, with Amgen’s shares falling 18 cents Monday to close at $47.18.“The money that they are taking in from Takeda aren’t significant enough to move the dial, either on their revenues on in terms of their cost line,” said Eric Schmidt, an analyst who follows Amgen for Cowen & Company.There are many issues of more importance to Amgen investors, particularly a meeting of the Food and Drug Administration in March to discuss the safety of the company’s anemia drugs, which once accounted for nearly half of its corporate revenue.Sales of the drugs have been falling on those safety concerns, prompting the company to cut its work force by more than 12 percent last year. It was during their announcement of that revamping last summer that Amgen’s executives first said publicly that they would sell rights to some of the drugs under development.The drugs included in the deal are mainly in early or middle-stage clinical trials, except for Vectibix, a colon cancer drug that Amgen sells in the United States.In addition to the Japan-only rights to the 13 drugs, Takeda is buying a share of the worldwide rights to an Amgen cancer drug under development, motesanib diphosphate, also called AMG 706. It will pay $100 million upfront and up to $175 million more. Prospects for AMG 706 had seemed to dim, in part because many similar drugs were either on the market or under development by other companies.Takeda is not getting Japanese rights to what is widely considered Amgen’s best experimental product: the osteoporosis drug denosumab. Those rights were sold last summer to Takeda’s rival, Daiichi Sankyo.'"
"'08-02-05,'0','Aspirin may help reduce the risk of colon cancer, a new study suggests, when taken in large doses over long periods of time.Researchers studied more than 47,000 men for 18 years. After adjusting for age, smoking, diet, physical activity and other risk factors, they found that men who took more than two standard 325 mg aspirins a week reduced their risk for colon cancer by about 21 percent compared with those who took less. Men who took 6 to 14 a week reduced their risk by 28 percent, and those who took more than 14 pills a week had a 70 percent decreased risk.The longer the men took aspirin, the more they reduced risk, but taking it for less than five years, or taking the equivalent of less than one and a half pills a week, conferred no advantage. Other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen (Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) gave similar protections, but not acetaminophen (Tylenol).“The results provide additional proof that a simple drug like aspirin can help prevent colon cancer,” said Dr. Andrew T. Chan, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard. Still, he said, “I wouldn’t recommend it to all patients, because of the side effects,” which can range from upset stomach to gastrointestinal bleeding.The study, in the January issue of Gastroenterology, was not randomized, but a link between aspirin use and a drop in cancer recurrence had been established in other randomized trials.'"
"'08-02-05,'0','BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — Sid Ganis, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and chief defender of its strike-threatened Oscar show, took the gloves off on Monday. Well, one glove anyway.At the annual nominees’ luncheon at the Beverly Hilton hotel on Monday, the usually congenial Mr. Ganis gave the assembled actors and filmmakers something of a lecture. But it was a sweetly diplomatic one — about the importance of keeping Oscar night on track, even if striking screenwriters picket the ceremony.While noting hopeful signs in talks between writers and production companies, Mr. Ganis said, “Regardless of those circumstances, which are beyond our control, we will be presenting the awards as scheduled.”A film producer and former studio chief who generally favors the soft pedal, Mr. Ganis stopped short of telling the nominees that they really ought to show up for the ceremony, which is scheduled to be broadcast by ABC on Feb. 24.But, he reminded the gathered film stars, who included George Clooney, Ellen Page and Viggo Mortensen, the Academy Awards are not just about business but also about recognizing cinematic achievement.“It would be such a terrible shame if, through no fault of yours and no fault of ours, the current conditions prevented us from shining that brightest possible light” on the very people who were gathered at the luncheon to bask in what he called their “nominee-ness.”'"
"'08-02-05,'0','Two other things struck me as remarkable about the plan by British Airways, which already flies eight times a day between Kennedy and London Heathrow and three times a day between Newark and Heathrow.One is the location: London City Airport. London City, which does not now have trans-Atlantic service, is six miles from the financial district and three miles from Canary Wharf, both home to rapidly growing international businesses.Two is the audacity of the initial pricing. In recent years, three start-up all-business-class carriers — Eos and Silverjet (along with MaxJet, which is now defunct) — began offering New York-to-London business-class fares that were considerably lower than the major carriers. According to Mr. Harford, the new British Airways business-class service will charge the same as its existing business-class service, known as Club World, between New York and Heathrow.“You can assume it’s going to be within the absolutely same neighborhood,” he said.On the other hand, as several competitors pointed out, little London City Airport has strict take-off weight limits. So the westbound flights of the new service will need to make what a British Airways spokesman conceded will be a “quick 40-minute gas-and-go stop” for a full load of fuel at an airport in western Britain or Ireland before proceeding across the Atlantic.Back to the fares. If you plan to fly between New York and London on short notice, the business-class walk-up fares are bracing. On British Airways, if you booked Monday to fly to Heathrow on Wednesday and return Saturday, you would pay $10,658.37. On American Airlines, the fare for the same dates is $8,611.40 — in the same ballpark as the fare charged by Eos. American flies six times a day between New York and Heathrow, but started a new route with competitive fares to Stansted last year in response to Eos and MaxJet.On Silverjet, which flies between Newark and the farther-out London Luton Airport, the fare is $3,260.Some high-volume companies negotiate discounts of 40 percent or more. For others, buying a ticket well in advance brings the fare down considerably.British Airways, which is counting on its brand recognition as it takes on smaller rivals, also plans to start a separate small all-business-class airline called OpenSkies in the spring, flying between New York and cities in Europe other than London. Last week, British Airways reported a 28.5 percent jump in operating profit for the last nine months, “mainly due to more premium passengers traveling.”The intensifying free-for-all in business-class cabins over the Atlantic is likely to rattle the foundations of the existing fares this year as competition grows, Mr. Harford said.The kind of intense yield-management that slices and dices coach cabins into a wide range of fares, depending on projected demand, will come to the business-class cabins across the Atlantic, he predicted. “As you get more competition and more options, as more advance-purchase opportunities creep in, a lot of the complexities of the fares in the economy cabins is creeping into the business cabin,” he said. “I think what you’ll see over the next few months is a lot more pricing options available.”'"
"'08-02-05,'0','Mr. Obama, who appeared to be building momentum in recent days, held wide leads in states like Minnesota, and ran close behind her in states like New Jersey. That left him poised to pick up a hefty number of delegates, even in some states that Mrs. Clinton won.“There is one thing on this February night that we do not need the final results to know: our time has come,” Mr. Obama said to cheers at a party in Chicago. “Our time has come, our movement is real, and change is coming to America.”Because most states gave nominating delegates to both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama based on vote proportions, as opposed to being winner-take-all contests, the two campaigns were predicting on Tuesday that neither candidate would have a blowout lead, setting up an intensifying race as Louisiana, Washington, Virginia, Ohio and Texas hold nominating contests over the next four weeks.On the Republican side, Senator John McCain of Arizona racked up primary victories on Tuesday night in the delegate-rich states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut as well as his home state, but he appeared to be locked in a tight battle with Mitt Romney for the biggest prize of all: California.For the Democrats, Mr. Obama was the winner of the Utah primary, as well as being the victor in caucuses in Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota and North Dakota.Mrs. Clinton, addressing supporters in a New York ballroom, looked and sounded ebullient about her early string of victories. “After seven years of a president who listens only to the special interests,” she said, “you showed you are ready for a president who will bring your voice, your values and your dreams to your White House.”Mrs. Clinton congratulated Mr. Obama on the states he won and said, “I look forward to continuing our campaign and our debate about how to leave this country better off for the next generation, because that is the work of my life.”He congratulated Mrs. Clinton on her victories on Tuesday night. “She has run an outstanding race,” he said. But he added that the contest presents a clear contrast between the change he represents and what he called “more of the same.”A total of 1,678 pledged delegates were at stake in the 22 state Democratic nominating contests on Tuesday, with 2,025 total delegates needed to win the nomination.In New Jersey, Mrs. Clinton carried six of 10 white votes, while Mr. Obama was favored by 9 in 10 blacks, according to exit polls. Voters who said they wanted a candidate who can bring about change voted by 2-to-1 with Mr. Obama, while 9 of 10 of those seeking experience cast their ballots for Mrs. Clinton.Nationally, Mrs. Clinton held an edge among women, whites and older voters, as she had in earlier contests, according to early results from exit polls in 16 states. Mr. Obama won large majorities of black voters but Mrs. Clinton was the choice of about 6 in 10 Hispanics.As polls closed in the East and Midwest, Clinton advisers were initially worried about New Jersey, where Mrs. Clinton had endorsements from Gov. Jon Corzine and Senator Robert Menendez, and recognition for her work after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in neighboring New York.Mr. Obama convincingly won Georgia, with exit polls indicating that his support transcended racial lines by an even greater margin than in South Carolina, his earlier Southern primary victory.More than half of Democratic voters in Georgia were black, and they strongly supported Mr. Obama, according to exit polls conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool of television networks and The Associated Press. Mr. Obama also received more than 4 in 10 votes from white Democrats, winning about half of white men and 40 percent of white women.Mr. Obama also carried his home state of Illinois (though he was born in Honolulu and Mrs. Clinton in Chicago). He won 70 percent of men overall and two-thirds of both women overall and white men. His weakest showing was among older voters, with only half of them supporting him. He was strongly supported across income and education backgrounds.Among Democrats voting on Tuesday, a majority said that they were most concerned about the economy, outpacing those worried about the Iraq war or health care. Nine out of 10 Democratic voters said the economy was in bad shape.A majority of Democrats in most states said they believed that Mrs. Clinton was best suited to be commander in chief, while Mr. Obama had a similar edge among Democrats regarding who was more likely to unite the country.Mr. Obama was receiving at least half of the votes from white men in Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia and Illinois, and he received 4 in 10 in Missouri, New York and New Jersey.He also won a majority of voters under 30 in most of the states. Similarly, Mrs. Clinton received most of the votes from people over 65.Mrs. Clinton also won important victories in Tennessee and Oklahoma, two states that are rarely carried by Democrats in a general election.For months now the Obama and Clinton campaigns have viewed Tuesday as a decisive moment in the presidential race. When Mrs. Clinton lost the first nominating contest, in Iowa, she and her advisers noted that the 45 delegates at stake there were a mere fraction of the delegates at stake in the state contests on Tuesday.Mr. Obama and his aides made similar remarks after his losses in New Hampshire and Nevada, and both he and Mrs. Clinton increasingly spoke of the nomination fight as a two-way battle for delegates, pure and simple.Mrs. Clinton underscored this viewpoint by campaigning in California and Arizona, two states that voted Tuesday, in the week before the South Carolina primary — signaling, in effect, that her strategy was much more focused on winning contests on Tuesday than on South Carolina, which Mr. Obama ended up winning in a rout.Over the last week, however, public and private opinion polls have showed tightening races in states where Mrs. Clinton had held substantial leads, including Massachusetts and New Jersey (where a combined total of 200 delegates were at stake) and California, with 370 delegates. As a result, both the Clinton and Obama camps began setting and resetting expectations for their state-by-state performance on Tuesday. Both campaigns said they did not expect either candidate to have appreciably more delegates than the other after Tuesday, given that most of the states allocate some delegates to the second-place finisher.In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday afternoon, Clinton advisers suggested that Mr. Obama would be on the ropes if he did not win Massachusetts and even California, where he had been gaining momentum.“Judging by the Zogby poll, if Senator Obama doesn’t win by 13 points in California, it will have to be considered a disappointing evening,” said Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton’s communications director.Obama advisers said those assertions were ludicrous. In California, they noted, Mrs. Clinton had endorsements from the state’s senior senator, Dianne Feinstein; the mayors of Los Angeles and San Francisco; and several state legislators and local officials.And according to a set of talking points circulated by the Obama campaign to advisers, they said they expected Mrs. Clinton to win more delegates and more states on Tuesday, though they expected the race to be close.Some Clinton advisers expressed relief in recent days that Tuesday’s votes were not further out on the calendar. Given Mr. Obama’s recent momentum, if he had another week to campaign, Clinton advisers said they feared his performance Tuesday might have been even stronger.As it is, the Clinton campaign is now seeking ways to slow that momentum. Her chief strategist, Mark Penn, said Mrs. Clinton wanted to face off against Mr. Obama in one debate a week until the Ohio and Texas nominating contests on March 4. Mr. Penn said she had already accepted three invitations to debate in Ohio and Texas and on ABC television, and would like to have a debate in Washington State, which votes on Saturday.“We’re still working out our schedule and debates will obviously be a part of that,” said Bill Burton, an Obama spokesman. “But this comes off more as a second-tier Congressional race tactic than anything else.”'"
"'08-02-05,'0','Mr. McCain has rarely detoured from his stump speech in these final days before Tuesday’s primaries and caucuses — he calls for making the Bush tax cuts permanent and says radical Islamic terrorism is the “transcendental challenge” of the 21st century — but he has begun to hurl some barbs at the Democratic presidential candidates, Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who have criticized him as wanting to keep American forces in Iraq for 100 years.In Boston, in a preview of what would be a centerpiece of his campaign should he win the nomination, Mr. McCain said their criticism “shows a fundamental lack of experience and judgment about national security issues” and pointed out that the United States had kept bases for decades in countries all over the world. “They don’t understand warfare,” he said.In the last 24 hours, Mr. McCain and his aides have begun to fret about recent California polls showing a tighter race with Mitt Romney than they had expected. “I think it’s a lot closer,” Mr. McCain told reporters on his bus.Mr. McCain is responding by flying to California from New York on Tuesday for an afternoon rally in San Diego before heading home to Phoenix to vote and wait for returns. The tightening race in California may also explain why Mr. McCain renewed a swipe against Mr. Romney on Monday in New Jersey, when he said at a mobbed rally at the Colonial Fire House in Hamilton that Mr. Romney favored “timetables for withdrawing from Iraq.”Mr. Romney has denounced the claim, widely labeled as misleading by news organizations, as “reminiscent of the Nixon era.”At other times in recent days, Mr. McCain and his aides have acknowledged that much of his campaign’s turnaround was the result of factors beyond his control, most notably the success so far of the troop escalation in Iraq. Mr. McCain’s support for it in the face of enormous skepticism last summer was a major reason his campaign imploded.And if the escalation had failed? “I might be here, but I think there’d be plenty of room back here,” Mr. McCain said Monday, gesturing to a dozen reporters squeezed with him and Rudolph W. Giuliani on the U-shaped sofa at the back of the bus. “Schmidt and I would be playing a game of cards,” he added, referring to Steve Schmidt, one of his campaign advisers, who was trolling through news of California polls on a BlackBerry.Mr. McCain draws energy and adrenaline from the crowds, and he has been traveling in the last day or so with his remarkably spry 95-year-old mother, who was on stage in Boston to show the crowd, he said, that her 71-year-old son was not too old to run for president. But Mr. McCain sometimes looks pale and drawn by the end of the day, as he did on Monday at Grand Central, when he was endorsed by a tanned and rested looking George E. Pataki, the former governor of New York.Mr. McCain got a break of sorts on Sunday night when he watched the Super Bowl, although he chose as his viewing spot not the peace of his hotel suite but the noisy lobby bar of the Hyatt Regency in Boston. As reporters, hotel staff members and bar patrons looked on, Mr. McCain shared a sofa with Senators Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, with former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas sitting nearby. All three traveled with him on Monday.“Just watching with the guys,” Mr. McCain said. The plan had been for him to stay through one quarter and then go to his room, but Mr. McCain was still there as the fourth quarter was getting under way. Finally his wife, Cindy, came down to get him.'"
"'08-02-05,'0','Lawmakers are responding to the takeover attempt. Representative John Conyers, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he would hold hearings to examine any proposed deal.And Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, who leads an important antitrust subcommittee, said he was interested in the proposed acquisition. “Should Yahoo accept Microsoft’s offer,” he said, “the subcommittee expects to hold hearings to explore the competitive and privacy implications of the deal.”Google and Microsoft have the ability to wage a major political fight, the kind appreciated in Washington for the money it generates in lobbyist fees and political donations for lawmakers. Both companies began their Washington operations as one-man bands but now have large presences.Microsoft enlarged its Washington staff in the late 1990s after it came under antitrust assault in the Clinton administration. Its lobbying shop is considered among the most effective in the capital, and it has retained more than 20 law firms, lobbying companies and press relations operations for an array of political and regulatory issues.Google’s Washington office is less than three years old and has been steadily growing. In fall 2006, it established a political action committee and has since used Democrats from the Podesta Group lobbyists, two former Republican senators — Connie Mack and Dan Coats at the law firm of King & Spalding, and the law firm of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.Google recently moved to larger quarters, with 27,000 square feet of space including a game room, open work areas, free lunches and environmentally friendly features like recycled rainwater — a smaller version of its Silicon Valley headquarters.While Microsoft and Google have been occasional allies in Washington — they have worked together on intellectual property legislation and issues of open access — they clashed last year on legal and regulatory fronts.In addition to the fight over DoubleClick, Google lodged a complaint in antitrust proceedings against plans for Vista, Microsoft’s new operating system. Google said these were anticompetitive because they unfairly discouraged the use of Google’s desktop search program. By lobbying in state capitals, Google persuaded prosecutors to intervene on its behalf. Ultimately, Microsoft agreed to modify the operating system to make it easier for users to decide which search application they wanted.As they are gearing up now, a legal fight, if at all, is months away. Federal regulators will not begin to consider any deal until it is completed and formally presented. It is not certain whether the deal would be considered by the Justice Department, which has overseen previous antitrust proceedings against Microsoft, or the Federal Trade Commission, which reviewed and approved Google’s purchase of DoubleClick. (That transaction has not closed as European regulators continue to review it.)Moreover, the size and complexity of a Microsoft-Yahoo deal is such that a government review is unlikely to be completed quickly, particularly in an election year, and may not be final before a new administration takes office in 2009.Should Yahoo finally agree to be acquired by Microsoft, a focus of the political and legal debate will be the products and markets that could be affected. Microsoft has said the acquisition would increase competition in two related and large markets: Internet search and online advertising. Many ad industry executives, who have watched Google’s rise with some trepidation, agree.But Google wants the focus of any antitrust debate to shift to issues other than search and advertising. In a statement posted on his company’s blog Sunday, David Drummond, Google’s general counsel, noted that a combined Microsoft and Yahoo would have an “overwhelming share” of the instant messaging and Web e-mail markets, and that the two companies run some of the most trafficked portals on the Web.“Could a combination of the two take advantage of a PC software monopoly to unfairly limit the ability of consumers to freely access competitors’ e-mail, I.M., and Web-based services?” Mr. Drummond asked.It is not hard to see why Google wants to shift the focus. In the search market, a combined Microsoft-Yahoo would have about 33 percent of the market, still trailing Google’s 58 percent, according to comScore.But in Web-based e-mail, comScore ranks Yahoo, with 256 million visitors worldwide in December, and Microsoft, with 255 million, as the top two providers. While there is bound to be overlap among users of the companies’ e-mail services, a combined Microsoft-Yahoo would command a much larger share than Google, which comScore ranks in third place with 90 million visitors in December.Yahoo and Microsoft also rank No. 1 and 2 in financial news, and No. 2 and No. 1 in instant messaging, according to comScore.'"

"'08-02-06,'0','Mr. McCain, speaking at a televised news conference Wednesday morning in Phoenix, said he would cancel a scheduled trip to a security conference in Munich, Germany, this weekend and instead campaign in Virginia.“We will be hitting the campaign trail tomorrow morning,” he said. Mr. McCain appealed to Republicans, particularly conservatives, to put aside their differences and remember common principles.“Hopefully, we can wrap this thing up, unite the party, and be ready to take on the Democratic nominee in November,” he said.Though Mr. McCain failed to sweep the contests that followed his big win last week in Florida or to knock his rivals out of contention, his victories in the delegate-heavy Northeast and in Oklahoma were a sweet reward for his resurgent candidacy. Eight years ago, his presidential hopes were dashed when he lost a coast-to-coast swath of nominating contests that were held that year in March, effectively ending his campaign.Tuesday night’s results buoyed Mr. Huckabee, who had been all but written off in recent weeks after his cash-starved candidacy struggled in the wake of his surprise victory in the Iowa caucuses. He defied expectations by winning contests in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee and West Virginia, as well as Georgia, the biggest Southern state to vote on Tuesday, and he came close to defeating Mr. McCain in Missouri, a key winner-take-all state, though Mr. McCain held on to first place there in preliminary counts.“You know, over the past few days a lot of people have been trying to say that this is a two-man race,” he told his supporters in a suburb of Little Rock, Ark. “Well, you know what? It is. And we’re in it!”The huge number of contests — the most nominating contests ever held on a single day — posed enormous challenges for candidates already drained of money after their hard-fought nominating contests in the early states and with too little time to campaign everywhere. In hindsight, some of their choices appeared unwise: Mr. McCain’s decision to campaign in Massachusetts may have been calculated to try to rattle Mr. Romney, but it kept him away from several close-fought states where more campaigning might have helped him.Mr. Romney told his supporters in Boston that the Republican race, which some had predicted could have ended on Tuesday, would continue. “One thing that’s clear is, this campaign’s going on!” he said to cheers.On a day when the stock market experienced its worst day in nearly a year, about 4 in 10 Republican primary voters cited the economy as the most important issue facing the nation in surveys of voters leaving the polls. That made it the top issue everywhere except for two states along the Mexican border, Arizona and California, where it vied with illegal immigration as most important.Voters who said they were most concerned about the economy, the Iraq war or terrorism were more likely to favor Mr. McCain, the surveys found. But those who called immigration the most important issue were more likely to favor Mr. Romney, who has assailed Mr. McCain’s support last spring for a failed immigration bill that many Republicans said amounted to amnesty.The voter surveys showed a stark ideological divide among Republican voters. While Mr. Romney did better among conservatives in almost every state, Mr. McCain did best among moderates. Mr. McCain has campaigned in recent weeks with Republican moderates like Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and independents like Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, and he has been criticized in recent days by conservative talk radio hosts, like Rush Limbaugh, who have proclaimed him not conservative enough.Mr. Romney did best among those who said they were looking for a candidate who shared their values, while Mr. McCain did best among voters who said they wanted a candidate who says what he believes.In Georgia, Tennessee and Missouri, half or more of the Republican primary voters described themselves as evangelical or born-again Christians, and in those states Mr. Huckabee, a former Baptist preacher, got about 4 in 10 of their votes. In a number of states he split conservative and religious voters with Mr. Romney.In his speech, Mr. McCain saluted Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Romney, but gave particularly warm praise to Mr. Huckabee, whose decision to remain in the race was credited by many analysts with splitting the votes of conservatives and religious voters who might otherwise have supported Mr. Romney.“Not for the first time, he’s surprised the rest of us and proved again his exceptional skills as a campaigner, and the extraordinary commitment and determination of the people who believe so passionately in him,” Mr. McCain said of Mr. Huckabee.The voter surveys also showed that Mr. McCain was backed by those who said they were looking for an experienced candidate, and those who want a candidate who can win in November. And voters were more likely to say that Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam who has made the Iraq war his central issue, was most qualified to be commander in chief.The exit polls were conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool of television networks and The A.P.The primaries drew unusually large turnout in many states. But despite long lines, confusion among poll workers and scattered computer malfunctions, there were no reports of widespread problems as voters showed up in record numbers.The day of battles between the Romney and McCain campaigns, which do little to conceal their distaste for each other, got off to a bare-knuckled start in West Virginia. At the Republican convention there, Mr. Romney captured the lead on the first ballot but failed to get a majority. He then lost on the second ballot to Mr. Huckabee when the McCain delegates cast their lot with him.The loss was a setback for Mr. Romney, who had invested time and money in West Virginia, building an organization there, having phone banks make calls, and advertising on the radio and through the mail.The Romney campaign cried foul: its campaign manager, Beth Myers, blasted Mr. McCain and Mr. Huckabee, saying in a statement that “this is what Senator McCain’s inside Washington ways look like: he cut a back-room deal with the tax-and-spend candidate he thought could best stop Gov. Romney’s campaign of conservative change.”Asked about the statement in a hangar in San Diego, Mr. McCain smiled wryly. “You know, with all due respect, I know what it’s like to win, and I know what it’s like to lose,” he said. “I obviously prefer winning. But generally speaking, rather than blaming it on someone else, I suggest that he move on.”'"
"'08-02-06,'0','Trading was thinner than usual, with markets in South Korea, Taiwan, and mainland China already closed for the rest of the week for the Lunar New Year holiday.The Hang Seng index fell as much as 6.15 percent before finishing at 23,469.46, down 1,339.24 points. The China Enterprises index of H-shares, or Hong Kong-listed shares of mainland Chinese companies, plunged 6.93 percent to 13,067.11.The Strait Times index in Singapore slumped 3.5 percent to close at 2,932.34 in half-day trading. The MSCI measure of Asian stocks excluding Japan fell 1 percent.In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 index lost 2.2 percent, hurt by a 5.6 percent decline in BHP Billiton. Rio was up 1.6 percent, but analysts were skeptical the bid would be successful.In London, the FTSE 100 index gained 0.1 percent, and the pan-European DJ Euro Stoxx 50 index was up 1.2 percent. In Frankfurt the DAX was up 1.2 percent, and in Paris, the CAC 40 ticked about 0.8 percent higher.Rate decisions by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England are due on Thursday.Asian exporters are likely to be hit by slumping U.S. consumption reflected in the January declines in the American service sector that was reported Tuesday by the Institute for Supply Management. The index dipped below a boom/bust line of 50 to a record 44.6, compared to a revised reading of 54.4 in December.That pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 370.03 points, or 2.9 percent, to 12,265.13.“The likelihood of a slowdown in U.S. consumption will feed into a deceleration in exports from the countries of North Asia, including Japan and China, of between 20 percent and 25 percent,” said Glenn Maguire, the Asia-Pacific chief economist at Société Générale, based in Hong Kong. “The economies of Southern Asia could see a slowdown in exports of as much as 30 percent to 35 percent.“The key is how long the U.S consumer will be impaired,” Maguire said in Tokyo.Maguire said he expected U.S. consumption to be subdued through the first half of the calendar year.That will affect the Chinese economy, said Yutaka Harada, chief economist at Daiwa Institute of Research in Tokyo. He said China has closely tracked economic events in the United States since the end of 2005, following a period between 2003 and 2005 when the two economies were not so closely tied together.Harada said nearly 50 percent of the Chinese gross domestic product relies on trade and any slow down in demand from U.S. consumers would affect the broader Chinese economy.He estimates that slowing U.S. economic activity could rein in Chinese economic growth by 0.5 percent to 1 percent, but he expects the Chinese economy to grow by about 10 percent this year.Maguire has lowered his Chinese economic growth forecast to 9.4 percent from 11.4 percent.Although international trade makes up an estimated 17 percent to 18 percent of the Japanese economy, the world’s second largest economy is unlikely to escape the effect of tighter U.S. purse strings. Japan provides many of the parts and intermediate goods that are incorporated into products exported to the U.S. consumer from countries like Taiwan, and South Korea.The Japanese economy may grow only 1.1 percent in the year to December 31, Ryutaro Kono, chief economist at BNP Paribas Tokyo said. ‘The Institute for Supply Management’s “number is telling us how bad things really are” in the United States.Kono forecasts that U.S. economic growth could be as low as 1.3 percent this year.'"
"'08-02-06,'0','The Dow Jones industrial average fell 370.03 points, or 2.9 percent, to 12,265.13. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropped 3.2 percent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 3.1 percent. Stock markets in Europe also fell sharply. In London, the FTSE 100 closed down 2.6 percent. In Frankfurt, the DAX was down 3.4 percent, and the CAC 40 index in France was off 4 percent.In the American market, the declines in the major averages were the largest since Feb. 27, 2007, when a brief plunge in the Chinese market alarmed investors worldwide. The Chinese market later recovered, and even after some recent weakness is twice as high as it was then.The S.& P. 500 is now down 8.97 percent since the start of the year. Howard Silverblatt, an S.& P. analyst, said this was the worst performance ever for the index at this point into the year.Confidence among European investors has been undermined by weaker-than-expected European economic data. Economists said the data suggested that economic distress was no longer solely a problem in the United States but was spreading.“The weak European data is starting to become more prevalent,” Mr. Shapiro said. “The concept of America as an island and everyone else being fat and happy is no longer clear.”In the United States survey, businesses complained of rising costs and falling orders. In responding to the survey, 42 percent of businesses said they felt worse about the next 12 months compared with 2007; only 16 percent felt better.For the first time, the institute published a monthly composite index to provide a broader measure of the nonmanufacturing sector, taking in the measures of business activity, new orders, employment and supplier deliveries. This index was 44.6 in January, indicating a contraction.According to the new nonmanufacturing report, only 3 nonmanufacturing industries reported growth in January, while 14 contracted.The index was released earlier than planned on Tuesday, the institute said, because of a possible leak. Analysts said rumors that the figures were going to be poor had circulated earlier and might have been a reason for the early weakness in stocks.In the report, the institute’s chairman, Anthony S. Nieves, said, “The overall indication in January is that nonmanufacturing has come to the end of a long-term period of growth and has contracted for the month of January.”“This clearly makes it more likely that it’s not just a slowdown but a recession in the first half of this year,” he said. “The general picture emerging is that the economy is contracting.”Mr. Gault said that during earlier slowdowns the index declined gradually over several months, but this time the index dropped extraordinarily sharply.The latest survey followed the publication of government figures Friday showing that employers eliminated 17,000 jobs in January. It was the first decline in the work force in more than four years.The big decline provided evidence that the Federal Reserve had reason to sharply reduce short-term interest rates in January, cutting the federal funds rate by 1.25 percentage points, to 3.5 percent, in two moves that served notice the Fed was worried about slow growth.But one aspect of the institute’s report provided a warning of the limits of action available to the Fed. The institute reported that most companies were paying higher prices for the things they buy, indicating that inflation may be getting stronger even as the economy slows.Some economists held out hope that the index’s plunge was overdone and would be reversed. “One extreme number on its own is not a reliable recession signal,” said Julian Jessop of Capital Economics. “It is so out of line with other January indicators that it is hard to know whether or not to believe it.”Others saw further evidence that the economy was softening.“The tea leaves are quickly accumulating,” Stephen Stanley of RBC Greenwich Capital said. “Payroll employment has flattened. The Christmas retail season was weak. Consumer spending seems to have weakened further in January, as auto sales fell noticeably. And of course the housing sector is a mess.”“Layered on top of this, financial markets, which we had hoped would find some footing after year-end, have gotten much worse so far in 2008, with the high-yield market imploding, stocks sagging, the leveraged loan backlog totally stuck and banks tightening credit fairly broadly.”On Monday, the Federal Reserve released a survey of lending officers indicating tighter lending standards.The nonmanufacturing index released Tuesday dates back only to 1997. In 2001, it turned lower in April, a month after what the National Bureau of Economic Research later concluded was the beginning of the recession.The manufacturing index, with a much longer history, dipped under 50 in December but bounced back in January. That may reflect the continuing strength of the world economy, which has led to rising exports for manufacturers and strong orders for many of their foreign subsidiaries.In Tuesday’s report, there were sharp drops in both new orders and in employment indexes, showing that most companies are reluctant to hire and are seeing few new orders.Stock prices rose last week on suggestions that the economy might be stronger than expected, and even with declines on Monday and Tuesday share prices remain well above the lows set in the middle of last month.Still, all 10 economic sectors in the S.& P. 500 fell on Tuesday. Financial stocks, off an average of 4.6 percent, turned in the worst showing. Three financial stocks fell by more than 10 percent, including NYSE Euronext, which reported higher profit but said it had to delay plans to reduce some expenses, and the Principal Financial Group, which said its earnings plunged because of investment losses.There was also significant weakness in stocks dependent on construction activity. Martin Marietta Materials, a large supplier of construction sand and gravel, fell $12.10, to $106.02, after reporting lower earnings. Vulcan Materials, a competitor, dropped $5.92, to $69.52.Home building stocks, which had rallied strongly in recent weeks on hopes that the worst was over in that market, have turned lower again. The S.& P. 500 home builders index fell 4.9 percent on Tuesday, after dropping 6 percent on Monday.One of the few stocks to rise was Whirlpool, which said profits were up because of strong sales in Asia and Latin America and savings from closing American manufacturing plants. It gained $8.41, to $90.The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 20/32, to 105 18/32. Its yield fell to 3.57 percent, from 3.64 percent.Following are the results of Tuesday’s auction of four-week Treasury bills:'"
"'08-02-06,'0','A critical factor in his comeback was his campaign’s decision to pour almost all of its scarce resources into trying to make an early splash in New Hampshire, a small state that fit Mr. McCain’s budget and his style of campaigning in intimate town hall meetings.Finally, Mr. McCain’s campaign could not have recovered without a last-ditch $3 million loan last fall, when the candidate, who is 71, put up as collateral his campaign mailing list, the principal asset of his political future, and took out a life insurance policy to assure the bankers that they would be paid, even if he died.“He was the last man left standing” after the Florida primary, said Ed Rogers, a veteran Republican operative not working for any campaign. While Mr. McCain’s opponents all suffered problems, even at the worst of times Mr. McCain was able to keep his approval rating from sinking in New Hampshire. If he was not winning, he was also, as Mr. Rogers put it, “just not losing.”Mr. McCain officially kicked off his campaign on April 25 last year, when he announced his candidacy to an often listless crowd in Portsmouth, N.H., then repeated his remarks later to a gathering pelted by cold rain in Manchester. The grim weather was a metaphor for a campaign dogged by problems, chief among them fund-raising difficulties and bloated expenses.Although he had expected to raise $100 million by the end of 2007, Mr. McCain’s positions on the war and immigration turned off the small donors who had been his mainstay in his 2000 presidential race. Mr. McCain had also alienated many potential big donors — particularly those in the lobbying, telecommunications and military industries — with various legislative crusades.At the same time, his campaign was spending freely. He had 150 people on his payroll and the highest-paid staff of any campaign of either party. Filings for the first three months of 2007 show that Terry Nelson, the campaign manager, made nearly $52,000 in the first quarter, and that the campaign had spent $11,000 on photography, $1,700 for decorations and $1,671 for flowers.The troubles exploded on July 10, when the campaign announced, at the very moment that Mr. McCain stood on the Senate floor opposing a withdrawal from Iraq, that his top two political aides, John Weaver and Mr. Nelson, were departing. Speculation raced through both parties that Mr. McCain would soon withdraw from the race.But three days later, Mr. McCain got off a Southwest Airlines flight in Manchester and began the long climb back up.The first decision was to jettison the planned 30-state campaign — Mr. McCain could not afford it, anyway — and focus almost solely on New Hampshire, where he had upset George W. Bush in the 2000 primary.“He said, ‘I know how to campaign here in New Hampshire, this state is tailor-made for me, I’ll live off the land,’ ” recalled Steve Duprey, a former New Hampshire Republican Party chairman and a top McCain supporter in the state.As Mr. McCain traveled in Mr. Duprey’s Suburban to banter and argue with voters in small gatherings, Rick Davis, the new campaign manager, brought costs under control, if only because there was no money and no other choice. Mr. Davis and other senior advisers worked without salaries, as they do to this day. Mr. Duprey recalls Mr. Davis turning down requests from the field for bumper stickers and yard signs.A turning point came in a debate in Durham, N.H., on Sept. 5, when Mr. McCain took Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and one of his Republican rivals, to task for saying the “surge” strategy in Iraq was “apparently” working.“It is working,” Mr. McCain said, in a sharp response that drew largely good reviews and energized his campaign. “No, not ‘apparently.’ It’s working.”A week later, Mr. McCain was on what his campaign billed as a “No Surrender” Iowa bus tour, a double reference to the Iraq war and Mr. McCain’s presidential campaign. The candidate packed a bus with former fellow prisoners of war from Vietnam and newly minted veterans from Iraq and stopped at V.F.W. posts and American Legion halls across Iowa to argue that the strategy in Iraq was a success, and that Democrats and wavering Republicans who wanted to withdraw the troops were making a terrible mistake. The campaign was convinced that even those voters who disagreed with Mr. McCain took notice.“He was willing to stake his political fortune,” said Michael DuHaime, a top adviser to the Giuliani campaign. “People respect that.”But the campaign, which could scarcely afford the bus, was being greatly outspent by Mr. Romney and Mr. Giuliani. “I tell you, it was still a tough slog,” Mr. Duprey said. The campaign was able to broadcast only one New Hampshire television commercial, made at cost by Mr. McCain’s media consultant, Mark McKinnon, but campaign advisers said it nonetheless nudged Mr. McCain’s poll numbers upward.By November, polls showed that the public had begun to feel less negative about Iraq, where violence had declined. Mr. McCain’s early support for increasing troop levels began to look prescient. At the same time, his closest rival for the nomination, Mr. Giuliani, began to fade after critical news reports about his years as mayor of New York City, and soon decided to pull out of New Hampshire entirely.“The rise of McCain is literally tied to the decline of Giuliani,” said Andrew Kohut, a pollster and the president of the Pew Research Center.The $3 million loan kept the campaign alive into December, when it became clear that Fred D. Thompson, another Republican rival, was going nowhere. At the same time, the commercial that ran in late December about the cross in the sand, titled “My Christmas Story,” seemed to be reaching evangelicals in South Carolina.“In 2000, in spite of the urging of several of us, Senator McCain was reluctant to speak about how faith got him through his P.O.W. experience,” said Gary L. Bauer, a prominent Christian conservative who became one of the few to endorse him eight years ago.“In this campaign he has been much more willing to show more of his own heart and his relationship with God,” Mr. Bauer said, “and I think that has contributed to the fact that essentially the evangelical vote is being divided three ways” among Mr. McCain, Mr. Romney and Mike Huckabee, who had been a minister before he became Arkansas’s governor. By Jan. 3, when Mr. Huckabee was the surprise winner in the Iowa caucuses, Mr. McCain’s advisers were jubilant that the victory had weakened Mr. Romney, then Mr. McCain’s most serious competitor.“Huckabee chipping Romney in Iowa was an enormous event for the campaign,” said Steve Schmidt, one of Mr. McCain’s senior advisers.Mr. McCain’s New Hampshire victory created the momentum that he and his advisers had long hoped for. The victory in South Carolina followed, not least because Mr. McCain had in place a “truth squad” of establishment Republicans to repel smear tactics that had derailed his primary campaign there in 2000.Last week, propelled once again by momentum and money that was at last rolling in, Mr. McCain won Florida with big support from Cuban-Americans. It was no accident that his first event in the state after his South Carolina victory was at a restaurant in Little Havana, where he was introduced in Spanish by a crucial supporter, Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Miami. At the same time, Mr. Giuliani, who had spent millions of dollars and weeks in the state, was in free fall, and ultimately lost the primary.This week, as Mr. McCain grew more confident of winning, the maverick who had long defied and exasperated his party began promoting himself as a true conservative who could unify Republicans for the fight in November. “The party always comes together after we have the nominee,” Mr. McCain said after he touched down Tuesday in Phoenix to watch election returns. “That’s a legacy handed down to us from Ronald Reagan.”'"
"'08-02-06,'0','In recent weeks, fresh concerns about the threat posed by Al Qaeda have prompted senior Bush administration officials to travel to Pakistan to seek approval for more aggressive American military action against militants based in the tribal areas near the border with Afghanistan.As part of his testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Gen. Michael V. Hayden, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, also offered the government’s most extensive public defense for the use of waterboarding, saying that the C.I.A. had used the harsh interrogation technique against three Qaeda operatives in 2002 and 2003 in a belief that another terrorist attack on the United States was imminent. He identified the three as Abu Zubaydah, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.General Hayden said the technique, which induces a feeling of drowning, had not been used since 2003. Mr. McConnell said that a future C.I.A. request to use waterboarding on a detainee would need to be approved both by Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey and by President Bush.The C.I.A. is the only agency permitted under law to use interrogation methods more aggressive than those used by the American military. Senate Democrats sought to use the hearing to exploit divisions about those techniques.Both Robert S. Mueller III, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Lt. Gen. Michael D. Maples, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told lawmakers that their agencies had successfully obtained valuable intelligence from terrorism suspects without using what Mr. Mueller called the “coercive” methods of the C.I.A.But General Hayden bristled when asked about Congressional attempts to mandate that C.I.A. interrogators be required to use the more limited set of interrogation methods contained in the Army Field Manual, which is used by military interrogators.“It would make no more sense to apply the Army’s field manual to C.I.A.,” General Hayden said, “than it would to take the Army Field Manual on grooming and apply it to my agency, or the Army Field Manual on recruiting and apply it to my agency. Or, for that matter, the Army Field Manual on sexual orientation and apply it to my agency.”During the testimony, Mr. McConnell tried to recalibrate somewhat the intelligence agencies’ view of Iran’s nuclear program, telling senators that the public portion of a National Intelligence Estimate released in December placed too much significance on the fact that Iran had halted secret work on nuclear weapons design in 2003.Mr. McConnell said that weapons design was “probably the least significant part of the program” and that Iran’s refusal to halt uranium enrichment meant that it still posed a potential nuclear threat.The fact that Iran was continuing its enrichment efforts was mentioned in that intelligence assessment, but Republican lawmakers and many conservative commentators have criticized the report as misleading.Intelligence officials have defended the assessment on Iran as an example of the more rigorous analysis that American spy agencies have adopted in response to the prewar intelligence failures on Iraq. But while Mr. McConnell praised the assessment, he said his office had not been clear enough about its conclusions as it hurried to make it public.“In retrospect, as I mentioned, I would do some things differently,” he said.Among his litany of worldwide threats, Mr. McConnell also warned the Senate panel about the growing threat of “cyberattacks” by terror groups or homegrown militants. He said President Bush signed a classified directive in January outlining steps to protect American computer networks.In his testimony on Al Qaeda, Mr. McConnell said Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Zawahri were precluded by “security concerns” from the day-to-day running of the organization. But he said both men “regularly pass inspirational messages and specific operational guidance to their followers through public statements.”Mr. McConnell said the flow of foreign militants into Iraq slowed somewhat during the final months of 2007. At the same time, however, he warned that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the largely homegrown Sunni insurgent group in Iraq that American officials say is led by foreigners, could shift its focus to carrying out attacks outside Iraq.Based on captured documents, Mr. McConnell said, fewer than 100 militants from Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia to date have left Iraq to establish cells in other countries.Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, blamed the Iraq war for undermining the campaign against Al Qaeda.“The focus of America’s military forces and intelligence resources were mistakenly shifted,” he said, “from delivering a decisive blow against Al Qaeda, which is the enemy.”'"

"'08-02-06,'0','The Dow Jones industrial average fell 370.03 points, or 2.9 percent, to 12,265.13. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropped 3.2 percent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 3.1 percent. Stock markets in Europe also fell sharply. In London, the FTSE 100 closed down 2.6 percent. In Frankfurt, the DAX was down 3.4 percent, and the CAC 40 index in France was off 4 percent.Asian markets Wednesday morning took their cue from Wall Street, with most falling sharply. Japan’s Nikkei share average fell more than 4 percent and Hong Kong was down nearly 5 percent.In the American market, the declines in the major averages were the largest since Feb. 27, 2007, when a brief plunge in the Chinese market alarmed investors worldwide. The Chinese market later recovered, and even after some recent weakness is twice as high as it was then.The S.& P. 500 is now down 8.97 percent since the start of the year. Howard Silverblatt, an S.& P. analyst, said this was the worst performance ever for the index at this point into the year.Confidence among European investors has been undermined by weaker-than-expected European economic data. Economists said the data suggested that economic distress was no longer solely a problem in the United States but was spreading.“The weak European data is starting to become more prevalent,” Mr. Shapiro said. “The concept of America as an island and everyone else being fat and happy is no longer clear.”In the United States survey, businesses complained of rising costs and falling orders. In responding to the survey, 42 percent of businesses said they felt worse about the next 12 months compared with 2007; only 16 percent felt better.For the first time, the institute published a monthly composite index to provide a broader measure of the nonmanufacturing sector, taking in the measures of business activity, new orders, employment and supplier deliveries. This index was 44.6 in January, indicating a contraction.According to the new nonmanufacturing report, only 3 nonmanufacturing industries reported growth in January, while 14 contracted.The index was released earlier than planned on Tuesday, the institute said, because of a possible leak. Analysts said rumors that the figures were going to be poor had circulated earlier and might have been a reason for the early weakness in stocks.In the report, the institute’s chairman, Anthony S. Nieves, said, “The overall indication in January is that nonmanufacturing has come to the end of a long-term period of growth and has contracted for the month of January.”“This clearly makes it more likely that it’s not just a slowdown but a recession in the first half of this year,” he said. “The general picture emerging is that the economy is contracting.”Mr. Gault said that during earlier slowdowns the index declined gradually over several months, but this time the index dropped extraordinarily sharply.The latest survey followed the publication of government figures Friday showing that employers eliminated 17,000 jobs in January. It was the first decline in the work force in more than four years.The big decline provided evidence that the Federal Reserve had reason to sharply reduce short-term interest rates in January, cutting the federal funds rate by 1.25 percentage points, to 3.5 percent, in two moves that served notice the Fed was worried about slow growth.But one aspect of the institute’s report provided a warning of the limits of action available to the Fed. The institute reported that most companies were paying higher prices for the things they buy, indicating that inflation may be getting stronger even as the economy slows.Some economists held out hope that the index’s plunge was overdone and would be reversed. “One extreme number on its own is not a reliable recession signal,” said Julian Jessop of Capital Economics. “It is so out of line with other January indicators that it is hard to know whether or not to believe it.”Others saw further evidence that the economy was softening.“The tea leaves are quickly accumulating,” Stephen Stanley of RBC Greenwich Capital said. “Payroll employment has flattened. The Christmas retail season was weak. Consumer spending seems to have weakened further in January, as auto sales fell noticeably. And of course the housing sector is a mess.”“Layered on top of this, financial markets, which we had hoped would find some footing after year-end, have gotten much worse so far in 2008, with the high-yield market imploding, stocks sagging, the leveraged loan backlog totally stuck and banks tightening credit fairly broadly.”On Monday, the Federal Reserve released a survey of lending officers indicating tighter lending standards.The nonmanufacturing index released Tuesday dates back only to 1997. In 2001, it turned lower in April, a month after what the National Bureau of Economic Research later concluded was the beginning of the recession.The manufacturing index, with a much longer history, dipped under 50 in December but bounced back in January. That may reflect the continuing strength of the world economy, which has led to rising exports for manufacturers and strong orders for many of their foreign subsidiaries.In Tuesday’s report, there were sharp drops in both new orders and in employment indexes, showing that most companies are reluctant to hire and are seeing few new orders.Stock prices rose last week on suggestions that the economy might be stronger than expected, and even with declines on Monday and Tuesday share prices remain well above the lows set in the middle of last month.Still, all 10 economic sectors in the S.& P. 500 fell on Tuesday. Financial stocks, off an average of 4.6 percent, turned in the worst showing. Three financial stocks fell by more than 10 percent, including NYSE Euronext, which reported higher profit but said it had to delay plans to reduce some expenses, and the Principal Financial Group, which said its earnings plunged because of investment losses.There was also significant weakness in stocks dependent on construction activity. Martin Marietta Materials, a large supplier of construction sand and gravel, fell $12.10, to $106.02, after reporting lower earnings. Vulcan Materials, a competitor, dropped $5.92, to $69.52.Home building stocks, which had rallied strongly in recent weeks on hopes that the worst was over in that market, have turned lower again. The S.& P. 500 home builders index fell 4.9 percent on Tuesday, after dropping 6 percent on Monday.One of the few stocks to rise was Whirlpool, which said profits were up because of strong sales in Asia and Latin America and savings from closing American manufacturing plants. It gained $8.41, to $90.The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 20/32, to 105 18/32. Its yield fell to 3.57 percent, from 3.64 percent.Following are the results of Tuesday’s auction of four-week Treasury bills:'"
"'08-02-06,'0','Now comes what is viewed as the most aggressive move yet: a proposal to have Danbury police officers work with federal agents in enforcing the nation’s immigration policies.While Mayor Boughton said the proposal was brought to him by other Council members, he — like the police chief and the city attorney — has been a vocal supporter of the collaboration with federal agents.Such arrangements have not always worked out well. Last fall in Greenport, on Long Island, a cooperative effort between federal agents and the local police so enraged Nassau County officials that they threatened to stop working with immigration agents. In a search for gang members, armed squads burst into homes at night, terrorizing families and arresting anyone who lacked identity papers, even if the agents had raided the wrong house.Danbury is a study in contrasts, which are perhaps most apparent on two streets named for the hills they climb. On Deer Hill Road, expansive homes line both sides of the street where factory owners once lived when this town was known as the “Hatting Capital of the World.” (Danbury turned out five million hats annually at the turn of the 20th century.)Not far away is Town Hill Avenue, where two-family houses have been converted into four- and five-family residences, evidenced by the multiple satellite dishes that line the rooftops. In 2005, a neighborhood inspection team was formed, in part to ferret out illegal attic and basement apartments that often house dozens of illegal immigrants and are rife with fire code violations. One row of houses is known as “the barracks.”Below the hills sits a compact city with its Main Street, now mostly home to Brazilian restaurants, ethnic hair salons and Western Union outlets; the growing campus of Western Connecticut State University; a regional airport; one of the country’s busiest shopping malls; and the corporate headquarters of Ethan Allen furniture and Praxair, a manufacturer of industrial gases.Despite protests from a vocal minority who say that deputizing local officers will lead to racial profiling and the erosion of community trust, the Common Council voted, 19 to 2, in favor of the immigration crackdown in a preliminary decision last month.“Every single person in Danbury is either an immigrant or the descendant of an immigrant, and yet there is a lot of vitriol against immigration,” said Councilman Paul Rotello, who voted against the proposal. “For all Danbury’s cosmopolitan airs, it really is a working-class place, and nothing is more threatening to the working class than immigration.”From the city ordinances aimed at immigrant communities to his frequent appearances on the Lou Dobbs and Joe Scarborough television programs, Mr. Boughton has gained a reputation as an official willing to take on the thorny issue of immigration.Yet the mayor said he did not set out to make it the central theme of his administration. “It’s not my cause,” Mr. Boughton said. “It’s not something I woke up to and said, ‘Let’s take on illegal immigration.’ ”Al Robinson, whose blog, HatCityBlog.com, is largely devoted to the mayor’s activities, says Mr. Boughton underwent a transformation in 2005 after being criticized by many residents here for proposing a day labor center to stop workers from gathering in Kennedy Park.“He just didn’t know the level of anti-immigration feeling in the area,” Mr. Robinson said. “It almost seemed like overnight he switched his whole policy from someone interested in helping immigrants to someone who just wanted to enforce immigration law.”Mayor Boughton said the crackdown is supported by what he calls “the middle 60-70 percent” of the city’s residents. And last year, he received 65 percent of the vote for mayor, giving him a fourth two-year term. He is the city’s longest-serving Republican mayor.“There’s no question that illegal immigration has a profound impact on the entire community,” Mr. Boughton said. “The expenses, health care, the schools, social service programs, and that’s a direct reflection on the federal government’s failure to get the job done.”If that is the case, Danbury has its work cut out. According to the Census Bureau’s 2006 population estimates, Danbury has a greater proportion of foreign-born residents than any other city in Connecticut, 34 percent of the population, up from 27 percent in 2000. Statewide, 12.9 percent of the population was born outside the United States.Mayor Boughton, 43, takes pride in the city, where he can trace his ancestry back 300 years. The men in his family, of English and French Huguenot descent, were carpenters for generations, until his father, Donald, broke the mold and entered politics, serving one term as mayor in the 1970s.Mark Boughton taught social studies at Danbury High School for 14 years before following his father into politics and winning election to the Connecticut General Assembly, where he served in the House from 1999 to 2001.As mayor, Mr. Boughton attends three or four social events on most Saturday nights.The mayor denies claims that his stance against illegal immigration is an attempt to position him for higher office. Still, he said, “if an opportunity arises, obviously I’ll look at it.”“I have ambitions,” he said. “I wouldn’t want somebody in my position not to have ambitions. But right now, my No. 1 priority is the city, to leave the city better off than what I inherited.”'"

"'08-02-06,'0','The project’s scale represents a triumph for residents, who beat back Macerich’s far more ambitious plan, unveiled in 2004, to tear down the mall and replace it with a 10-acre complex of high-rise residential buildings, office space and stores.Since 1980, Santa Monica, with a population of 88,000, has more than doubled its stock of office space to about 13.1 million square feet, said Andy Agle, the city’s director for housing and economic development. Many office workers commute long distances because of the steep housing costs in Santa Monica and adjacent neighborhoods on the Westside of Los Angeles.The proposed high-density complex at Santa Monica Place raised fears that traffic gridlock would worsen, said Diana Gordon, a co-chairwoman of the Santa Monica Coalition for a Livable City, a group that opposed the project. “The towers were lightning rods for the frustrations about traffic and overdevelopment,” she said.Randy Brant, a Macerich executive vice president, said his company came up with the plan for the large-scale project at the urging of the city, which was working to update the nearby Civic Center and connect it to the city’s downtown. But he conceded that Macerich was caught short.“We’ll take full blame for misreading the community, thinking they would want something like that,” Mr. Brant said. “Once we took it out to the community, we knew immediately that it wasn’t going to work.”In response to the protests, the city held a series of well-attended public workshops. During that process, Macerich bought 11 stores that Federated Department Stores (now Macy’s Inc.) had acquired from May Department Stores, including one store of the defunct Robinsons-May chain at Santa Monica Place.The purchase of that store gives Macerich a chance to attract a new anchor tenant — perhaps Nordstrom, which has a store in the Westside Pavilion, another Macerich mall only six miles away. Other candidates are Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale’s, all already represented on the Westside. (Macy’s owns its store at Santa Monica Place, which will remain open during the mall’s redevelopment.)Normally retailers would hesitate to open a second store so close by. But in Los Angeles the heavy traffic creates distinct shopping districts, said Jim Sullivan, an analyst at Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif., that focuses on REITs. “The rules of thumb don’t apply when you talk about West L.A.,” he said.No tenants have been announced, but Tony Grossi, another Macerich executive vice president, said the retailers are not likely to compete with the Third Street Promenade, where the stores largely cater to shoppers aged 18 to 30. “Santa Monica has a wealthy resident population,” he said, “and they have no immediate choices for luxury or near-luxury shopping.” Macerich has gradually emptied out the mall by making its leases short term.Judging by the success of the Third Street Promenade, which occupies three city blocks, analysts say they expect the revamped mall to do very well. Over the years, the independent retailers that lined the Promenade, including several bookstores, have given way to the type of chain stores that can be found in shopping malls throughout the country.These national retailers, of course, can pay higher rents. Jan Sweetnam, the West Coast asset manager for Federal Realty Investment Trust, a REIT based in Rockville, Md., that owns most of the buildings on the two northernmost blocks of the Promenade, said annual rents were $20 to $25 a square foot in 1996 and have climbed to $220 a square foot now. “We have people looking at spaces for 2010 and 2011,” he said.Santa Monica Place could have been an open-air mall from the outset. Three decades ago, Jon A. Jerde, chairman and president of the Jerde Partnership, the firm that has redesigned the mall, proposed such a design but lost out to Mr. Gehry.The Rouse Company, the developer of the mall, “was an East Coast firm, and they always put roofs on shopping centers because it snows there,” said Mr. Jerde, who also designed Horton Plaza in San Diego. Horton Plaza, which opened five years after Santa Monica Place, is a multilevel shopping center without a roof.Mr. Gehry declined to be interviewed about the redevelopment plans, but Mr. Jerde said he was not likely to be upset about them. “This was a client-conceived building,” Mr. Jerde said. The mall was extensively remodeled once before, in 1990.This is not the first time a Gehry building has encountered a wrecking ball. Last year, the University of California, Irvine, tore down a two-story building designed by Mr. Gehry, saying it was too small for the campus’s needs.But Mr. Agle said the city, which owns the parking structures adjacent to Santa Monica Place, was likely to retain one distinctive feature of the mall: a mesh sign, now obscured by ficus trees, that recalls Mr. Gehry’s penchant early in his career for working with ordinary materials.Mr. Jerde said the sign was a “perfect remnant of Frank’s chain-link aesthetic.” The architecture firm Pugh & Scarpa will remodel the facades of the parking structures, Mr. Agle said.With the mall redevelopment about to begin, Ms. Gordon said the Santa Monica coalition was happy with Macerich’s plan. “We think that’s what residents want — an intelligent redevelopment of an existing building,” she said. “Big new commercial developments don’t work for Santa Monica anymore.”'"

The fund’s investment manager, Ritchie Capital Management, agreed to a $2.5 million penalty.Ritchie Capital Management separately agreed to changes, said the attorney general of New York, Andrew M.

"'08-02-06,'0','A Rhode Island judge ruled Tuesday that felony cases brought while state law briefly treated 17-year-olds as adults would be dismissed or transferred to Family Court.The judge, Daniel A. Procaccini of Superior Court, ruled that about 100 pending cases would be dismissed. Cases in which a grand jury has returned an indictment will be transferred to Family Court, but they can be returned to Superior Court if the attorney general thinks the crime is egregious and should be elevated to the adult level.“It is apparent that defendants’ rights were violated by their direct placement in the adult criminal system,” Judge Procaccini wrote.The dismissed cases can be refiled in juvenile court, according to the ruling.Attorney General Patrick C. Lynch appealed the ruling Tuesday, saying in a statement that it puts cases that should be in Superior Court in limbo.“This state of uncertainty is not fair to victims and their families,” Mr. Lynch said.The initial change in law, which took effect July 1, was meant to save millions of dollars a year by transferring juvenile defenders to the state prison. The law set off a furor among law enforcement officials and children’s advocates, and failed to take into account that juveniles are housed in protective custody, which is more expensive.'"
"'08-02-06,'0','LONDON — BP, the British oil giant, announced on Tuesday that it would cut an additional 5,000 jobs by the middle of next year, part of a plan by the chief executive, Anthony B. Hayward, to slim management and make the company more efficient.The company also announced a fourth-quarter profit that missed analyst estimates, but said it would raise its dividend 31 percent, citing an “increasingly robust” outlook.Profit in the last three months of 2007 rose 53 percent, to $4.4 billion, from $2.88 billion, in the period a year earlier. Excluding gains or losses from holding inventories or one-time items, profit was $4 billion, which was about 10 percent less than analysts expected.Still, BP said overall oil and gas production was expected to grow this year, justifying the increase in the dividend, to 13.5 cents a share. “The rise reflected the company’s increasingly robust view of the future and greater confidence in its ability to deliver sustained dividend income to shareholders,” Mr. Hayward said.Mr. Hayward, who took over from John Browne last year, is trying to improve performance and efficiency by streamlining operations, removing management layers and cutting jobs.

"'08-02-06,'0','“The publishing world wants to fit you into some kind of niche,” Mr. Cohen said recently on a short drive past the settings of his books. “You’re a crime writer, you’re a science writer, whatever. I’m passionate about a lot of different things.”The first of the three books was “Boombox,” released in May by Academy Chicago Publishers, a literary novel inspired by frustrations experienced on his block in Boerum Hill. The second, “The Graving Dock,” was more commercial, a sequel to his crime novel that Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin’s Minotaur published in November. The third, due on March 1, is the most personal and quietly startling: “Storms Can’t Hurt the Sky: A Buddhist Path Through Divorce” (DaCapo), an account of the end of Mr. Cohen’s marriage.“It was the worst thing that ever happened to me,” he writes. “What I learned astonished me: that change and loss are inevitable, but that the suffering we derive from them is not.”As different as the books may seem, Mr. Cohen sees a common thread. “Ultimately, all of them are mysteries,” he said. “Obviously, the crime novel is a mystery. ‘Boombox’ is a mystery about why it’s so hard for people to get along.”Even “Storms,” he said, is a mystery: “On a very specific day in 2005, my marriage fell apart. Why did that happen? And that opened up into a deeper mystery. Why are romantic relationships so difficult?”Mr. Cohen was born in Austin, Tex., and lived in Afghanistan and Rio de Janeiro as a boy, while his father helped train elementary schoolteachers, before settling in Washington. After attending Wesleyan University in Connecticut and stints in a rock band and at a weekly newspaper, Mr. Cohen moved to New York, taking day jobs to get by. (He has in recent years written occasionally for the City section of The New York Times.)He wound up in Boerum Hill on Wyckoff Street, where today about the biggest threat on the sidewalk is having your foot run over by a baby stroller. But back in 1989 the block was more dangerous. “I’d hear gunshots at night,” he said outside his old apartment. “I got mugged on this block.”He was writing a novel there in 1991 when what he called a “writer’s nightmare” began: a teenage neighbor bought a club-size public-address system and began blasting gangsta rap in the courtyard. “I tried talking to him and his mother,” Mr. Cohen said. “She told me, ‘This isn’t Westchester.’ ”Though eventually the neighbors organized and went to the police, he said, “for several months I just kept struggling with that.” Then he decided to write about it, creating “Boombox” from the real situation but with fictitious characters.He didn’t sell the book to a publisher, and began writing another, a crime novel, “Red Hook.” It was nominated for best first novel by the Mystery Writers of America and praised by critics. “There’s a documentary panache to his depiction of Brooklyn and its history,” Mark Rozzo wrote in The Los Angeles Times, citing “an acutely rendered sense of consequence, of the way criminal acts — and personal histories — radiate to affect entire communities.”At about that time Mr. Cohen had begun a whirlwind, long-distance romance with the woman he calls Claire in “Storms Can’t Hurt the Sky.” She moved to Brooklyn on Sept. 1, 2001 (“Welcome to New York,” he writes in “Storms”), and they married in 2003. But the news that their building was being sold led to a series of brutal fights about new neighborhoods and apartments, Mr. Cohen said, and counseling brought no relief.What helped — though it was too late for his marriage — was Buddhism. His interest began with a flier advertising a Buddhist lecture in Park Slope. Though, he said, he feared something “dopey,” he attended: “The talk just blew me away. It was so much about what I was going through.” Buddhism gave him tools to deal with his anger, he said, aids to recovering from his divorce.Mr. Cohen pulled “Boombox” out of the drawer and found a publisher. After a first attempt at a “Red Hook” sequel failed to gel, his second try came together. And he realized he had another book in him. “Storms Can’t Hurt the Sky” is part memoir and part self-help book. It blends a frank examination of his marriage with equal parts enthusiastic introduction to Buddhist teachings and outsider’s skepticism. Chapters have titles like “You Aren’t My Sunshine” and “Does This Book Exist?”His literary efforts extend to a monthly reading series he started in 2002 at Sunny’s, an eclectic Red Hook bar where he invites New York writers to read from their books and essays.He has seen his ex-wife once since she moved out, he said, at her lawyer’s office, and has not had contact with her in over a year. “If she reads the whole thing,” he said, “I hope she sees this is not about me blaming her for what went wrong.”'"
"'08-02-06,'0','The anxiety over school admissions is a parable of desire and frustration in a country with the largest concentration of young people in the world. About 40 percent of India’s 1.1 billion citizens are younger than 18; many others are parents in their 20s and 30s, with young school-age children.Today, for all but the very poor, government schools are not an option because they are considered weak, and the competition for choice private schools is fierce.The scramble is part of the great Indian education rush, playing out across the country and across the socioeconomic spectrum. The striving classes are spending hefty amounts or taking loans to send their children to private schools. In some cases, children from small towns are commuting more than 40 miles every day to good, or at least sought-after, schools. New private schools are sprouting, as industrialists, real estate developers and even a handful of foreign companies eye the Indian education market.That market is a lot like other things in India. Supply lags far behind demand as cities grow, pocketbooks swell and parents who themselves may have struggled in their childhoods want something better for their offspring.The father named Amit acknowledged the cravings of his social class this way: “Branding has really taken over. Everyone is looking at what car you’re driving, what clothes you’re wearing, where your child is going to school.”A retired civil servant, Vir Singh, 68, recognized this shift in his own family. One of his sons attended government school and moved to the United States to work as an engineer. Another attended a decent private school here in Delhi and went on to work for a multinational company, but today refuses to send his daughter to his own alma mater. Mr. Singh said that son wanted his child to attend none but the city’s best. “Now they want more high-fly schools,” is how he put it. “It’s a changed society.”One morning, in search of a “high fly” school, Mr. Singh arrived at a branch of the coveted Delhi Public School here — as in Britain, “public” means private — to see if his granddaughter’s name had appeared on the admissions shortlist. No such luck. Mr. Singh grumbled about the school’s criteria for shortlisting; he was appalled that the child of a single parent was getting preference. “You want the parents to split up?” he asked incredulously.The admissions process has never been easy in elite Indian schools. Once, private school admissions were based on an opaque mix of connections, money and preferences for certain kinds of families for certain kinds of schools. Today, as a result of litigation, court-mandated rules in Delhi have been devised to make the process fairer and more transparent, at least on paper.Schools are allowed to set their own admissions criteria, but those must be made clear to parents and followed consistently. Many schools this year have created a point system that rewards girls, students with older siblings in the same school, children of alumni and, to encourage neighborhood schooling, those who live nearby.Over the past few weeks, it was hard to find parents who were not complaining about the new rules.Sridhar and Noopur Kannan, seeking admission to the Delhi Public School for their 4-year-old son, found it absurd that girls were being rewarded, even as they counted their one enviable blessing: Mr. Kannan was an alumnus of the school, and a member of the screening committee remembered him as a good student.Rumana Akhtar’s alma mater, where her daughter would have had an edge, was impractical because it was far across town from where she lives. Alok Aggarwal’s efforts to ply his connections had done nothing to secure a seat for his 4-year-old son. Ashok Gupta rued his own lack of connections, but had set aside more than $2,500 in case a “donation” would open doors.Many parents said that despite the new criteria, some schools continued to make exceptions in exchange for contributions to school funds.The pressures can be felt on the other side of the door as well.This year, Suman Nath, principal of Tagore International School, in a crowded middle-class neighborhood, received 2,014 applications for 112 prekindergarten seats. The other day, she said, a tailor who stitches clothes for her family came to appeal on behalf of her child. Government ministers called to lobby on behalf of certain children. A director at another school recalled receiving a phone call from the electricity board, threatening to cut off her school’s power if a certain child was not admitted.The one change that many parents and school administrators have welcomed is that children are no longer subjected to interviews for admissions. At least now, Mrs. Nath said, “children aren’t experiencing rejection.”That brought little comfort last Friday afternoon, when Tagore International posted its list of children selected for admission. Parents elbowed their way through a thick crowd to have a look at the list. Most came away looking bereft.“They need to open a new school for children who haven’t gotten in anywhere,” said Sarika Chetwani, 28, who had applied unsuccessfully to 12 schools for her 4-year-old daughter. “I’m totally messed up. I don’t know what to do next.”Shailaja Sharma, 26, said her only hope was to find an influential someone to ply another influential someone with money. Mandira Dev Sengupta, carrying her 3-year-old-son son, Rio, in her arms, bit her lip and fought back tears. After 17 applications, Rio had been admitted to only one school, and it was not one that she particularly liked.This week, even before the nursery school race was over, another race had begun. Twelfth graders across India braced for final examinations, which determine whether students will get coveted university seats, and where.On Monday, The Hindustan Times published tips for parents of exam takers. “Do not nag your child,” was one. “Remember, he is not a machine that can study for four to five hours at a stretch,” was another.'"

"'08-02-06,'0','Yet he is openly taking on Microsoft of Redmond, Wash. “This could be a signal that he’s going to go straight at Microsoft, including disrupting their deals,” said George F. Colony, chief executive of Forrester Research. “This looks like the beginning of the formal war.”Whatever the outcome of Microsoft’s bid, analysts say, the move and Google’s countermoves represent an escalation in the confrontation between the companies. Google says the Microsoft bid raises grave competitive and policy issues.Its chief legal officer, David Drummond, said in a statement Sunday afternoon that the proposed deal posed a threat to “the underlying principles of the Internet: openness and innovation.”Mr. Schmidt called Yahoo’s chief, Jerry Yang, to offer help, perhaps a partnership. In Washington, Google lobbyists urged regulators to scrutinize any Microsoft-Yahoo merger.Microsoft’s initiative toward Yahoo, according to former colleagues, seems to have set off alarm bells for Mr. Schmidt, the seasoned Microsoft adversary.“Google’s response looks like an overreaction, even a little panicky, to me,” said Michael Sheridan, a venture capital adviser who worked with Mr. Schmidt at both Sun and Novell. “But for Eric, it’s as if something from your past has kicked in, and the feared enemy from the north is at your door.”Mr. Schmidt is a computer scientist who worked as a researcher at Bell Laboratories and at the Palo Alto Research Center of Xerox before moving into management. He is every bit as comfortable talking about software scripting languages as he is discussing corporate strategy. His resentment of Microsoft, it seems, stems in part from his view that it is a triumph of market muscle over superior technology — a common belief in Silicon Valley.Now, after a long career there, Mr. Schmidt finds himself leading a company that has plenty of market muscle of its own, and it is Microsoft for once that is struggling to compete.Mr. Schmidt’s concern is that buying Yahoo could put Microsoft in a position to repeat the pattern of the 1990s, according to people who have talked with Mr. Schmidt recently and asked not to be quoted because they were not authorized to speak for him. In the 1990s, Microsoft used its dominance of personal computer software to wrest control of the early Web software markets, like the ones for computer browsers and media players.If Microsoft buys Yahoo, it will have more than an 80 percent share in markets like consumer e-mail accounts on the Web and instant messaging.Mr. Schmidt, they say, has warned that Microsoft could then combine its dominance in PC software to steer users to online software and services, and lock them into Microsoft technology — in a way “exactly analogous” to the company’s tactics in the ’90s. Microsoft’s corporate behavior led to antitrust challenges and sanctions in the United States and Europe.Microsoft argues that its purchase of Yahoo would give Google a solid competitor in the Internet search and ad markets, enhancing consumer benefits and hastening innovation.The Google campaign against Microsoft’s bid, to some degree, underlines their broadening competition. They compete not only in Internet searches and advertising, where Google continues to gain market share, but also in software.It is an assault that is just getting under way. But Google has begun offering Web-based word processing, spreadsheets and presentation software as an alternative to Microsoft’s lucrative desktop programs. Google’s online programs are free, or $50 a user for companies that want technical support.“That’s the dagger at the heart of Microsoft,” said Thomas R. Eisenmann, an associate professor at Harvard Business School and an author of the school’s case study on Google. “And that’s why Microsoft is so eager to have a response. It’s buying Yahoo to become a much more vigorous competitor in search and advertising, Google’s core business.”Whether Google’s concerns about Microsoft are justified is unclear. And its protests of the deal, some analysts suggest, amount to posturing with intent. The longer Microsoft’s purchase of Yahoo can be dragged out with regulatory reviews, they say, the better for Google, as it gains while Microsoft’s online business remains unsettled.Two years ago, Google raised concerns about Microsoft’s use of the most recent version of its browser to steer users to its MSN search service. The browser, which is bundled with Microsoft’s Windows operating system, contains a small on-screen box for searching. Google complained that the search box steered users to Microsoft’s search engine as the default, and expressed its concerns to state antitrust regulators, the Justice Department and the European Commission.Microsoft said it listened to concerns from Google and other competitors, and designed the browser so that it was easy to set and change the default search service. In June 2006, the Justice Department concluded that the design of Microsoft’s browser was not anticompetitive. Since then, Google’s share of Internet searches has continued to climb.For its part, Google has plenty that is proprietary. Its search algorithms and the design, even the size, of its data centers are trade secrets.But the two powerful companies have different business models that seek advantage in different places. In an interview in November, Mr. Schmidt said he understood the comparison but that it “rankled” him.“Microsoft was found guilty in a federal court,” he said. The big software maker, he argued, illegally maintained its Windows monopoly by stifling rivals. “Fundamentally, they blocked people from entering their ecosystem.”“At Google,” Mr. Schmidt added, “we had a long conversation about, if we became a big company, how could we avoid that. There are a lot of technical things we can do and have done. But the one that we decided that was most important was not to trap user data. That is important because” if you can move your data from Google, “you always have a choice to go to a competitor of Google. That is absolutely not true in Microsoft’s history.”Google is hoping that Microsoft’s past will hamper its effort to become more formidable in the online business. Regulators in the United States and Europe can be expected to look closely at Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Yahoo and decide whether Google is being paranoid or not.'"
"'08-02-06,'0','LOS ANGELES — Hillary Clinton and John McCain scored decisive victories in California late Tuesday night after heated skirmishes for the state’s opulent troves of delegates to each party’s national convention.Most significant for Mr. McCain on the Republican side was his strong showing across a wide swath of the state’s 53 Congressional districts — with three delegates at stake in each — including areas in the southern portion of the state where a strong anti-immigration sentiment appeared earlier to poison his chances. Exit polls showed that Mitt Romney was favored over Mr. McCain by two to one among Republicans who were principally concerned with that issue.For his part, Mr. McCain dominated among voters who were focused on the war and the economy.On the Democratic side, the picture for Mrs. Clinton seemed equally clear; her support was widespread across the state and strong among the constituencies who have supported her in other states. For example, according to exit polls, Mrs. Clinton won Hispanic votes by a 2-to-1 margin over Barack Obama, and she won Asians by a 3-to-1 margin. Mr. Obama outpolled Mrs. Clinton among white Democrats and took 8 out of 10 African-American votes, while besting her among voters under the age of 30.As elsewhere in an eager and riveted nation, the turnout in this most populous of states was high: At least half of California’s 15.7 million registered voters, from the forest-line northern precincts to its beach communities in the south. were expected to have cast a vote in favor of a presidential candidate when the tally is complete.A judge in Alameda County, one of the most populous in the San Francisco Bay Area, ordered some precincts there to remain open a half-hour late, until 9:30 p.m. Pacific Time, to serve the throngs of voters who had appeared; some precincts ran out of ballots.'"
"'08-02-06,'0','But the night buoyed Mr. Huckabee, who had been all but written off in recent weeks after his cash-starved candidacy struggled in the wake of his surprise victory in the Iowa caucuses. He defied expectations on Tuesday by winning contests in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Georgia, the biggest Southern state to vote Tuesday. He and Mr. McCain were locked in a tight race in Missouri, a key winner-take-all state.“You know, over the past few days a lot of people have been trying to say that this is a two-man race,” he told his supporters in a suburb of Little Rock, Ark. “Well, you know what? It is. And we’re in it!”The huge number of contests — the most nominating contests ever held on a single day — posed enormous challenges for candidates already drained of money after their hard-fought nominating contests in the early states and with too little time to campaign everywhere. In hindsight, some of their choices appeared unwise: Mr. McCain’s decision to campaign in Massachusetts may have been calculated to try to rattle Mr. Romney, but it kept him away from several close-fought states where more campaigning might have helped him.Mr. Romney told his supporters in Boston that the Republican race, which some had predicted could have ended on Tuesday, would continue. “One thing that’s clear is, this campaign’s going on!” he said to cheers.At midnight, before California or Missouri were called, a delegate analysis by The Associated Press based on incomplete vote totals projected that Mr. McCain had won 269 delegates on Tuesday, Mr. Romney had won 67, Mr. Huckabee had won 85, and Representative Ron Paul of Texas had won 5. Those figures are likely to change as the vote tallies are completed and delegates are awarded under complicated rules that vary from state to state.That brought Mr. McCain’s estimated delegate count so far to 371, Mr. Romney’s to 160, and Mr. Huckabee’s to 128, according to The A.P.On a day when the stock market experienced its worst day in nearly a year, about 4 in 10 Republican primary voters cited the economy as the most important issue facing the nation in surveys of voters leaving the polls. That made it the top issue everywhere except for two states along the Mexican border, Arizona and California, where it vied with illegal immigration as most important.Voters who said they were most concerned about the economy, the Iraq war or terrorism were more likely to favor Mr. McCain, the surveys found. But those who called immigration the most important issue were more likely to favor Mr. Romney, who has assailed Mr. McCain’s support last spring for a failed immigration bill that many Republicans said amounted to amnesty.The voter surveys showed a stark ideological divide among Republican voters. While Mr. Romney did better among conservatives in almost every state, Mr. McCain did best among moderates. Mr. McCain has campaigned in recent weeks with Republican moderates like Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and independents like Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, and he has been criticized in recent days by conservative talk radio hosts, like Rush Limbaugh, who have proclaimed him not conservative enough.Mr. Romney did best among those who said they were looking for a candidate who shared their values, while Mr. McCain did best among voters who said they wanted a candidate who says what he believes.In Georgia, Tennessee and Missouri, half or more of the Republican primary voters described themselves as evangelical or born-again Christians, and in those states Mr. Huckabee, a former Baptist preacher, got about 4 in 10 of their votes. In a number of states he split conservative and religious voters with Mr. Romney.In his speech, Mr. McCain saluted Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Romney, but gave particularly warm praise to Mr. Huckabee, whose decision to remain in the race was credited by many analysts with splitting the votes of conservatives and religious voters who might otherwise have supported Mr. Romney.“Not for the first time, he’s surprised the rest of us and proved again his exceptional skills as a campaigner, and the extraordinary commitment and determination of the people who believe so passionately in him,” Mr. McCain said of Mr. Huckabee.The voter surveys also showed that Mr. McCain was backed by those who said they were looking for an experienced candidate, and those who want a candidate who can win in November. And voters were more likely to say that Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam who has made the Iraq war his central issue, was most qualified to be commander in chief.The exit polls were conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool of television networks and The A.P.The primaries drew unusually large turnout in many states. But despite long lines, confusion among poll workers and scattered computer malfunctions, there were no reports of widespread problems as voters showed up in record numbers.The day of battles between the Romney and McCain campaigns, which do little to conceal their distaste for each other, got off to a bare-knuckled start in West Virginia. At the Republican convention there, Mr. Romney captured the lead on the first ballot but failed to get a majority. He then lost on the second ballot to Mr. Huckabee when the McCain delegates cast their lot with him.The loss was a setback for Mr. Romney, who had invested time and money in West Virginia, building an organization there, having phone banks make calls, and advertising on the radio and through the mail.The Romney campaign cried foul: its campaign manager, Beth Myers, blasted Mr. McCain and Mr. Huckabee, saying in a statement that “this is what Senator McCain’s inside Washington ways look like: he cut a back-room deal with the tax-and-spend candidate he thought could best stop Gov. Romney’s campaign of conservative change.”Asked about the statement in a hangar in San Diego, Mr. McCain smiled wryly. “You know, with all due respect, I know what it’s like to win, and I know what it’s like to lose,” he said. “I obviously prefer winning. But generally speaking, rather than blaming it on someone else, I suggest that he move on.”'"

"'08-02-07,'1','It's been a little while since I've had the honor of addressing you, and I appreciate very much your courtesy to me today. You know, we should do this more often.I hope you'll pardon my absence last year and understand that I intended no personal insult to any of you. I was merely preoccupied with the business of trying to escape the distinction of pre-season front- runner for the Republican nomination, which I'm sure some of you observed I managed to do in fairly short order.But now I again have the privilege of that distinction, and this time I would prefer to hold on to it for a little while.And I say -- I know that you were addressed earlier by a great governor, Governor Romney, and I had -- (interrupted by cheers, applause). And I say -- (interrupted by cheers, applause). May I say -- may I say that I had a phone conversation with Governor Romney.I congratulated him on running an energetic and dedicated campaign. We agreed to sit down together, and we agree the importance to unite our party.All of you who worked so hard in the support of the millions of people in our party who supported Governor Romney, I congratulate you. You did a fine job. And you are welcome to join my campaign, and it'll be a campaign based on conservative principles in a consequential election about the country's future.I'd also like to say a word about our friend Governor Huckabee, a great and fine man -- (cheers, applause) -- who has also -- I also know that he's injected from time to time some much-needed humor in the campaign. And I would like to again congratulate him as he continues to run a very strong campaign. And I congratulate him on his success Tuesday night.My friends, I'd be honored and deeply humbled to receive the nomination of my party as we continue moving forward in this campaign.My friends, I know I have a responsibility, if I am, as I hope to be, the Republican nominee for president, to unite the party and prepare for the great contest in November. And I am acutely aware that I cannot succeed in that endeavor nor can our party prevail over the challenge we will face from either Senator Clinton or Senator Obama without the support of dedicated conservatives whose convictions, creativity and energy have been indispensable to the success of our party that it has had over the last quarter century.Many of you have disagreed strongly with some positions I have taken in recent years. I understand that. I might not agree with it, but I respect it for the principled position it is. And it is my sincere hope that even if you believe I have occasionally erred in my reasoning as a fellow conservative, you will still allow that I have, in many ways important to all of us, maintained the record of a conservative. Further, I hope you will grant that I have defended many positions we share just as ardently as I have made my case for positions that have provoked your opposition.If not, thank you for the opportunity to make my case today. Thank you.I am proud to be a conservative, and I make that claim because I share with you the most basic of conservative principles: that liberty is a right conferred by our Creator, not by governments and that -- (interrupted by cheers, applause) -- and that the proper object of justice and the rule of law in our country is not to aggregate power to the state, but to protect the liberty and property of its citizens. And like you, I understand, as Edmund Burke observed, that ""whenever a separation is made between liberty and justice, neither is safe.""Well, I have long worked to help grow a public majority of support for Republican candidates and principles. I have also always believed like you in the wisdom of Ronald Reagan who wanted and warned in an address to this conference in 1975 -- he said, ""A political party cannot be all things to all people. It must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers.""I attended my first CPAC conference as the invited guest of Ronald Reagan, and long after I had returned -- not long after I had returned from overseas, when I heard him deliver his shining city upon a hill speech. I was still a naval officer then, but his words inspired and helped form my own political views, just as Ronald Reagan's defense of America's cause in Vietnam and his evident concern for American prisoners of war in that conflict inspired and were a great comfort to those of us who, in my friend Jerry Denton's (sp) words, had the honor of serving our country under difficult circumstances.I am proud, very proud to have come to public office as a foot soldier in the Reagan revolution, and if a few of my positions have raised your concern that I have forgotten my political heritage, I want to assure you I have not and I am as proud of that association today as I was then.My record in public office taken as a whole is the record of a mainstream conservative. I believe today, as I believed 25 years ago, in small government, fiscal discipline, low taxes, a strong defense, judges who inform and not make our laws, the social values that are the true source of our strength, and generally the steadfast defense of our rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- which I have defended my entire career as God-given to the born and the unborn.These are my beliefs. These are my beliefs, and you need not (sic) examine only my past votes and speeches to assure yourselves that they are my genuine convictions. You can take added comfort from the positions I have defended during this campaign. I campaigned in Iowa in opposition to agriculture subsidies. (Applause.) I campaigned in New Hampshire against big-government-mandated health care and for a free market solution to the problem of unavailable and unaffordable health care. (Applause.) I campaigned in Michigan for the tax incentives and trade policies that will create new and better jobs in that economically troubled state. I campaigned in Florida -- I campaigned in Florida against the national catastrophic insurance fund bill that passed the House of Representatives. (Applause.)And I defended my opposition to the prescription drug benefit bill that saddled Americans with yet another hugely expensive entitlement program. (Applause.) I have argued to make the Bush tax cuts permanent, to reduce the corporate tax rate and abolish the AMT, that threatens 25 million American families. (Applause.) I have defended my position on protecting our Second Amendment rights, including my votes against waiting periods, bans on the so-called assault weapons, and illegitimate lawsuits against -- targeting gun manufacturers.I have proudly defended my 24-year pro-life record. (Cheers, applause.) Throughout -- throughout this campaign, I have defended the president's grave decision to increase troop levels in Iraq -- (applause) -- to execute a long overdue counterinsurgency -- (cheers, applause) -- a long overdue counterinsurgency that has spared us the terrible calamity of losing that war.I hold these positions because I believe they were in the best interests of my party and country. Surely, I have held other positions that have not met with widespread agreement from conservatives. I won't pretend otherwise, nor would you permit me to forget it. (Laughs/laughter.)On the issue of illegal immigration, a position which -- (boos) -- which -- (cheers, applause) -- a position which obviously still provokes the outspoken opposition of many conservatives, I stood my ground, aware that my position would imperil my campaign.I respect your opposition, for I know that the vast majority of critics to the bill base their opposition in a principled defense of the rule of law. While I and other Republican supporters of the bill were genuine in our intention to restore control of our borders, we failed, for various and understandable reasons, to convince Americans that we were. I accept that. And I have pledged that it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first -- (cheers, applause) -- to secure our borders first. And only after we have achieved widespread consensus that our borders are secure would we address other aspects of the problem in a way that defends the rule of law and does not encourage another wave of illegal immigration. (Applause.)My friends, all I ask of any American conservative, moderate, independent, or enlightened Democrat, is to judge my record as a whole and accept that I am not in the habit of making promises to my country that I do not intend to keep.I hope I have proven that in my life, even to my critics. Then vote for or against me based on that record, my qualifications to the office and the direction where I plainly state I intend to lead our country. If I am so fortunate as to be the Republican nominee for president, I will offer Americans, in what will be a very challenging and spirited contest, a clearly conservative approach to governing.I will make my case -- (interrupted by cheers, applause) -- I will make my case to voters, no matter what state they reside in, in the same way. I will not obscure my positions from voters who I fear might not share them. I will stand on my convictions, my conservative convictions, and trust in the good sense of the voters and in my confidence that conservative principles still appeal to a majority of Americans -- Republicans, independents and Reagan Democrats. (Cheers, applause.)I know -- I know that you know that often elections in this country are fought within margins of small differences. This one will not be. We are arguing about hugely consequential things. Whoever the Democrat nominee is, they would govern this country in a way that will, in my opinion, take this country backward to the days when government felt empowered to take from us our freedom to decide for ourselves the course and quality of our lives; to substitute the muddled judgment of large and expanding federal bureaucracies for common sense and values of the American people; to the timidity and wishful thinking of a time when we averted our eyes from terrible threats to our security that were so plainly gathering strength abroad.It's shameful and dangerous that Senate Democrats are blocking an extension of surveillance powers that enable our intelligence and law enforcement to defend our country -- (cheers, applause) -- to defend our country against radical Islamic extremists.My friends, this election is going to be about big things, not small things.And I intend to fight as hard as I can to ensure that our principles prevail over theirs.Senator Clinton and Senator Obama want to increase the size of the federal government. I intend to reduce it. I will not -- (interrupted by cheers, applause). My friends, I will not sign a bill with earmarks in it, any earmarks in it. (Cheers, applause.) And I can assure you Senator Coburn will hold me to it. (Laughter.)I will fight for the line-item veto, and I will not permit any expansion whatsoever of the entitlement programs that are bankrupting us. I will not. I will not. On the contrary -- (interrupted by cheers, applause). On the contrary, I intend to reform those programs so that government is no longer in that habit of making promises to Americans it does not have the means to keep.Senator Clinton and Senator Obama will raise your taxes. I intend to cut them. I will start by making the Bush tax cuts permanent. (Cheers, applause.) I will cut corporate tax rates from 35 to 25 percent to keep industries and jobs in this country. (Cheers, applause.) I will end the alternate minimum tax, and I won't let a Democratic Congress raise your taxes and choke the growth of our economy.They will offer a big government solution to health care insurance coverage. I intend to address the problem with free market solutions and with respect for the freedom of individuals to make important choices for themselves. They will -- (interrupted by cheers, applause). They will appoint to the federal bench judges who are intent on achieving political changes that the American people cannot be convinced to accept through the election of their representatives.I intend to nominate judges who have proven themselves worthy of our trust, that they take as their sole responsibility the enforcement of laws made by the people's elected representatives.Judges -- judges of the character and quality of Justices Roberts and Alito, justices who can be relied upon to respect the values of the peoples whose rights, laws and property they are sworn to defend.Senator -- Senator Clinton and Senator Obama will withdraw our forces from Iraq based on an arbitrary timetable designed for the sake of political expediency and which recklessly ignores the profound human calamity and dire threats to our security that would ensue.I -- I intend to win the war and trust in the proven judgment of our commanders there, and the courage and selflessness of the Americans they have the honor to command.My friends, we share the grief over the terrible losses we've suffered in the prosecution of this war. There is no other candidate for this office who appreciates more than I do just how awful war is. But I know that the cost in lives and treasure we would incur, should we fail in Iraq, will be far greater than the heartbreaking losses we have suffered to date, and I will not allow that to happen.SEN. MCCAIN: Those senators won't recognize and seriously address the threat posed by an Iran with nuclear ambitions to our ally Israel in the region. I intend -- (applause) -- I intend to make unmistakably clear to Iran we will not permit a government that espouses the destruction of the state of Israel as its fondest wish and pledges undying enmity to the United States to possess the weapons to advance their malevolent ambitions. (Applause.)Senator Clinton and Senator Obama will concede to our critics that our own actions to defend against its threats are responsible for fomenting the terrible evil of radical Islamic extremism, and the resolve to combat it will be as flawed as their judgment. I intend --SEN. MCCAIN: I intend to defeat the threat by staying on offense and by marshalling every relevant agency of our government and our allies in the urgent necessity of defending the values, virtues and security of free people against those who despise all that is good about us.Those are but a few of the differences that will define this election. They are very significant differences, and I promise you I intend to contest these issues on conservative grounds and fight as hard as I can to defend the principles and positions we share and to keep this country safe, proud, prosperous and free.We have had a few disagreements, and none of us will pretend that we won't continue to have a few. But even in disagreement, especially in disagreement, I will seek the counsel of my fellow conservatives. If I am convinced my judgment is in error, I will correct it. And if I stand by my position even after benefit of your counsel, I hope you will not lose sight of the far more numerous occasions when we are in accord.I began my comments today to you by assuring you that we share a conception of liberty that is the bedrock of our beliefs as conservatives. As you know, I was deprived of liberty for a time in my life. And while my love of liberty is no greater than yours, you can be confident that mine is the equal of any American's.It is a deep and unwavering love. My life experiences and service to our country inform my political judgments. They are at the core my convictions. I am pro-life and an advocate for the rights of man everywhere in the world because of them, because I know that to be denied liberty is an offense to nature and nature's creator. I will never waver in that conviction. I promise you. I know in this country our liberty will not be seized in a political revolution or by a totalitarian government, but rather as Burke warned. It can be nibbled away for expedience and by parts. I am alert to that risk and will defend against it and take comfort from the knowledge that I will be encouraged in that defense by my fellow conservatives.You've heard me say before that for all my reputation as a maverick, I have only found true happiness in serving a cause greater than my self-interest. For me that cause has always been our country and the ideals that have made us great. I have been a her imperfect servant for many years, and I've made many mistakes. You can attest to that, but need not, but need not -- (laughter) -- for I know them well myself. But I love her deeply, and I will never, never tire of the honor of serving her. I cannot do that without your counsel and support, and I am grateful, very grateful that you have given me this opportunity to ask for it.Thank you, and God bless you.'"
"'08-02-07,'1','“There are some major policy hurdles that he needs to overcome,” said Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, arguing that Mr. McCain still has not “closed the sale” with social conservatives.But though still resistant to Mr. McCain, the leaders of the conservative movement are hardly ready to embrace Mr. Huckabee. A Southern Baptist minister before becoming governor of Arkansas, he won his home state, as well as Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and West Virginia, mainly by appealing to a subset of evangelical voters.“It is kind of a Southern Baptist effect,” said James L. Guth, a political scientist at Furman University who studies religion and politics.Dr. Guth noted that Mr. Huckabee appeared to excel mainly in the counties with the highest concentrations of Southern Baptists, many familiar with his career from church publications. Mr. Huckabee fared less well in counties with more diverse groups of evangelicals. Exit polls showed that he received only about a third of the vote of born-again Christians across the country — roughly on par with Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney.Mr. Huckabee campaigned with a populist message increasingly at odds with the fiscal conservative wing of his party.When President Bush agreed with House Democrats on a stimulus package centered on big tax rebates, for example, Mr. Huckabee raised the hackles of supporters of free trade by arguing that the plan in effect subsidized the Chinese manufacturers of imported consumer goods. And he argued that the money would be better spent building roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects at home, irking proponents of limited government. Such ideas about economic growth “were widely believed in Russia in the 1950s,” said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.Mr. Huckabee confounded many conservative leaders by succeeding without much support from the most visible evangelical political leaders, many of whom share their secular allies’ views on economics, and over the noisy opposition of conservative commentators and talk radio hosts. And he did it after many national pundits had written off his campaign, while he was spending a small fraction of what his rivals poured into the race.The Web site of Christianity Today, the leading evangelical journal, declared Wednesday that the election results “exposed divides between evangelical voters and their spokesmen.” It noted that Mr. McCain had won a third of born-again Christian voters who ignored criticism of Mr. McCain by influential leaders like James C. Dobson, while Mr. Huckabee had dominated evangelical voting in several Southern states “despite little official support from conservative leaders.”Meanwhile, conservatives have begun to debate whether and how Mr. McCain can energize his party’s core, beginning Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference. In his broadcast on Wednesday, the talk show host Rush Limbaugh sighed in exasperation at the idea that Mr. McCain’s “reach out” would mollify the right.“He’s not getting the conservative base in this party voting for him,” Mr. Limbaugh said. “He’s going to need that if he has any chance of winning. They may want to wipe the conservative element out of the party, but they want it back every four years for the election.”“There is a greater desire on the part of members of our party,” Mr. Limbaugh added, “to destroy certain elements of our party, than there is a unified party desire to defeat Democrats.”The editors of National Review wrote on the magazine’s Web site on Wednesday that “aside from his opposition to pork-barrel spending, there is no domestic conservative cause that McCain has taken up.” They added: “McCain can win over most conservatives, but their support is not his by right.”Another column on National Review’s Web site specifically warned him not to “spend the bulk of the speech burnishing his conservative credentials,” noting that “he has tried doing that, and a lot of conservatives are still left cold.” Instead, the column argued that conservatives would want to hear “that he will fight for conservative ideas.”Others caution that any hint of concession could appear to be pandering and jeopardize the reputation for independence that is at the heart of Mr. McCain’s appeal.“Throwing people bones is not really the John McCain style,” said Jim Dyke, a veteran Republican consultant who had worked for the Giuliani campaign. “That is not why people like him.”Mr. McCain, for his part, has already begun stepping up his efforts to remind his party’s faithful that he truly belongs among them. “I am a Republican,” he said in his victory speech on Tuesday night, repeating the phrase six times.'"
"'08-02-07,'1','“I think people are somewhere in the middle on immigration,” said Geri Byrne, the chairwoman of the Republican Party in Modoc County, a heavily agricultural area in the northeast corner of the state and one of the most conservative counties. “We don’t want amnesty, but we don’t want to close the borders, because the crops will not get picked. We want a guest worker program. That is where most of ag is on that.”In addition, voters in California, a state that is facing a multi-billion-dollar budget deficit, may be at the forefront of those across the country who say the economy is the most pressing issue.“To be honest, I think the governor’s endorsement really helped out,” said Hector Barajas, the spokesman for the California Republican Party. “He remains a very popular person in California. Also, right now the economy tends to be the big overriding issue. And whether you are Christian or not, we all have billion-dollar deficits and possible park closures, and people are worried as to what is going to happen.”Further, according to exit polls provided by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International, evangelical voters here split among Mr. McCain, Mitt Romney and, to a lesser degree, Mike Huckabee. More than half of those who identify themselves as most conservative voted for Mr. Romney, with Mr. McCain taking 21 percent and Mr. Huckabee pulling in 16 percent.“That lack of unity really opened up the possibility for a moderate to win,” said Mark DiCamillo, the director of the Field Poll in California. It was an unusual split for the state. “In virtually all the Republican primaries here over the last 20 years, the conservative candidate wins,” Mr. DiCamillo said.Among Democrats, the assured performance of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York — she took 52 percent of the vote here — demonstrated her strength among groups she has sought in other areas of the country, including women, Hispanics and Asian-Americans.According to the exit polls, African-Americans, who make up 9 percent of registered Democrats in California, constituted only 7 percent of those who voted in Tuesday’s primary, far below expectations.By comparison, Mrs. Clinton remained strong among Hispanic voters — roughly 7 out of 10 pulled the lever for her here — perhaps suggesting that her campaign’s ground game among those voters was stronger than that of Senator Barack Obama of Illinois among black voters, many of whom have enthusiastically embraced his candidacy nationwide. Twenty-nine percent of those who voted in the California Democratic primary are Hispanic, up from 16 percent in the 2004 Democratic primary.Mr. Obama’s strength in this state was among the most left-leaning Congressional districts as well as in counties like Mono County where Democrats are becoming viable for the first time in decades.Mrs. Clinton also benefited from some peculiarities in voting practices here. For instance, those who vote by mail are offered their ballots four weeks before primary day, well before Mr. Obama’s key endorsements and campaigning in the state occurred. The New York senator, whose campaign here pushed for support among early voters, enjoyed close to a 20 percentage-point advantage among them, her campaign said.“That was without question a big difference here,” Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa of Los Angeles, a Clinton supporter, said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday.Independents, who account for almost 20 percent of registered voters in California and are permitted to vote in the Democratic primary, experienced confusion and problems when they tried to vote. Many were never told that they had to mark an extra box on their ballots to be counted, and some were erroneously told that they were not allowed to vote for a Democratic candidate. This may have hurt Mr. Obama, who has fared well with independent voters elsewhere.'"
"'08-02-07,'1','PLANO, Tex. (AP) — Electronic Data Systems, the operator of corporate computer systems, said Wednesday that fourth-quarter profit fell 13 percent after the company lost a crucial customer, Verizon Communications.E.D.S. reported net income of $189 million, or 36 cents a share, in the quarter that ended Dec. 31. That was down from $217 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier.The company said adjusted earnings, excluding one-time costs, were $295 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with $254 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts, who usually exclude special items from their estimates, expected profit of 57 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial.Revenue rose 2.2 percent, to $5.83 billion; analysts forecast $5.88 billion. Revenue would have declined 3 percent without the impact of currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures.Sales in the Americas fell 8 percent, however, and operating profit in the region dropped 28 percent. The company said this was driven mostly by the loss of work for Verizon Communications, which decided to handle its own technology work. Last year, Electronic Data disclosed the early termination of the contract, which had called for E.D.S. to get $5 billion to $7 billion in revenue from 1999 through 2009.For all of 2007, E.D.S. earned $716 million, or $1.35 a share, up from $470 million, or 89 cents a share, in 2006. Revenue rose 4.1 percent, to $22.13 billion.'"
"'08-02-07,'1','One-third of the Democratic primary voters described themselves as independents, according to exit polls, and they said they voted overwhelmingly for Senator Barack Obama.Among Democrats, the state’s delegates will be divided between Mr. Obama, who won the state with 49.2 percent of the vote, and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton with 48 percent. In a state where 1.4 million votes were cast, the space between the two — some 10,400 votes, according to unofficial results — was so painfully close that a few news media outlets called the race in Mrs. Clinton’s favor on Tuesday night, only to withdraw the announcement as the night wore on.On the Republican side, all of Missouri’s delegates will go to Senator John McCain, under Republican Party rules, but the popular vote looked more like a pie split nearly in thirds.Mr. McCain, who won 33 percent of the state’s Republicans, finished about 8,500 votes in front of Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, who wound up with 31.5 percent. Not far behind was Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, with 29.3 percent.Mr. Huckabee won a wide swath of less populated counties across a large southern section of the state, generally a socially conservative region, while Mr. Romney won a number of counties, including some around Kansas City.Mr. McCain’s victory came from no region in particular, but from a wide strip of first-place finishes in counties between Kansas City and St. Louis; it did not hurt that he came in second behind Mr. Huckabee in many of the southern, most conservative counties.Republican voters in Missouri were split over what they saw as the most important issue facing the country, statewide exit polls conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool showed; 44 percent said the economy was most important, followed by the war in Iraq (20 percent), illegal immigration (18 percent) and terrorism (13 percent).Republicans who shared certain top concerns also seemed to share preferred candidates. Many who chose illegal immigration said they voted for Mr. Romney, while those who chose the war voted for Mr. McCain, and those who selected terrorism voted for Mr. Huckabee.Although Republican leaders in Missouri dismissed worries of lasting divisions, saying many voters now seemed ready to unify around Mr. McCain, some spoke of a lingering divide.“I think frankly Senator McCain will have a challenge,” said Delbert Scott, a Missouri state senator who supported Mr. Huckabee. “People may vote for him, but they won’t bring the neighbors to vote for him.”Among Democrats, Mr. Obama won overwhelming majorities in St. Louis, Kansas City and St. Louis County, as well as victories in a few other counties (like the home to the Columbia campus of the University of Missouri and that of Jefferson City, the capital).Mrs. Clinton won majorities in counties throughout the rest of the state, from the collar region outside St. Louis County to the southern edges of the state, where Republicans regularly win general elections.A majority of white voters (57 percent) supported Mrs. Clinton, the exit polls showed, while most blacks said they favored Mr. Obama (84 percent).Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, who has endorsed Mr. Obama, said she was not worried about any lasting bruises from the current split among Democrats.“I’m pretty confident that we have a lot going for us on our side in the name of unity,” Ms. McCaskill said.'"
"'08-02-07,'1','Neuroeconomics has not won many converts on Wall Street. Researchers like Mr. Knutson have yet to show how their work can be applied effectively in the markets. And some academics question whether the field is of any use in economics.“Economics is about equilibrium, and supply and demand, and forces that come to some stabilized system,” says Stephen A. Ross, the Franco Modigliani Professor of Finance and Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “It’s not about atoms or how little people behave.”Even so, the field seems to be gaining some traction. Last year Jason Zweig, who edited the 2003 edition of “The Intelligent Investor” by Benjamin Graham, wrote a 352-page book entitled “Your Money and Your Brain: How the New Science of Neuroeconomics Can Help Make Your Rich.”One of his findings was that brain images of drug addicts who are about to take another hit are indistinguishable from those of traders who are making money and about to place another trade. “That tells us pretty confidently that if you make money and make money again,” Mr. Zweig said, “it is very similar to a chemical addiction and it becomes very hard to let go.”Mr. Kerviel, 31, told prosecutors that he was thrilled when his surreptitious trades in European stock index futures began to pay off. By late December, he had made a profit of about $2 billion. “That produced a desire to continue,” Mr. Kerviel said. “There was a snowball effect.”But when the markets turned against him, Mr. Kerviel made an all-too-common mistake: He refused to cut his losses, which would balloon to more than $7 billion as the bank frantically unwound his positions on Jan. 21-22.Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize-winning psychologist, showed that individuals do not always act rationally when faced with uncertainty in decision making. When faced with losses, individuals may seek to take more risk rather than less, contrary to what traditional economic thought might suggest.“When you are threatened with extinction, you act like nothing matters,” said Andrew Lo, a professor at M.I.T. who has studied the role of emotions in trading. Mr. Kerviel, he said, is a case study in loss aversion.Mr. Lo and Dmitry V. Repin of Boston University have studied traders to determine how stress and emotions affect investment returns. They monitored traders’ vital signs like heart rate, body temperature and respiration as their subjects darted in and out of trades.The findings, while preliminary, suggest — perhaps unsurprisingly — that traders who let their emotions get the best of them tend to fare poorly in the markets. But traders who rely on logic alone don’t do that well either. The most successful ones use their emotions to their advantage without letting the feelings overwhelm them.“The best traders are the ones who have controlled emotional responses,” Mr. Lo said. “Professional athletes have the same reaction — they use emotion to psych them up, but they don’t let those emotions take them over.”Or, as Warren E. Buffett once put it, “Once you have ordinary intelligence, what you need is the temperament to control the urges that get other people into trouble in investing.”Of course most traders do not breach ethical boundaries like Mr. Kerviel, who doctored e-mail messages to hide his unauthorized trades. But unbridled ambition and the hit from the money high are a dangerous combination.People like to think that logic prevails in the financial markets, that traders and investors always act rationally. “Clearly, institutional investors want to believe it’s all scientific,” said Mark W. Yusko, president of Morgan Creek Capital Management.But Wall Street can get carried away. The Internet boom and bust were followed by an even bigger boom and bust in mortgage lending. Wall Street is now saddled with more than $100 billion in losses stemming from mortgage investments, and the economy may be sliding into recession.Alpesh Patel, principal at the Praefinium Group, an asset management company, said that when traders get too emotional, they start making bigger, more frequent trades.“You know you are damaging yourself, and there’s no gain in a financial sense, but the highs from the winning lead you to take bigger risks,” said Mr. Patel, who has written 11 books on trading psychology and risk management.Legendary Wall Street traders like Steven A. Cohen and Julian H. Robertson Jr. are students of human emotion. Mr. Cohen, who runs a $15 billion hedge fund called SAC Capital Advisors, keeps Ari Kiev, a psychiatrist, on hand to work with his legions of traders, people from SAC say. (Dr. Kiev declined to say whether he worked for Mr. Cohen’s firm.)Mr. Robertson, the founder of Tiger Management, which at its peak in 1998 managed $22 billion, turned to a psychoanalyst, Dr. Aaron Stern, to test and evaluate Tiger’s traders.Dr. Kiev, author of the forthcoming “Mastering Trading Stress: Strategies for Maximizing Performance,” said many traders, professionals and everyday investors alike, fail to manage their risks.“It is more common for people to hold onto losers and see their investment go to zero, or shorts go to the sky, than it is for them to practice good risk management and get out,” Dr. Kiev said.'"
"'08-02-07,'1','The bond insurance company MBIA said on Wednesday that it planned to sell $750 million in common stock as it tries to maintain its crucial AAA credit rating.MBIA will offer about 50.3 million shares of common stock — at about $14.91 a share — to raise the money, which it will place in reserve to cover potential future claims.Warburg Pincus, the private equity firm that has already directly invested $500 million in MBIA, will support the offering in exchange for preferred stock, covering shares not sold in the sale.MBIA also raised $1 billion through a private offering of surplus notes in January.As the number of mortgage defaults has increased, ratings agencies have worried that bonds backed by the troubled loans would also default, causing an unmanageable number of payments from bond insurers. Bond insurers pay claims when an issuer defaults.On Tuesday, Fitch Ratings warned that it might downgrade MBIA from AAA, and Standard & Poor’s placed MBIA on a negative watch last week. Other bond insurers — including Ambac Financial Group, Security Capital Assurance and the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company — have been downgraded in recent weeks.Bond insurers essentially need the AAA rating to book new business.Two investment banks, JPMorgan Securities and Lehman Brothers, are underwriting the offering.Separately, MBIA revised certain fourth-quarter charges, resulting in a $6.5 million decrease to the company’s previously announced losses of $2.3 billion.'"
"'08-02-07,'1','WASHINGTON (AP) — Worker productivity, a crucial factor in rising living standards, slowed sharply in the last quarter of 2007 while wage pressure increased.The Labor Department reported Wednesday that productivity, the amount of output for each hour of work, increased at an annual pace of 1.8 percent from October through December, down from a 6 percent pace in the July-September period. The slowdown reflected an overall weakening in economic activity.Labor costs rose by 2.1 percent, after having fallen by 1.9 percent in the third quarter and 1.1 percent in the second quarter.Still, the increase in productivity was nearly double what economists had been expecting, and the rise in labor costs was slightly less than expected.Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, said he looked for productivity to slow further in 2008, reflecting an extremely weak economy in the first half of the year.For all of 2007, productivity rose 1.6 percent, a modest increase from a 1 percent gain in 2006. Both years were well below the average annual increases of 3.2 percent from 2000 through 2004.'"
"'08-02-07,'1','Floyd M. Boring, a Secret Service agent who guarded five presidents and took part in the gunfight that foiled an attempt by Puerto Rican nationalists to assassinate President Harry S. Truman, died Friday at his home in Silver Spring, Md. He was 92.His death was confirmed by the Collins Funeral Home of Silver Spring.On the afternoon of Nov. 1, 1950, Truman was taking a nap at Blair House, where he was living while the White House, across Pennsylvania Avenue, was being renovated. Mr. Boring was stationed outside Blair House with several uniformed White House guards, while two Secret Service agents were posted inside.“It was a beautiful day, about 80 degrees outside,” Mr. Boring recalled in a 1988 interview for the Truman Library. Mr. Boring had been teasing one of the uniformed guards, Leslie Coffelt. “I was kidding him about getting a new set of glasses,” Mr. Boring said. “I wanted to find out if he had gotten the glasses to look at the girls.”Moments later, at 2:20 p.m., two men approached Blair House and opened fire with pistols, trying to shoot their way inside and assassinate Truman to further the cause of independence for Puerto Rico.Mr. Boring, drawing his .38-caliber Colt pistol, known as a Detective’s Special, fired a bullet through the hat of one of the gunmen, Oscar Collazo, grazing his scalp. Mr. Collazo was also shot in the chest, and bullets grazed his nose and an ear. He was captured at the entrance to Blair House as Mr. Boring kicked his pistol away from his side.Griselio Torresola, the other gunman, shot Mr. Coffelt, who killed him with return fire. Mr. Coffelt died of his wounds hours later. Two other White House policemen were wounded.'"
"'08-02-07,'1','PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The Cigna Corporation, a health insurer, said on Wednesday that fourth-quarter profit rose 13 percent as growth in its overseas business and in its group disability and life operations helped to offset a slight decline in health care earnings.The company also raised its 2008 earnings forecast in anticipation of strong growth in its international and group businesses.Cigna reported a profit of $263 million, or 93 cents a share, up from $232 million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding investments and special items, adjusted profit totaled 98 cents a share in the latest period.Revenue climbed to $4.46 billion from $4.21 billion a year earlier, primarily as a result of higher premiums and fees from specialty insurance and Medicare Part D.Cigna’s core health care business, which accounts for more than half of revenue, posted adjusted earnings of $170 million, a 3.4 percent decline. Premiums and fees rose 3 percent.The number of medical members rose in the quarter to 10.17 million, up 8 percent from a year ago, but it was down from 10.22 million in the third quarter.Earnings from the rest of Cigna’s operations were $107 million in adjusted profits, up by 19 percent from the previous year.

"'08-02-07,'1','Like other buzz-generating Web content, the series has attracted mainstream media movers and shakers: Greg Daniels, the executive producer of the American version of “The Office,” and Dennis Erdman, a director and producer who worked on television shows the three grew up with like “Saved by the Bell”, both sent e-mail messages to say they were fans. A pilot for CBS, with Darren Star of “Sex and the City” fame as executive producer and Mr. Erdman and Clark Peterson of “Monster” as co-executive producers, is in the works.Until now, “We Need Girlfriends” — which underscores that women are not the only ones to cultivate meaningful friendships with each other or to be emotionally pulverized by the opposite sex — has been filmed on the streets of Astoria and in Mr. Amyot and Mr. Acevedo’s humble apartment, with its mismatched furniture and walls of unframed movie posters. The three were the creative team, the body doubles and the extras. They created the series at night and on weekends when they weren’t at their day jobs. The actors worked for free.“We were sort of casting fictional versions of ourselves but, you know, we cast better looking guys than ourselves,” said Mr. Amyot, who was also having lunch at Mike’s Diner, where the three regularly convene to brainstorm and to decompress.Promoting “We Need Girlfriends” cost nothing: Mr. Tsapelas, Mr. Amyot and Mr. Acevedo made MySpace pages for Henry, Tom and Rod two months before the show went online, duping MySpace users into thinking the characters were real people and delighting them with posts about a rivalry between the abrasive, porn-watching Rod and the bespectacled, “X-Files”-revering Henry. Fans (who “skew a little bit female, but not by much,” according to Mr. Acevedo) made art collages of Rod and Henry and bought “Team Rod” and “Team Henry” T-shirts. Each character had more than 2,000 MySpace friends before the first “We Need Girlfriends” episode was uploaded.“I saw this little kid with geeky glasses on, and I thought he was really cute,” said Jessica Babyok, 20, of Beaver Falls, Pa., who presumed Henry was real.Though he turned out to be as real as Jane Austen’s Mr. Darcy, Ms. Babyok ended up liking “We Need Girlfriends” so much that she stayed up until midnight waiting for each episode to go online. “It shows you a different side of the male psyche, and they’re all really geeky and that’s awesome,” she said.“I just feel that the geeky guys have more to offer than the hotshots.”Before Mr. Tsapelas, Mr. Amyot and Mr. Acevedo were spending their days teasing out the virtues of fictional beta guys who subsist on Bagel Bites and ice pops, they were attending Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., where they met in 2000 and worked together as film majors. In general, Mr. Tsapelas (the inspiration for Henry) does the writing, Mr. Amyot (a k a Tom) directs and Mr. Acevedo (Rod) shoots and edits. After graduation they reconvened in Astoria, entered short film contests and attended small film festivals. Yet it all cost time and money, and few people ever showed up for screenings. Inspired by Comedy Central and Spike TV’s online contests, they decided that showcasing their work on the Internet would get it seen by more people and also enable them to tell a longer story. But what?“At the time we were watching ‘Entourage’ a lot,” Mr. Tsapelas said. “And ‘Entourage,’ you know, these guys go through their daily situations in life and just pick up women constantly. And for us it was like the complete opposite. Everything was a struggle.”For the first time since college, all three were single. “We broke up and I was just clueless,” said Mr. Amyot, whose three-year relationship had been the longest of the bunch. “I would have these discussions with Steve about it, about what I was feeling, how I was trying to figure it out and, like, how are we going to meet girls and all this stuff. We were just sort of living the lives that these characters are living in the show while trying to come up with an idea for a Web series.”Their college relationships had been the most momentous of their relatively young lives. “That was like the last hope, I guess,” Mr. Tsapelas said. “And then it ended, and then we were all on a life raft.” He suggested to Mr. Amyot and Mr. Acevedo the notion of creating an anti-“Entourage,” a show, essentially, “about us.”The first episode, in which Rod accuses Tom of “scamming” his “squirrel” (translation: stealing the woman he’s got his eye on), went online on Nov. 1, 2006. Eventually a few of the episodes ended up on the home page of MySpace. Last April, Episode 4, “Rod vs. Henry” (in which Rod uses Photoshop to create a picture of himself having sex with Henry’s ex), appeared on the home page of YouTube. In the episode, Rod invites every girl Henry has ever made out with (all three) to their apartment to see Henry’s collection of wrestling dolls and DVDs. Henry appropriates tricks from the movie “Home Alone” to booby-trap the apartment, in an attempt to maim Rod.“It kind of exploded after that,” Mr. Tsapelas said. Last May the three went to Los Angeles to meet industry executives who had contacted them, including Barry Blumberg (now their manager), talent agents (they signed with United Talent) and Mr. Daniels, who gave them a tour of the set of “The Office.”Two months later, the three received an e-mail message from Mr. Erdman, saying Mr. Star had expressed interest. In August they were back in Los Angeles meeting with Mr. Star and Sony Pictures TV. Two months later, they ended up pitching “We Need Girlfriends” to several networks.On a visit to Mr. Erdman’s house in Bel Air, they asked him if it was O.K. if they photographed themselves with his Emmy and Golden Globe awards. (It was.) They were about 500 feet outside of Mr. Erdman’s gate when he called Mr. Amyot’s cellphone and told them to return. The three thought they had forgotten something, but when they pulled their rental hybrid up to the gate, Mr. Erdman leaned into the car window and told them that CBS wanted “We Need Girlfriends.”Mr. Tsapelas’s first instinct was to call his mother.Now all three are supervising producers and writers on the “We Need Girlfriends” pilot, which they were working on until the night before the writers’ strike began. “It would have been probably done by Christmas,” said Mr. Tsapelas.While they don’t know when the script will be completed, they can answer another question: Do they still need girlfriends?Mr. Tsapelas has been dating a graphic designer for about a year and a half (she created the “Team Rod” and “Team Henry” shirts). Mr. Acevedo, who was trolling Facebook a few months ago, came across the profile of the first girl he ever kissed (at 14). He is now her boyfriend.As for Mr. Amyot: “I’m dating a girl,” he said sheepishly. “The girl that broke up with me that inspired ‘We Need Girlfriends.’ ”'"

"'08-02-08,'0','PARIS — Alcatel-Lucent, the telecommunications giant, predicted a loss in the current quarter on Friday after posting a big fourth-quarter loss and suspending its stock dividend.For the fourth quarter, the net loss was 2.58 billion euros ($3.8 billion), in large part because of a one-time charge. That compares with a loss of 615 million euros in the period a year earlier. Revenue, however, increased 18 percent, to 5.23 billion euros ($7.6 billion) despite earlier warnings of a rough period.The chief executive, Patricia F. Russo, predicted “somewhat of a loss” for the current quarter, given an uncertain economy and a seasonal sales decline.Alcatel-Lucent finished its first full year as a merged company with a net loss of 3.52 billion euros, or $5.1 billion, mostly on charges, and sales of 17.79 billion euros, a 2.5 percent drop.The fourth-quarter write-down came from revaluing its CDMA business, a mobile-network technology that was a major part of the portfolio that Lucent Technologies brought to the merger.'"
"'08-02-08,'0','FRANKFURT — WestLB, a German state-owned bank, said Friday that it would reduce its work force by 25 percent and receive 5 billion euros or $7.2 billion from its owners to cover losses tied to bad trades and the subprime mortgage market.Under the rescue plan, forged with banking regulators, WestLB’s owners agreed to guarantee a new off-balance-sheet unit that would house about 23 billion euros, or $33 billion, of the risky securities. The bank’s owners, the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the state’s municipal savings banks, will provide a guarantee of 5 billion euros.As part of the plan, WestLB will shed up to 1,500 jobs by 2010, about a quarter of its 5,900 staff.“Headcount reductions are always painful. But there is no alternative,” the chief executive, Alexander Stuhlmann, said. “We have to begin quickly to shape the future of WestLB and make the remaining jobs as safe as possible.”The latest bailout underscores the bank’s continuing troubles and its importance as a provider of corporate banking services in the North Rhine-Westphalia region, home for several export-oriented manufacturers.A decade ago, WestLB looked poised to break out of the mold of a stodgy public financial institution, with operations in London and New York. But it stumbled when losses mounted at its British operations, requiring a bailout. In July, its chief executive, Thomas Fischer, stepped down after a trading scandal.'"
"'08-02-08,'0','Mr. Thornton appeared to have hit a tipping point 10 days ago, when he lost the free-speech lawsuit with the city stemming from two disorderly conduct arrests at City Council meetings.Gerald Thornton, Mr. Thornton’s brother, told CNN on Friday that his brother felt that his “constitutional protections” had been violated and no other options were available to him.“My brother went to war tonight with the government,” Gerald Thornton said in an interview with a local television station after the incident. “He decided that he could no longer verbally work it out.”In another interview he said, “this was not a random rampage.”The brother said that he had no warning of the shooting, and he did not know that his brother owned a revolver. A suicide note was left behind saying ""the truth will come out in the end,"" another brother told The Associated PressThree city officials — Councilwoman Connie Karr, Councilman Mike Lynch and Public Works Director Kenneth Yost — and a police officer, Tom Ballman, were killed in the chamber. Another officer, Sgt. Bill Biggs, was killed and stripped of his gun before Mr. Thornton entered City Hall.Mayor Mike Swoboda was wounded and remains in critical condition at St. John’s Mercy Medical Center in Creve Couer, Mo. A local reporter named Todd Smith was also taken there, but was in stable condition.“We thank the officers who bravely and heroically came to the rescue of those of us in the council chambers,” Deputy Mayor Timothy E. Griffin said this morning. “This is a tragedy of untold magnitude.”Kirkwood was in mourning Friday, with flags flying at half staff at schools and prayer services and vigils planned throughout the day.One of the vigils was planned for 7 p.m. local time across the street from City Hall, bringing the mourners to the scene of the crime just 24 hours after it occurred. This time, an impromptu memorial of flowers lined the path to the entrance, which was adorned with black bunting.Outside Kirkwood’s police department, lilies, roses, daisies and an American flag were laid in remembrance of the two officers killed, along with more black bunting. Last Friday, the department received a measure of closure when the man convicted of the killing an officer in 2005 was sentenced to death.This morning, Police Chief Jack Plummer was resolute, vowing that “we will move past this.”“There’s an old phrase that says, you don’t get more than you can handle,” he said. “That’s being tested. But we’ll get through it. And we ask your help and your support. Because without that, things will not work out the way they need to.”The first of the five people killed at about 7 p.m. Thursday night, Police Sgt. William Biggs, was shot outside the building with a large-caliber revolver and then stripped of his weapon, said Tracy Panus, spokeswoman for the St. Louis County Police Department.When he got inside the building, Mr. Thornton shot and killed another police officer, police said. He then carried both guns into the council chamber, where he opened fire at the start of a council session while repeating the phrase, “Shoot the mayor,” according to a witness.The rampage ended when police officers stormed the chamber, shooting and killing Mr. Thornton, Ms. Panus said. They heard the gunfire from the police department, which is right behind City Hall.Kirkwood is a middle class community of about 27,000 people with a main street lined with shops and restaurants and many grand homes. As officers from departments from suburbs throughout the region swarmed into Kirkwood, many residents expressed disbelief and anger that such a thing could happen there.According to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which had a correspondent at the meeting, the Pledge of Allegiance had just been recited and Mr. Swoboda, the mayor, was starting the meeting when the gunman rushed inside the council chambers and opened fire. Some witnesses said they heard at least 15 gunshots. About 30 people were believed to be at the meeting, and some tried to fight off the gunman by throwing chairs.Mr. Thornton, an independent contractor, was said to have often come to council meetings and to have had repeated disagreements with Kirkwood officials.On Thursday, “He came from the back of the room,” Janet McNichols, the correspondent, told The Post-Dispatch. “He kept saying something about, ‘Shoot the mayor,’ and he just walked around shooting anybody he could.”On the newspaper’s Web site, Ms. McNichols said she had looked up to see a police officer shot in the head, then saw the gunman shooting at a public works official. “After that, I was on my stomach under the chairs,” she said. “I laid on my stomach waiting to get shot. Oh, God, it was a horror.”'"
"'08-02-08,'0','In Norfolk, Va., Mr. McCain began his first full day as the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee talking about national security and the threat posed by Iran.Mr. McCain took part in a panel discussion in this Navy town Friday morning with not one but three former secretaries of the Navy, pronouncing himself “pleased and humbled by the progress that our campaign has made” and spoke about what he often calls the transcendent challenge facing the nation in the form of Islamic terrorism.He added that he believed the central battle ground was still Iraq, though he said he was worried about Afghanistan and Pakistan — and the threat he said was posed by Iran.After the discussion ended, Mr. McCain told reporters here that he hoped to meet soon with his former rival, Mitt Romney, to work to unite the party, and acknowledged that “we have a lot of work to do to unite the party.” And he said more than once that he considered Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, a “viable candidate.”“That’s why we’re moving forward with our campaigning,” he said.Mr. McCain said that he appreciated President Bush’s remarks to the Conservative Political Action Committee Friday morning, in which he spoke about rallying around a Republican candidate. But when he was asked about whether it was an endorsement he said, with a smile, “Unless he mentioned my name...”At the panel discussion Mr. McCain seized on new reports that Iran has begun to deploy a new generation of machinery to enrich uranium, which could be used to fuel nuclear reactors or, after more processing, to produce nuclear weapons.He called it an indication of what “some of us on this panel suspected” whom he said had been “skeptical” of the recent National Intelligence Estimate which said that Iran had stopped working on a weapons design in 2003.“I continue to worry about their ambitions, which are as old as history — a Persian domination of the region,” Mr. McCain said at a panel discussion on security in a cruise terminal next to a Naval museum on the waterfront here.Flanking him were three former Navy secretaries: Senator John Warner of Virginia, John Lehman, and William Ball, as well as Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas and former Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma. Mr. Ball said that he hoped Mr. McCain would soon be “fleeting up” to a new job at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.With the Virginia primary coming up Tuesday, there were reminders about Mr. McCain’s roots in the region, and he recalled the “enormous economic contribution to the local economy” when he was based nearby at the Naval Air Station Oceana, and how he took advantage of what he called “the cultural advantages” that were “available to young Navy pilots at Virginia Beach.”Mr. Warner recalled being secretary of the Navy when Mr. McCain was a prisoner of war in Hanoi, and visiting Mr. McCain’s parents, who were stationed in Hawaii.At the conservative conference in Washington, the audience chanted “four more years,” after Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, introduced Mr. Bush, and again during his speech. It was a striking contrast to the reception Mr. McCain received from the same audience the day before, when he was jeered and booed by some.Mr. Bush referred to the Republican candidates as “good and honorable people.” But in keeping with what one adviser called “studious neutrality” during the primary — “We’re Switzerland here,” the White House counselor, Ed Gillespie said in an interview this week — Mr. Bush refrained from any explicit endorsement.Instead, he used the speech, his first to the conservative group’s annual gathering since he was a governor running for president, as a valedictory summation of his presidency and what he repeatedly called “our philosophy.”He strongly defended the parts of his record that critics and opponents view as his greatest liabilities: taxes, government spending, the handling of terrorist suspects and, especially, the war on Iraq.“There’s another philosophy, and it’s advanced by decent people who see the world differently,” Mr. Bush said of the Democrats, returning to a recurring theme of speeches that have become increasingly partisan as the national campaigns intensified.“They tend to think Washington has the answers to our problems,” he went on, “They tend to believe our country only succeeds under the expansive federal government. They tend to be suspicious of America’s exercise of global leadership — unless, of course, we get a permission slip from international organizations.”Although he has not endorsed any Republican, Mr. Bush has made it clear that he would actively campaign for a Republican successor, though his aides said in interviews this week that the White House would defer to the eventual nominee on strategy, including when and where Mr. Bush might campaign.The aides, though, said that speeches like Friday’s were an example of how he would be of use. A prominent booster from the party’s conservative core could help soothe some of the anger and bitterness from the right over Mr. McCain’s candidacy.“So with confidence in our vision and faith in our values,” Mr. Bush said, “let us go forward, fight for victory and keep the White House in 2008.”'"
"'08-02-08,'0','At Dr. Malakov’s funeral, his relatives angrily accused Dr. Borukhova of involvement in the killing.The killing angered not only the couple’s extended families but also their broader community of fellow Bukharan Jews from Uzbekistan who had settled in Queens.Investigators said that they had suspected the wife’s involvement because of the marital infighting and other factors.The killing appeared to be a contract killing and not motivated by robbery or something else, and Dr. Borukhova knew that her husband would be at the playground at the appointed time, the police said. By being there she took the role of an apparent bystander seen by witnesses in the playground, the police said.The case began to unravel when investigators said they found a homemade silencer, crudely fashioned from a bleach bottle and duct tape, hidden in leaves at the scene.That silencer revealed fingerprints matching those of Mikhail Mallayev, 50, an Uzbek immigrant who lives near Atlanta and is related by marriage to a sister of Dr. Borukhova, the police said. His prints were on file because of a 1994 fare evasion arrest in New York, the police said.In November, the police arrested Mr. Mallayev on murder charges. Investigation uncovered dozens of phone calls between him and Dr. Borukhova in the week before the shooting, though he insisted that his calls sought medical advice for his wife, according to court papers.When Mr. Mallayev was arraigned, the prosecutors said that he had been “acting in concert with another person” in the shootings, but they did not identify the second suspect. More details are expected to be released on Friday at a news conference by Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney.While Dr. Borukhova was in custody at the 112th Precinct station house, her slain husband’s relatives stood outside chanting, “Justice for Daniel.” His mother, Malaka, voiced relief at the arrest but said it did not bring back her son. “How are you going to be happy?” she said. “Where is my son, so youthful, so happy, so energetic?”Yuri Normatov, 17, a nephew of Dr. Malakov, said, “I can’t do anything about my uncle, but at least knowing the person who conspired to do this is going to be behind bars is a relief.”He said of Dr. Borukhova, “Now she’ll never see her child again.”After the killing, the daughter was placed in the care of the city’s Administration for Children’s Services. Dr. Borukhova, who works at North Shore University Hospital, protested and sought custody.Next the girl was placed with the father’s relatives, but Dr. Borukhova said her daughter had complained of being hit by a paternal grandmother. The grandmother denied it, but the girl was transferred to foster care.In Queens Family Court a week after the murder, Dr. Borukhova cried and said that her husband had abused her on her birthday, Nov. 10, 2003. “He physically abused me,” she said. “He said in order for me to stay with him, I have to clean the house with my tongue. He punched me all night. I couldn’t stand it anymore. It was the first time he started beating me up. I left.”Three days later, the slain dentist’s brother testified that after Dr. Malakov had won custody of the daughter, Dr. Borukhova’s mother had threatened the Malakovs: “You will all pay for this.”The court eventually denied custody to Dr. Borukhova, keeping the girl in foster care.'"
"'08-02-08,'0','The bond insurer MBIA raised $1 billion on Thursday by selling shares at $12.15 each in an effort to protect its AAA insurance rating.The 82.3 million shares were sold at a 14 percent discount to MBIA’s $14.20 closing price, the company said in a statement. The private equity firm Warburg Pincus bought shares worth $300 million.MBIA increased the sale from a planned $750 million, but accepted a lower price than it had anticipated.The company’s plans were announced the same week that Fitch Ratings placed the company’s AAA insurance ranking under review for a downgrading as losses increased on the type of subprime mortgage debt that MBIA guarantees.MBIA has raised about $2.5 billion since November, and it said that it would contribute most of the proceeds to its insurance company.Warburg Pincus already bought $500 million of MBIA stock this year. MBIA also sold $1 billion in surplus notes and cut its dividend by 62 percent.'"
"'08-02-08,'0','Mr. Romney did not explicitly endorse Mr. McCain in his address to the annual convention of the Conservative Political Action Conference, but for the first time in a campaign remarkable for its animosity between the two men, signaled a degree of support for him, saying he agreed with Mr. McCain on the war and on fighting terrorism.“Now, I disagree with Senator McCain on a number of issues as you know,” Mr. Romney said, as the crowd booed at the mention of the name. “But I agree with him on doing whatever it takes to be successful in Iraq.”When Mr. McCain took the stage, he reached out to conservatives in conciliatory remarks.“Many of you have disagreed strongly with some positions I have taken in recent years,” Mr. McCain told the group in an enormous, overflowing hotel ballroom, where people were held back from entering by security guards who said the raucous crowd exceeded fire code violations. “I understand that. I might not agree with it, but I respect it for the principled position it is.”Nonetheless, Mr. McCain said, “it is my sincere hope that even if you believe I have occasionally erred in my reasoning as a fellow conservative, you will still allow that I have, in many ways important to all of us, maintained the record of a conservative.”President Bush is to speak to the group on Friday and will indirectly vouch for his old rival for the 2000 Republican nomination, according to a text of his remarks released by the White House. “Soon we will have a nominee who will carry the conservative banner into this election and beyond,” Mr. Bush is to say.The mixed reception for Mr. McCain reflected the divisions within the party as it tries to chart a post-Bush ideological and political course in the face of a fired-up Democratic Party.Although Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Representative Ron Paul of Texas remain in the Republican race, Thursday’s events had the effect of placing Mr. McCain in an almost unassailable position, while Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton face the prospects of a long fight between themselves for their party’s nomination.Mr. McCain’s speech to the convention was one he had hoped to deliver Tuesday night, after voting in more than 20 primaries and caucuses across the country gave him a commanding lead.On Thursday, with Mr. Romney out, Mr. McCain, of Arizona, faced the task of generating enthusiasm for his candidacy among conservatives while at the same time beginning to reach out to independents and moderate voters who could tilt the balance in the general election.Many at the gathering responded to Mr. McCain’s speech with a mixture of resistance and resignation, indicating the magnitude of the challenge he will face if he hopes to match the palpable energy of the Democrats. As soon as Mr. Romney announced that he was ending his campaign, a few activists appeared in the hotel lobby with handmade cardboard signs saying, “Republicans Against McCain.”Paul Weyrich, chairman of the Free Congress Foundation and a founder of the conservative movement who had endorsed Mr. Romney, said he had watched Mr. McCain’s speech on television and doubted that he had convinced many on the right.“It didn’t go far enough,” Mr. Weyrich said. “I am going to write in somebody.”Others said they would vote for Mr. McCain with distaste. “I will hold my nose and pull the lever,” said Tom Lewis, a small-business owner from Saratoga Springs, N.Y., who was attending the conference.Conservatives fault Mr. McCain for what they consider a long list of transgressions: voting against a big tax cut and a Constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, championing campaign finance laws that put advertising restrictions on independent organizations, pushing an immigration overhaul that many conservatives call amnesty for illegal immigrants, and once calling certain evangelical leaders “agents of intolerance.”Mr. McCain’s plea for support reflected the Conservative Political Action Committee’s growing centrality to the Republican Party. It was founded decades ago by a small band of Barry Goldwater supporters who railed from the outside against the Republican Party of Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford.But since the election of Ronald Reagan, the group has become an increasingly central focal point for party activists, a symbol of how much the lines have blurred between the conservative movement and the Republican Party. Mr. McCain was the only Republican primary contender to skip last year’s conference. His absence earned him barbs throughout the conservative media, and his advisers have since said his decision was a mistake.In his noticeably conciliatory remarks, Mr. McCain cataloged his record, which he said included support for tax cuts, a near quarter-century opposition to abortion rights and enthusiasm for judges who “take as their sole responsibility the enforcement of laws made by the people’s elected representatives.” He reminded the group that he had defended Mr. Bush’s troop escalation in Iraq and vowed, if he became president, never to sign a bill that contains earmarks, the pet spending projects that lawmakers pursue in Congress.He did not mention his bill to overhaul the nation’s campaign finance system, which conservatives regard as an assault on free speech, but he did address his efforts last year to pass legislation that would have loosened immigration laws. Mr. McCain has since said he would secure the nation’s borders before putting some illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship, but he has not changed his basic position.“I stood my ground, aware that my position would imperil my campaign,” Mr. McCain said.He added: “While I and other Republican supporters of the bill were genuine in our intention to restore control of our borders, we failed, for various and understandable reasons, to convince Americans that we were. I accept that.”After Mr. McCain’s speech, Tom DeLay, the former Republican majority leader, said in an interview on “Hardball” on MSNBC, said he was not sure he would vote for him in the general election.“If he continues down to be the same old John McCain that used to have disdain for the conservatives, then I’m not sure who’s the most dangerous to be in the White House,” Mr. DeLay said.Mr. McCain learned from news media reports on Thursday morning that Mr. Romney was planning to drop out of the race, forcing Mr. McCain’s speechwriter, Mark Salter, to hastily rewrite the remarks he had planned for the conservative gathering.In between Mr. Romney’s 12:30 p.m. speech and Mr. McCain’s 3 p.m. remarks, Mr. McCain telephoned Mr. Romney, a McCain adviser said, to express respect and talk about the need to unite the party.Mr. McCain’s advisers are hoping for Mr. Romney’s endorsement in the coming days, as well as those from other party conservatives.'"
"'08-02-08,'0','The cost of New York City’s failure to adequately regulate the construction industry was made tragically clear again last month when a worker pouring concrete fell 42 stories to his death during work on a Trump hotel in SoHo. The city is now starting to take some overdue steps to force contractors to operate more safely. For the sake of the workers, and pedestrians below, we hope that these reforms are adopted right away.The city’s construction boom has provided important aid to the economy. But there is no excuse for the large number of construction-related deaths: a dozen last year, and 18 the year before. Concrete pouring appears to be particularly dangerous in New York. Since 2006, three concrete workers have died and another 16 were injured. When people on the ground are also threatened, it is often over poorly performed concrete work.This week, the city’s Buildings Department announced a plan for stricter regulations, beginning with a requirement that general contractors and concrete operators get licenses. Amazingly, under the current rules anyone who wants to engage in the risky business of pouring concrete on building sites high above the city has to do little more than just show up. The department also, quite properly, wants to start requiring more job site safety managers.The New York City Council, and Speaker Christine Quinn, have also taken a keen interest in construction safety and have begun to call for rules that have real enforcement teeth. The rules should be backed up with a tough process for banning contractors who violate them.It is clear that the current system of citations and fines has amounted, for some builders, to no more than the cost of doing business. A good safety record should be in a contractor’s interest. Unfortunately, it seems that reasonable care is too often forgotten in the rush to complete work and keep construction costs down.New York continually reinvents itself with new construction. That is part of its excitement and its strength. But it has to find a way to get new buildings up without putting workers, and the public, at undue risk.'"
"'08-02-08,'0','In one case, Mr. Johnson had even provided blood and hair samples to the authorities.The Innocence Project, which is based in New York, had the blood tested against semen in a rape kit last year and found a match. Lawyers at the project told the Mississippi attorney general, Jim Hood, of the match and persuaded him to take on the investigation.“If they had properly investigated the first murder, the second little girl wouldn’t have been killed,” said Vanessa Potkin, a lawyer at the Innocence Project, which has used DNA evidence to free innocent convicts around the country.Mr. Brewer, who is mildly retarded, was released on bond last fall after Mr. Allgood recused himself from the case and another district attorney, Ben Creekmore of Oxford, Miss., took over.Mr. Creekmore is preparing to file a motion dismissing all charges against Mr. Brewer, but Mr. Allgood will retain jurisdiction over any new defendant. Lawyers for the previous defendants said Mr. Johnson had confessed on videotape, but Mr. Creekmore would not confirm that, saying that prosecutors are not allowed to discuss such evidence.The two cases haunted Noxubee County, in rural east-central Mississippi, where many of the residents knew members of the large Brewer family and believed that Mr. Brewer, who had dropped out of school when his father was debilitated by diabetes, was innocent. But few realized that Mr. Johnson’s former wife lived next door to one victim and that Mr. Johnson lived near the other.In the first of the two cases, in September 1990, Courtney Smith, 3, was abducted from her home, and her body was later found in a nearby pond. Mr. Johnson was one of more than a dozen people arrested, but investigators soon focused on the mother’s boyfriend, Levon Brooks. Mr. Brooks was convicted after Courtney’s 5-year-old sister identified him in court and a bite-mark specialist, Dr. Michael West, testified that Mr. Brooks’s teeth matched bites on the victim’s body.Lawyers are preparing an emergency writ to remand the case for retrial on the strength of Mr. Johnson’s confession and are seeking Mr. Brooks’s release.Mr. Johnson has not yet been charged in the Smith case, in which no surviving DNA evidence has been found.In May 1992, a second child, Christine Jackson, 3, was taken from a shared bedroom and then found dead in a nearby creek. Mr. Johnson, who had pleaded guilty to assault in connection with an unrelated attempted rape, gave blood and hair samples to the police. At the time, however, DNA testing was not widely used and , investigators relied on blood type and bite-mark comparisons.That investigation focused on the mother’s boyfriend, in this case, Mr. Brewer. The couple had slept that night in the same room as Christine. Dr. West again testified, saying that in both cases the killers had used only their upper teeth in biting the victims. Lawyers from the Innocence Project now say the marks were caused by animals.Dr. West’s findings at trial have been contradicted by DNA evidence in at least two other cases, and he has been suspended from a professional organization.Reached by telephone on Thursday, Earnest Eichelberger, who investigated both killings as a sheriff’s deputy in Noxubee County, said Mr. Johnson had been excluded in both cases by bite-mark comparisons.Last fall Mr. Eichelberger said he was still convinced of Mr. Brewer’s involvement in the crimes, but on Thursday he said there had not been enough money to conduct a thorough investigation and defended his work.“If I hadn’t of went on and did a sexual assault kit, they wouldn’t have had what they do now,” he said.'"
"'08-02-08,'0','It was Lonn Trost, the Yankees’ chief operating officer, who noted the new costs Thursday during a news-media tour of the construction site. They will be borne by the team, not the city and the state, which are footing the bill for new parks, new garages and a new Metro-North station, and financed by borrowing beyond the $866 million in tax-exempt bonds and $64 million in taxable bonds that are financing the stadium’s construction.The team’s debt service will surely rise — and it won’t get any help from a naming rights deal. Trost said the team has rejected offers of at least $50 million a year — two and a half times what Citigroup is paying the Mets — to name the stadium for a corporation. He did not say which companies would pay such a fee.Still, even without naming-rights booty, Sal Galatioto, who runs a sports investment banking company, said the Yankees shouldn’t have much trouble finding more financing. “The Yankee name carries a lot of weight with investors,” he said. “They have a good story to tell, especially if some of the increased expenses will increase revenues.”About $150 million in higher costs are going to a fancier scoreboard than originally envisioned and enhancements to luxury suites, club suites and restaurants that went beyond the original architectural plans — all designed to produce cash.The scope of space dedicated to the wealthiest’s pursuits in suites and pampered club areas is stunning. The two-level Legends Suite Club will serve the 1,800 ticket holders who will sit closest to the field in 1,800 cushioned seats extending along the baselines from home plate. Hopefully, when ticket prices are announced, the wealthiest in their premium areas will subsidize the regular Joes.Another $60 million is to pay for security improvements that were recommended by the New York Police Department and $50 million was associated with starting construction several months late in August 2006 because of lawsuits.The stadium is starting to look like something, much like Citi Field, which is rising in Flushing beside Shea Stadium. Both ballparks are racing to be completed by April 2009.The dueling Yankee Stadiums face each other across 161st Street. The partly finished granite and limestone exterior of the new one winks at the ancient House That Ruth Built as if to say, “I’m going to be look better than you — and I’ll have wider seats.”Gate 4, at the corner of 161st Street and Jerome Avenue, gleamed in the gray chill.YANKEE STADIUM is inscribed into the stone and highlighted in gold leaf. Circular holes on either side of the inscription await the arrival of sculptured medallions of eagles that were part of the original design by Osborne Engineering.“I just ran across Ruppert’s 1924 income tax return where he started amortizing the $2 million construction cost,” Trost said. “For $2 million, we can build a seat.”Actually, arithmetic proves that the 53,000 seats will cost $22,641 each. (Cheap!)Inside, much of the steel structure is completed, and the most striking feature so far on display is a 21st-century rendition of the rooftop frieze that defined the old stadium’s design. The old one was copper and turned green through oxidation. The new frieze is made of steel, painted white and was delivered in 39 six-ton pieces.About half are in place, giving the new place its first indication of grandeur.Trost’s tour of the construction site meandered from outside (with what appears to be a much gentler grade to the seating, offering fewer steep views), to the inside, where he walked through the Yankees’ clubhouse, showers and weight room. He gestured down a corridor and said, “Torre’s office is that way.” Reminded of the transfer in power from Joe Torre to Joe Girardi, he added with a smile, “You know it’s Joe’s office.”'"
"'08-02-08,'0','CARACAS, Venezuela — The oil giant Exxon Mobil has won court orders freezing as much as $12 billion in petroleum assets controlled by Venezuela’s government in an escalation of a dispute over efforts by President Hugo Chávez to assert greater control over the country’s oil industry.Venezuela’s dollar-denominated bonds suffered their steepest drop in six months on Thursday on concerns that Mr. Chávez’s government could face a protracted legal battle with Exxon, preventing the government from raising cash through the sale of refineries abroad if the economy here slows after years of torrid growth.Investors are also increasingly concerned about the financial health of the national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, amid reports that its debt is ballooning as its output declines.The oil company is the largest single source of revenue for Mr. Chávez’s government, financing an array of social welfare projects and foreign aid to leftist allies.“This is a big blow against Venezuela,” said Pietro Pitts, an oil analyst who publishes Latin Petroleum, an industry magazine based here. “It could set an important precedent for other multinationals threatened by Venezuela’s government.”'"
"'08-02-08,'0','The lawsuit is seeking to recover the lost money as well as damages.The lawsuit filed by the two trustees of Mr. Brown’s estate, Adele J. Pope and Robert L. Buchanan Jr., both lawyers, focuses on one of the three former managers, David G. Cannon, accusing him of siphoning at least $10 million since 1999.The complaint also states that Mr. Cannon may have forged Mr. Brown’s signature to obtain a 40 percent interest in royalties from the James Brown dancing doll, an interest worth $95,000.Mr. Cannon, who was Mr. Brown’s accountant and business manager beginning around 1991, worked with Albert H. Dallas, Mr. Brown’s personal lawyer since around 1984, and Alfred A. Bradley, a former South Carolina magistrate judge. Mr. Bradley became a trustee of Mr. Brown’s will, shared power of attorney over his affairs and wrote liner notes to at least one of his albums. Both Mr. Dallas and Mr. Bradley, who along with Mr. Cannon were trustees of Mr. Brown’s estate until late last year, were named as defendants in the suit.Mr. Bradley’s involvement with Mr. Brown apparently began in 1990, when he served as Mr. Brown’s prison work-release program “sponsor.” Mr. Brown had spent 15 months in a South Carolina jail and 10 months on a work-release program after a 1988 run-in with the police that culminated in a car chase across two states.Mr. Cannon resigned in August 2007 as a trustee of Mr. Brown’s will after complaints of mismanagement from Mr. Brown’s heirs. Last November, a South Carolina state judge ordered him to repay around $350,000 to the estate, which he did. Calls to Mr. Cannon, in Barnwell, S.C., were not returned.In November, after renewed complaints, a South Carolina state judge removed Mr. Bradley and Mr. Dallas as trustees, and appointed Ms. Pope and Mr. Buchanan in their place.Calls to Mr. Dallas, in Thomson, Ga., and to Mr. Bradley, in Aiken, S.C., were not returned.The lawsuit also accuses Enterprise Bank of failing to prevent the former business managers from mismanaging funds through accounts held there. Also, the suit says that Greenberg Traurig and one of its lawyers, Joel A. Katz, worked with the three to rake in excessive fees and commissions.An official at Enterprise Bank said the bank had not seen the complaint and declined to comment.Mr. Brown earned gross revenues of around $5 million a year from concerts and touring, the complaint said. His latest will was drawn up around 2000 by H. Dewain Herring, a Columbia, S.C., lawyer who is now serving 30 years for the 2006 murder of a strip club employee.Some of Mr. Brown’s heirs hope to turn his estate in Beech Island, S.C., into a lucrative Graceland-style tourist mecca. His songs also continue to produce royalties.The bulk of Mr. Brown’s estate was held in a trust and in James Brown Enterprises, which was controlled by Mr. Cannon, according to the lawsuit.The complaint says that Mr. Cannon received an “exorbitant” fee of $4.9 million for helping Mr. Brown sell $26 million worth of “Pullman” bonds in 1999 that were based on his future royalty income. The bonds are named for a New York financier, David Pullman, who pioneered them for entertainers like David Bowie and Marvin Gaye.About $10 million of the proceeds were invested in an account at Morgan Stanley that was controlled by Mr. Cannon.That money is now largely gone, the complaint said, because Mr. Cannon siphoned it off to himself, to entities he controlled and to his fellow trustees.Lawyers for the two current trustees who sued the former business managers declined to comment on Thursday.The complaint also says that the three former business managers worked with Mr. Katz, who was Mr. Brown’s lawyer at Greenberg Traurig for about three decades, to try to refinance the bonds in 2005 through a loan from the Royal Bank of Scotland.The deal would have generated fees of at least $2.7 million for the managers and lawyer — who charged Mr. Brown from $800 to $900 an hour — but would ultimately have cost Mr. Brown around $5 million, the suit says, and was not advantageous to him. The proposal fell apart in 2006 after a lawsuit against the managers.In a written statement, Jill Perry, a spokeswoman for Greenberg Traurig, said: “James Brown never indicated to Joel Katz that he was unhappy with any legal services that Joel or our firm provided. We are confident that, when the true facts are presented, it will be clear that the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit.”Greenberg Traurig has been in the news before. From 2001 through early 2004, the law firm employed Jack Abramoff as a top Republican lobbyist and power broker in its Washington office. Mr. Abramoff is serving six years in a prison after his conviction in 2006 on fraud charges stemming from a corruption scandal.In separate legal proceedings, Tomi Rae Hynie, a former backup singer who says that she was Mr. Brown’s fourth wife when he died and is the mother of his young child, James J. Brown II, is making a claim to half of Mr. Brown’s estate.'"
"'08-02-08,'0','Mr. Gelb in a wide-ranging racketeering case in which 61 others were also charged. It was Mr. Carneglia, the indictment said, whom Mr. Gelb had arrested on a gun charge all those years ago.The news of the charges rippled through a small, yet tightknit universe of family and court personnel, some of whom have always suspected the mob.“From the very beginning we accused the Carneglia crew,” said Dennis Quirk, president of the New York State Court Officers Association, who spoke with Mr. Gelb at 8 p.m. on the night before his death. “The day after it happened, at the station house in Queens, we accused them right there.”According to Mr. Quirk, Mr. Gelb was off duty and eating at the diner when Mr. Carneglia and some associates began to hassle a waitress. He intervened and ended up arresting Mr. Carneglia when he saw that he was carrying a pistol.Mr. Gelb soon began getting death threats not to testify at Mr. Carneglia’s trial, Mr. Quirk said. When Mr. Quirk spoke to Mr. Gelb the night before his death, Mr. Gelb “said that he had gotten more death threats, and they were not going to intimidate him,” Mr. Quirk said.Mr. Gelb was only 25 on the night that he was shot, and the court officers’ union soon established an annual award for public service in his honor.The award has been given to the likes of Mayor Edward I. Koch, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Cardinal John O’Connor and Vice President Al Gore. A bronze plaque also hangs in memory of Mr. Gelb at the Brooklyn criminal courthouse at Schermerhorn Street.In one of those strange closed loops that seem to permeate the New York law enforcement world, one of the last men to have seen Mr. Gelb alive was Richard A. Brown, at the time a fledgling criminal court judge in Brooklyn and now the Queens district attorney whose office is involved in the current case.Mr. Gelb was Mr. Brown’s “bridge man,” the court officer who serves as a bridge between the bench and the lawyers, calling cases into the record and handing up files. On the night he died, Mr. Gelb escorted Mr. Brown to his car outside the courthouse, as he often did.“And that was the last I saw of him, that night he was shot and killed,” Mr. Brown said in an interview Thursday. “The case has special meaning to me. I guess what I’d tell you is that what comes around goes around.”Mr. Gelb’s sister, Emily Gelb, who is his only surviving immediate relative besides his mother, moved away from New York a year before his death. Ms. Gelb, the vice president of a large retail chain, was informed of the charges in her brother’s murder by a reporter calling for comment. She was speechless at first, then said she needed a moment and hung up.Twenty minutes later, when she called back, she said the whole thing was utterly surreal.“I’m shocked, obviously, after 32 years, but I’m very pleased that the wheels of justice are turning. The pain is still there,” she went on, her voice beginning to quake. “He was my only brother. It gets better, but it doesn’t go away.”'"
"'08-02-08,'0','“It’s a shame he decided it was best for him not to come here,” Jamie Murray told The Guardian. “It kind of affects the way we feel about him. I think from what I’ve heard he hasn’t actually said that he was injured, it was more of a preventive thing. If he really wanted to push himself, he really could have come here to play the tie.”Such absences are, of course, nothing new. The top players have been blowing hot and chilly on the Davis Cup since Jimmy Connors was in power in the 1970s. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal are much more accommodating, but neither will be involved in this weekend’s festivities.Federer has said no to the opening round for the last three years to keep his mind and body fresh for regular tournaments. He participated in the World Group playoffs in September, but he could not keep Switzerland in the top group.Nadal is following Federer’s lead by declining to play (on red clay, no less) in Spain’s first-round matchup in Peru, whose team, led by the veteran Luis Horna and not much more, is making its World Group debut.“When is enough going to be enough for them really?” McEnroe said of the International Tennis Federation, which organizes the Davis Cup. “It’s not a U.S. problem anymore. It used to be, well, it’s just the U.S. Now, it’s just about every other country except us. No Roger. No Nadal. No Murray. You think Murray’s really hurt? Give me a break.”If McEnroe sounds irritated, he is. Much more inclined toward diplomacy than his older brother John, McEnroe has gradually grown more frustrated in his eight years as captain. And he now is sounding off from the bully pulpit provided by the United States’ first Davis Cup title on his watch.“I don’t know what else to do at this stage,” he said.What McEnroe still wants, even with his cherished Cup in hand, is a format change that will allow promotion of the game’s premier team event well in advance, perhaps transforming the final into a global happening instead of a local shouting point.“Who outside Portland and Russia cared about the final? Let’s be honest,” McEnroe said.He would like to keep the home-and-away format for the early rounds each year and then have the defending champion and three other teams come together in one site, preferably in the champion’s country, for a Final Four-style extravaganza.United States Tennis Association officials met with Francesco Ricci Bitti, the I.T.F.’s president, in Melbourne during last month’s Australian Open to start a dialogue on possible changes, but were met with little encouragement.Ricci Bitti believes the Cup is in a healthy place in terms of sponsorship, appeal and participation. He is unconvinced that a format change is worth the risks of toying with an annual tradition and the passion it generates, particularly in this opening weekend when eight World Group matches are being played from Israel to Peru. He also wants someone to present him with a viable financial proposal. But McEnroe maintains that risks are in order.“Look, in the past the feeling was, we’re crying because we haven’t won it lately,” he said. “And I love Davis Cup more than anything, and I think it’s such a unique competition, and there are obviously plenty of positives right now, as we experienced ourselves last year to win it with the home crowd and all that. But it can be so much more than it is.“The best players should treat Davis Cup like it’s a Slam,” he added. “There’s got to be a way to create the right format where they will. In the current situation, I would love for Roger and Rafa to be playing, but I can certainly understand that they don’t. I’d be disappointed if my guys decided not to play, and I’ve been very lucky they continue to play. But it would be hard for me to look them in the eye if they didn’t and say, ‘You’re not doing the right thing for your country.’ ”For now and the near future, Andy Roddick, James Blake and the Bryan twins are not interested in doing anything else during Davis Cup weeks. Winning in December was one of the emotional highs of their lives, a feeling underscored when none of them went past the quarterfinals at last month’s Australian Open.“I’ve said many times that Davis Cup means a lot to me; it’s a priority in my career that hasn’t changed since last year,” Roddick said. “I guess you could say the one good thing coming out of Australia was that I had more time to prepare for this tie.”The Australian Open champion, Novak Djokovic, and the finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France will be in action this weekend. Djokovic will lead Serbia against Russia in Moscow, and in light of recent form, the Serbs deserve to be viewed as slight favorites. Tsonga, the 22-year-old whose grin is as flashy as his attacking game, will make his debut for France in Romania.The established stars might be wavering on the Davis Cup, but the game’s newest stars are eager to juggle self-interest and national interest, at least for now.'"
"'08-02-08,'0','TRENTON (AP) — Merck will pay $671 million to settle claims it overcharged government health programs for four popular drugs and gave doctors fees and gifts to induce them to prescribe its drugs, federal prosecutors and company officials said Thursday.The overcharges, dating back to the mid-1990s, involved Medicaid programs in all but one state and the District of Columbia, as well as federal health insurance programs at agencies including the Public Health Service and the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs.A nationwide investigation by federal prosecutors, prompted partly by a former Merck salesman who turned whistle-blower and a Louisiana doctor who exposed part of the suspected overcharging, resulted in two settlements announced Thursday.In Philadelphia, federal prosecutors said Merck agreed to pay $399 million and interest for improper calculation of Medicaid rebates and its marketing practices. And in New Orleans, the United States attorney’s office said the drug maker agreed to pay $250 million and interest for its rebate practices.The interest payments increase the total payout to $671 million, Merck said.The company said the settlements did not constitute an admission of any liability or wrongdoing.'"
"'08-02-08,'0','HOUSTON (Reuters) — Three former El Paso Corporation natural gas traders were convicted on Thursday of reporting false deals to manipulate gas prices from 2000 to 2002.A jury in Federal District Court convicted the men — James Brooks, Wesley C. Walton and James Patrick Phillips — of sending the publications Inside FERC and NGI false trade data to defraud the markets.The men face up to five years in prison and $250,000 fines on their convictions of one conspiracy count each, and up to five years in prison on each conviction on a false reporting or wire fraud count — 44 for Mr. Brooks, 22 for Mr. Walton and 20 for Mr. Phillips.In addition, they face up to $250,000 in fines, or twice the financial loss caused, for each wire fraud count and $500,000 in fines on the false reporting counts.“There will be an appeal. We think there are several issues,” said David Adler, who represented Mr. Phillips.Prosecutors argued that defendants’ intent was to defraud other buyers and sellers to enhance the profits of their trading operation at El Paso.'"
"'08-02-08,'0','An influx of immigrants from the Sinaloan region in recent years has made Malverde’s image increasingly visible on this side of the border, particularly in the Southwest and in California. His legend has spread among Hispanics, Dr. Creechan said, inspiring many to build altars to Malverde in their homes, as well as to wear Malverde cologne.His image, which looks suspiciously like that of Pedro Infante, the Mexican matinee idol of the 1940s, appears on T-shirts and patches sewn on jackets and backpacks. Busts of Malverde can be seen next to cash registers at restaurants, bars and discos.Manuel Simental, a Sinaloan immigrant, has an altar to Malverde in his restaurant, El Paisa, in Lynwood, Calif. It brings him good luck, Mr. Simental said. His customers leave dollar bills and loose change on the altar, which he said he collects and distributes among the poor when he visits Mexico.Five years ago, Indio Products, a manufacturer in the Los Angeles area that distributes mystical products, did not carry any Malverde merchandise. Today, it has a full line of Malverde items including candles, rosaries, trading cards, stamps, hair oils and bathroom cleaners. The company’s president, Martin Mayer, said Malverde’s popularity was spreading.“I just shipped an order of Malverde busts to Italy last week,” Mr. Mayer said. “I joked that they were probably going to the Mafia.”Malverde items are typically sold at botánicas — alternative-medicine pharmacies found in Hispanic neighborhoods that sell herbs, ointments and assorted good luck and black magic charms and potions.“People say Malverde helped me do this or that; mostly it’s people into drugs who think he’ll shield them from the police,” said Raul Gonzalez, owner of a botánica called Mystic Products in Compton, Calif. “It’s the power of the mind, you know. They believe it, so they take chances and get away with it, but they will eventually get caught.”Indeed, drug enforcement authorities in Mexico and the United States said Malverde statues, tattoos and amulets can be tip-offs to illegal activity.“We send squads out to local hotel and motel parking lots looking for cars with Malverde symbols on the windshield or hanging from the rearview mirror,” said Sgt. Rico Garcia with the narcotics division of the Houston Police Department. “It gives us a clue that something is probably going on.”Courts in California, Kansas, Nebraska and Texas have ruled that Malverde trinkets and talismans are admissible evidence in drug and money-laundering cases.“It’s not a direct indication of guilt, but it would definitely be used in combination with other things” like piles of cash, baggies and scales, said José Martinez, a special agent with the federal Drug Enforcement Agency.Last month, Cervecería Minerva, a Mexican microbrewery in the central-western state of Jalisco, introduced a beer called Malverde. Company officials said they chose Malverde’s name and image for its label because he was the most recognizable and admired figure in focus groups.“Drug smugglers drink it like holy water,” Sergeant Garcia said.Pervasive in Hispanic culture, Malverde has crossed over into mainstream television shows, movies and plays. Shrines to him were featured in a recent episode of the CBS television series “CSI” and in the 2003 movie “A Man Apart,” starring Vin Diesel.Malverde was the subject of a play called “Always and Forever” that premiered last year at the Watts Village Theater in Los Angeles. And there is a hip-hop artist who performs under the name Malverde.“The appeal of Jesús Malverde is that he was a nonconformist,” said Guillermo Avilés-Rodríguez, artistic director of the Watts Village Theater. That the Roman Catholic Church does not recognize Malverde as a saint fits his outsider image.“There’s a beauty to that, because it was the people who decided he was a saint,” Mr. Avilés-Rodríguez said. “He represents the belief, power and will of the people.”'"
"'08-02-08,'0','Tobacco could kill up to a billion people during the 21st century, as cigarette sales soar in poor and middle-income countries even as they drop in wealthier ones, says a report issued Thursday by the World Health Organization.The report, financed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s foundation, suggests a six-point program for fighting the tobacco industry’s influence.“The W.H.O. is described by the tobacco industry as its biggest enemy,” Dr. Margaret Chan, the organization’s director general, said at a news conference introducing the report. “Today we intend to enhance that reputation.”Nicknamed Mpower and based on a partly successful program for fighting drug-resistant tuberculosis, the report suggests raising cigarette taxes, banning smoking in public places, enforcing laws against giving or advertising tobacco to children, monitoring tobacco use, warning people about the dangers and offering free or inexpensive help to smokers trying to quit.The report, to which Bloomberg Philanthropies contributed $2 million, is the first to compile global data on how many smokers or tobacco chewers each country has, how much they pay in tobacco taxes, and how antismoking efforts are faring.'"
"'08-02-08,'0','To set up her first encore at Terminal 5 on Wednesday night, Cat Power relied on a simple but effective bit of stagecraft. She and her four-piece backing group, the Dirty Delta Blues Band, had just been lumbering engagingly through a tune called “Willie,” and they didn’t wait for it to finish before peeling off into the wings. Eventually the only person left onstage was Jim White, the drummer. He kept his beat going long enough for Cat Power to reappear with an armload of roses and enact a ritual of handing or tossing them, stem by stem, to her grateful fans.This scene underscored a few recent truths about Chan Marshall, who records and performs under the name Cat Power. Once a chronically erratic performer, she has developed a remarkably self-assured stage presence over the last couple of years. Since her superb last release, “The Greatest” (Matador), in 2006, she has also come to cherish the privilege of a good working band. And she now embraces the adulation of an audience that can no longer be described in cult terms.Terminal 5, on far West 56th Street, was hardly big enough to accommodate Ms. Marshall’s fans on Wednesday, though it was a good deal bigger than the music seemed to demand. Drawing from her new album, “Jukebox” (Matador), Ms. Marshall and her crew played blearily soulful covers of songs associated with Hank Williams, James Brown, Jessie Mae Hemphill and George Jackson. In a less cavernous room the results might have been haunting. The sound surely would have been better.“Jukebox” is Ms. Marshall’s salute to a clutch of singers that also includes Janis Joplin and Joni Mitchell, who didn’t figure into the show, and Billie Holiday, who did. Singing “Don’t Explain,” a song partly written (and wholly owned) by Holiday, Ms. Marshall stretched the melody into a shape that better flattered her raw-honey voice. She opted not to sing Bob Dylan’s “I Believe in You,” but did include her open letter to him, “Song to Bobby,” which doubled as a confession of influence and an act of outright emulation.The Dirty Delta Blues Band — Judah Bauer on guitar, Gregg Foreman on keyboards and Erik Paparazzi on bass, along with Mr. White — brought a hazy, humid sound to the material. Tempos slouched back or staggered ahead. There were just a few exceptions, like “Life of the Party,” which kicked into a hand-clapping overdrive, and “Lived in Bars,” which included a bluesy breakdown and a gospel accelerando.Whatever the groove, Ms. Marshall seemed physically buoyed by the efforts of the band. She spent much of the night in a playful half-crouch; a grin often lighted up her face as she shimmied across the stage. This was delightful, though it didn’t always serve the songs. It was almost a relief when the sparse accompaniment on an original like “The Moon” nudged her to rein in her exuberance. (“The moon is not only beautiful/It is so far away,” she sighed, and for that moment the sad truth of her statement was the point.)'"
"'08-02-08,'0','Mr. Gates also said that he was seeking more creative solutions to troop shortages in Afghanistan, such as asking nations to loan helicopters to those allies willing to take on combat missions. Likewise, those with restrictions on combat roles could take over fixed-site security missions — such as guarding entrances to bases — to free up troops that could take on more aggressive counterinsurgency roles.Senior aides to the defense secretary said Mr. Gates’s comments here, as well as a speech scheduled for Sunday to a security conference in Munich, were part of an administration strategy to provoke a public discussion within Europe about the importance of the Afghan mission.Mr. Gates acknowledged that his recent order to deploy an additional 3,200 marines to Afghanistan for a seven-month tour was designed for two purposes: to guarantee security gains in the south and to make a point to allies “and see if they could dig deeper and come up with more troops, as well.”At the end of his first day of talks here, Mr. Gates said he “came away from the meeting encouraged. Everybody understands the nature of the problem.”Mr. Gates also squelched early suggestions that the United States would take over command of combat operations in Southern Afghanistan, which has seen a spike in insurgent violence and drop in government control.“I don’t think that’s realistic anytime soon,” Mr. Gates said. “I have thought about the command structures from the American standpoint. I’ve decided not to make any changes.”At present, an American four-star general is in overall command of the NATO mission. Moving down the leadership chain, Americans are in command of the regional mission in the east, while a Canadian is in command of the south.NATO officials are preparing a formal mission statement describing the way ahead in Afghanistan to be publicly released in April at a NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania.The alliance’s secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, said Thursday that the NATO review — which will be written in a classified and nonclassified form — would not declare a change in NATO strategy for Afghanistan.But it is expected to describe a comprehensive political-military strategy “to answer for ourselves a number of fundamental questions — to see if we can create benchmarks answering the question: ‘How do we see NATO’s presence and NATO’s role in Afghanistan now and for a longer period?’ ”The document, looking out three to five years, will be more of a mission statement than a military campaign plan, setting goals and aspirations, NATO officials said.'"

He added, “The Russian Federation has created limitations that are not conducive to undertaking election observation.”Russia reacted angrily to the decision, but the United States signaled its approval.“We support O.D.I.H.R’s decision,” David J. Kramer, a deputy assistant secretary of state whose bureau covers Russia, said by telephone. “Countries should be accustomed to the fact that respected international organizations come in and observe and monitor their elections. Russia should not be exempt from that; it is part of developing into a normal democratic society.”Mr. Kramer and other diplomats said the conditions imposed by Russia on observers had made a full and honest assessment of the election process impossible.The limitations, diplomats have said in recent weeks, include Russia’s refusal to allow a typical set of long-term observers access to the country; these observers monitor candidate registration, news media content, the government’s use of state resources and conduct during the campaign period.Russia has also barred a much larger set of short-term observers, who typically monitor government conduct on election day, as well as voting and vote-counting. Instead, it has invited only a small mission for a limited time.As recently as 2004, Russia permitted more than 400 monitors to its elections, and allowed long-term observers to arrive several weeks before the vote.For this presidential election, which has been tightly scripted by the Kremlin and lacks a serious opposition candidate, Russia invited 70 monitors from the organization. It had said they could not begin work in the field until a few days before the election.In negotiations between the Central Election Commission in Russia and the monitors this week, Russia offered to let the observers begin their work on Feb. 20, less than two weeks before the vote.Diplomats at the monitoring organization said that Russia’s second offer was insufficient and that the monitors needed to begin work on Feb. 18 to achieve even a diminished mission.Russia refused to allow them access that early, and the negotiations broke down.Mr. Strohal, normally restrained in his public remarks, spoke in critical terms. “What is true for every election is also true for this one: transparency strengthens democracy; politics behind closed doors weakens it,” he said. “I regret this development and hope that the Russian authorities can find their way back to unimpeded cooperation with the O.D.I.H.R.”The Russian government, which still struggles to portray itself as democratic even as it has suppressed open elections, news media content and public dissent, reacted angrily.“We profoundly regret their position,” Mikhail Kamynin, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said, according to the Interfax news agency.The fight to define and portray the tilt toward autocracy in much of the former Soviet Union has played out for years. Reports of the observers’ organization have documented an array of electoral abuses and patterns, and become a detailed public archive of the mechanisms of election-rigging by the region’s many autocratic governments, including Russia’s.Since 2003, when the reports appeared to galvanize opposition movements, the Kremlin has waged a diplomatic and media campaign to subvert them.The Kremlin has also tried, so far without success, to introduce rules in the monitors’ parent organization, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, that would forbid publication of the observers’ reports.Last year, when that effort failed, Russia sharply restricted the number of observers allowed to attend the parliamentary election in December. The observers, in response, boycotted that election, saying the restrictions made a thorough assessment of the election impossible.On Thursday, another organization that monitors elections, the Parliamentary Assembly, based in Copenhagen and also part of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said it would not be sending a mission to Russia for the vote.The organization represents 55 parliaments, but Russia invited only 30 observers, its spokesman, Klas Bergman, said by telephone.“They are trying to change the rules of the game here, there is no question about it,” Mr. Bergman said.The refusal of the observers to accept Russia's terms was announced as a poll by the Public Opinion Fund found that the preponderance of Russians think that Dmitri A. Medvedev, a first deputy prime minister and the Kremlin's choice as successor to Mr. Putin, will win the election.Mr. Medvedev is now warmly and extensively covered by state-controlled television, and the Russian government has blocked any serious challengers. Mr. Strohal, speaking by telephone from Warsaw, noted that no matter what the outcome of the election, the observers could have created a record of the challenges to creating a pluralistic society in Russia.Had they been allowed to work freely, he said, they would have interviewed voters and opposition members, documented candidate registrations and observed court challenges by opposition members who believed they had been unlawfully blocked from the ballot or denied rights.'"
"'08-02-08,'0','“We have switched the portfolio,” Andrew Bonfield, Bristol-Myers’s chief financial officer, said when the write-off was announced. “As of today’s date,” he said, about 60 percent of the “cash and marketable securities is in T-bills and T-bill-related funds.”The company had treated so-called auction rate securities as short-term marketable securities, a category of assets that investors usually treat as equivalent to cash. Even though the securities were long term, there were auctions every month to set the interest rate, and to provide holders the opportunity to sell. But there are not enough buyers in the auctions these days, and some investment banks that marketed the securities are not willing to buy them back.That leaves the outstanding auction-rate securities with whoever owned them when the market closed. And it leaves companies that would like to issue such securities with one less source of available financing.The credit squeeze, which seemed brutally bad only a few months ago, is getting worse.Consider Solutia, a chemical company that filed for bankruptcy back in 2003, and got bankruptcy court approval for an exit plan just three months ago. That plan was based in part on a financing commitment for $2 billion from Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.That commitment was signed in late October, but now the banks say the market has gotten worse and they will not make the loans. Solutia sued the banks this week, trying to force them to fork over the money even if they cannot sell the loan to others, asthey had intended to do. Citigroup says the suit is without merit.Regardless of how that suit turns out, it is an indication of how much harder it has become to get financing for highly leveraged companies. In recent years, companies that ran into problems could almost always get loans to rescue them. Now they can’t. And that is before a recession hits most industries.The number of corporate bankruptcies filed by leveraged borrowers so far this year is greater than the total filed in all of 2006 and 2007, Standard & Poor’s Leveraged Commentary and Data reports.The prospect of more bankruptcy filings raises fears that some credit default swaps will not be good, because some of those who wrote them — taking a fee for guaranteeing that a company would not default — might be unable to meet their obligations.Such fears make lenders more cautious, just as they make corporate treasurers search for safety rather than the slightly higher yields that seemed so attractive only months ago. So both lenders and treasurers search for safety, and in the process increase the risk of more companies going broke.This is happening even as the Federal Reserve slashes the cost of borrowing for those with very good credit. Low interest rates are of little use to those who can’t borrow at any rate.'"
"'08-02-08,'0','Thousands of miles from the halls of Congress, Roger Clemens and Brian McNamee, a former drug distributor named Kirk Radomski will appear in a federal courtroom in San Francisco on Friday to be sentenced for his illegal activities.It is Radomski who is at the heart of the report that George J. Mitchell prepared on baseball and performance-enhancing drugs, with many of the players named in the report cited as his former clients. It is Radomski who led investigators to McNamee, and, by extension, Clemens.And it is Radomski, who in exchange for his cooperation with federal authorities and Mitchell’s investigators, is likely to receive a sentence that will call for little, if any, time in prison.The final act of the Radomski saga will be before federal prosecutors from the Northern District of California and the I.R.S. special agent Jeff Novitzky, who led the investigation into Radomski’s activities and who has become the face of the government’s efforts to fight steroid distribution across the country. And there are indications that even as the Radomski case plays out, Novitzky and the prosecutors are keeping a close eye on the continuing confrontation between Clemens and McNamee.Novitzky, because of federal laws that try to put distance between lawmakers and law enforcement, cannot participate directly in the investigative preparation for the Congressional hearing that will take place Wednesday. The hearing will deal with Clemens’s contention that McNamee lied in the Mitchell report when he said he injected the pitcher on numerous occasions with human growth hormone and steroids.'"
"'08-02-08,'0','Take Elizabeth Ross, a real estate lawyer from Wellesley, Mass., and who is, of all things, a Harvard graduate. She spends weekends in Norwich, Vt., across the river from Hanover.“Rather than buy a place on top of a mountain somewhere, we wanted a home near culture, where there were things to do,” said Ms. Ross, who enjoys the paintings at the Hood Museum at Dartmouth, films at the four-screen Nugget Theaters in Hanover and strong coffee at the Dirt Cowboy Cafe.Other days she entertains guests in her home, which she shares with her husband, Bill O’Reilly, and their two sons. Converted from a 1950s ranch-style house, the two-story Cape has four bedrooms, three and a half bathrooms and 2,900 square feet on three acres on a hill. The house cost $540,000 in 2003, Ms. Ross said and could sell for $700,000 today.Year-rounders, including Dartmouth employees, surround Ms. Ross, but the feel is more seasonal in Post Mills, Vt., on Lake Fairlee, where flat-topped hills spill down to shores rimmed with sand and, this time of year, ice.Though her four kayaks are mothballed, Barbara Keeling, a second-grade teacher who lives in Washington, doesn’t duck the Hanover region in winter. She savors the solitude that arrives after all the homes that aren’t insulated empty out for the season.Her two-story wood-frame, built in 1994, has three bedrooms, two bathrooms and 1,800 square feet. After a decade of renting lakeside houses with friends, Ms. Keeling bought the house in 2006 “as kind of a lark” for $370,000.Six miles distant, bustling Hanover is “just far enough away that it doesn’t infringe on your life all the time,” said Ms. Keeling, who nevertheless enjoys the sprawling Dartmouth Bookstore and likes that people can enroll in college-sponsored adult-education classes.“Living near a college is a tremendous advantage,” she said.Predictably, perhaps, many alumni feel the same — they like to be close to their alma mater. William Rich, another Wellesley resident, who graduated from Dartmouth in 1968, spends weekends at his 1850 farmhouse in Canaan, N.H., which is 18 miles east.With four bedrooms and 2,000 square feet, the house also has its original barn. Mr. Rich, who runs a wealth-management firm, bought the property in 1995; he declined to give the price.Dartmouth activities provide a ready source of entertainment for Mr. Rich. More rigorously, he often scales 3,155-foot Mount Cardigan in snowshoes, which he will try this season by moonlight. “We like being out here in the country,” he said. “There are a lot of evenings you can look up in the sky and see every star that exists.”Restaurant options have grown since he was an undergraduate. One favorite is the Canoe Club, whose menu includes two dozen draft brews and a roasted free-range chicken entree with mashed potatoes ($23). Sixty people were crowded in the dimly lighted dining room on a recent Saturday night, while a piano player covered Elton John.There’s plenty to do in the towns around Hanover. King Arthur Flour, in Norwich, offers baking classes. Nearby is Dan and Whit’s, a classic general store; a sign taped to the window states: “If we don’t have it, you don’t need it.” Scuffed floors lead to aisles stuffed with wool hunting caps, penknives, bananas and microbrews made in Vermont and New Hampshire.In White River Junction, Vt., a rehabbing former railroad hub, the Northern Stage theater is now presenting “The Price” by Arthur Miller. For sustenance, the theater crowd often heads to the Tip Top Cafe — in the old Tip Top Bread bakery — a soup, salad and sandwich kind of place where you can also get entrees like orange-infused honey-glazed salmon ($14.95).Lebanon, a former mill town, is rebounding, too. Its brick-faced opera house has recently been host to musical acts like Los Lobos and BeauSoleil.The region is a center for outdoor activities, and Hanover itself is a cultural hive. And Dartmouth earns good-neighbor points for letting the public use its library and gym. Skiers can also hit 30 slopes across a 968-foot vertical drop at the Dartmouth Skiway in Lyme Center, N.H., where adult day passes on weekends cost $40, and lift lines are short.Parking in downtown Hanover is at best a nuisance and at worst grueling. But Advance Transit, a local bus service, runs as far as Canaan, with free fares on all lines. Darkness falls early at the height of winter, and when mud season arrives — March to May — high boots are a must.Second-home buyers generally skip Hanover proper, where the median price for a house is $500,000, but properties can sell for up to $2 million. They prefer quieter outlying areas, where houses have more land. Houses comparable to those in Hanover cost about 10 percent less in Lyme or Thetford, Vt., and up to 20 percent less in Canaan.The median price for second homes in the region is $350,000, which can buy a two-story 20-year-old Colonial-style house with 2,500 square feet on 10 acres, according to the Northern New England Real Estate Network.Bargain hunters, though, can pick up homes for $200,000, typically A-frames on dirt roads in Strafford, Vt., that have 1,000 square feet.One of the more prestigious addresses is Orford, N.H., 17 miles up the Connecticut River, where at high elevations, vast farms offer panoramas of cloud-grazed peaks. They can sell for several million dollars, but rarely come on the market, Jane Darrach, a sales associate with Martha Diebold Real Estate, said.POPULATION 11,151, according to a 2006 estimate by the Census Bureau, including some 5,700 college students. Real estate agents say the region draws at least 4,000 seasonal residents.GETTING THERE From New York, take Interstate 95 north to Exit 48 in New Haven, then head north on I-91 for 190 miles to Exit 13.

"'08-02-08,'0','Yet Mr. Romney’s advisers acknowledged Thursday an array of tactical missteps and miscalculations. Perhaps most significantly, they conceded that they had failed to overcome doubts about Mr. Romney’s authenticity as they sought to position him as the most electable conservative in the race, a jarring contrast to his more moderate record as governor of Massachusetts. And during the January nominating contests, as his opponents attacked his shifting on issues, polls showed his favorability ratings plummeting.Mr. Romney spent more than $35 million of his own money trying to get himself elected, but his campaign faced challenges from the start, some from obstacles beyond his control.Suspicions about Mr. Romney’s Mormon faith consumed his campaign early on, only to seem to fade from view. But his advisers and outside experts agree that the unease ultimately helped pave the way for Mike Huckabee, a former Southern Baptist pastor, to emerge from the backbench of the Republican field to win the Iowa caucuses, a central, costly goal of Mr. Romney’s strategy. Then Mr. Romney’s aides failed to anticipate the collapse of Rudolph W. Giuliani’s candidacy, leaving no one to halt Senator John McCain’s resurgence among moderate Republicans and independents.“You had a Rudy Giuliani who wound up not being really competitive, and you had a candidate who emerged on the right,” said Carl Forti, the Romney campaign’s political director. “When a candidate emerged on the right and with no one to check McCain on the left, it gave him more room to grow, and we were in the middle.”But in an election cycle in which authenticity is an overriding concern among voters, the perception of Mr. Romney remaking himself into a Reagan-like figure through his positioning on issues like abortion rights and gun control exposed him to biting, often mocking attacks from his rivals, who were almost universal in their scorn of him. His fellow Republicans used the flip-flopping accusations to reframe everything he did. Even in the final hours of Mr. Romney’s candidacy, Mr. McCain was running advertising suggesting Mr. Romney had shifted radically in his view of Ronald Reagan.The authenticity issue was a problem his advisers recognized early on. As Mr. Romney was laying the groundwork for his run back in 2006, Alex Castellanos, one of the campaign’s chief media strategists, put together a 77-slide PowerPoint presentation, first reported by The Boston Globe, which listed some of Mr. Romney’s vulnerabilities, including the perception of him as an ideological panderer, as well as his Mormonism and his inexperience in military affairs.But his advisers perceived there was a gap in the field for an electable conservative and pounced on that opportunity in recasting Mr. Romney’s image. They believed that he could overcome the more moderate views he had espoused in the past as governor of Massachusetts and while running for the Senate in 1994 against Edward M. Kennedy by being up front about his most obvious change on abortion. They also spotlighted Mr. Romney’s family, arguing he lived his values and that examining his beliefs up close would reveal that his inner convictions were conservative.“Ultimately, we thought if we put everything into the crucible, people would say, ‘Wait, this guy is conservative, and he’s honest and straightforward,’ ” said Alex Gage, Mr. Romney’s director of strategy.But Mr. Gage acknowledged that in Mr. Romney’s rush to beat back the attacks questioning his conservative credentials, he may have swung too far in the other direction, ultimately taking some of the most-pronounced stands against illegal immigration and social issues.Competing against far better-known candidates, the campaign’s strategy from the beginning was to “win early and often,” backed by an unprecedented early advertising strategy that resulted in the campaign spending more than $30 million on television commercials.One of the campaign’s fears all along was that someone would outflank them on the right. Some called this imaginary candidate, “Huckafred,” a reference to Mr. Huckabee and former Senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee, who many perceived would be a savior to conservatives.Mr. Huckabee’s sudden emergence in November still caught many of his advisers by surprise, although Gentry Collins, Mr. Romney’s Iowa state director, had sounded an early alarm about him.There had been some divisions within the campaign in the fall about whether to run negative commercials or even mailings against opponents. But Mr. Romney’s advisers ultimately came to a consensus that they needed to go after Mr. Huckabee directly. The result was a blitz of “contrast” advertisements that attacked him on a range of issues.Yet even with a textbook turnout operation in Iowa, in which the campaign exceeded its targets for getting its supporters to the polls, Mr. Huckabee beat Mr. Romney handily as evangelicals turned out to vote in record-breaking numbers.It was at a meeting at a hotel conference room in Portsmouth, N.H., the following day, in which the campaign sought to rebound, that Mr. Romney blurted out the slogan the campaign would adopt for the rest of his run, that “Washington is broken.” He even began jotting down a “to-do” list of items that needed to get done in Washington.The campaign seized on the utterance, and scrambled to get banners made up for the next day. When Mr. Romney showed up at an Ask Mitt Anything forum at a school in Derry, N.H., he was flanked by the “Washington is Broken” sign that would become a staple at his events.Meanwhile, the campaign was also attacking Mr. McCain over the airwaves, something some of Mr. Romney’s advisers said afterward may not have been such a good idea, given Mr. McCain’s high favorability ratings across the board in New Hampshire.The attack advertisements paved the way for a devastating counterattack from the McCain campaign, and what many of Mr. Romney’s advisers believe was the most effective commercial of the election cycle, a negative advertisement that cited quotes from newspaper editorials to make the case that Mr. Romney was a fake.In the end, even though Mr. Romney’s aides contended he found his voice in New Hampshire, he wound up losing the state as well.Brewing behind the scenes was a rancorous dispute over advertising strategy, pitting Mr. Castellanos, who had been the quarterback of Mr. Romney’s ad team, against Stuart Stevens and Russ Schriefer, advertising men who joined the campaign in the fall from Mr. McCain’s campaign after it stalled.Mr. Romney had always relished vigorous disagreement during meetings to ensure opposing views were heard, but after New Hampshire it was Mr. Stevens and Mr. Schriefer who won out, with Mr. Castellanos largely sidelined.Mr. Romney rebounded with a convincing victory in Michigan, aided by the growing economic jitters gripping the country, which played nicely into his business background. He was also able to emphasize his personal roots in Michigan, where he was born and raised and his father, George, was a popular governor.Florida would become the site of a pivotal showdown with Mr. McCain. Mr. Romney’s advisers contend he was winning the state until Mr. McCain scored the last-minute endorsements of Senator Mel Martinez and Gov. Charlie Crist.Mr. Romney tried to shift gears again heading into the crush of states voting last Tuesday, portraying his battle with Mr. McCain as a fight for the future of the Republican Party.The campaign chose to make its stand in California, spending $1.7 million in advertising there, as well as a host of states holding caucuses or conventions, and hoped to pick off other primary states, like Georgia or Missouri.After Mr. Romney’s advisers retreated to their Boston headquarters on Tuesday night to watch the returns, the news got progressively worse as the evening wore on.Nevertheless, Mr. Romney was his usual buoyant self the next day when he showed up with his wife, Ann. He huddled with his senior advisers in a conference room, where they laid out the reality that he faced almost insurmountable odds.“We had very kind of frank discussion,” Mr. Schriefer said. “His magic number was very high, and McCain’s was very low.But there was discussion about how Mr. Romney might be able to prevent Mr. McCain from reaching the requisite number of delegates as well and take the fight all the way to the convention.Afterward, Mr. Romney delivered a rousing pep talk to his campaign staff on the first floor and left to mull over his decision.That evening, Tagg Romney, who lives on the same street as his parents, came over and the elder Romney told his son he had decided to pull out, citing the importance of uniting the party around a candidate with the nation at war.“Most of us wanted to keep battling,” Tagg Romney said.'"

"'08-02-09,'0','VIENNA (AP) — Clay has never been the favorite surface for the United States in Davis Cup play, but Andy Roddick and James Blake managed victories on it Friday, when the American team began defense of its title.Roddick was extended to five sets on what he said was a “terrible court.” Blake needed four sets to win his match, with what he said was “probably my best match ever on clay.”Their efforts gave the United States a 2-0 lead over Austria in the first round. The doubles team of Bob and Mike Bryan can clinch the best-of-five series and send the team to the quarterfinals by winning their match Saturday.“This is probably my best day as captain of the team,” said Patrick McEnroe, who added, “I was really impressed by the way the guys battled and showed their physical and mental strength under difficult circumstances.”Roddick defeated 57th-ranked Jurgen Melzer, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 6-7 (4), 6-3, on the slow indoor clay. Melzer, who was treated for a thigh injury in the fifth set, varied his game with drop shots from the baseline and charges to the net.Blake had far less trouble after the first set, beating Stefan Koubek, 5-7, 7-5, 6-2, 6-2.The United States won its record 32nd Davis Cup title in December. Austria has not won a World Group series since 1995.'"
"'08-02-09,'0','Through much of his concert at Joe’s Pub on Wednesday night, the pianist Fernando Otero used his instrument as an engine of rhythm. Repeatedly he pounded syncopations around the piano’s lower register; sometimes he created a bristling overlap of arpeggios. When he opted for a gently flowing cadence, his tenderness felt fraught with anticipation, like the quiet before a gathering storm.Mr. Otero hails from Argentina, where romance has often been cast as a kinetic pursuit. The expressive drama of tango generally animates his compositions, which also involve aspects of classical chamber music and jazz improvisation. His new album, “Pagina de Buenos Aires” (Nonesuch), could be described as a heroically ambitious tango record, with a scope that reaches beyond the usual connotations of the style.The album features Mr. Otero’s music for duo, trio, quintet and a 25-piece orchestra. None of the more elaborate arrangements figured into the picture on Wednesday, since he was performing only with the violinist Nick Danielson. But as they prove on the new album — and on “Revision,” an album of duets released on the Argentine label Epsa in 2006 — these musicians have an interplay with its own brand of heat and propulsion.Beginning with “El Circulo Rojo,” which appears on both recent albums, Mr. Danielson and Mr. Otero locked in tightly, playing a compact melody in sync and then spiraling outward to set up some counterpoint. During one passage in the piece, and on a brisk subsequent composition, there was a faint echo of the dynamic that existed between the pianist Chick Corea and the violinist Jean-Luc Ponty some 30 years ago.Mr. Danielson played with charismatic vigor, tackling parts clearly intended to tweak the conventional language of his instrument. This was felt most vividly on a solo violin concerto that Mr. Otero said he had written for his colleague. Its initial drone was punctuated by staccato plinks, produced by Mr. Danielson with the left pinkie. As the piece grew more intense, it came to feel as if the violin were yet another percussive tool. (It’s anyone’s guess what Mr. Otero has devised for the Kronos Quartet, which will give one of his newer pieces its premiere on Feb. 22 at Zankel Hall.)Near the set’s end Mr. Otero picked up a melodica to improvise a duet with Mr. Danielson, and their perambulations eventually brought them to the tango classic “La Comparsita.” It was a rewardingly playful allusion, especially since the reedy timbre of the melodica evoked an Argentine bandoneón.'"
"'08-02-09,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — Yahoo’s board of directors plans to reject Microsoft’s $44.6 billion hostile bid with a letter Monday saying the offer undervalues Yahoo, a person familiar with the matter said Saturday.The decision to reject the bid was taken following a board meeting Friday in which directors explored ways in which to respond to Microsoft’s week-old bid. The board heard presentations from Yahoo’s management and its bankers, according to people familiar with the discussions. Several people argued that the company was worth more than what Microsoft offered, this person said.The board was also presented with various options for maintaining Yahoo’s independence, including an advertising partnership with Google that could improve Yahoo’s bottom line, this person said.Lawyers at the meeting discussed the antitrust implications of a tie-up with Google, as it would extend that company’s dominance of the search advertising market, the person said. They also discussed how to press Microsoft to increase its bid.Yahoo declined to comment on Saturday. Yahoo said earlier in the week that its board was evaluating Microsoft’s offer and other alternatives.Yahoo could give an immediate lift to its revenue and profit by outsourcing its search-related ad business to Google, because Google’s advertising technology generates far more cash for every search query, on average. This option had long been recommended by some Yahoo investors and analysts, but Yahoo executives had said that search ads were an integral part of the company’s business.'"
"'08-02-09,'0','But then what? In 2009, a central quandary for the next president, particularly if it is a Democrat with healthy Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress, will be how aggressively to push an agenda that calls for greater government spending and higher taxes.In advancing those goals, the sense that the economy is doing poorly cuts both ways. It adds to the crisis atmosphere that encourages an activist government. But it also tends to make middle-class voters want to protect themselves and wary of being asked to dip into their pockets to finance programs for those in need.And the Republicans are likely to take aim at Democrats over rolling back the Bush tax cuts and suggesting some wholesale tax increases, like Senator Barack Obama’s plan to make more income subject to Social Security taxes.“It puts Democrats in a bit of a political bind,” said Stephen Rose, a moderate Democratic economist who has challenged some of the conventional wisdom on the left about the reasons behind the increasing anxiety of the middle class.“An economic downturn should be a natural environment for supporting a bigger safety net,” Mr. Rose explained, “but a lot of middle-class voters are also concerned about not wanting to pay more taxes. And people don’t feel as much solidarity with people below them when they are feeling bad about their own economic prospects as well.”With the stimulus package that Congress just passed, it is clear that Democrats, while determined to spread the largesse as broadly as possible, are particularly focused on appealing to middle-class voters.“We are making history,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said after the bill was approved by lawmakers on Thursday evening. “What has passed the Congress in record time is a gift to the middle class and those who aspire to it in our country.”In his 2005 book, “The Moral Consequencs of Economic Growth,” Benjamin Friedman, an economics professor at Harvard, makes the case that strong economic growth fosters less fear of immigrants and more generous support for public education and the disadvantaged. Economic stagnation, by contrast, leads to insecurity that encourages a retreat from progressive social policies.Mr. Friedman, in a telephone interview, notes that incomes for the majority of American households, adjusted for inflation, have slipped despite the overall growth of this decade. While a recession is a relatively short-term event, Mr. Friedman adds, it is likely “to focus people’s minds on a stagnation that has been under way throughout the decade.”Democratic politicians and policy activists have made much of the erosion of middle class incomes and hope to use it to their advantage in this year’s election. But they have to be careful to avoid leaving the public with the impression that the economy is in such bad shape that the best that can be done is to hunker down for hard times.“A lot will depend on how any recession plays out,” said Jason Furman, director of the moderately-liberal Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “If it has blown over by 2009, most of this is irrelevant.”But even if the recession ends relatively quickly, a just-released study by John Schmitt and Dean Baker of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research that looked at the three most recent downturns — in the early 1980s, the early 90s and in 2001 — suggests that the economic pain is likely to linger well beyond the formal end of any recession.“Based on the historical pattern,” the study concluded, “the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed would continue to increase through 2010 (to 6.7 percent in the case of a mild-to-moderate recession) or 2011 (to 8.4 percent in the case of a more severe economic downturn.)”Despite his worries about the economy, though, Mr. Baker remains hopeful that the next President will be up to the challenge.“It’s going to take a skillful politician to navigate through these troubled economic waters,” Mr. Baker said. “But whoever wins this election is going to have proved himself or herself to be a very skillful politician, indeed.”'"
"'08-02-09,'0','“I have nothing else to do,” he added with a smile.Mr. Huckabee did not mention Mr. McCain by name in his speech but sought to draw an implicit contrast by underscoring his commitments to social conservative issues. Among other things, he called for the impeachment of judges who cite international law — a group that includes members of the United States Supreme Court.In a nod to the fact that there are still some convention delegates to be chosen, Mr. McCain’s campaign strongly hinted that Mr. Huckabee could win in the Kansas caucuses Saturday, noting the state’s many evangelical voters and the McCain campaign’s weakness in caucus states up to now. The campaign is still embracing the mantle of overall front-runner.Speculation about why Mr. Huckabee remains in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, though his chances are slim, has settled recently on the notion that he wants to be Mr. McCain’s vice presidential running mate.At a news conference after his speech Saturday, Mr. Huckabee confirmed that “a McCain-Huckabee ticket” has already been achieved.“My wife’s maiden name is McCain,” he said with the raised eyebrow and mischievous grin that have done much of the heavy-lifting in his enduring, if unlikely, candidacy so far.Janet McCain of Hope, Ark., married Mike Huckabee, a classmate at Hope High School, in 1974, when she was 19. Beyond that precedent, however, Mr. Huckabee said there were no other plans for a McCain-Huckabee union. “I’m not having any illusions that Senator McCain would seek me out as a running mate,” he saidOn Friday in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference here, President Bush sought to unify the Republican Party and focus on the general election.Mr. Bush did not mention Mr. McCain by name. But he said that “soon we will have a nominee who will carry the conservative banner into this election and beyond,” in what was widely interpreted as a message of reassurance about Mr. McCain, whose relationship with Mr. Bush has been strained in the past, and who faces misgivings from the Republican right.As the party began to coalesce around Mr. McCain, Mr. Bush’s remarks were part of a broader Republican move over the last day and a half that has set the stage for a campaign focused on the nation’s security.Beginning with Mitt Romney, who withdrew from the race on Thursday, warning that he would not abet “the surrender to terror,” Republicans, including Mr. McCain and Vice President Dick Cheney, have warned darkly that the Democrats were ill-suited and ill-equipped to protect the nation, the same theme that Mr. Bush struck in his successful 2004 re-election campaign.On the first day as the likely nominee, a status he achieved when Mr. Romney withdrew, Mr. McCain on Friday turned his attacks toward the two Democratic candidates, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, not his remaining major Republican challenger, Mr. Huckabee.“I guarantee you this: If we had announced a date for withdrawal from Iraq and withdrawn troops the way that Senator Obama and Senator Clinton want to do, Al Qaeda would be celebrating that they had defeated the United States of America and that we surrendered,” Mr. McCain said at a rally in Wichita. “I will never surrender.”For Mr. Bush, Friday’s speech presaged a role his aides said he would play all year: using the power of the presidency to shape the agenda, defend his own record and attack his Democratic critics on national security as relentlessly as he has since the 2002 midterm election.“Listen, the stakes in November are high,” Mr. Bush told the boisterous audience in Washington. “This is an important election. Prosperity and peace are in the balance.” Some of Mr. Bush’s closest associates have already begun officially to fall in behind the McCain campaign.Ken Mehlman, a former political director under Mr. Bush who managed his re-election campaign and went on to lead the Republican National Committee, announced his endorsement of Mr. McCain on Thursday evening. Mr. Bush’s political guru, Karl Rove, said on Friday that he had contributed $2,300 to the senator’s campaign, confirming a report first published by Time magazine’s blog, The Page.Mr. Bush himself refrained from any explicit endorsement of Mr. McCain on Monday, in keeping with what one adviser called “studious neutrality” during the Republican primaries and caucuses. (“We’re Switzerland here,” the White House counselor, Ed Gillespie, said in an interview.) But Mr. Bush did refer to the Republican candidates as “good and honorable people,” and made clear that he would vigorously campaign for the ultimate nominee.A White House spokesman, Scott M. Stanzel, said it remained premature to discuss a presidential endorsement, despite Mr. Romney’s withdrawal.“That gets us one step closer to having a nominee,” he said, traveling with Mr. Bush to Tennessee, where he toured cities damaged this week by tornadoes, “but we’re not there yet.”Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain were bitter rivals for the Republican nomination in 2000, and Mr. McCain has at times infuriated the White House by parting company with Mr. Bush, notably with his refusal to support the president’s first round of tax cuts in 2001.But Mr. McCain actively campaigned for Mr. Bush in 2004. When it came to the 2008 campaign, many of Mr. Bush’s top contributors and advisers dispersed to support other Republicans in the primary season, but most are expected to regroup behind Senator McCain.Mr. Bush’s speech, his first to the annual conservative gathering since he was a governor running for president in 2000, amounted to a valedictory summation of his presidency and a full-throated articulation of what he repeatedly called “our philosophy” — on everything from taxes to Supreme Court nominees.Although deeply unpopular, with an approval rating at historic lows below 30 percent, Mr. Bush still enjoys strong support among conservatives like those who gathered to hear him speak on Friday.“Four more years,” the audience chanted after Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, introduced him, and again during his speech. The crowd roared, too, when Mr. Bush declared Mr. Cheney “the best vice president in history” — and joked that “Mother may have a different opinion,” since his father served as vice president for two terms under Ronald Reagan.It was a striking contrast to the reception that Mr. McCain received from the same audience the day before, when he was jeered and booed by some.Mr. Bush strongly defended the parts of his record that critics and opponents view as his greatest liabilities: taxes, government spending, the handling of terrorist suspects and, especially, the war on Iraq.“There’s another philosophy, and it’s advanced by decent people who see the world differently,” Mr. Bush said of the Democrats, returning to a refrain of speeches that have become increasingly partisan as the national campaigns intensified late last year.“They tend to think Washington has the answers to our problems,” he went on. “They tend to believe our country only succeeds under the expansive federal government. They tend to be suspicious of America’s exercise of global leadership — unless, of course, we get a permission slip from international organizations.”Mr. Cheney joined the assault on Friday at a Republican Party fund-raiser in Harrisburg, Pa., saying: “The important thing for all of us to remember is that six and a half years after 9/11, the war on terror is still very real, that it will not be won on the defensive, and that we have to proceed on many fronts at the same time.” Mr. Bush’s role in the coming campaign remains unclear.But they said that speeches like Friday’s were an example of how he would be of use in a general campaign, especially with the party’s conservative base.A prominent booster from the party’s conservative core could help soothe some of the anger and bitterness from the right over Mr. McCain’s candidacy, even as Mr. McCain reaches out to independents and others in the political center.Mr. McCain also appeared to be looking ahead, though he emphasized more than once that Mr. Huckabee remained a viable candidate. In Norfolk, Va., a Navy town where he served as a young man, he allowed himself to muse out loud about his thinking about a potential running mate. He said he thought regional considerations no longer played the role they once did.“The fundamental principle behind any selection of a running mate would be whether that person is fully prepared to take over, and shares your values, your principles, your philosophy and your priorities,” he said.Mr. McCain acknowledged that he needed to work to unify the party, and the issues of national security and taxes appeared to be the means of doing that. He said that he had spoken to Mr. Romney and also another erstwhile rival, Fred D. Thompson, who, he said, pledged “to do whatever it takes to help me win.”“We also understand that once the dust settles, then we all join together,” he said in Wichita, appearing beside Senator Sam Brownback, another conservative former rival for the nomination, because “we all know what will happen to the United States of America if the wrong party wins in November.”'"
"'08-02-09,'0','A few seconds would have been sufficient Friday. The game turned for good on one play, in the final seconds of regulation, with the Knicks clinging to an 88-85 lead. Manu Ginóbili received an inbounds pass, dribbled around the perimeter to the baseline, then zipped a perfect pass to Michael Finley in the right corner. Finley drained the 3-pointer with four-tenths of a second left.Finley was open because Renaldo Balkman was drawn toward the paint on Ginóbili’s drive. (“He’s learning,” Thomas said of Balkman.) The Knicks could have also fouled Ginóbili inside the arc before he got a chance to pass. The play perfectly contrasted the two teams.“For me it was like it was in slow motion,” Jamal Crawford said. “I was like, Please, please. Our luck, it went in. That’s been our story the last eight games.”The Knicks had one chance to avoid overtime, but Crawford could not get a shot off in time after receiving the inbounds pass.The Spurs scored the first 7 points of overtime while the Knicks missed their first seven shots of the period. Crawford finally broke the drought with a running jumper with 29.5 seconds left, but the Knicks never threatened to take the lead.The evening ended with the obligatory boos and “Fire Isiah” chants as the Knicks (14-36) fell to a season-worst 22 games under .500.Tim Duncan overcame a slow start to lead the Spurs with 21 points and 14 rebounds. Ginóbili added 20 points. Crawford led the Knicks with 24 points and 8 assists. Zach Randolph had 13 points but went 4 for 17 from the field, missing all four shots he took in overtime.Randolph said the Knicks’ late scoring drought was caused in part because they failed to get the ball inside.“Definitely,” he said, adding that there were “no shots in the paint really, or penetration to the paint; that’s one of the reasons why we were 2 for 17.”Finley’s 3-pointer completed the Spurs’ second big comeback of the second half. They wiped out an 18-point deficit in the third quarter and came back from 9 points down in the final six minutes of the fourth.This has been a rough stretch for the Spurs and their title defense aspirations. The Lakers acquired Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies on Feb. 1, making them instant contenders in the West. O’Neal joined the Phoenix Suns five days later, in a trade from the Miami Heat. The Golden State Warriors also added some size recently, signing Chris Webber.It would appear that everyone in the West is loading up to take down the Spurs — and specifically Duncan.“You can say that,” said Robert Horry before the game, although he and his teammates do not really buy the story line. “I just think people are trying to get better. I don’t think they really worry about us. If you look at last year, Tim wasn’t even the M.V.P. Tony was,” he said, referring to point guard Tony Parker, who missed Friday’s game because of an ankle injury.Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich called the trades by the Lakers and Suns “two great moves” — particularly the acquisition of Gasol by the Lakers. But Popovich, whose team has won four titles in nine seasons, also shrugged off the idea that the Spurs inspired the deals.“I don’t think anybody really has ever feared us,” he said. “I don’t think anybody expected us to win a championship last year.”Quentin Richardson, hobbled for five days by a sprained right ankle, declared himself probable for Saturday night’s game in Milwaukee. Richardson injured the ankle in the second quarter of Monday’s loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. ... Nate Robinson did not travel with the team after Friday’s game and is not expected to join the Knicks in Milwaukee. ... The rookie Wilson Chandler made his first N.B.A. start, in place of Richardson. But he was shaky and finished with 2 points in 10 minutes.'"

"'08-02-09,'0','Mr. Mallayev, who was arrested in November, pleaded not guilty to murder charges in January. At that time, Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said he was “acting in concert with another person” when he shot Dr. Malakov twice in the chest.On Thursday night, Dr. Borukhova was arrested at her home in Queens. The arrest followed painstaking work by investigators, who had suspected her involvement because of marital infighting and other factors.The scene in court on Friday provided a glimpse into a killing that has angered not only the couple’s extended families, already at odds over a custody battle, but also their broader community of fellow Bukharan Jews from Uzbekistan who have settled in Queens.Dr. Borukhova showed no emotion in the courtroom. Behind her, members of the two families sat on opposite sides of the gallery. On the left sat her sisters and members of her extended family. On the right, the family of her estranged husband.She did not look directly at her husband’s relatives and listened to the proceedings without any visible signs of discomfort or emotion as the assistant district attorney, Brad A. Leventhal, described her as the main player in a contract-murder plot.Mr. Leventhal said Dr. Borukhova wanted to have Dr. Malakov killed after she lost custody of their daughter, Michelle, in a bitter court battle.As the plan to kill him took root, she and Mr. Mallayev spoke by telephone 91 times. According to the indictment, the calls took place from Oct. 3, 2007, through Oct. 26, 2007.According to the indictment, Dr. Borukhova arranged to meet Dr. Malakov near a playground in Rego Park on Oct. 28. Dr. Malakov had intended to meet her on an arranged visit with Michelle, 4, who was present when her father was killed. Mr. Mallayev, 50, fatally shot Dr. Malakov, using a gun with a makeshift silencer, according to the indictment.A few days after the shooting, the two defendants spoke again twice by telephone and then met at the Rego Park office of Dr. Borukhova, who is an internist, officials said. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said that Dr. Borukhova had told detectives that she was not related to Mr. Mallayev. But Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Mallayev’s wife was a cousin of Dr. Borukhova’s father. He also said that Mr. Mallayev had referred to Dr. Borukhova as his niece.“They clearly knew each other,” he said.On Nov. 8, Mr. Mallayev deposited $19,800 in 10 bank accounts, the indictment said.“The evidence in this case is overwhelming,” Mr. Leventhal said in court.The telephone exchanges are a central piece of evidence, prosecutors said. Some of Dr. Malakov’s relatives twisted in their seats and loudly scoffed when Dr. Borukhova’s lawyer Stephen Scaring explained the calls by saying that Mr. Mallayev was a patient of Dr. Borukhova’s.Mr. Brown declined to give further details, except to say, “I don’t call my doctor 90 times in the course of the two weeks before I see him.”Mr. Brown also said that the investigation was continuing.Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Mallayev’s fingerprints were lifted from duct tape that had been used to attach the silencer, a piece of a plastic bottle, to the gun. Detectives then matched the prints to those taken after an arrest in 1994, when Mr. Mallayev was accused of subway fare evasion. He was extradited to New York from Georgia.Mr. Kelly said that when she was first interviewed by investigators, Dr. Borukhova said that she did not hear anything when her husband was killed, a statement that immediately led investigators to suspect her.After the arraignment, Dr. Borukhova was led away.She turned and nodded to her sisters. On the other side, Dr. Malakov’s relatives spoke with one another in Russian and broken English.Mr. Scaring said afterward that the case had “highly circumstantial evidence.”“The case is pure speculation and no evidence,” he said. “She is stunned. She doesn’t understand how any of this could be happening.”“Given the weakness of the case, I thought she would be out on bail right now,” he said. “But she’s very tough, and she is going to fight it.”Outside the court, Hanna Lushiyeva, an aunt of Dr. Malakov’s, said that she had suspected Dr. Borukhova. “When I heard the first time from my sister that he was killed I said: ‘Ah! His wife got him. His wife is involved.’ ”'"
"'08-02-09,'0','But a merger would also allow Microsoft to adapt its empire to compete in a world of low-cost Internet-centered software.Yahoo’s huge user base could provide the audience and the infrastructure for Microsoft to change how it distributes its products and charges for them.“Microsoft makes its money selling licenses to millions and millions of people who install it on individual hard drives,” said Nicholas Carr, a former editor at The Harvard Business Review and author of “The Big Switch,” a book about the transition to what the technology industry calls cloud computing.“Most of what you need is on the Internet — and it’s free,” he said. “There are early warning signs that the traditional Microsoft programs are losing their grip.”Certainly, analysts said, Microsoft’s revenue — $51 billion last year, most of it from software — is not yet suffering in any meaningful way.The company said, to the contrary, that business is booming, and that Microsoft Office, a flagship product, is having a record-breaking year.“Last year was our best year, and this year is better,” said Chris Capossela, a Microsoft vice president with the Office division.At the same time, though, the company has lowered prices. Last year it began selling its $120 student-teacher edition to mainstream consumers, who had been asked to pay more than $300 for a similar product.The bulk of the company’s profit comes from selling to corporations, which unlike consumers may be slower to adapt to a system in which proprietary data is not stored in corporate-owned data centers.Microsoft said that corporate customers prefer using software that they are familiar with and that provides more functions and better security.But the corporate business, too, is coming under increasing assault from lower-cost Internet competitors, including Microsoft’s archnemesis, Google.On Thursday, Google took its attack to a new level. It released Google Apps Team Edition — a version of its productivity software that includes word processing, spreadsheet and calendar programs. In a form of guerrilla marketing, the fans of Google Docs can take it into the office, bypassing or perhaps influencing decisions made by corporate executives, who until now have overwhelmingly bought Microsoft software.Google, while it gives such software free to consumers, charges corporations for a premium edition, though the fee is less than what Microsoft charges for productivity software, analysts said.The change is coming not from corporations but on the computers of a growing base of individuals who increasingly expect their software to be free — and for it to be processed and managed over the Internet.Kevin Twohy, 20, a mathematics student at U.C.L.A., uses a free service on Facebook to store and share photos, a program called Picnik to edit the images, and Gmail.For his English class last semester, he wrote a term paper about William Blake using Google’s free word processing software, even though Microsoft Office had come loaded on his personal computer.The advantage of the Google program, he said, was that it allowed him to keep his information on Google’s servers so that it was accessible at any computer, whether he was working at his fraternity, a coffee shop, a campus computer bank or the library. The experience, he said, has persuaded him not to pay money for software.“I don’t ever see myself buying a copy of Office,” he said.Those individual users may be able to do what an army of lawyers and regulators in the United States and Europe have never been able to do — rein in Microsoft’s monopoly power. There is some evidence that the erosion in its pricing power has already begun.Last fall, Microsoft lowered prices of its most powerful productivity software for students, whom it regards as important future customers. For a limited time, it said, students could buy a $60 downloadable version of its most feature-rich version of Office, which ordinarily costs around $460.Microsoft has also had ad-supported online competitors who have challenged other prominent brands, like the Encarta encyclopedia and Microsoft Money, personal finance management software.“If Microsoft had to start over today, it wouldn’t even think about charging money for its software,” said Yun Kim, an industry analyst with Pacific Growth Equities. “Nobody in their right mind is developing a business in the consumer market to charge” for software.Mr. Kim said that he expected Microsoft at some point to introduce a free ad-supported version of Office for consumers, though the company insists that it has no such intention.Mr. Kim, however, expects that Microsoft’s corporate business is more entrenched and resilient, and less susceptible to the influences of free or ad-supported cloud computing.Microsoft’s online competitors disagree. Among them is Zimbra, a division of Yahoo that offers Internet-centered productivity software for e-mail, word processing and spreadsheets.Consumers pay nothing for the product, but corporations pay as much as $50 a year per license. About 20,000 companies, most of them small, are paying customers.For Office software, Microsoft charges $75 a year per license to large companies, and up to $300 for small companies, according to Forrester Research.Satish Dharmaraj, general manager of Zimbra, said the company could undercut Microsoft because it costs far less to create, maintain, fix and upgrade software that runs in a central data center instead of on thousands of individual computers.But the relative quality of Microsoft’s software continues to attract customers, argued J. P. Gownder, an industry analyst with Forrester Research.He said that Microsoft has an opportunity to develop a hybrid version of its software that combines the convenience of cloud computing with the security of processing on the desktop, thus helping it maintain and further its empire.“This is the predominant reason why Microsoft has gone after Yahoo,” Mr. Gownder said. “The ad revenue is a nice short-term achievement, but in the long run it is much more about delivering apps over the Web.”'"
"'08-02-09,'0','FRANKFURT — WestLB, a state-owned German bank, said Friday that it would reduce its work force by 25 percent and receive 5 billion euros ($7.2 billion) from its owners to cover losses tied to bad trades and the subprime mortgage market.Under the rescue plan, forged with banking regulators, WestLB’s owners agreed to guarantee a new off-balance-sheet unit that would house about 23 billion euros ($33 billion) of the risky securities. The bank’s owners, the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the state’s municipal savings banks, will provide a guarantee of 5 billion euros.Under the plan, WestLB will shed up to 1,500 jobs by 2010, about a quarter of its staff,“Head-count reductions are always painful,” the chief executive, Alexander Stuhlmann, said, “but there is no alternative. We have to begin quickly to shape the future of WestLB and make the remaining jobs as safe as possible.”The latest cash infusion underscores the bank’s troubles and its importance as a provider of corporate banking services in the North Rhine-Westphalia region, home to several export-oriented manufacturers.A decade ago, WestLB looked poised to break out of the mold of a stodgy public financial institution, with operations in London and New York. But it stumbled when losses mounted at its British operations, requiring a bailout. In July, its chief executive, Thomas R. Fischer, stepped down after a trading scandal.Now, losses linked to American mortgages are likely to cost the bank its independence.WestLB has been in merger talks for several months with Helaba, a state-owned bank based in Frankfurt. Any action has now largely been put off, pending the formation of a new government in the German state of Hesse, where Helaba is based. The state owns about 38 percent of WestLB, and has considered a sale in the past.'"
"'08-02-09,'0','The authorities said Mr. Thornton arrived at City Hall around 7 p.m. on Thursday and encountered a police officer, Sgt. Bill Biggs, in a parking lot. Mr. Thornton shot Sergeant Biggs, then retrieved the fallen officer’s service revolver and entered the Council chambers yelling, “Shoot the mayor!” Once inside, he turned his guns on the assembled crowd.Three city officials — Councilwoman Connie Karr, Councilman Mike Lynch and Kenneth Yost, the public works director — and a police officer, Tom Ballman, were killed in the chamber. Sergeant Biggs died in the parking lot.Mayor Mike Swoboda was wounded and remains in critical condition at St. John’s Mercy Medical Center in Creve Coeur, Mo. A newspaper reporter, Todd Smith, was also wounded and was in stable condition at a hospital.Ms. Karr had been busy in recent weeks planning a mayoral bid and was regarded as a top contender. Mr. Lynch was a zoning specialist whom friends described as gentlemanly and sociable. Mr. Yost was responsible for enforcing the ordinances related to zoning.A former Kirkwood police chief, Dan Linza, said Officer Ballman was a polished young man with a positive attitude. Mr. Linza said he also knew Sergeant Biggs, a former professional cowboy, and said the sergeant had been looking forward to the day when he could raise cattle and have a quiet life in the outdoors.“You’ve just got to grieve with these people,” said State Representative Rick Stream, a Republican who represents this area, mirroring the disbelief of many. “I just couldn’t believe it was Cookie that had done this. He was such a friendly guy. Obviously, he had some problems with the city, and for whatever reason, he just snapped.”For years, Mr. Thornton had feuded with the city, saying it excessively ticketed his company’s vehicles and harassed him by saying he lacked proper permits.A former Kirkwood mayor, Herb Jones, said he knew Mr. Thornton from his tenure and had attended Mr. Thornton’s wedding reception. While he once admired Mr. Thornton, Mr. Jones said, he had noticed that Mr. Thornton was unwilling to play by the rules.“He was running a commercial building business in a residence with heavy equipment and running afoul of the law,” Mr. Jones said. “It escalated into all sorts of problems from that. He was not willing to abide by the rules that apply to the whole community.”To Mr. Thornton’s family, however, he was a persecuted man who felt he had been deeply disrespected by a city he loved.“He tried to peacefully resolve issues,” said Mr. Thornton’s brother, Gerald Thornton, 54.After the shootings, Mr. Thornton said he had found a note on his brother’s bed that read, “The truth will win in the end.” Just one line, unsigned.Only after growing frustrated did his brother become violent, Gerald Thornton said, adding “He chose to do a first strike against the enemy that would be overwhelming.”Mr. Thornton was black, and several residents of Kirkwood’s poor and mostly black Meacham Park neighborhood said Friday that the attack at City Hall was a sharp reminder of the racial division they say has plagued the city for decades. They were not willing to condemn Mr. Thornton, a Meacham Park resident, for what he had done.“We are grieved, we are sorry, but they share in the responsibility,” Ben Gordon, a black man from nearby Webster Groves, said of city officials. “Cookie Thornton is to me a hero. I don’t condone murder. But as long as there is this separation, you’ll see more of this.”Mr. Gordon spoke at a standing-room-only meeting in Meacham Park that had been called to talk about the killings. While no one else at the meeting was as outspoken as he, many expressed a frustration with what they called a double standard for black and white residents of Kirkwood. They said they thought Charles Thornton lost his tolerance of that reality.“Cookie had anguish built up in him for the neighborhood,” said Charles Reynolds, a childhood friend.Others in the city did not give the Meacham Park residents much support for their theory.“They were all dedicated public servants,” Mr. Jones, the former mayor, said of the victims. “They were all very caring people, and Mr. Thornton, who we’ve known since he was in high school, felt he was being ill-treated by the city. That was not the style of the city or the Council members. They did not go into these types of things heavy-handed. It was unbelievable that Cookie Thornton thought he was being persecuted.”Mr. Thornton had a long and troubled history with authority including one 2002 incident in which a St. Louis County judge found him guilty of the assault and battery of Mr. Yost, whom Mr. Thornton killed on Thursday.But most of Mr. Thornton’s legal battles involved violations of city ordinances. He is named in as many as 15 cases in St. Louis County for violating such ordinances, like operating his construction business without the proper permits, and for numerous traffic-related infractions.A longtime critic of City Hall, Mr. Thornton was often disruptive in Council meetings, referring to Kirkwood as “having a plantation mentality,” according to court filings. Though the Council considered banning him from future meetings, it decided against such a step.In May 2006, the police removed Mr. Thornton in handcuffs from a Council meeting and later charged him with disorderly conduct, according to court filings. He sued the city, saying his removal from the meeting had violated his civil rights.'"
"'08-02-09,'0','The regulation, which the panel unanimously struck down, was issued in 2005. It aimed to reduce power-plant emissions of mercury 70 percent by 2018, through a system that capped total emissions, set the amounts of mercury that power plants could emit and let cleaner plants sell unneeded allowances.A coalition of environmental groups in alliance with 17 states, mostly on the receiving end of power plant emissions, sued, arguing that the law required tighter, more expensive controls that could eliminate up to 90 percent of mercury emissions.The toughest possible controls on mercury seemed destined to go into effect after a decision by the departing Clinton administration in December 2000. The Clean Air Act, which forbids a simple reversal of such a decision, required the Bush administration to meet a series of tests before it scrapped the Clinton plan.Rather than confront those hurdles and try to show that mercury emissions pose little danger to people, the agency declared it would take a different approach.The appellate ruling faulted that approach, calling it “the logic of the Queen of Hearts, substituting E.P.A.’s desires for the plain text” of the law.James Pew, a lawyer who represented the alliance, said if the agency had tried to reverse the Clinton decision by strictly following the law’s requirements “they would have had to show that there won’t be adverse health effects” from the failure to regulate power plants.“E.P.A. knew it couldn’t make those showings,” Mr. Pew said.A spokesman for the agency, Jonathan Shradar, said that officials were “disappointed that the court suspended the first ever regulation for mercury emissions from power plants.”“Because of the court’s action,” Mr. Shradar said, “the U.S. has no national regulation to cut mercury from existing power plants.”.He added that the agency was reviewing the decision to determine its response.The list of major judicial reversals of Environmental Protection Agency decisions on coal-burning power plants has grown. It includes a Supreme Court ruling last year forcing the agency to take a broader, more aggressive approach to regulate factories and power plants that add capacity or make renovations that increase air pollutants.A second Supreme Court decision rejected the agency’s contention that it had no authority to regulate the greenhouse gases linked to global warming. Utilities are responsible for a significant share of greenhouse gas emissions nationwide.In another decision against the agency, the United States Court for the District of Columbia Circuit, the court that ruled on Friday, ended a ruling with what sounded like a civics lesson by an exasperated instructor.“If the E.P.A. disagrees with this court’s interpretation of the Clean Air Act,” a panel wrote, it should appeal its earlier ruling. “In the meantime, it must obey the Clean Air Act as written by Congress and interpreted by this court.”Professor Tobias said the agency had an unusual string of defeats.“It’s hardly that I’d call these liberal courts,” he said, noting that the three-judge panel that ruled Friday included Janice Rogers Brown, whose appointment by President Bush was bitterly opposed by Senate Democrats.“Today’s decision adds to the momentum against dirty power and adds to the momentum for clean energy, ” said John Walke, a lawyer and clean-air expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which was among the plaintiffs in the suit.Supporting the agency were groups representing the utility industry and seven states with large coal-burning power plants, coal mines or coal-dependent utilities, including Alabama, West Virginia and Wyoming.“The court’s decision represents a major setback for federal efforts to establish clear mercury regulations for coal-fired power plants,” Dan Riedinger of the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade group, said in a statement.When a new rule is devised, Mr. Riedinger said, “we hope it reflects both the technological feasibility of reducing power plant mercury emissions” and “the fact that U.S. utilities produce just 1 percent of total global mercury emissions, thereby contributing little to people’s exposure to mercury from eating seafood.”In 2004, the environmental agency and the Food and Drug Administration warned women who might become pregnant and children to limit the consumption of certain canned tunas because high mercury levels might damage young nervous systems.'"
"'08-02-09,'0','For Kerstin J. T. Ottmar, who often treks to dog shows with three generations of Swedish vallhund packed into her salt-stained Subaru station wagon, recognition was a “lifetime goal and an achievement.”In 1985, her mother, Marilyn Thell, was the first to breed the Swedish vallhund in the United States. Ottmar, who took over her mother’s kennel in 1994 after Thell had a stroke, has three dogs in this year’s competition.One of them — a 12-year-old service dog, Ch. Jonricker Moustaffa, nicknamed Moose — will be the oldest to compete at Westminster.In a matchup of newcomers in the herding group Monday evening, the fox-like Swedish vallhund will share the ring with the Beauceron, a large, black-and-tan shepherd dog with double dewclaws — a sixth toe, in other words. Both will compete against more established breeds such as the border collie and the German shepherd.Stanley S. Saltzman, who will judge the group, said that while he studied the new breeds’ standards and talked to foreign judges “who are more experienced with them” to prepare for the event, evaluating a new breed was much like evaluating an old one.“You are looking for the same thing with every dog: how well they meet their standard of perfection,” he said. “The length of time a dog has been approved has no effect on how close a dog gets to perfection.”In order for a breed to be recognized by the American Kennel Club, it must have a population of at least 300 dogs in the United States, with a three-generation pedigree.Once these requirements have been met and a parent club for the breed has been established, the breed becomes part of a miscellaneous class for one to three years. Most breeds move out of this stage and into the regular pool of breeds eligible for show-ring competition after about 18 months.To help breeders, the American Kennel Club created the Foundation Stock Service in 1995, which keeps pedigree and ownership records. The service works only with those dogs that have already been tracked in a foreign or domestic registry. It does not accept crossings of previously recognized breeds — sorry, no puggles or labradoodles — or color, size or other variations within a breed.“It’s a kind of pride I feel to finally see these breeds I’ve worked with, for them to have their first year at the show,” said Mari-Beth O’Neill, assistant vice president for special services at the Foundation Stock Service. “I feel like now they’ve gone on and it’s up to them to carry forth — and I’m sure they will.”The American Kennel Club recognizes 157 distinct dog breeds. Its international counterpart, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, accepts more than 300. So most breeds that are new to the United States are not new to the world.“Some have been around for thousands of years,” said David Frei, director of communications for the Westminster Kennel Club. “The Tibetan mastiff has been around thousands of years. It’s probably the progenitor of many of the breeds you see in the ring today.”The Plott hound comes closest of the four new breeds to being a native American dog. Brought to the United States in the late 18th century and bred to sniff wild boar and bear, the midsize, brindle-haired dog is still primarily used for hunting. (The breed standard includes this note to judges: “The Plott may have an identification mark on the rump used to identify the dog when out hunting. Such a mark is not to be penalized when evaluating the dog.”)Joe Burkett is one of only two breeders who have Plott hounds showing at Westminster. “They need to be hunting dogs before they go into the ring for a show,” he said. Of the four Plotts he entered, he said he expected only two — named Trigger and Jeff — would be able to handle the stress of the large, cramped show.“It’s a tough show for a hunting dog from out in the country,” he said. “But it’s an honor to be invited.”'"
"'08-02-09,'0','Finally, during a recession, politicians may redirect their attention from environmental initiatives toward the economy. “Massive corn subsidies anyone?” Mr. Richard wrote. “Don’t even think about progress on global warming.”Has Silicon Valley become a hotbed of drug abuse, with hopelessly addicted venture capitalists demanding that would-be entrepreneurs supply them with OxyContin before they will agree to finance start-ups?Probably not, but that has not stopped Valleywag, the Silicon Valley gossip blog, from posting such allegations over the last few months. It began in December, when the blog flatly claimed, based on an e-mail message from a single anonymous “tipster,” that OC-80, a type of OxyContin, was becoming “the Valley’s next big drug.”This week, Valleywag published the supposed account of an employee at a start-up who was fired because he could not secure OxyContin for his boss to give to a venture capitalist. The boss purportedly wrote an e-mail message to the employee saying: “I told these investors we can get them OC. But just a couple days before I meet with them, you tell me you can’t get it. They were counting on it, Joe. We are not going to get funded. You are fired.”The stilted language aside, would a boss in this situation really fire “Joe” via e-mail, spelling out the reasons so frankly? Many Valleywag commenters thought not. “O.K.,” wrote one, “I’m changing Valleywag’s tag from ‘News’ to ‘Fiction.’ ”According to Linsey Knerl of the personal finance site Wisebread, Target stores are often filled with bargains, but they can be hard to find. “In addition to the fantastic finds on the end caps of most aisles,” she wrote, “there are fabulous hidden deals to be had for those of us who really want them.”For instance, a product may be marked down, but there is no hint of its real price. “The only way to really know if an item is on ‘secret clearance’ is to scan it, made handy by the self-scanning stations placed throughout most stores.” These and several other hints are available at wisebread.com.Cracked.com offers videos of some of the most unintentionally ridiculous television spots from the golden age of television. A spot for the Mattel Dick Tracy Tommy Burst toy machine gun features a young boy mock-killing a robber. And a 1963 commercial for Folgers instant coffee depicts a man hinting to his wife that “the girls down at the office” might steal his affections thanks to their superior brewing skills.'"
"'08-02-09,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — A week after Yahoo learned that it would be the target of a $44.6 billion hostile bid by Microsoft, the company’s board met on Friday to consider its options, a person briefed on the meeting said.The directors listened to a series of presentations from Yahoo’s management and its bankers, who argued that the company was worth more than what Microsoft has offered. The board was also presented with various options for maintaining Yahoo’s independence, this person said.One possibility that has been discussed is a search-related joint venture with Google. Lawyers at the meeting discussed the antitrust implications of such a tie-up, which would extend Google’s dominance of the search advertising market, the person said. They also discussed how to press Microsoft to increase its bid.Yahoo could give an immediate lift to its revenues and profits by outsourcing its search-related ad business to Google, because Google’s advertising technology generates far more cash for every search query, on average. This option had long been recommended by some Yahoo investors and analysts, but Yahoo executives had said that search ads were an integral part of the company’s business.In recent years, Yahoo has invested millions in a new search advertising system, called Panama, in an effort to close the gap with Google.The technology, which Yahoo began to roll out early last year, has helped increase search advertising revenue, but Google’s technology remains more efficient, according to analysts. For Yahoo executives, replacing Panama, or other parts of its search system, with Google’s technology would be an admission of defeat.Nevertheless, the board has considered the idea, after a call last week by Google’s chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, to his Yahoo counterpart, Jerry Yang, offering his company’s help in fending off the Microsoft bid.'"

"'08-02-10,'0','As of 1:30 p.m. on Saturday, nearly 50 hours after news broke of Mr. Romney’s withdrawal, Mr. Langi and Mr. Kelley had still not heard of it, nor were they told.Asked if anything had surprised him in current events, Mr. Langi replied that some New Yorkers had mentioned a public-television series on the Mormons that was broadcast last year. Anything else? Yes, he continued, a 2006 film on a controversial chapter in 19th-century Mormon history called “September Dawn.”Mr. Kelley offered, “Some people have asked me, ‘Are you hoping Mitt Romney wins?’ I just say, ‘Whatever happens is whatever happens.’ ”Like other missionaries, who number about 170 in Manhattan, the Bronx, Westchester County and Connecticut, Mr. Kelley and Mr. Langi are carefully schooled to be politically neutral, said Richard Searle, mission president for the area. (There are about 73,000 Mormons in New York State.)If people press missionaries on politics, Mr. Searle said, there are certain scripts. “We can tell you what Mr. Romney believes, if you would like to hear about the Gospel,” Mr. Searle said, “but we don’t have a position on him. We’re not out campaigning, we’re here to preach the Gospel.”A few hours spent on a chilly and rainy Saturday watching Mr. Langi and Mr. Kelley do missionary work showed two determined and amiable young men who are not easily distracted.Walking in Chelsea past a red Lamborghini sports car parked in the street, two men in see-through T-shirts sharing a cup of coffee, and a large framed picture of Marilyn Monroe lifting barbells, Mr. Langi and Mr. Kelley looked only for the addresses of two possible converts who had said they wanted to hear a Mormon lesson plan. The people were not at home in either case.On 14th Street, they returned to what they had done earlier in the day in Union Square: They approached dozens of people who walked quickly away and refused to make eye contact when they said, “Excuse me, have you ever heard of the Book of Mormon?”The church values missionary work and accords missionaries the title of “elder,” even though Mr. Langi and Mr. Kelly look even younger than their ages.At 6-foot-2 and 280 pounds, Mr. Langi, a former high school football player who was born in El Paso, Tex., is an especially striking figure. The son of an Army medic and a bus driver, both of Tongan heritage, he can do the Haka, the Tongan war dance that involves stomping feet, bulging eyeballs and a protruding tongue.Like Mr. Kelley, the son of an electrical engineer and a nurse, Mr. Langi saved up to $14,000 to finance two years of missionary work. (The church helps with finding apartments and other financial matters but does not finance the missions, which are voluntary.)Mr. Langi has been in New York for nearly a year and a half and is teaching Mr. Kelley, a Salt Lake City native who arrived last month, the rigors of evangelizing. They live, with two other missionaries, in a modest two-bedroom apartment in Chinatown, Mr. Kelley in the top bunk bed and Mr. Langi in the bottom. The daily rigors and rhythms are not much different from when Mr. Romney was a missionary in France, in the late 1960s.Mr. Langi has learned that those most likely to listen to church information are people “going through life changes,” like having children or recently moving to town.He is not above mentioning to sports fans that he has an uncle, Sione Pouha, who plays defensive tackle for the New York Jets.Mr. Langi is also adept at occasional street debates when some contend that Mormonism has racist aspects. He just grins and looks down at his dark brown arms, in a theatrical gesture that seems to say, “I’m not exactly an albino.”Mr. Kelley is disarming in his own way. Pale and thin, he turns pink on a cold day like Saturday, his nose and ears turning crimson. Older women listen out of concern. Older men place a fatherly arm around his shoulder.“It works for me,” he said slyly.'"
"'08-02-10,'0','PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — Even as Vijay Singh roared into a tie for the lead with Dudley Hart at nine under par, restoring some sense of order in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am on Saturday, Phil Mickelson went the other way by missing the cut here for the first time in six years.Finishing 54 holes at seven-over-par 221 after a 78 on Saturday, Mickelson ran aground at the 14th hole. It is a landlocked but still difficult par-5 that has a rich history of slaying big-name contenders, from Nick Faldo in the 1992 United States Open to Arnold Palmer in the 1967 Bing Crosby Pro-Am. Mickelson, the defending champion, sank from two under par to four over when he hit two shots out of bounds and made a sextuple-bogey 11.“I took an aggressive line off the tee, going right of the bunkers at 14 to try to get it as close as I could, and I tried to get it right in front of the green with a hybrid,” Mickelson said. “I was only two under and hadn’t made anything happen, and I felt like I needed to get it close. It shot right on me and went out of bounds. And then I did it again.“It happens, unfortunately. I was trying to get myself within striking distance of the leaders. Nobody really was making anything happen, and I thought if I could get something going, I could get into contention.”Singh and Hart each made plenty happen. Hart finished a bogey-free round at Spyglass with birdies on the 17th and 18th holes for a 68. Singh eagled the 11th hole at Spyglass on his way to a 32 on the back nine.'"
"'08-02-10,'0','Novitzky will not testify and may not be sitting in the front row, but he is expected to be in the hearing room, listening carefully, according to a lawyer familiar with the matter.Looming over the Congressional inquiry into steroids in sports, an investigation that is now focused on Clemens, are the Department of Justice and Novitzky himself. Novitzky turned Radomski and McNamee into informants for the government and for George J. Mitchell in his investigation into performance-enhancing drugs in baseball.Rusty Hardin, one of Clemens’s lawyers, said it would be “unbelievable” and “brazen” for Novitzky to attend the Congressional hearing when he could watch it on television or read the written record.“Is there really any question now about what’s going on?” Hardin said in a telephone interview Saturday night. “Novitzky’s been nibbling around the edges, calling the other people’s lawyers, making sure they’re careful about what they say.“You know what? He does not have a sacred mission from God to mess up everybody’s life. So I will be delighted to meet him and let him hear from Roger. He’s never attempted to hear from Roger. He’s never contacted us. So he can sit there at the same time and we’d be delighted to hear from him, but it sure does send a message.”Hardin added, “I can tell you this: If he ever messes with Roger, Roger will eat his lunch.”Richard D. Emery, one of McNamee’s lawyers, reacted with approval when told of Novitzky’s plans in a telephone interview Saturday night.“I’m glad to hear that,” Emery said. “He should be at the scene of the crime. If there’s going to be a crime committed, there should be a cop there. And I welcome him, and I’m really glad that he’s going to be there to see Roger dissemble.”Novitzky, in an e-mail message Saturday night, declined to comment.In addition to listening to Clemens, Novitzky will be evaluating the testimony of Radomski, with whom the government signed a cooperation agreement, and of McNamee, with whom federal prosecutors signed a proffer agreement. Each promised to tell the truth — Radomski in exchange for reduced charges, McNamee for no charges.Clemens adamantly denies McNamee’s accusations against him, which were published in the Mitchell report. Last week, Clemens gave a deposition and met with 19 members of the committee to press his case.If McNamee is not telling the truth, he is violating the proffer agreement his lawyers signed last summer, and everything he has said about drug distribution can be used against him. He could also face charges of lying to a federal agent and lying to Congressional officials. Those charges are punishable by up to five years in prison.If Clemens is not telling the truth — or at least if the Department of Justice or the chairman of the committee, Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, decides he is not telling the truth — he can be referred and investigated for lying to Congressional officials.For Bonds, baseball’s career home run leader, and for Jones, the sprinter who won five medals at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and has since returned them, it was not the allegation of steroid use that landed them in federal court. The government virtually never prosecutes steroid users. It was the accusation of lying to a grand jury and to Novitzky.Novitzky and the federal prosecutors in California, who declined comment, have not been squeamish about going after famous athletes. They have been patient, too. Bonds and Jones were not charged until almost five years after making their statements.The Department of Justice assigned an I.R.S. agent to steroids cases because they often involve money laundering.The Justice Department may also be sensitive to criticism that in its pursuit of Bonds and Jones, it went after two of the most famous black athletes in the United States. Clemens, the winner of seven Cy Young awards, is white.In many ways, people already know what Clemens and McNamee have to say. Clemens steadfastly denies the charges and makes a persuasive witness, but he cannot prove a negative. He impressed many of the committee members he met last week with his sincerity and his willingness to answer any question.McNamee is not as polished and has added to his accounts as time has gone on. He did not tell Novitzky and Mitchell last year about the syringes and gauze pads that he now says he had saved since 2001 because they had steroids and Clemens’s blood on them. Clemens’s lawyers say that McNamee fabricated this evidence, and they say that although they respect Mitchell, his report contains other provable falsehoods concerning Clemens.For instance, the Mitchell report says that McNamee said he attended a lunch party at José Canseco’s house in Miami in June 1998 and “observed Clemens, Canseco and another person he did not know meeting inside Canseco’s house, although McNamee did not personally attend that meeting.” Canseco is an admitted steroids user. Shortly after that, the report says, Clemens approached McNamee for the first time and asked him about injecting steroids.But Clemens and his lawyers have told members of Congress in their private meetings last week that Clemens was not at that party at Canseco’s house, and that he can prove it, with a receipt from a golf course and with Canseco’s own account.Emery responded Saturday night that McNamee has a clear recollection of Clemens, his wife, nanny and children attending at least part of Canseco’s party, which lasted several hours.Intriguing testimony may also come from Pettitte, Clemens’s longtime teammate and workout partner. Pettitte has admitted to receiving H.G.H. injections from McNamee. A lawyer familiar with the matter said that Pettitte had told Congressional investigators about talking with Clemens about H.G.H.Hardin said, “Roger will testify that never did Andy tell him he used H.G.H., and never did he tell Andy that he used it.”Under the House committee’s rules, Waxman can refer witnesses he thinks have not told the truth to the Department of Justice for investigation. Waxman has made it a practice to do so only in cooperation with the ranking Republican, Tom Davis of Virginia. Davis, the former chairman, followed the same practice.Waxman and Davis each signed a referral letter last month concerning Miguel Tejada after new evidence in the Mitchell report raised questions about whether Tejada had told the truth to committee lawyers three years ago. The F.B.I. has opened an investigation into Tejada.If the Justice Department starts an investigation, a grand jury would probably begin hearing evidence, Mathew Rosengart, an adjunct law professor at Pepperdine University who was a federal prosecutor in Washington, said in a telephone interview.“You could have a case where McNamee and Clemens are being called to testify again,” Rosengart said, “this time in front of a criminal grand jury.”'"
"'08-02-10,'0','WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 — Astronauts will delay by one day attaching a European science laboratory to the International Space Station because of an undisclosed health problem with one member of the space shuttle Atlantis’ seven-man crew, NASA officials said Saturday.John Shannon, chairman of NASA’s Mission Management Team, disclosed the problem and delay during a televised briefing from the Johnson Space Center in Houston. However, citing privacy issues, he refused to disclose the nature of the medical issue or the astronaut involved.“It’s not life threatening,” Mr. Shannon said. Although astronauts in space have had health problems in the past, he said this was the first time he could recall such an incident affecting plans during a mission.Atlantis, which took off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Thursday, docked with the space station shortly after noon Eastern time on Saturday.Mr. Shannon said the crew requested two private medical conferences with flight surgeons at about the same time, and shortly afterward mission control advised astronauts on both craft that a Sunday spacewalk would be delayed and that a different crewman would be involved.Stanley G. Love will replace Hans Schlegel, a European Space Agency astronaut from Germany, on the delayed spacewalk. Mr. Love, who has been trained as Mr. Schlegel’s backup, will join Col. Rex J. Walheim of the Air Force in attaching the Columbus laboratory carried by Atlantis to the station, officials said.Mr. Shannon would not say if the medical issue involved Mr. Schlegel or if the German astronaut would be conducting a second spacewalk for which he is scheduled. Mr. Schlegel, 56, has been an astronaut since 1990 and flew on a 1993 space shuttle mission.'"
"'08-02-10,'0','Yahoo’s board plans to reject Microsoft’s $44.6 billion hostile bid in a letter on Monday, saying the offer undervalues Yahoo, people involved in the discussions said Saturday.Microsoft, which hopes Yahoo will help it compete more effectively against Google, is likely to continue its pursuit.The decision to reject the offer was made after a board meeting Friday in which directors discussed ways the company might respond to Microsoft’s week-old bid. The board heard presentations from Yahoo’s management and its bankers, who made the case that the company was worth more than the $31 a share Microsoft offered, people familiar with the discussions said.In response, Microsoft is likely to mount a behind-the-scenes campaign directed at Yahoo’s largest shareholders, hoping they will put pressure on Yahoo’s board, people familiar with Microsoft’s plans said. Hedge funds have bought up much of Yahoo’s stock since Microsoft made its bid, and they typically favor a quick sale as opposed to holding shares for the long term.Microsoft could also decide to make an offer directly to shareholders, called a tender offer, which would put even more pressure on Yahoo’s board to negotiate. Microsoft could also set a deadline for its offer.'"
"'08-02-10,'0','Despite the Secretary General’s positive remarks, no NATO nation has come up with substantial new contributions for the Afghan mission except for the United States, which has committed to sending 3,200 more marines into southern Afghanistan.The annual conference in Munich brings together heads of state, foreign and defense ministers and other high-ranking diplomats. Relations among NATO members seemed to be slightly less strained following the two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers in Lithuania that ended last week.Mr. Gates, scheduled to deliver a keynote address on Sunday at the Munich conference on Afghanistan, said Saturday that the United States had not issued any sort of ultimatum to NATO allies to provide more troops.In conciliatory remarks to alliance members, he expressed Washington’s understanding of political pressures within NATO capitals that have made some allies reluctant to join the combat mission there.Mr. Gates said his recent letters to alliance defense ministers instead “expressed the hope” that they would increase their contributions of combat troops and security trainers for the Afghan mission.He said American bilateral relations with individual NATO nations would not be harmed if they were unable to contribute more to the mission in Afghanistan. “We have a realistic understanding of some of the political limitations here in Europe in certain countries,” Mr. Gates said.But the American defense secretary coupled those comments with a clear warning that the alliance itself could suffer if it does not succeed in Afghanistan because only some allies step up to the combat mission.“It’s a military alliance,” he said. “The members have signed up with certain obligations in this regard. But if it were to become the case that some allies are not prepared to fulfill their military obligations, while others continue to do so, I think that is a very dangerous situation for the future of the alliance.”Speculation was rampant throughout the day at the conference that Germany would raise the ceiling on its troop deployments in Afghanistan from a maximum of 3,500 to 4,500. But a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said there had been no deliberation of the matter in the chancellery, just discussions among members of Parliament.Germany has come under significant pressure from the United States to move some of its 3,200 troops from the northern part of Afghanistan to the south.Polls show a majority of the German public opposes an expanded role for the country’s soldiers in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan.The Munich Conference on Security Policy, which began during the heart of the cold war, is meeting for the 44th time. The conference theme, “The World in Disarray — Shifting Powers, Lack of Strategies,” reflected the air of uncertainty afflicting the alliance, which had a clearer mission when the Soviet Union was the enemy.The event lacked some of the luster of previous years. Mrs. Merkel was not scheduled to attend. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, pulled out at the last minute because of the demands of his presidential campaign.The conference also lacked a significant controversy, such as the large protests in 2003 when then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld spoke to what he previously had referred to as “Old Europe” on the eve of the Iraq invasion, or last year’s event, when Russian President Vladimir V. Putin went beyond the usually diplomatic niceties in a speech harshly critical of United States foreign policy.This year, Mr. Gates and Sergei B. Ivanov, Russia’s first deputy prime minister, were back to the niceties.As he entered a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Gates after a series of other country’s speeches that had criticized both American and Russian policy, Mr. Ivanov said, “Everyone pokes his finger at you and us — we are responsible for everything.”'"
"'08-02-10,'0','TOKYO — Finance leaders from the world’s wealthiest nations warned Saturday that global economic woes could get worse from the slump in the American housing market, but offered few specific remedies.In a statement issued after meetings in Tokyo, the finance ministers and central bank chiefs of the Group of 7 industrialized nations offered a more pessimistic view of the global economy than they did four months ago, after their last meeting. They also said the fundamental elements of the global economy remained strong and the United States was likely to avoid recession.The finance leaders from the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada warned that global growth could continue to slow as a result of the credit crisis set off by America’s subprime mortgage problems. The statement also pledged joint action to calm shaken financial markets, but it was short on specifics, especially on steps to rekindle growth.It did not press member nations to pick up the slack from the slowing United States economy by stimulating their own domestic growth. It also did not contain any dramatic joint action, like a coordinated cut in interest rates, as some had hoped.“The world confronts a more challenging and uncertain environment than when we met last October,” the statement said. “We will continue to watch developments closely and will continue to take appropriate actions, individually and collectively, in order to secure stability and growth in our economies.”'"
"'08-02-10,'0','Vivi the whippet, the prize-winning show dog who vanished two years ago at Kennedy International Airport, is alive and well and living in Brooklyn. At least that’s what the animal psychics say. These are the professionals who claim to tune into an animal’s thoughts through telepathy the way another person might find a radio station.“She’s pretty street-smart,” said Judi Byers, who describes herself as an animal communicator. “She’s made friends, and she’s got reliable places to eat. She told me she’s been pregnant — she lost one puppy — and that she’s trying to raise the litter on her own.”It has been two years since Vivi, a brown and white whippet whose full name is Bohem C’est La Vie, disappeared at Kennedy after competing at the 2006 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. At the time, her disappearance prompted an extensive, frenzied and fruitless search that swept up the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the news media and a party of more than 100 local volunteers for weeks — the canine answer to Jimmy Hoffa.Heartbroken, her co-owners, Jil Walton and Paul Lepiane, and breeder, Bo Bengtson, stayed away from the Westminster dog show last year. But this week, Walton and Lepiane will return dogs to competition at Madison Square Garden for the first time since losing Vivi. (The lists of competitors are kept secret until the show to preserve the integrity of the judging.)And their first trip back will certainly be emotional.“For me, it will always bring back the memories of losing her,” Bengtson said. “We realize that the chances of finding her are very minuscule, but we’re hoping that someone found her and is feeding her.”'"
"'08-02-10,'0','Buffeted by concerns about a weakening economy, the stock market fell last week after two weeks of gains.On Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management reported that an index measuring the service sector of the economy fell in January to its lowest level since October 2001, in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.That sharp decline brought the index to a level signaling that the economy has been slowing — perhaps into a recession.Financial services stocks took a beating during the week. Citigroup shares fell 12.3 percent, the worst weekly performance among the Dow industrials.For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 561.06 points, or 4.4 percent, to close at 12,182.13. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 64.13 points, or 4.6 percent, to close at 1,331.29. The Nasdaq composite index lost 108.51 points, or 4.5 percent, to close at 2,304.85.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.64 percent from 3.59 percent the previous week.'"

Stanley Arthur Loewenberg, and 10 crew members boarded Pluto, a B-17 Flying Fortress. Pluto took off from Port Moresby, New Guinea, on a reconnaissance mission to Irian Jaya Barat. Twenty minutes after the last check-in, radio contact was lost, and so were my grandfather and the crew.Nearly 65 years later, they’ve yet to be found. For many years, my great-grandmother continued to write letters to my grandfather, hoping that her correspondence would help bring my grandfather back. But my family — and the families of the other crew members — have not had the relief of closure. The crew is still missing. Pluto is still out there.Through memorials, pictures, stories and pleas to the government, those of us who have lost family keep their memories, and our hope, alive.My grandfather may be missing, but he is not forgotten.Thanks to a Philadelphia businessman whose passion is searching for lost World War II aircraft and the Joint P.O.W./M.I.A. Accounting Command, or JPAC, the remains of both our fathers were recovered and identified over half a century after they went missing in action in early 1944.Discovered in 1998 within 15 miles of each other in the Finisterre (French for “end of the earth”) mountains of Papua New Guinea, Second Lt. George P. Gaffney Jr., a fighter pilot, and Maj. Earl R. Kindig, an artillery battalion commander, are now at rest in Arlington National Cemetery.Our message to the tens of thousands of our fellow war orphans: Don’t give up hope. Press Congress to adequately finance JPAC.And most of all, keep your loved ones’ names alive in your hearts.'"
"'08-02-10,'0','Mr. Montgomery, a veteran product manager who has also worked as a computer industry writer and editor, is an example of how it just might be possible to teach dinosaurs to dance.Last fall, his team introduced an intriguing software Web service called Popfly that is intended to make it possible for nonprogrammers to plug together Web components and data sources quickly to create useful new Web services. For example, news feeds could be added to digital images, or data lists to maps.Introduced at the Web 2.0 conference last year by Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, Popfly was picked by PC World magazine as one of the most innovative computing and consumer electronics products of 2007. It has garnered more than 100,000 users — the company says the exact number is confidential — and now has a library of more than 50,000 “mashups”: new components or Web pages that have been created in a visual snap-together fashion, like Lego blocks.The mashup is at the heart of a generation of Lego-style software that is emblematic of the second generation of the Internet. Both Google and Yahoo have developed tools to help Web users display apartment rentals on maps, or build complicated Web sites likeTripTouch.com, which is intended to offer diverse local information for travelers.The Popfly programmers, however, have gone a step further in an effort to design a tool that is intended for a generation of Web users who are familiar with the Internet but are not skilled programmers.A user might take Popfly and mash up his list of Amazon book recommendations with the Seattle Library book catalog on the Web, he said, and receive a notification when the waiting list for a particular book was down to zero.“This is not just a passive experience,” Mr. Montgomery said. “You can take this stuff and use it in new ways.”He now sees his target audience as people who are not professional developers, but who work with information.Popfly, he said, is for “the 21- to 27-year-old crowd who grew up on the Web.”“They have never known a world without eBay, Amazon, or Google,” he added. “They assume that when you create a piece of software it will be Internet-connected and it will have an innate sense of who your friends are.”Microsoft is certainly not alone in seeing this kind of an opportunity. Yahoo offers a widely used tool call Yahoo Pipes that offers some of the same capabilities as Popfly, and Google has designed a “mashup editor” for more skilled programmers.But Mr. Montgomery sees Popfly as a more ambitious and comprehensive effort. He also thinks that it could turn into a general educational tool for nonprogrammers.That is what prompted him to visit an introductory computing course in December at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., where the computer scientist Mark Frydenberg is using Popfly to teach his students how to interact with digital data in new ways.So far, students’ projects have run the gamut from simple calculators or clocks that can be displayed on a Web page, to World of Warcraft blocks that make it possible to connect the multiplayer fantasy game to other Web services like Facebook.Mr. Frydenberg said he believed that Popfly would be a perfect educational tool for the Bentley students, because the college has a general business focus.“This will help the students think about merging data from two different sources,” he said. “That’s a problem that happens in business all the time.”IF Popfly can become that kind of a tool widely used on the Web, it will be an important quiver in the strategy that was started in 2005 by Ray Ozzie, who is now Microsoft’s chief software architect.“His message was that the only interesting software is going to be software that is connected to the Web and we have to work on that,” Mr. Montgomery said.At the time, Mr. Montgomery was the product manager of the company’s .Net software business, which had been the focus of Microsoft’s previous Internet strategy. But he quickly realized that Microsoft had to reach a much broader audience than its core base of professional software developers.Mr. Montgomery was intrigued by the phenomenon of 13-year-olds who were “tricking out” their MySpace pages with “digital bling.” They didn’t realize it, but by cutting and pasting snippets of code together, they were programming, he said.The largest challenge facing the Microsoft team of Popfly developers will be to gain the acceptance of the broader Web world. Because the company chose to design Popfly using a Microsoft Web graphics and animation technology called Silverlight, it will be treated with suspicion by an Internet universe that is increasingly committed to open standards.Silverlight is an alternative developed by Microsoft to compete against Adobe’s Flash and, more recently, Flex systems, that are now used ubiquitously by Web developers.Mr. Montgomery will also have to overcome the skepticism with which many Internet veterans now view Microsoft.“Popfly shows me that Microsoft still thinks this is all about software, rather than about accumulating data via network effects, which to me is the core of Web 2.0,” said Tim O’Reilly, the founder and chief executive of O’Reilly Media, a print and online publisher. “They are using Popfly to push Silverlight, rather than really trying to get into the mashup game.”For his part, Mr. Montgomery believes that Popfly does have some very big ideas to offer the Web world. He is following in an important tradition that began in the 1960s with computer languages like Logo and Smalltalk, which were aimed at unlocking the power of computing for nontechnical users. Today he is betting that Popfly will offer a simple way to give the power of programming to the rest of us.'"
"'08-02-10,'0','Q I live in a three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment on the Upper West Side that was once rented by my mother. In the early ’80s, when the building went co-op, she was offered an insider’s price of $165,000 to buy it. She declined. Do I have any right to buy at a lower price?A Dennis H. Greenstein, a Manhattan co-op and condo lawyer and a former New York assistant attorney general, said the letter writer is not entitled to any discount. “The General Business Law, which governs conversions, provides that tenants in occupancy at the time the offering plan to convert the building to a cooperative was accepted for filing have the exclusive right to purchase their apartments for a period of 90 days,” he said.Mr. Greenstein said that while the writer appears to have succeeded to her mother’s rights as a rent-stabilized tenant, this would not give rise to any rights to purchase.'"
"'08-02-10,'0','In December 2004, when Acorn bought Pleasant East, federal resources disappeared, forcing the organization to eliminate the armed security guards that HUD had posted there and to close the on-site management office. The group that had helped tenants in their fight to save the buildings was now their landlord, not to everyone’s delight.“I think people had felt trashed, they felt abandoned, they felt disrespected,” Ismene Speliotis, the Acorn housing corporation’s director, acknowledged last week. Still, she added, “we never gave up.”Ms. Montañez, sitting in her renovated apartment, said she preferred the security guards to the cameras that replaced them. “Maybe they can see when they come in,” she said of images of visitors, “but they don’t see if they’re going to kill me or something.”Still, Ms. Montañez expressed satisfaction with the repairs, adding that other residents, too, seemed mostly satisfied. “They have complaints, you know, but they’re pretty happy,” she said. “They come to me and I say: ‘Listen: Look around, the way things were before and the way they are now.’ ”Some discontent remains. Carmen Pichardo, a former Acorn volunteer who has been among the group’s most vocal critics, said she believed that the group had abandoned its commitment to tenants’ rights. She contended that Acorn had bought the buildings as an investment in a gentrifying neighborhood and would eventually try to force out the tenants. In response, Ms. Speliotis of Acorn said that under the terms of her organization’s purchase of the buildings, they cannot be sold for many years.Erica Negron, a 30-year-old single mother of two boys who has a fixed income from disability payments and who arrived at Pleasant East in July, sees her new home as an improvement, regardless of its history. Her previous building, in the South Bronx, had been disqualified from the Section 8 program after failing an inspection. During a six-month search, the only apartments she could find with landlords that would accept her were in neighborhoods where she was scared.Now, Ms. Negron said, her sons are in good schools, and Pleasant East seems safe. As for whether there is still crime in the building, she said: “I stay to myself. It’s just me and my two kids, and that’s all I focus on.”Ms. Negron said she was excited to have a place with new floors, windows and kitchen appliances, and to be back in the borough where she grew up, and where her relatives live. Almost all of the apartments she had seen that accepted her vouchers were in the Bronx, she said, adding, “I had totally lost my hope in Manhattan.”'"
"'08-02-10,'0','ROOM 102 at Ward Melville High School is a modest classroom that doubles as a haven and Petri dish for scientifically inclined students at risk of being dissed as disposable nerds in less-brainy quadrants of school — yes, the gymnasium can be hostile territory. Some things never change, not even in this Geek Squad-as-heroes era.Today a passel of students are running stress tests on model bridges they built for a contest sponsored by Brookhaven National Laboratory. The squish test is eliciting audible awe and groans; the competition to create a collapse-proof structure is intense. Only the strongest bridge survives. A nice, unsubtle life lesson.In an adjoining office belonging to George J. Baldo, the Corvette-driving, bling-accessorized director of the school’s high-octane InStar (Independent Science Technology and Research) program, sits Herman Gudjonson of East Setauket. His exhibit for this month’s Long Island Science and Engineering Fair, a condensed version of the near-year-long medical research project that became his entry for the national Intel Science Talent Search, is rolled up at his feet. “Reduced Taste in Drosophila Mutated for an Obesity Syndrome Protein” is a title only a bona fide scientist could love — or make sense of. That’s sort of the point.At 17, he is an aspiring geneticist, a veteran New York Youth Symphony violinist (with Carnegie Hall concerts on the résumé) and a former varsity tennis champion (he relinquished his United States Tennis Association ranking to concentrate on science full time and orchestra rehearsals on Sundays) who found out on Jan. 30 that he was one of 40 Intel finalists. He was stunned.“In our circle, the Intel award is known as the high school Nobel Prize,” Dr. Baldo explains. “With the level of work he is doing, Herman could actually be in graduate school right now.” Instead he’s right here overachieving, and he has company.This year Ward Melville contributed a bumper crop of semifinalists, 13, to the competition, besting a school record (it had been 12) and leading the nation. “We were shocked to have 13 in the semis,” Dr. Baldo says. “This is like a little fraternity that allows kids to be as nerdy or geeky as they want and nobody is going to pound them for it verbally or physically; in this room they can be themselves without recrimination, and if we also get a good scientist out of it every year or two, not a problem.”'"
"'08-02-10,'0','“I was absolutely sure of this after being in the hotel during twenty-two heavy bombardments in which other parts of it were struck. It seemed eminently more sensible to live in a part of a hotel which you knew would not be struck by shell fire, because you knew where the shells lit, than to go to some other hotel further from the lines, the angles of which you had no data to figure and where you would maybe have a shell drop through the roof.“Well, I had great confidence in the Florida and when Franco finally entered Madrid, Rooms 112 and 113 were still intact. There was very little else that was though.”The Mint Theater Company normally specializes in revivals of neglected plays, but its production of “The Fifth Column” is really a premier of sorts, Jonathan Bank, the company’s artistic director, said recently. “I want to be precise about this, so maybe I should say this is the first time Hemingway’s play has been done professionally in America,” he explained. “There might have been an amateur production. There was a production in the Soviet Union in 1963. And from a reference I saw in a biography of Michael Powell, I know he directed a production in Scotland in the ’40s.”What was billed as an “adaptation” of “The Fifth Column” by Benjamin Glazer, directed by Lee Strasberg, was put on by the Theater Guild in 1940, to mostly mixed reviews. Hemingway by that point had washed his hands of it and for good reason, according to Mr. Bank. “I would say that it’s 80 percent Glazer and 10 percent Hemingway out of context,” he said. “It’s completely restructured and, well, awful.”In the Hemingway version, which was published in his 1938 collection “The Fifth Column and the First Forty-nine Stories,” Philip Rawlings, the play’s protagonist, and his colleagues are unabashed Communists who call each other comrade. Those references are absent from the Glazer adaptation, and Mr. Bank said he originally assumed that all the changes in the Theater Guild production had been made in 1940 for political reasons. What he discovered, though, was that most of the changes were from earlier, and the most disastrous revisions stemmed from Mr. Glazer’s odd streak of Puritanism.Mr. Glazer, who had written and produced the successful movie version of “A Farewell to Arms,” was the brother-in-law of Hemingway’s lawyer, Maurice Speiser, who suggested that he take a look at the unproduced play. After Mr. Glazer said that “The Fifth Column” needed a “dramatic spark plug,” he and Hemingway entered into an agreement in which he would rewrite the play in return for 50 percent of the royalties. If Hemingway liked what Mr. Glazer wrote, the play would be produced under Hemingway’s name; if not, it would be called an adaptation.“My speculation is that Hemingway somehow thought that the relation of published play to the produced one was like the relationship of a novel to a movie,” Mr. Bank said. “It never occurred to him to reserve the right to just call the whole thing off.”What Mr. Glazer most disliked about the play, it turned out, was the female lead, Dorothy Bridges, closely based on the journalist Martha Gellhorn, Hemingway’s mistress at the time and eventually his third wife. Like Gellhorn, Dorothy has a history of lovers, glamorous ones especially, and in the first act she guiltlessly detaches herself from a married man she has been seeing and takes up with Rawlings.Mr. Glazer thought the character was a nymphomaniac and rewrote the first act so that a shell-shocked Rawlings rapes her — on the assumption, apparently, that this would render her more sympathetic.“I think he completely failed to appreciate Dorothy, who is a delicious and complicated character,” Mr. Bank said, and he added that a lot of the play is about the little community that the residents of the hotel create for themselves under bombardment. The one thing people don’t do in such circumstances, Hemingway later wrote, is rape each other.The unpublished seven-page letter was discovered by Mr. Bank while trolling through the Theater Guild archive, in the Beinecke Library at Yale.Hemingway hoped it would be printed in The New York Times, and so here, some 70 years later, are some further excerpts:The food was very bad and very scarce so we used to cook in my room. At that time Sidney Franklin cooked the breakfasts and anybody was welcome to eat as long as they brought something toward the meal. If they didn’t bring anything toward the meal, Sidney would feed them once but he would insult that so that they rarely returned. ...Sidney’s bitterness reached its height when Miss Gellhorn wanted some tinned marmalade to keep in her own room in case she would not be breakfasting with the rest of the mess.Hemingway was called Pop in those days, and his boss was John Wheeler of the North American Newspaper Alliance, who paid him a dollar a word, far more than the others were getting.“Who does that lady think she is?” Sidney asked us all. “I’ll bet that lady doesn’t make in a month as much as Pop could make in a day.” “If Pop worked steady,” he would add sorrowfully. Sidney owned ten percent of me at the time and we faced no tragedy great than a hold-down order from Jack Wheeler. Sidney is a great and old friend and being a professional bull fighter for years he knows exactly how much you should expose yourself to death for the amount of cash received.Hemingway described one of the bombardments this way:Something you can’t put on the stage but that would be good in a picture was the first big shelling of the Florida. The hotel was packed when the shelling started just at daylight and after the first shell hit the front of the building, (seven more hit it that day and over eleven hundred were fired into the town), there was a sort of mass migration from the rooms on the side that faced the lines. Couples carrying their mattresses over their backs scuttled across the halls on every floor like a movement of the lemmings. Then in the crashing and the rolling clouds of dust Antoine de Saint Exupéry started to give away grapefruits. He had brought two bushel of them from Valencia and this was his first bombardment and he was handling it by giving away grapefruits.Crash. More dust. People lying under the mattresses. Screams from ladies awakened too early and abruptly.Crash. More dust. Strong smell of cordite and blasted granite. Pieces of masonry fall through skylight. Ladies under mattresses who have not thought of facing eternity until awakened give serious thoughts to same.The letter ends with Hemingway describing what it was like to work on a play for a change:About writing the play itself: I was excited and happy to be able to write the dialogue without having to write about places. That is you could say a place was such and so. You did not have to really make it as in a novel so that the reader can walk in and know it is true. A set designer would have to make it from your knowledge.I can write dialogue on a typewriter because it goes faster than I can use a pencil. But when I make country, or a city, or a river in a novel it is slow work because you have to always make it, then it is alive. But nobody makes anything quickly nor easily if it is any good.The making part of a play comes after the writing of it. Other people do all the great detail that you just indicate when you write. Right now I have been working steadily for a year and a month on a novel. In that no one can help you. But in a play the credit for all the really hard work goes to those who stage, direct, and act in it. I had all the fun. They had all the work. Well, that is a nice kind of an exchange for once.The one good lucky thing was that I happened to have a room in the Hotel Florida from March 1937 to May 1938 at a time when you could learn as much at the Hotel Florida in those years as you could learn anywhere in the world. I did not spend all those months in that room. But each time I came back to that room I had learned something. And the shelling and the rest of it were very good to keep you from kidding yourself about many things.Letter text printed with the permission of the Ernest Hemingway Foundation.'"
"'08-02-10,'0','I went on in that essay to explain how the quarry I would seek through the ivy would deliver me from loneliness and panic and might even “pin” me with a fraternity pin, typically sported on the left breast, maybe by my sophomore year. We would live in a little white house with a picket fence and I’d wear an apron.The teaching assistant was appalled and let me know it. To my everlasting shame, he reminded me in stern longhand on that first college paper that Penn was an institution with a heritage of intellectual excellence, and that perhaps I was taking up someone else’s legitimate space.My only defense, then as now, is that I was telling the truth as I saw it.I did get chosen. I married the second man who asked me. I was, after all, graduating from college and frighteningly bereft of other prospects. He was an “older man,” sweet, funny and promising. According to my mother, he “had a future.”We met on a blind date during the “fix-up” Neanderthal days, when that was the standard way to meet. We had a whirlwind romance — I remember that several months into it, we realized that we’d never seen each other in daylight. It was a powerful metaphor for the limits of a relationship that consisted solely of dating on weekends.Vic was already a lawyer and a full-fledged grown-up of 27. He had a day job, while I was still analyzing the water imagery in Coleridge and deciding what I wanted to be when I grew up.Nine months after that blind date, we were married at my Philadelphia synagogue in a proper Jewish wedding that my parents planned because I was busy taking my senior year finals.Frankly, we barely knew each other. That elusive daylight had not yet filtered into our relationship. We had certainly never lived together or even thought about it. I had, of course, “saved myself” for my husband, as nice girls did back then.So for us, marriage was a wild and primitive country.I cried on our honeymoon in Bermuda because Vic was impatient with me about getting to the dining room for the first dinner seating. Rock Hudson didn’t yell at Doris Day, and some of my images about marriage were based on that obviously questionable Hollywood foundation.Who knew that this man who was my husband got grouchy when he was hungry? Who knew that in 47 years of marriage, that wouldn’t change?We did live in a little white house, minus the Hollywood picket fence, which worked right into my marriage script, until we learned more than either of us ever wanted to know about mortgage payments, lawn care and plumbing backups.We had pictured candlelit dinners and waltzes under crystal chandeliers, but he made $4,300 a year, and I made less. By our second Valentine’s Day, I had already “retired” from teaching in the full bloom of a first pregnancy. By our fourth Valentine’s Day, we were bursting out of our little white house thanks to the arrival of another infant. By our sixth, our third daughter had joined us and there wasn’t a chandelier in sight.Through those early years the marriage ripened, strangely sweetened by the realities of children. Later on, when we became a two-career couple, the standard flash points about love and work created new skirmishes. Life got harder for me, but much richer for us. And somewhere along the line — years after the wedding china was terminally chipped and the silver spoons had been crazily bent by the garbage disposal — we realized we were lifers.Despite the petty arguments about whose fault it was that we bought the wrong sofa, what constitutes a civilized temperature indoors in winter and why he still never gets it right about how to rewind the answering machine, our joint venture has flourished.We used to talk about how it would be when the kids were gone — how we’d take off for Alaska or the Far East on a whim, or go to the movies at midnight. And suddenly, they were gone, the silence crawling through their empty bedrooms. And we did none of those things.Instead, we argue about whose turn it is to unload the dishwasher. He continues to crack his knuckles in a way that drives me up the wall. I continue to mess up the interior of his pristine car with assorted junk. We are petty and petulant with each other. Needs go unmet, dreams go unfulfilled. And still I know with clarity that we are living in a state of grace.After years of concentrating on our children, we’re back to that first stage of marriage — just you and me, kid. Sometimes it’s lonely. But more often, it’s not. This new era comes with seven magnificent grandchildren and a deeper, more nourishing connection between two very married Valentines. It beats the hearts-on-fire stuff. It touches the marrow.We are each other’s homeland.'"
"'08-02-10,'0','SOME of the most expensive and historic mansions on the Upper East Side pay no taxes at all, and the number is growing. These are, of course, the properties picked up over the years by foreign governments, at a time when prices were far lower than they are today.But last month, amid a spate of record town house sales, the Russian Federation paid $35 million for a 25-foot-wide brick and limestone town house on East 75th Street with the help of Carrie Chiang, a broker for the Corcoran Group. That sale ranked in the top 10 town house sales in Manhattan in January.The house has a deep extension and, according to a recent listing, 12,000 square feet of space, including an ornate living room that had been used for party scenes for “Gossip Girl,” a television series about life among young socialites on the Upper East Side. The Russian envoy to the United Nations will use the house.The seller was Dr. Michael Evans Sachs, a Manhattan plastic surgeon who is facing a civil suit related to the death of an Irish woman hours after cosmetic surgery in his office, according to court records. His broker was Joanna Cutler.The mansions used as ambassadorial residences or consulates include the third most expensive town house in city property records. That Federal Revival town house at 690 Park Avenue, declared a landmark, is listed in property records as a single-family home worth $37 million. It would have an annual tax bill of $213,000, if it had not been owned by the government of Italy since 1959.In fact, 6 of the 20 town houses with the highest listed market value in New York City are owned by foreign governments, including Italy, Iraq, Indonesia and Korea. Cameroon, a country in West Central Africa, with a population of about 18 million, owns a town house on East 73rd Street, valued at $18.5 million, and used by its permanent representative to the United Nations.'"

"'08-02-10,'0','On Feb. 1, Continental upped the number of miles required for some of its so-called EasyPass awards, raising the price of a first-class domestic flight to 100,000 miles from 90,000, and the price of the so-called SaverPass award to 50,000 from 45,000. And Delta did away with a key selling point of its premium SkyChoice awards (which cost twice as much, 50,000 miles for a domestic ticket, as its basic SkySaver award): a guarantee of an award ticket as long as there was an open seat on the plane. “SkyChoice Award Ticket Reservations will continue to be available on most Delta flights,” according to a statement on , “but seats will be limited and possibly unavailable on some flights.”Tim Winship, editor at large for and the publisher of , said, “The currency has been devalued.” He added, “It’s been this incremental process whereby they raise a little here, they raise a little there, they cut back on the availability of restricted awards, which has the effect of forcing people to redeem twice as many miles.”And if award-ticket inflation weren’t enough, many airlines have also imposed shorter expiration dates. American, United and have 18-month expiration policies, and Delta has cut the life span of its SkyMiles from three years to two. The latest to cut back is Alaska Airlines. Effective April 1, it will wipe the miles from any account that has been idle for two years.The airlines say they give away plenty of award seats each year. In fact, they say, more frequent-flier tickets are being awarded than ever: American Airlines issued 4.8 million AAdvantage award tickets and upgrades last year, up about 85 percent from 2006. And Continental issued 1.84 million OnePass award tickets and upgrades last year, up 7.6 percent from the previous year. Those numbers, however, don’t reflect how many customers tried to use their miles and failed.Indeed, many frequent fliers have given up trying to score the cheapest award tickets, which typically start at 25,000 miles, saying that it’s an exercise in futility. “I never expect to get the saver awards,” said Chris Schmandt, a research scientist from Winchester, Mass., who is an elite flier on United. “I basically go into it thinking I’m going to spend the premium award.”And judging by the recent mileage cutbacks, it’s probably not going to be any easier. To get the most out of their miles, customers are going to new extremes. To redeem tickets for her parents from to Honolulu for a winter vacation, Mary Tuohy, an elite Continental flier from Manalapan, N.J., searched every day for six months. “This was my daily job from June until November — checking on a daily basis, sometimes twice a day,” she said. Eventually the effort paid off, though it still required some creative booking. The airline suddenly released some award seats on the dates she wanted, and Ms. Tuohy was able to use 55,000 miles for one ticket (coach on the outbound flight, first class on the return). For the second ticket, she paid $1,150 for coach seats and used 17,500 miles to upgrade the return flight to first class.Beyond obsessively checking for new award seats, there’s unfortunately little that mileage members can do to improve their chances. One strategy is to search for flights with less demand, like off-season destinations. Award tickets to , for example, are still available if you travel before the summer high season. A recent search on found plenty of American Airlines tickets between New York and through May 15 that only cost 40,000 miles — its cheapest MilesSaver award category.Award tickets may also be available on new routes that have yet to gain traction. Delta, which recently added nonstop service from Kennedy Airport to , still had a smattering of its lowest SkySaver awards (30,000 for the ) available in a recent search for February and March, despite its being St. Lucia’s high season.Be sure to check for award seats on partner airlines. Some airlines are starting to make it easier to do so online. Delta’s Web site now lets you search for award tickets for SkyTeam alliance partners, including Continental and Northwest. And don’t hesitate to pick up the phone and call the airline directly, recommended Randy Petersen, editor of InsideFlyer magazine. While most airlines charge fees for making award reservations by phone, a booking agent can often pull together an award itinerary using partner airlines. All the major carriers are part of an airline alliance like oneworld, SkyTeam or Star Alliance, which allow travelers to redeem miles for flights on other members.Check out the online forums of FlyerTalk.com, FrequentFlier.com and , where mile-obsessed travelers share their strategies for earning and redeeming miles. Some airlines also point out routes on their Web sites that have good award availability at a given time of year. American Airlines recently listed ; Santa Ana, Calif.; and among its February AAdvantage Hotspots. US Airways offers its own “best bets for award travel” on .If you can’t find a coach ticket, consider upgrading on longer flights. “You may be better served from a value standpoint,” said Mr. Winship of FrequentFlier.com. While a coach ticket from to costs 25,000 miles, it may be worth only $198 if you bought it yourself. Upgrading to first class, on the other hand, sets you back 30,000 miles, but the ticket would normally cost $1,158 based on recent prices. For the extra legroom, tastier meals and state of mind, it may be well worth your while.Frequent-flier miles are becoming harder to redeem for airline tickets. Here are some tips:Search for off-season destinations, like in the spring. The fact that airlines are offering deals like $398 to suggests that there are likely to be seats up for grabs for travelers looking to use miles.Look for new routes, like Delta’s flight from Kennedy Airport to , which started on Nov. 15, or American’s from Kennedy Airport to , as more seats are often available on recently started routes.Cast a wider net by seeking out partner airlines. No award seats to on American? Try its partner Cathay Pacific, which flies there via .Keep checking. Airlines typically load seat inventory 330 days in advance but can release award seats at any time based on cancellations, changes or demand levels.'"

"'08-02-11,'1','The coalition of hedge funds that wants to place directors on the board of The New York Times Company has more than doubled its stake in the company, to at least 9.96 percent of the regular shares, according to federal records filed Monday.One of the hedge funds, Firebrand Partners, has said that it wants the company to sell some assets, but that it is not seeking to change the Sulzberger family’s control of the company. In addition to The New York Times newspaper, the company owns The Boston Globe, a number of smaller newspapers and About.com; it sold its string of television stations last year.The family trust owns most of the Class B shares in The Times Company; the voting for 9 of the 13 board members is restricted to holders of Class B shares. Firebrand is seeking to install a slate of candidates in the remaining four seats, which are chosen by Class A shareholders.The company revealed in late January that the coalition, led by Harbinger Capital Partners, a part of the Harbert Management Corporation, had accumulated just under 5 percent of the Class A shares and nominated four people for the board.In a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, the group revealed that it had bought many more shares since then. The filing lists several holdings by different entities, many of which appear to overlap, making it unclear how many shares it controls.The largest stake listed is 14.25 million shares, or about 10 percent of the Class A stock, a figure that might or might not also represent the total that the coalition has accumulated.'"
"'08-02-11,'1','The campaign has a budget of $120,000, which is being supplemented with pro bono contributions arranged by Rawle Murdy that are worth an additional $70,000, in areas like production and media.Voting continues through March 8, when the new building for the animal society is scheduled to open.The campaign is emblematic of a time-tested marketing tactic known as borrowed interest, which seeks to reach consumers by riding piggyback — to cite another kind of animal — on a news event, a societal issue or a trend in the popular culture.Every four years, the race for the White House becomes the inspiration for a slew of ads presenting products as candidates — or, as Anheuser-Busch proclaimed in the 1960s of Budweiser beer, “our can-to-date.”In recent years, the use of election trappings to sell brands had been on the wane as many Americans seemed turned off by the political process.This time around, however, Madison Avenue is taking advantage of the public’s growing involvement in the presidential race as evidenced by large voter turnouts for primaries and caucuses in states like South Carolina as well as high ratings for televised debates.Examples include, in addition to the Charleston Animal Society campaign, ads for Stonyfield Farm yogurt, which urge consumers to “vote in the flavor primaries and choose our next new yogurt”; a campaign for Svedka vodka, centered on its “fembot” spokescharacter being elected president; commercials for Pizza Hut that remind consumers to vote; and a political-themed campaign for the spray version of I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter, featuring its brand mascot, Spraychel.Borrowing the interest the public has in the elections makes sense for the animal society, says its actual, human president, Charlie Karesh, because the campaign is “not just about raising money, it’s about making people aware of what we do.”“I was a little skeptical people would jump on it,” he adds. “But people come up to me — people I know, and people I don’t know — and are talking about it, and the local media have loved it.”Indeed, The Moultrie News, an area weekly newspaper, ran an editorial endorsing Biscuit, while the candidacy of Spike was backed by another local publication, Lowcountry Dog magazine.Real local officeholders and public figures are also weighing in. For instance, Biscuit has been endorsed by Harry Hallman, the mayor of Mt. Pleasant, S.C., and Bobby Cremins, the basketball coach at the College of Charleston.Among those collared by Spike are Joseph P. Riley Jr., the mayor of Charleston, and Keith Summey, the mayor of North Charleston.Each candidate has a section on the SpikevsBiscuit Web site devoted to wooing the voters. Spike’s slogan is “I like Spike,” echoing the winning slogan of 1952, “I like Ike,” as in Dwight D. Eisenhower. Biscuit’s slogan is “Biscuit ’08.”Each candidate also has its own Web site, votespike.org and votebiscuit.org, as well as its own pages on the third-party Web sites. For example, on Facebook Spike is “Spike Charleston” (facebook.com/people/Spike_Charleston/783569682) and Biscuit is “Cat Named Biscuit” (facebook.com/people/Cat_NamedBiscuit/787744374).Of all the many elements of the campaign that are inspired by real electoral races, perhaps the most faithful to their source — and the most hilarious — are the video clips being posted on YouTube, which are styled like political commercials.Both Biscuit and Spike appear in introductory spots that offer upbeat biographies of their lives. Both appear in commercials to promote their, er, pet issues: for Biscuit, health care and owner education, and for Spike, animal adoption and animal rights.Biscuit’s campaign manager, “Chairman Meow,” even turns up in some of her clips.And because animals sometimes descend to the level of human beings, there are videos produced to resemble political attack ads.Biscuit, in one clip, seeks to demonstrate her identity as “the pet health care candidate” by revealing she was spayed, then declaring: “What’d Spike do? He went to the park and slobbered on tennis balls.”Biscuit goes negative in another commercial, which shows photographs of her opponent in black and white — as human attack ads are wont to do. A photo of Spike near a Pepsi-Cola vending machine elicits the charge from Biscuit that Spike “buckles to the demands of shameless product placement.”Spike does not take the attacks lying down. Well, he takes some of them lying down because he is, after all, a dog.But Spike does bite back in one clip in which is seen campaigning. He charges, “I don’t see Biscuit on the trail, working as hard as me.”Bruce Murdy, president at Rawle Murdy, says the animal society “needed to stand out in some way,” but “we knew we had little money to build awareness.”“We wanted to get buzz going,” he adds, “and we decided to leverage the power of the Web, of social networking, which do that.”When the agency began working on the campaign in late November, Mr. Murdy says, the anticipation for the South Carolina primary on Jan. 26 was already building.“People in South Carolina believed they were a little more connected to the vote because they had an early primary election,” he adds. “We thought, ‘Let’s jump on that; let’s have some fun.’ ”Rawle Murdy intends to echo more aspects of actual election campaigns before the voting ends on March 8.For instance, “we had planned on adding a dark-horse candidate,” Mr. Murdy says, but the public beat the agency to it last week when a Charleston radio station announced the potential entry into the race of a snake named Hissy.“Social networking gets people engaged and lets them participate in a way they can’t with a traditional ad,” Mr. Murdy says, “taking it to a level beyond what you can hope for in traditional media.”There is also a way to participate in this election that differs from others: Visitors to spikevsbiscuit.org can vote more than once for their favorite candidate.“This is the one time you can ‘vote often,’ ” Mr. Murdy says, laughing as he invokes the venerable political advice, attributed to a mayor of Chicago, William Hale Thompson, to “vote early and often.”If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that appears Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times newspaper and on nytimes.com.'"

"'08-02-11,'1','When the two-day Westminster extravaganza begins Monday at Madison Square Garden, more than 2,500 purebred dogs will compete to win their breed competitions, which will enable them to vie for supremacy in each of seven groups, from which the Best in Show champion will be chosen Tuesday.Mick played the Garden in 2001, 2002 and 2003, winning the terrier group each time before he became the first Kerry blue to win it all.He defeated one of his sons in 2002, and a daughter in 2003. And since his retirement from competition five years ago, 20 of the 45 Kerry blues showing at Westminster were his offspring, including Ch. Sethfield Gazon Mickbeth, a bitch that will be in the breeding ring Monday at 11 a.m.“He’s my stud of studs,” McFadden, a prominent handler, said Friday from Acampo, Calif., where he and his wife, Taffe, run Bold Oaks Kennel. “I’ve never shown anyone with that kind of impact on the breed.”Mick’s matings escalated after he won the elite Crufts dog show in 2000 in England and then immigrated to the United States to discover an appetite to produce more just like him — or better.“The breeders went nuts and his fan base exploded,” McFadden said.He added: “In the spring and fall, when the bitches were in season, he might have two or three bitches in a day, sometimes two or three a week.“When I ran his campaign, he was always a stallion.”Mick’s reproductive toils, which usually took 30 to 45 minutes, slowed because of a prostate condition that led to his being neutered last year.But, McFadden said, “I don’t think it affected his psyche.”Perpetuating the bloodlines of purebred animals is as crucial to the dog business as it is to thoroughbred horse racing. If there is money to be made in showing dogs, it is in stud fees and in puppies like Mick’s progeny.But it is not thoroughbred-size money, considering that cash prizes at dog shows are modest, or nonexistent, and that the costs of travel, advertising, health care, grooming and handlers are significant. Canine stud fees of a few hundred to a few thousand dollars (or, simply, a pick-of-the-litter puppy) are minor compared with the $300,000 required to retain the siring services of thoroughbreds like A. P. Indy or Storm Cat. Storm Cat, now 25, commanded a $500,000 stud fee as recently as 2002.“It’s a hobby,” said David Frei, the Westminster Club’s director of communications and the longtime analyst for the show’s broadcasts on USA, this year from 8 to 9 p.m. Eastern on Monday (moving to CNBC from 9 to 11 p.m.) and from 8 to 11 p.m. Tuesday. “The only dog that makes money is a great stud dog, but if you’re doing it enough to make money, you’re overusing the dog.”Pat Trotter, a Westminster judge and a breeder of Norwegian elkhounds, said: “True dog breeders live for their dogs, not off of them. The people who show at Westminster are trying to develop a quality bloodline of dogs, and they recognize that they won’t pay for themselves.”There are productive studs in every breed. Mick is actually the second-ranked sire among Kerry blues. The top distinction belongs to a star of the 1960s, Ch. Melbee’s Chances Are, who produced 66 champions, said Thomas Rogers, the president of the United States Kerry Blue Terrier Club.One of Trotter’s Norwegian elkhounds, Howdy Rowdy, produced 166 champions, she said. Ten of his descendants have won the hound group at Westminster, and one was last year’s top dog in the breed nationally.Ch. Bang Away of Sirrah Crest, or Bangaway, a boxer, won it all at Westminster in 1951 and was a prodigious sire.“He was the turning point from boxers of yesteryear, who were thicker-necked and chunkier, to the more elegant boxers we know today,” Trotter said in a telephone interview from Antioch, Tenn.She added: “For each breed, there are only a couple of great sires. There is a difference between being able to produce and being a good sire. The mark of a great sire is his ability to produce dogs like himself.”Carrying on such genetic production with chilled or frozen sperm is expanding as an impersonal, but scientific, alternative to a live coupling, reducing the cost of flying females hither and yon and the potential of injury.Chilled semen is used for a quick turnover — a sample is viable for about three days — but the frozen version can last indefinitely.Chilled or frozen semen is collected from a stud dog egged on by a “teaser” female in heat, a practice similar to what is used in horse breeding. Once the sample is received, it is injected into the female or implanted into the female’s cervix, said Bill Truesdale, a veterinarian who owns the International Canine Semen Bank franchise in Seekonk, Mass.In Seekonk, stud fees run from $800 to $1,500, depending on the qualities, merits and rarity of the breed.“The advantage to frozen semen is storing it forever, but the problem is, once you thaw it, the active motility is 12 hours, so we have to make sure the bitch is fertile,” Truesdale said.Truesdale’s bank holds more than 1,000 cryogenically frozen samples. About half are derived from deceased or now-sterile dogs, including a few collected from a golden retriever 21 years ago and 40 from his boxer Biff (Ch. High-Tech’s Arbitrage), who was profiled in the New Yorker in 1995.“I’ll be dead before we run out of samples for Biff,” Truesdale said.Mick, the Kerry blue, is still high spirited, but he is no longer potent and there is not much of his frozen semen left.“I kind of wish we had more,” McFadden said. “Mick’s owner has opted to keep the last little bit and put it on hold to breed daughters and granddaughters back to him.”'"
"'08-02-11,'1','President Bush staged an event in the East Room last week for his unconfirmed appointees and repeated a story line so tired that it’s hard to imagine even he believes it. His nominations — of judges, top Justice Department officials and others — are stalled, he said, because of undue Senate delay. The real problem, of course, is that 15 months after American voters put the Democrats in control of the Senate, Mr. Bush is still trying to muscle far-right ideologues with troubling records into important positions.To hear Mr. Bush tell it, he has been the nation’s meritocrat in chief. The man who brought us Alberto Gonzales to head the Justice Department and Michael Brown to run the Federal Emergency Management Agency said at the Thursday gathering that he had “nominated skilled and faithful public servants to lead federal agencies and sit on the federal bench.”One of the most prominent people Mr. Bush is stomping his foot over is Steven Bradbury, his choice to head the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. Mr. Bradbury is best known for signing legal opinions that cleared the way for harsh interrogation techniques, and perhaps torture. He has also defended the administration’s lawless domestic surveillance programs.Another of the unrequited, Hans von Spakovsky, a nominee to the Federal Election Commission, used his position in the Justice Department to put up barriers to voting by minority groups. He was instrumental in changing the focus of the voting section from defending voting rights to advancing a partisan agenda.And then there are the patently unsuitable judicial nominees. Richard Honaker, Mr. Bush’s nominee for the District Court in Wyoming, is an extreme anti-abortion activist with troubling views on the role of religion in public life.The Senate’s Democratic leaders offered a compromise that would have allowed Mr. Bush to put 84 of the more than 180 nominees in place through recess appointments. They have been rebuffed, they say, because Mr. Bush is insisting above all on getting Mr. Bradbury confirmed. That and, apparently, putting on a good show for the base. Mr. Bush’s East Room event conveniently coincided with the start of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington.'"
"'08-02-11,'1','WASHINGTON — President Bush broke his silence on the 2008 presidential race on Sunday, giving his imprimatur to Senator John McCain of Arizona as a “true conservative,” who nonetheless has “got some convincing to do” to persuade fellow Republicans of his bona fides with the right.The remark, in an hourlong interview broadcast on “Fox News Sunday,” was as close to an endorsement as Mr. McCain will get from Mr. Bush at this stage, before a nominee has been officially declared. It was also a sharp departure for Mr. Bush, who had refused to be drawn into commenting on the race.“I think that if John’s the nominee, he’s got some convincing to do to convince people that he is a solid conservative,” Mr. Bush told the Fox host, Chris Wallace. “And I’ll be glad to help him if he’s the nominee, because he is a conservative.”With conservative pundits like Rush Limbaugh saying that a McCain nomination would destroy the Republican Party, the senator’s advisers had been hoping for just this sort of public embrace. It came on the heels of Mr. Bush’s call for unity in a speech Friday to the Conservative Political Action Conference, which was also widely interpreted as an implicit endorsement of Mr. McCain.Until now, with the exception of an early prediction that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York would be the Democratic nominee, Mr. Bush had done his best to steer clear of extensive discussions of the candidates, especially the Republicans. He has repeatedly said he will not be the “pundit in chief,” and said on Sunday that he did not want to get “into the trap again of getting involved in this primary.”'"

"'08-02-11,'1','However, when it has come to making big deals, it has balked until recently. In late 2003, Microsoft talked to the big German business software maker SAP about buying it. The deal, had it been pursued, would have cost Microsoft more than $50 billion.The talks, made public in a court case in 2004, were abandoned, Microsoft said, because of the “complexity of the potential transaction,” especially the management headaches of trying to put the two big software companies together.Mr. Liddell, who calls himself Microsoft’s “gatekeeper of funding,” spent the weekend devising ways to raise the stakes in the fight for Yahoo now that the company’s original proposal has been rejected, holding a series of marathon conference calls with his cadre of Wall Street advisers.More an accountant than a technologist, Mr. Liddell, who joined Microsoft after serving as chief financial officer at International Paper, the giant forest products company, clearly has no compunction about ruffling any digital feathers. Among his alternatives is a series of bare-knuckle Wall Street tactics: First, Microsoft is planning to crisscross the nation to meet with Yahoo’s largest shareholders in an election-style campaign, hoping they can put pressure on Yahoo’s board, people briefed on the company’s plans said.Microsoft may have an easier time than it could have had two weeks ago: since then, millions of Yahoo’s shares have traded hands to short-term-oriented hedge funds that typically favor a quick sale, as opposed to value investors who hold shares for the long term.Microsoft could also decide to make an offer directly to shareholders, called a tender offer, which would put more pressure on Yahoo’s board to negotiate. At the same time, Microsoft could also set a deadline for its bid, known as an “exploding offer.”And if Microsoft decides to make this a nasty battle, it could start a proxy contest to oust Yahoo’s board at its next election; it would have until March 13 to nominate a new slate of directors.Microsoft’s advisers in the takeover attempt are Morgan Stanley and the Blackstone Group. Its lawyers are Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft.They are facing Yahoo’s team of bankers at Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Moelis & Company, and its lawyers at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.Microsoft also hired outside public relations advisers, Joele Frank, Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher and Waggener Edstrom Worldwide. Yahoo has Abernathy-McGregor and Robinson, Lehrer, Montgomery.Microsoft may simply raise its offer to clinch a deal. Analysts have suggested the company could afford to pay as much as $35 a share for Yahoo, up from its current offer of $31.But Mr. Liddell, speaking generally about negotiations, seemed to suggest he was willing to play hardball. “You have to be willing to walk away,” said Mr. Liddell, who plays rugby regularly and has completed several triathlons.For Mr. Liddell, who sends e-mail messages to colleagues at all hours and is a PowerPoint whiz, the prospect of joining Microsoft as an outsider and trying to transform it into a financially oriented acquisition machine was daunting. “I knew there had been a history of people coming in here and it not working,” he said.Mr. Liddell was one of several high-profile outside hires at Microsoft in recent years including Ray Ozzie, the creator of Lotus Notes, as the company’s chief software architect; and B. Kevin Turner, a former Wal-Mart executive, as chief operating officer.Mr. Liddell, who has a master’s degree in philosophy from Oxford, found that with Bill Gates and the president, Steven A. Ballmer, “If you do a good job, you fit in. They don’t suffer people very well who don’t come prepared.”He has a background as an investment banker at Credit Suisse First Boston in Auckland. Since he joined the company, Microsoft has made 50 acquisitions.He has pushed the company to use its cash — it has spent $54 billion on stock buybacks and dividends since his arrival. And it has even taken on, dare it be said aloud at Microsoft, debt for the first time in the company’s history. If the company’s bid for Yahoo is successful, Microsoft will be doing both.'"
"'08-02-11,'1','The strategy comes into play when an executive holding a large amount of publicly traded stock that has gained in value wants to turn that stock into cash, but not immediately pay the capital gains taxes that apply when the stock is sold.Instead, the executive agrees at a future date to sell a chunk of the stock to an investment bank, in exchange for an immediate cash payout. The executive pays the taxes on the stock when he actually turns over the shares to the bank, typically many years later.To protect itself against potential losses should the pledged stock fall in value, the bank then hedges its bet by borrowing the pledged shares from the executive and selling them short, betting that they will fall in price.The executives and banks argue that the shares are technically borrowed by the bank, not sold to it, and that the transaction is thus not a sale resulting in a cash payment that is immediately subject to taxation..The bank gets “all the benefits and burdens of ownership in the pledged shares,” making it a true sale and thus taxable to the executive, according to the technical paper, which is dated Feb. 6 and was published by Tax Analysts, a trade publication, on Friday.The I.R.S. paper also instructs agency employees to determine if the strategies are “reportable transactions,” technical language that can refer to an abusive tax shelter.Reportable transactions are characterized by, among other things, confidentiality agreements between the taxpayer and the bank or accounting firm that carried out the transaction, and by fees based on the amount of tax to be saved or deferred. Unlike “listed transactions,” they can be legal, but under stiffer 2004 rules aimed at combating tax shelter abuses, taxpayers still have to disclose their use to the I.R.S.The matter does not appear to involve any violations of securities laws or any of the offshore tax components that are under heightened I.R.S. scrutiny.Wall Street banks entered into scores of the transactions with executives in recent years, according to Mark H. Leeds, a tax lawyer at Greenberg Traurig in New York.Mr. Willens, the corporate tax consultant, said executives liked the strategy because it allowed them to diversify their investments by taking large quantities of stock in a single company, converting the shares to cash and then buying other stocks, while delaying payment of taxes associated with the sale. “This is the most popular deferral technique that exists,” he said.But some users are able to reduce taxes as well as defer them, and that may be upsetting the I.R.S. Mr. Leeds said that some executives, by carrying out the transactions through partnerships and the like, could be avoiding payment of ordinary income tax, at rates of 35 percent.In 2003, apparently unaware that an increasing number of the prepaid forward contracts involved share lending, the I.R.S. declared them valid.But by 2006, when it had started to figure out how the transactions work, it issued a memorandum saying that they were not.“I think that it is fair to say that the I.R.S. has had buyer’s remorse over its original ruling for some time,” Mr. Leeds said. He said the agency was asking banks about how the transactions worked, though he would not identify the banks.'"
"'08-02-11,'1','Talk about premature congratulation: The Boston Globe had planned to run a supplement marking a big Super Bowl win for the New England Patriots in its Feb. 4 issue. Instead the paper carried the forlorn front-page headline “History Derailed.”“We had planned special sections in the event of a victory, but none was printed,” said Al Larkin, a spokesman for The Globe.The special supplement wasn’t the only thing derailed. The Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Company, had also been selling advance copies of a commemorative book, “19-0: The Historic Championship Season of New England’s Unbeatable Patriots,” on Amazon.com for $14.95. But that book, compiled by the paper’s sports staff, was also scrapped at the last minute when the Patriots were upset by the New York Giants in a cliffhanger ending.Some backseat quarterbacks went online to accuse The Globe of cheekiness, complaining that the very existence of the pre-sale book might have given the Giants an extra incentive to win. But Mr. Larkin said that other publishers — of the instant-book variety — had offered similar books about the presumptive historic Patriots season (and, indeed, books were available instantly about the Giants upset). “The publication was canceled as a result of the outcome of the game,” he added.A spokeswoman for Amazon.com, Tammy Hovey, said that the site would not release sales figures for “19-0” but did say that the title was removed from the site after the game, since the final score determined that the book would not be printed.“Any pre-orders placed for the title were canceled,” she said by e-mail. “Per Amazon’s usual policy, customers are not charged for pre-orders until the product physically ships. So in this case, none of the customers who pre-ordered this item were charged any fee.”'"
"'08-02-11,'1','High levels of lead were found in a handful of well-known baby products made of vinyl plastic by an environmental group based in California that spread the word about lead on vinyl baby bibs and lunchboxes.The products include a Medela-brand cooler for storing breast milk, a carrying case sold with the First Years breast pump manufactured by RC2, a Playtex baby bottle cooler and a vinyl pacifier carrying case made by Skip Hop.The Center for Environmental Health, the group that did the tests, purchased the products in January and tested them first with a hand-held metal detector and then at a laboratory. The products were found to have from 1,100 parts per million of lead to 5,500 parts per million of lead, the group says.Still, the findings are bound to be criticized within the plastics and children’s products industries, which claim that lead in plastic is not a health concern. Federal law bans lead from paint used on toys and other children’s products, but there is no mandatory federal rule about lead inside other materials in children’s products.Legislators are considering new laws about product safety, and one provision in the proposed law would put a limit on the total amount of lead that could be in children’s products, no matter the materials. If enacted, that limit might forbid lead in plastic at the levels found by the California group. The group contends that no level of lead is safe in children’s products.'"

"'08-02-11,'1','While I agree with your editorial urging changes to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, you do not note the steps that Congress has taken to address consumer safety and the pending legislation that will make the changes you advocate.Last fall, as chairman of the Senate subcommittee that oversees financing for the C.P.S.C., we provided the commission with its largest budget increase in more than 30 years. Those funds, nearly $20 million over the president’s request, allowed the commission to hire additional staff members, modernize equipment and secure new testing facilities.But financing is only part of the problem. Legislative efforts to strengthen the agency have been repeatedly blocked by those seeking to weaken the bill at the request of industry and at the expense of consumers, all with the blessing of the Bush administration.Since October, Democrats have tried to bring to the floor a bill that would more than double C.P.S.C.’s budget, increase staffing levels by nearly 20 percent, increase fines and give the commission greater authority to inspect and recall products.American consumers need a safety agency that works. We have the bill. All we need now is the will.The writer is assistant majority leader in the Senate.'"
"'08-02-11,'1','Before the elections on Saturday, Mr. McCain seemed ready to begin casting the net wide for those independent voters.“We have to energize our base and yet continue to reach out because we know that the formula for success in most campaigns, as you know, is your base, independents and Reagan Democrats,” he told reporters on a flight from Wichita, Kan., to Seattle.In an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” President Bush proclaimed Mr. McCain, of Arizona, a “true conservative,” but added that there was still fence-mending to do with the party’s conservative base.“I think that if John is the nominee,” Mr. Bush said, “he has got some convincing to do to convince people that he is a solid conservative. And I’ll be glad to help him if he is the nominee.”Mr. McCain’s strong showing on Tuesday forced former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts from the contest and left Mr. Huckabee as the last major hurdle between Mr. McCain and the nomination.In Mr. Huckabee, Mr. McCain has found an opponent who is in some ways the best of rivals, and, in other ways, the worst of rivals.Mr. Huckabee has avoided negative campaigning as a general rule, and has been almost scrupulous in treating Mr. McCain with respect. At a point where public attention to the all-but-settled Republican presidential contest might have lagged, Mr. Huckabee’s competitiveness guarantees that will not happen.But while it is unlikely that Mr. Huckabee will win, he can bloody Mr. McCain before the contest is decided.When Mr. Huckabee told an audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week that he favored a constitutional amendment banning abortion and an amendment defining marriage as the union of a man and woman, the roar of the crowd was as much a rebuke of Mr. McCain, who has declined to support both proposals, as it was support for the speaker.Mr. Huckabee followed up that appearance with a visit Sunday to the Rev. Jerry Falwell’s church in Lynchburg, Va. In an address to the congregation, Mr. Huckabee marveled at “what an incredible influence” Mr. Falwell, who died last year, “had in this country,” and he emphasized how fond he had always been of the man who founded the Moral Majority. He did not have to remind the parishioners that Mr. McCain once called their former pastor an agent of intolerance.To the delight of his supporters, Mr. Huckabee has insisted that he intends to press on, despite the delegate count weighing heavily against him.“His supporters are true believers who don’t care so much about pragmatic considerations,” said Todd Harris, who served as communications director for Fred D. Thompson’s campaign. “They believe he has a message and that that message should be heard. And as long as they keep sending him money, it will be.”As if to reinforce that notion, Mr. Huckabee’s campaign vowed on Sunday that it would be “exploring all available legal options” regarding the outcome in Washington State.“The Huckabee campaign is deeply disturbed by the obvious irregularities in the Washington State Republican precinct caucuses,” the campaign’s chairman, Ed Rollins, said in a statement. “It is very unfortunate that the Washington State party chairman, Luke Esser, chose to call the race for John McCain after only 87 percent of the vote was counted.”The McCain campaign declined to comment on the Huckabee campaign’s statement. “We respect Governor Huckabee and his decision to campaign as he sees fit,” said Jill Hazelbaker, a McCain spokeswoman.On Friday, Mr. McCain said he understood the skepticism of some conservatives toward his candidacy. He said he had made overtures to conservatives, and would continue to do so.“Look, after 2000, there were a lot of McCainiacs who were very angry and bitter,” he said, referring to his bruising loss to Mr. Bush. “And after President Bush and I got together, I worked very hard to say, look, you know, a lot of people were bitter about South Carolina, a lot of people were bitter because, you know, when you invest your hard work and your effort and your passion into a candidate. I understand that there was a period there where you’ve got to unify people and get them to recognize what the major goal is.”'"
"'08-02-11,'1','The next move is now up to Microsoft and a largely unknown executive on the company’s sprawling campus, Christopher P. Liddell.Mr. Liddell, a former banker from New Zealand, is the behind-the-scenes architect of Microsoft’s hostile takeover, the company’s first unsolicited bid and perhaps the most audacious effort by a technology company to wrestle control of a competitor.With Yahoo’s board rejecting Microsoft’s advances, it will fall to Mr. Liddell, an outsider to the software industry who joined Microsoft as its chief financial officer just two years ago, to plot the company’s next steps in this bitter battle — and in the process, reshape Microsoft’s not-invented-here culture toward making aggressive acquisitions.“You have to be disciplined and ruthless,” Mr. Liddell said by telephone last week, before Yahoo’s board decided to rebuff the offer. “We should see acquisitions as a way of growth. We should not be embarrassed at all.”Microsoft has made acquisitions over the years, but mainly smaller ones to jump-start a fledgling business or pick up a needed technology. Its media player, voice recognition, health search and business software, among others, are technologies Microsoft bought along with the companies that created them.However, when it has come to making big deals, it has balked until recently. In late 2003, Microsoft talked to the big German business software maker, SAP, about buying it. The deal, had it been pursued, would have cost Microsoft more than $50 billion.The talks, made public in a court case in 2004, were abandoned, Microsoft said, because of the “complexity of the potential transaction,” especially the management headaches of trying to put the two big software companies together.Mr. Liddell, who calls himself Microsoft’s “gatekeeper of funding,” spent the weekend devising ways to raise the stakes in the fight for Yahoo now that the company’s original proposal has been rejected, holding a series of marathon conference calls with his cadre of Wall Street advisers.More an accountant than a technologist, Mr. Liddell, who joined Microsoft after serving as chief financial officer at International Paper, the giant forest products company, clearly has no compunction about ruffling any digital feathers. Among his alternatives is a series of bare-knuckle Wall Street tactics: First, Microsoft is planning to crisscross the nation to meet with Yahoo’s largest shareholders in an election-style campaign, hoping they can put pressure on Yahoo’s board, people briefed on the company’s plans said.Microsoft may have an easier time than it could have had two weeks ago: since then, millions of Yahoo’s shares have traded hands to short-term-oriented hedge funds that typically favor a quick sale, as opposed to value investors who hold shares for the long term.Microsoft could also decide to make an offer directly to shareholders, called a tender offer, which would put more pressure on Yahoo’s board to negotiate. At the same time, Microsoft could also set a deadline for its bid, known as an “exploding offer.”And if Microsoft decides to make this a nasty battle, it could start a proxy contest to oust Yahoo’s board at its next election; it would have until March 13 to nominate a new slate of directors.Microsoft’s advisers in the takeover effort are Morgan Stanley and the Blackstone Group. Its lawyers are Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft.They are facing Yahoo’s team of bankers at Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Moelis & Company, and its lawyers at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.Microsoft also hired outside public relations advisers, Joele Frank, Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher and Waggener Edstrom Worldwide. Yahoo has Abernathy-McGregor and Robinson, Lehrer, Montgomery.Microsoft may simply raise its offer to clinch a deal. But Mr. Liddell, speaking generally about negotiations, seemed to suggest he was willing to play hardball. “You have to be willing to walk away,” said Mr. Liddell, who plays rugby regularly and has completed several triathlons.For Mr. Liddell, who sends e-mail messages to colleagues at all hours and is a PowerPoint whiz, the prospect of joining Microsoft as an outsider and trying to transform it into a financially oriented acquisition machine was daunting. “I knew there had been a history of people coming in here and it not working,” he said.Mr. Liddell was one of several high-profile outside hires at Microsoft in recent years including Ray Ozzie, the creator of Lotus Notes, as the company’s chief software architect; and B. Kevin Turner, a former Wal-Mart executive, as chief operating officer.Mr. Liddell, who has a master’s degree in philosophy from Oxford, found that with Bill Gates and the president, Steven A. Ballmer, “If you do a good job, you fit in. They don’t suffer people very well who don’t come prepared.”He has a background as an investment banker at Credit Suisse First Boston in Auckland. Since he joined the company, Microsoft has made 50 acquisitions.He has pushed the company to use its cash — it has spent $54 billion on stock buybacks and dividends since his arrival. And it has even taken on, dare it be said aloud at Microsoft, debt for the first time in the company’s history. If the company’s bid for Yahoo is successful, Microsoft will be doing both.'"

"'08-02-12,'1','The following is the text as prepared for delivery of Senator John McCain’s speech to supporters after the Feb. 12 primaries, as provided by his campaign.Thank you. Thank you, voters of Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, for a clean sweep of the Potomac primary. I want to commend my friend, Governor Huckabee, whose spirited campaign, many gifts as a communicator and advocate, and passionate supporters are a credit to him and our party. He certainly keeps things interesting, a little too interesting at times tonight, I must confess. But I have even more reason to appreciate just how formidable a campaigner he is. And thank you, my friends, for your support and all your hard work. We have come a long way in this campaign, and we have had our ups and downs. But as luck, that product of opportunity and industry, would have it, we are approaching the end of the first half of this election on quite an upswing. Without your faith and commitment we would not be here, and I am immensely grateful to you.But now comes the hard part, and for America, the much bigger decision. We do not yet know for certain who will have the honor of being the Democratic Party's nominee for President. But we know where either of their candidates will lead this country, and we dare not let them. They will promise a new approach to governing, but offer only the policies of a political orthodoxy that insists the solution to government's failures is to simply make it bigger. They will appeal to our dreams of a better future for ourselves, our families and our country, but they would take from us more of the wealth we have earned to build those dreams and assure us that government is better able than we are to make decisions about our future for us. They will promise to break with the failed politics of the past, but will campaign in ways that seek to minimize their exposure to questions from the press and challenges from voters who ask more from their candidates than an empty promise of ""trust me, I know better."" They will paint a picture of the world in which America's mistakes are a greater threat to our security than the malevolent intentions of an enemy that despises us and our ideals; a world that can be made safer and more peaceful by placating our implacable foes and breaking faith with allies and the millions of people in this world for whom America, and the global progress of our ideals, has long been ""the last, best hope of earth.""We will offer different ideas, based in a better understanding of the challenges we face, and the resolve to confront them with confidence in the strength and ideals of free people. We believe that Americans, not our detractors and certainly not our enemies, are on the right side of history. We trust in the strength, industry and goodness of the American people. We don't believe that government has all the answers. We believe that government must respect the rights, property and opportunities of the people to whom we are accountable. We don't believe in growing the size of government to make it easier to serve our own ambitions. We believe that what government is expected to do, what we cannot do for ourselves individually, it must do with competence, resolve and wisdom.The American people don't send us to Washington to serve our self-interest, but to serve theirs. They don't send us to fight each other for our own political ambitions; but to fight together our real enemies. They don't send us to Washington to stroke our egos; but to help them keep this beautiful, bountiful, blessed country safe, prosperous, proud and free. They don't send us to Washington to take more of their money, and waste it on things that add not an ounce to America's strength and prosperity; that don't help a single family realize the dreams we all dream for our children; that don't help a single displaced worker find a new job, and the security and dignity it assures them; that won't keep the promise we make to young workers that the retirement they have begun to invest in, will be there for them when they need it. They don't send us to Washington to do their job, but to do ours; to do it better and with less of t heir money.'"

"'08-02-12,'1','LONDON — Switzerland’s two largest banks may have their Zurich headquarters within walking distance of each other but when it comes to weathering the credit crisis they are miles apart.One bank, Credit Suisse, said Tuesday that it had write-downs of 1.3 billion Swiss francs, or $1.18 billion, in the fourth quarter on debt related to the tight credit market and the subprime crisis in the United States.A larger rival, UBS, wrote down $14 billion in the same period. The difference is mainly the result of Credit Suisse’s management scaling back riskier investments before the subprime crisis started.“So far they’ve been doing better than UBS and it’s largely due to management decisions,” a fund manager at Swiss Canto Asset Management, Florian Esterer, said. “They still have the same old issues in asset management but their core business of investment banking and private banking seems to be doing O.K.”Credit Suisse’s fourth-quarter profit fell 72 percent to 1.33 billion francs, or 1.21 francs a share, from 4.67 billion francs, or 4.12 francs a share, in the same period of 2006. Unlike UBS, which is expected to report a record loss when it announces results on Thursday, Credit Suisse said its investment banking operation continued to report a profit in the quarter.'"
"'08-02-12,'1','In all, 168 pledged delegates were at stake for the Democrats and 116 for the Republicans. The Democrats will divide delegates proportionally to the candidates’ vote statewide and at the Congressional level while the Republican races were winner-take-all.Mr. Obama’s victories gave him a lead over Mrs. Clinton among pledged delegates, according to preliminary counts by the Obama campaign and some news organizations. Obama aides calculate that he also leads in delegate counts that include so-called superdelegates, the party officers and elected officials who control 20 percent of the total delegates to the Democratic convention.An exultant Mr. Obama told a rally in Madison, Wis.: “This movement wont stop until there’s change in Washington. Tonight, we’re on our way.”Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has suffered in recent weeks from overspending and internal upheaval, including the demotion of the campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, late last week and the resignation Tuesday of the deputy campaign manager, Mike Henry.Mrs. Clinton essentially conceded the three contests Tuesday morning by leaving Washington to campaign in Texas, and she signaled that she would not vigorously contest two Democratic races next week, a primary in Wisconsin and a caucus in Hawaii, where Mr. Obama spent much of his childhood. If she loses in those two states, she will be 0 for 10 in nominating contests from Feb. 5 to March 4, when Texas, Ohio, Rhode Island and Vermont hold primaries.Mrs. Clinton’s advisers say she will focus on winning over voters in Ohio and Texas to halt Mr. Obama’s growing momentum and to try to stay close in the count of pledged delegates. The Clinton campaign hopes that Ohio, with large numbers of lower-income and older voters, and Texas, with a large Latino electorate, will serve as a seawall against the Obama surge. The Clinton campaign is also looking to Pennsylvania, which votes on April 22, to provide another big-state victory and to stay competitive in the delegate chase.“We are going to sweep across Texas in the next three weeks bringing our message about what we need in America, the kind of president we need on Day One to be commander in chief and turn the economy around,” Mrs. Clinton said at a rally in El Paso Tuesday night. “I’m tested. I’m ready. Let’s make it happen.”But in the meantime, Mr. Obama will have a chance to begin persuading his party that his series of convincing wins in the last week represents a turning point in the campaign and that now is the time for Democrats to begin rallying around him as the strongest candidate to take back the White House.In claiming victory, Mr. McCain congratulated Mr. Huckabee, saying: “I want to commend my friend, Governor Huckabee, whose spirited campaign, many gifts as a communicator and advocate, and passionate supporters are a credit to him and our party. He certainly keeps things interesting, a little too interesting at times tonight, I must confess. But I have even more reason to appreciate just how formidable a campaigner he is.”Mr. McCain went on to add: “We have come a long way in this campaign, and we have had our ups and downs. But as luck, that product of opportunity and industry, would have it, we are approaching the end of the first half of this election on quite an upswing.”Despite losing all three primaries Tuesday, Mr. Huckabee said Republican voters still wanted to hear an alternative voice in deciding who should be the party’s presidential nominee.“There is still a sense in the Republican Party to have a choice,” Mr. Huckabee said after a strong showing in Virginia, where he said he closed a broad gap between him and Mr. McCain.“Just a few days ago, last Friday, a lot of the polls showed me behind by 30 points,” the former Arkansas governor was quoted by The Associated as saying in the lobby of a Little Rock bank after watching election returns. “Yesterday, we closed within 11 or 12. Maybe if we had a few more days we could have closed the gap all the way.”Turnout was brisk in all three jurisdictions, with long lines at polling stations but few serious problems reported. Bill O’Field, spokesman for the D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics said that turnout had surpassed previous primaries and some precincts ran out of paper ballots but that voting was never halted because the stations had electronic voting machines as well.In Maryland, polls stayed open an extra 90 minutes, until 9:30 p.m., because of bad road conditions caused by sleet and freezing rain.One in three voters in Tuesday’s Republican primary in Virginia described themselves as very conservative, and they supported Mr. Huckabee by more than three to one. And two-thirds of evangelical Christians, who accounted for nearly half of Republican voters here, backed Mr. Huckabee.Mr. McCain, for his part, had a slight edge among voters who said they were “somewhat” conservative, as well as broad support among moderates and nonevangelical Christians.But the exit poll further underscored some of Mr. McCain’s potential vulnerabilities among conservatives going forward. More than half of all Republican voters in Virginia said his positions on the issues were not conservative enough. And while 7 in 10 conservative voters said they would be satisfied if Mr. McCain won the nomination, just 1 in 3 of them would be “very” satisfied.Nearly half of voters called themselves evangelical Christians and two-thirds of them supported Mr. Huckabee.Slightly more than half of all Virginia Republican voters said Mr. McCain’s positions on the issues are not conservative enough.Mr. Obama’s strength in Virginia and Maryland crossed a range of demographic groups, according to exit polls conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool. He received majority support from voters across all income and education levels, as well as across political ideologies, from those who described themselves as liberal, moderate and conservative Democrats. And independents, who were allowed to vote in Virginia’s Democratic primary and accounted for 2 in 10 voters there, supported Mr. Obama two to one over Mrs. Clinton.Mrs. Clinton received the support of a majority of white women voting in Virginia and Maryland, but Mr. Obama countered with majority support among white men and overwhelming support among black voters, men and women alike.The two Democratic candidates roughly split the white vote in the two states, while Mr. Obama was backed by nearly 90 percent of black voters.About two of three men in both states supported Mr. Obama, as did nearly 6 in 10 women, big changes from numbers in earlier primaries.As in previous contests, young voters also heavily backed Mr. Obama. Significantly though, Mr. Obama was even able to compete with Mrs. Clinton among the older age groups in Virginia and Maryland. In many earlier primaries, Mrs. Clinton was able to neutralize his advantage among young voters with strong support of her own among older voters.Voters who showed up at Washington Irving Middle School in the Washington suburb of Springfield, Va., provided a cross-section of opinion on the four chief remaining candidates.Nancy O’Donnell, 70, who teaches English as a second language for the Diocese of Arlington in Virginia, said she cast her vote for Mr. McCain because he is “a strong man” and because she approves of his tolerant views on immigrants. But she said his age — he is a year older than she is — was something of a concern. “I wish he was a little younger,” Ms. O’Donnell said, “but unfortunately he’s not. But I like the things that he stands for. He’s pro-life, which is very meaningful to me.”Joseph Martin, 86, a retired nuclear engineer, said he voted for Mrs. Clinton. “She is more knowledgeable on things, she’ll go ahead and give you a straight answer,” he said. And the other one, Obama, he’s merely giving you a statement of we can do this, we can do that, but he is, he gives no details of how he’s going to do these things.”Sharon Webb, a former military career woman, currently is a stay-at-home mom. “I voted for Huckabee,” said Ms. Webb, who is Hispanic. “His values are in line with mine. I don’t think McCain has the same values as me on immigration.”Don and Peggy Fredericksen, a retired couple, said they were Republicans but they cast ballots in the Democratic primary. “We voted for Mr. Obama, and we’re Republican!” Mr. Fredericksen said. “Obama is the voice of hope and change. We like McCain too, but he doesn’t need our help in this election.”In exit poll interviews, voters in Virginia and Maryland cited the economy as the most important issue facing the country, and these voters strongly supported Mr. Obama. But he also outpaced Mrs. Clinton among those who cited Iraq or health care as the nation’s top problem.A majority of voters also said they were looking for a candidate who can bring about needed change. More than 8 in 10 of them backed Mr. Obama. Voters looking for experience went in large numbers for Mrs. Clinton, but they accounted for only about a quarter of the electorate in each state.'"
"'08-02-12,'1','According to Wall Street’s forecasters, the recession of 2008 is now unavoidable.That is, if you read between the lines of their predictions.In a survey released Tuesday morning by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, forecasters said on average that there was a 47 percent chance the economy would shrink in the first quarter of this year. But the economists surveyed, many working for investment banks or Wall Street research firms, are a notoriously optimistic bunch, and every time they have gotten so worried over the last four decades, the economy has ended up in recession.There have been six recessions since 1968, the year that the quarterly survey of economists began. At the start of every one, economists put the odds that the economy would shrink in the current quarter at 40 percent or more.At times, the economists have either jumped the gun or said that a recession would last longer than it did. In late 1979, for example, the forecasters said the economy was already likely to be shrinking; the National Bureau of Economic Research — widely considered the arbiter of business cycles — later said that the recession began in January 1980.But the recession-probability index — which the Philadelphia Fed calls the Anxious Index — has yet to miss a recession entirely or to signal one that never happened. Its biggest blemish came in the first quarter of 1988, when forecasters put the odds of a negative quarter at 35 percent. The economy then continued to grow for more than two years, before entering a recession in the summer of 1990.In the latest survey, the forecasters also said there was a 43 percent chance that the economy would shrink in the following quarter — the second quarter of 2008. That measure’s record is just as good over the last four decades: Every time it has risen above 40 percent, the economy has gone into recession.'"
"'08-02-12,'1','“He was his usual self,” said Aaron Wilkerson, his handler, as Uno relaxed contentedly in his arms. “Perfect, as always.”At some point when he shows, Uno bays, for no reason other than to say his piece. It was more of a croon than a bark that he emitted from the green carpeted floor of the Garden. And he did it several times.“He bayed at the judge,” Wilkerson said. “He does it on his own. He’s saying to the judge, ‘Look at me.’ So he just plants his feet and bays away.”The judge, Ralph Lemcke, said he had no memory of being bayed at. But he said he will remember Uno, whom he had never seen before.“This is one of the best hounds I’ve ever seen,” he said. He, too, had no explanation for Westminster’s best-in-show beagle shutout.A Sealyham terrier has won it all at Westminster four times, the last time in 1977. Charmin, or Ch. Efbe’s Hidalgo At Goodspice, with a beard, mustache and a fall of tousled hair between his eyes (a coiffure adapted for tussling in the dark with badgers), defeated 27 terrier colleagues to reach Tuesday’s finals.“Charmin is so close to the standard of Sealyhams,” said Margery Good, his nearly breathless handler and co-owner. “He has strength without coarseness. He’s forward-moving and he’s consistent. He’s just so elegant.”She added, “Everything I asked her to do, she did — in spades.”Charmin is dubbed after the toilet paper, unusual even in the wacky world of doggie nicknaming. “The first co-owner had coarse-coated dogs, and she said he was so fluffy and squeezably, wonderfully soft,” Good said. “When she passed away, I didn’t have the heart to change it.”Remy, the standard poodle officially named Ch. Brighton Minimoto, won the nonsporting group, as expected, given that she was the third-ranked dog in the country. A standard poodle last won in 1991.She glided around carpet, her mouth agape, and if you wanted to believe she was expressing her joy at impending victory, so be it.“Her grandfather always had a smile,” said Chris Manelopoulos, her handler who grew up among toy poodles in Melbourne, Australia, and now lives in Greensboro, N.C.Remy, as in Remy Martin, wears a cream-colored coat that is clipped into canine topiary. She won her breed competition Monday morning after four hours of primping.Remy’s face, throat and long muzzle are shaved but she has a well-sprayed Rick Springfield-like helmet of fluffy hair and thick, feathered ears. Soft fur covers her chest and back, but elegant clipping yields a half-pompon on either side of her shaved hips. Her tail is a cotton candy pompon.Thick bracelets (more pompons) of carved fluff expand like small tennis balls from the lower portions of her legs, which are otherwise shaved.Her stylized, Victorian appearance to the contrary, Manelopoulos said, “She’s a real tomboy. She’s not a prissy dog.”If a Las Vegas oddsmaker is correct, she could win it all.In his second year of Westminster odds making, Johnny Avello, director of race and sports operations at the Wynn Las Vegas, sets odds on breeds’ chances of winning, not on particular dogs. He gave the standard poodle the best odds at 25-1. The toy poodle came in at 28-1, the German shepherd at 30-1, the Welsh corgi at 35-1, and the Sealyham at 40-1. Do not look for a pooch betting window; Avello’s odds are just for fun.Deuce, a rambunctious Australian shepherd, won the herding group, an upset over the German shepherd ranked seventh in the country. The 4-year-old winner, Ch. Vinelake Collinswood Yablon, returned to work last month after a year’s sabbatical to give birth to a litter of nine. “It’s a dream come true,” Collins said. “She never ceases to amaze me.”'"

"'08-02-12,'1','Analysts said that the acquisition, could be a hint of a broader plan by Microsoft to build a consumer strategy around brands like Yahoo, which Microsoft recently bid $44.6 billion to acquire.“Microsoft is lining up every asset it can get to challenge Research In Motion and Google’s Android,” said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering Inc., an industry consultancy. R.I.M. makes the BlackBerry cellphone, and Android is the operating software for cellphones developed by Google.Danger, founded in 2000 by three engineering veterans of Apple, WebTV and General Magic, designed a soap bar-sized cellphone, the Sidekick, that was one of the first mobile devices to give consumers easy access to wireless data beyond electronic mail.Early on, the Sidekick, which was distinguished by a fold-out screen that opens like a switchblade knife, attracted a celebrity following that helped the company make inroads into consumer and youth markets. But it missed early opportunities to expand its service provider alliances beyond T-Mobile, the third-ranking cellular carrier in the United States, limiting Danger’s ability to grow quickly.Currently the Danger handsets are manufactured by Sharp Electronics and by Motorola.In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last December to raise $100 million, Danger said that its revenue rose to $56.4 million in its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, from $49.3 million in the previous year. It reported that it had 923,000 customers, most of them through its T-Mobile Sidekick line of devices.In an interview on Monday, Henry R. Nothhaft, Danger’s chief, said the company had strong holiday sales that pushed the company close to profitability and took its subscriber base to close to 1.2 million.Microsoft indicated to him that it plans to continue to invest in Danger and expand it beyond its current 300 employees and 60 contractors, he said.“I think they view us as a foundation for their consumer Internet experience,” he said.Although he declined to comment on the “select” list of companies that had been interested in acquiring Danger, Mr. Nothhaft said that he owned 11 thoroughbred horses and that during the negotiations Danger executives had assigned one of his horses’ names as a code name for each possible deal. He said that he had more horses than potential deals, but that he had run through a number of the names.Like much of the Valley’s mobile computing technology, Danger has its roots in Apple during the late 1980s. All three of the founders worked at Apple as engineers. Two of the founders, Joe Britt and Matt Hershenson, have remained with Danger, leading its technical direction.The third founder, Andy Rubin, left Danger to form Android, which was acquired by Google in 2005. The cellphone software it was developing became the basis for Google cellphone software announced last year.'"
"'08-02-12,'1','But the trickle has become a wave. Juan Pablo Montoya, another Indy 500 champion and Formula One alumnus, led the current influx after winning one race and taking rookie of the year honors last year. His quick success, coupled with the importance of name recognition in a sport that runs on sponsorship dollars, made established open-wheel drivers a hot commodity for Nascar teams.Hornish moved from Penske Racing’s premier IndyCar program to the team’s No. 77 Dodge in Sprint Cup. Franchitti takes over the No. 40 Dodge at Chip Ganassi Racing, becoming teammates with Montoya. Villeneuve will drive the No. 27 Toyota for Bill Davis Racing, and Carpentier will compete in the No. 10 Dodge at Gillett Evernham Motorsports. Regan Smith of Cato, N.Y., is the only rookie of the year contender who made his way up from lower-level stock-car racing. He will be in the No. 01 Chevrolet at Dale Earnhardt Inc.“It’s just a trend thing,” said Ganassi, who has embraced the trend as much as any owner. He competes in a variety of racing series and features drivers from New Zealand, England, Scotland, Mexico, Colombia and the United States.But it will not be all checkered flags and victory laps for the Nascar newcomers. Asked if he expected the open-wheel drivers to be up front with the leaders or in the wall and crashing, the 2004 Cup champion Kurt Busch said, “I think they’ll do both.”Open-wheel drivers face a major adjustment in racing stock cars, which are much heavier and less dependent on downforce. The open-wheel drivers find themselves comparing notes about how to drive them.“We laugh about it,” Carpentier said. “ ’Cause we’re like, ‘What kind of world we landed in?’ ”It is no coincidence that a large-scale migration from open wheel has come this year, when the Nascar-designed Car of Tomorrow is phased in at all racetracks. Even longtime Nascar drivers are still adjusting to the new car, which was used in 16 races last season. That means the newcomers have less catching up to do as they learn how to race in the boxier model designed to improve safety.“It’s so competitive,” Carpentier said. “One thing that helps us, the COT puts us a little bit more at level with the older car. It would have been almost impossible to adapt with these guys.“The challenge is how quickly I’ll get used to it and race with these guys. I don’t think you can come in and start winning races. It’s going to take some time.”If these drivers succeed, the move to Nascar could extend their careers.“The open-wheel cars have always been a little bit more dangerous,” Hornish said. “They’ve done a lot to make the safety come up there, but physics are physics. A car that goes 50 miles an hour faster around the corner, ultimately, you get out of control, it’s going to hit the wall faster, and it doesn’t matter how much safer you make it, you always have that more speed to it.”Hornish said he did not want to say that he made his decision because of safety, but he knew the longevity of a stock-car driver tended to be longer. “Most IndyCar drivers run between the ages of 32 and 35,” he said. “That’s the span of it. That’s what your body can take. You can have accidents and not feel like you’re going to get hurt or have any kind of problems. This is different. Guys generally tend to go until they’re 40 and some guys past that point.”The newcomers will have to compete for victories if they want to stick around that long. As the sport grows, patience grows shorter. Drivers are given less time to prove themselves before the next trend comes along.“I think everybody in this whole series is under pressure to perform,” Franchitti said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re a rookie, if you’re a veteran, if you’re an open-wheel driver, if you’re from Scotland, if you’re from Georgia, it doesn’t matter. Everybody’s under pressure to perform.”The pressure is also on the IndyCar Series, which continues to be drained of talent. It lost two of its premier drivers in Hornish and Franchitti. Officials there are focusing their marketing this year on high-profile drivers like Hélio Castroneves, Danica Patrick, Dan Wheldon and Marco Andretti.“Clearly, we lost two guys that will be missed on the racetrack, very talented racecar drivers,” the IndyCar Series spokesman John Griffin said in a telephone interview. “Sam, in a lot of respects, was the poster child of the IndyCar Series. Dario, I don’t think you could have asked for a better representative and better champion.“There’s always going to be enough drivers in this country that have passion for Indianapolis and oval-style racing. It’s up to us right now and we know it’s up to us to continue to build the series.”If not, the IndyCar Series could become little more than a feeder program for the Nascar big leagues.'"
"'08-02-12,'1','“When minority candidates run, their natural constituency is their neighborhoods and their neighbors,” Mr. Bopp said in a telephone interview.“And the unfortunate reality is that the minority population is on average in the lower socioeconomic level and less able to contribute, so minority candidates have to rely — I am told by activists here, consultants — that they tend to rely disproportionately on contributions from outside of their district, and in particular, business interests. So that this would disproportionately affect them.”The 13 plaintiffs include one African-American and four Hispanics, including two Republican former City Council candidates who say in the suit that they would like to run again, but could not afford to do so with the new limits in place.Richard Briffault, a law professor at Columbia University and an expert on campaign finance law, said the lawsuit appeared to be a “stretch,” particularly the aspects claiming racial discrimination.“It’s going to affect everybody,” Mr. Briffault said. “There’s no evidence that Hispanics or African-American candidates are particularly dependent on lobbyist donations than white candidates.”The Vermont case Mr. Bopp won before the Supreme Court has been viewed by some experts as a harbinger of the court’s shifting stance on campaign finance reform. But that case dealt with restrictions that affected all contributors, and the justices felt that the limit — $400 per election for statewide races — would endanger the ability of some candidates to get their message out.New York City’s law is different because it affects only certain classes of contributors, mainly people who do business with the city, like contractors, developers and financial underwriters. The law also bans entirely contributions from limited liability corporations and partnerships.Mr. Bopp said the new limits imposed by New York City’s law are lower than any ever upheld by the Supreme Court. But because the city’s law leaves plenty of revenue sources for candidates to draw from and increases their public matching funds, Mr. Briffault said, it is unlikely to encounter the same problems as the Vermont law.The suit also contends that the law is constitutionally untenable because it targets some entities doing business with the city, while leaving others, like labor unions and neighborhood organizations, unaffected.“The city is claiming the potential of undue influence by people who are doing business with the city and then they exempt two of the biggest categories of people doing business with the city,” Mr. Bopp said.City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, who pushed the bill past skeptical Council members worried about their ability to raise money, said the law was designed specifically to help candidates who did not have connections to the city’s high-powered lobbyists and developers.“By incentivizing smaller contributions, this law will allow challengers and candidates of color with grass-roots support to mount effective, winning campaigns,” she said in a statement. She added that she was confident that the law would survive the court challenge.But Councilwoman Maria del Carmen Arroyo, the Bronx Democrat who is co-chairwoman of the Council’s Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, said that the law raised legitimate concerns.“There is a very strong sense from colleagues on the impact of campaign finance rules on candidates of color,” said Ms. Arroyo, who is not involved in the case. “It’s a program that’s meant to level the playing field, and it doesn’t seem to do that very well.” The caucus includes 25 of the 51 Council members.A spokesman for the Campaign Finance Board said the board was reviewing the suit and declined to comment.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who pushed for the new limits, defended the law on Monday.“I’m not a constitutional lawyer,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “It’s a very well-intentioned and well-drafted piece of legislation and certainly we should have that law. Whether the way they drafted it’s constitutional, that’s up to the courts.”Among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Tom Ognibene, a former City Council minority leader, and Yvette Velázquez Bennett and Viviana Vazquez-Hernandez, former Council candidates who are both Republican district leaders in Brooklyn. The New York State Conservative Party and the Kings County Conservative Party are also listed as plaintiffs.Though only one lobbyist is named as a plaintiff, and no one from the real estate industry is, representatives from both industries acknowledged they were helping finance the lawsuit.“We all find this repugnant, and so I think you’ll find that there are a number of people who are interested in the suit and have contributed,” said Sid Davidoff, a senior partner of Davidoff Malito & Hutcher, one of the state’s biggest lobbying firms, which is a contributor and is also acting as local counsel.'"
"'08-02-12,'1','That is much more optimistic than predictions by many analysts on Wall Street.Among economists surveyed by the Blue Chip Economic Forecast, a closely watched monthly survey, the consensus prediction is that the economy will expand 1.7 percent.Indeed, a growing number of analysts contend that the United States has already slipped into a recession and will get only a temporary lift from the stimulus package this summer.Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a research note on Monday that he was convinced the economy was already in a recession and he warned that losses in the housing market could be even bigger than the $400 billion that Goldman predicted several months ago.Ethan Harris of Lehman Brothers predicted last week that the economy was likely to face a double-dip or “W-shaped” downturn before it begins a recovery.Federal Reserve officials, who have cut rates four times since August including sharp reductions twice last month, are predicting that the economy will escape a true recession — usually defined as a contraction in activity that lasts for at least two back-to-back quarters.But Fed policy makers are expecting much slower growth than the administration, and they acknowledge great uncertainty about their own forecasts.Mr. Lazear acknowledged that the economy might turn out to be weaker than the White House predicted in November in its previous forecast. Unemployment has already risen to 5 percent.“We only do our forecast twice a year,” Mr. Lazear said. “But if we look at the forecast of professional forecasters, those not in the government but outside government, those numbers have come down to some extent.”Instead of lowering their forecast, administration officials are instead predicting that the economy will bounce back in the summer as a result of both the tax rebates for individuals and temporary tax cuts for businesses in the new stimulus plan.Mr. Lazear rejected proposals by Democrats to offer an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits, for a total of 39 weeks, to people who lose their jobs. He said it would be unprecedented to extend jobless benefits at a time when the unemployment rate is only 5 percent, and he predicted that the stimulus package would create an additional 500,000 jobs this year.The report on Monday predicts that business investment growth and job growth are both likely to remain “solid” in 2008, and it noted that exports have climbed sharply in part because the dollar has declined in value against many major currencies in the last several years.But it also noted that the wages of workers failed to keep up with inflation last year and that consumer spending has slowed.“Americans should be confident about the long-term strength of our economy, but our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty,” President Bush wrote in a letter to Congress accompanying the report.Democratic lawmakers quickly accused Mr. Bush of glossing over serious economic problems. “The administration needs to recalibrate its overly optimistic assumptions in order to seriously address the declining fortunes of middle-class families,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.ST. LOUIS (Reuters) — The United States appears likely to avoid an economic slowdown but the chances of a recession have risen, William Poole, the president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, said Monday.“I think the best bet is that we will not have a recession,” he said after a speech to the St. Louis chapter of the National Association for Business Economics.Mr. Poole later told reporters, however, “There is no question that the odds are higher than they used to be.”'"
"'08-02-12,'1','WASHINGTON — A tax research group went to court Monday, arguing that the Internal Revenue Service was not complying with federal court orders to release data on its audit practices.A researcher, Prof. Susan B. Long of the Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University, said the I.R.S. was “flouting three federal court orders” to turn over detailed data on individual and corporate audits.She asked Judge Marsha J. Pechman of United States District Court in Seattle to require the agency to certify in writing that the data it provides complies with a 1976 court order as well as two recent ones. The agency complied with the court order until four years ago, when it said in a letter that no such order existed, a position it dropped once Professor Long provided a copy of it.Professor Long gave the judge dozens of pages of recent I.R.S. documents showing that instead of providing data in electronic database format as the court ordered, it released some in Microsoft Word and printed out other data on paper that was mailed, unsorted, in boxes with gaps in sequentially numbered pages.In one document, the total numbers of corporate and individual audits under review and the total amounts of tax in dispute were blacked out. The court orders specify that no such editing is allowed, said David Burnham, co-director with Professor Long of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, which gathers government data and posts it on the Internet along with its analyses of the effectiveness of half a dozen federal agencies.'"
"'08-02-12,'1','Also high on the agencies’ priority list is persuading the broadcast networks to change their venerable policy of selling commercial time ahead of the fall season, in what is called the upfront market, only in the spring. The executives hope that if year-round programming is possible, so, too, is a more flexible upfront.“People still want to buy commercials on TV shows ahead of time,” said Wayne Friedman, the West Coast editor of MediaPost Communications, who has written extensively about the strike. “But it doesn’t necessarily have to be in May.”During the strike, top network executives like Jeff Zucker of NBC Universal signaled that they were highly receptive to new ways of doing business. That open-mindedness has been met eagerly by the advertising community, which is hungry for innovation yet still sees television as the best way to reach audiences to sell products.The settlement “really could usher in the start of a new era,” said Aaron Cohen, executive vice president at Horizon Media.“We’ve had time to reflect, because of the strike, and open our minds, our frames of reference,” he added.During the strike, ratings fell — not as much as had been feared, but enough to concern advertisers. The trade publication Mediaweek estimated the percentage declines in the ratings for the Big Three broadcasters — ABC, CBS and NBC — in the low double digits compared with the period a year ago.The abrupt end to popular series like “Desperate Housewives,” “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Heroes,” which ran out of episodes produced before the strike, annoyed — and perhaps alienated — loyal viewers. And while reality series filled gaps in network schedules, some shows with provocative content dismayed sponsors that are particular about where their ads appear.If the industry adopted the year-round model, which most cable networks use, there would be less of a feast-or-famine mentality in buying commercial time. The continuous model means that “a successful show can be launched any time of the year,” Mr. Rutman said, because the promotional campaigns to encourage viewers to watch are staggered rather than simultaneous.Gene DeWitt, chairman and chief executive at another media agency, DeWitt Media, agreed that “there’s no reason to premiere everything at once, like it was Christmas.”Mr. DeWitt advocated that the broadcasters “introduce new shows as they’re ready, over time, to give each one some distinction.”The shift would have the added benefit of saving the networks money, he said, because they would no longer need scores of pilot episodes of prospective series to be produced each spring in advance of the fall season. (NBC has announced that it intends to order far fewer pilots for the 2008-9 season.)“The writers had a few things working for them” before the strike, Mr. DeWitt said, particularly “their ability to command huge money during a compressed pilot-development season,” which increased demand for their services.The staggering of pilot production and the ordering of fewer pilots could have the unintended consequence of lowering writers’ incomes even as the strike settlement raises them, he added.The additional time to develop potential series would benefit advertisers, said Steven J. Farella, president and chief executive at the TargetCast TCM agency, because “this business isn’t about G.R.P.’s anymore,” a reference to buying commercial time based on gross ratings points, once a mainstay of media schedules.“Now, this business is about big ideas,” Mr. Farella said, “leveraging your buy with an ‘event’ show, with a hit series, with programming marketers want to make a big deal out of.”“We dearly need the writers for that,” he added, “because the strike has proven that the networks don’t need the writers to get a 1.7 rating” — a mediocre level of viewership.More time to create new shows would also benefit sponsors of what is known as branded content, the industry term for integrating products as intrinsic elements of plot lines. Examples include the Applebee’s restaurant chain on “Friday Night Lights” and Nissan cars on “Heroes.”“The smarter players are going to get back in the content game as soon as possible,” Mr. Rutman of MPG North America said. “Making up for lost time is important.”Indeed, an executive at one agency said Monday that a major branded-entertainment project from a large marketer, which “had been in limbo until now,” is being given a green light with the settlement of the strike, “and should start moving forward” for a debut in April. The executive spoke on the condition of anonymity because the project is only now getting under way.If the hidebound network schedule was to change, it would logically follow that the annual springtime rite of selling commercial time after glitzy, elaborately staged upfront presentations would change, too. NBC, for one, has already suggested that it will scrap its upfront dog-and-pony show.Mr. Cohen of Horizon Media described “this dream I have had for a long time,” of being able “to accommodate clients by their fiscal year” rather than the upfront schedules of the networks.Mr. Rutman called himself “a fan of advance buying, because there are benefits there,” like ratings guarantees and an ability to cancel orders.“But I’d like to do it on a calendar year” instead of on the networks’ schedule, he added, “because it better aligns with the majority of businesses of our clients, which tend to be on a calendar basis.”One issue that will linger in the aftermath of the strike is the growing prominence of reality series on the schedules of the broadcast networks. Among them are “American Gladiators” on NBC, “The Moment of Truth” on Fox and the first winter appearance of “Big Brother” on CBS.“These shows do tend to get an audience, but you’re not necessarily getting as upscale an audience as you get for an intense scripted drama,” Mr. Scanzoni of GroupM said.To help dramas supplant the rising tide of reality, he suggested there be fewer dramas with serialized story lines that viewers must follow from week to week and more with episodes that can be watched stand-alone, “which you can pop in and out of.”Another issue that concerns Madison Avenue is how many viewers who popped out of the broadcast TV habit during the strike will pop back in.“There are always some viewers you lose, who will never come back to broadcast,” said Steve Sternberg, executive vice president for audience analysis at Magna Global, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.“But most of them will,” he predicted. “They’re waiting for their shows.”Even if, as Mr. Farella put it, “it’s a Barry Bonds season, a season with an asterisk.”'"
"'08-02-12,'1','For years, ethnic warlords have pushed each other from power in Chad with backing from neighbors like Libya and Sudan. Chad’s 10 million citizens, who occupy a landlocked and impoverished nation three times the size of California, have had little say in how they have been ruled since independence from France in 1960. Chad’s presidents have a long history of torturing and killing their civilian opponents. Opposing the government has a price, and many have paid it.One former president, Hissène Habré, is believed to have tortured and killed tens of thousands of opponents during his eight-year rule, earning the nickname “African Pinochet.” Victims of his government, many of whom were permanently disabled by torture at the hands of his security forces, have been trying for years to have him held to account under international law. He is living in exile in Senegal, where the government agreed to try him 18 months ago, but the trial has yet to begin.Mr. Déby, who toppled Mr. Habré in a 1990 coup planned in Darfur and carried out with help from Sudan, has portrayed the recent attempt by three rebel groups to push him from power as a foreign plot, hatched in Sudan and carried out by Chadian mercenaries paid by Sudan.The Sudanese government has reasons to want to rid itself of Mr. Déby, who has helped rebel groups linked to his family that are working in the Darfur region. Still, the Sudanese government has denied any involvement in the anti-Déby uprising.While international condemnation of the rebels trying to push Mr. Déby from power was swift and harsh, and France, the former colonial power, pledged to defend his government by force if needed, hardly a word of public condemnation has been uttered about the political crackdown currently under way in Chad.“It is like we don’t exist; the world has forgotten us,” said one opposition party member who was in hiding in Cameroon. “It is the same old story. The West needs Déby, and civil society and political opposition is sacrificed.”Jacqueline Moudeina, a human rights lawyer and activist, was so afraid of being arrested that she moved from safe house to safe house for days until friends in the West were able to persuade France to intervene. She was taken to the French base in Ndjamena for her safety last week.“I am just relieved to be safe,” she said as she waited for a French official to escort her onto the base. In 2001, a security official against whom she had lodged a human rights complaint tossed a grenade at her, and she was badly wounded. The official was arrested and tried, but acquitted.Roland Marchal, a senior fellow at the National Center for Scientific Research in Paris who has studied Chad for years, said the civilian opposition was a real threat to Mr. Déby, who has managed to cling to power for 18 years — the longest tenure of any ruler in Chad — despite an array of enemies who wish him harm.“Civilian opposition groups are the Achilles’ heel to Déby,” Mr. Marchal said. “If they switch onto the side of the rebellion they could give the rebellion legitimacy. Politically they could change the balance internally and even internationally.”Mr. Déby has dismissed the political opposition as irrelevant, and in a news conference last week he said the arrests of opposition leaders were “petty details” not worth his time.Like many African countries, Chad is a democracy on paper but its elections have often been marred by fraud and violence. Since it won its independence in 1960, the country has never had a peaceful transfer of power. Its institutions, outside of the powerful presidency, remain very weak.Chad adopted a new Constitution in a referendum in 1996, and Mr. Déby was elected twice. In 2005, he pushed through a constitutional change that eliminated the two-term limit for the presidency. When he ran again in 2006, the opposition boycotted and he won in a landslide.The armed rebellions against Mr. Déby are drawn from a variety of ethnic groups. They say that he has not managed the country’s growing oil wealth well and that he has given preferential treatment to members of his ethnic group, the Zaghawa. But even members of his family have even turned against him — his nephew leads one of the rebellions.Blaise Mouga, a member of the Federation Action for the Republic, a party whose leader, Ngarlejy Yorongar, was arrested last week, said the country needed change by any means necessary.“Despite our oil, our cotton, our rich farmland in the south, look at how poor this country is,” Mr. Mouga said. “We want some kind of change. We are not for the rebellion, but we are not for Déby either. The international community might say Déby is the lesser of two evils, but they are not living with him.”'"
"'08-02-12,'1','But rather than following the standard script of informing taxpayers after the fact, or making a televised address from the comfort of his office, Mr. Corzine is telling thousands of people to their faces that his plan will hurt, and hurt a lot. But not adopting it, he warns, will hurt a lot more.“I don’t want to be doing this,” he said at another town meeting in Mays Landing last Thursday. “This is not fun to stand up here and say, ‘We’ve got these problems.’ ”Although he has run into predictable opposition from Republican legislators and surprising opposition from several Democratic officials, he has won the support of political adversaries and major business leaders in the state. What he needs is the support of anyone and everyone who will listen in all 21 of New Jersey’s counties.Few can recall a governor’s embarking on a road show promoting a plan that seems to be so unpopular. In Livingston in Essex County and Hackensack in Bergen and other Democratic areas, the reception has generally been respectful, the discourse civil. He shows “a lot of guts,” just by showing up, people say repeatedly.In some places it has been less “Ask the Governor” and more “Accuse the Governor,” as members of the audience, their faces red with anger, have lambasted his policies, made light of his near-fatal accident on the Garden State Parkway or interrupted his answers by barking out, “Next question!”Perhaps it was better that two of Mr. Corzine’s children attended the meeting in Cranford, which was simply prickly, and not those in Toms River and Marlboro, which bordered on civil disturbances.“When everybody laughed when you said that the board would be non-partisan, why do you think everyone laughed?” said Al Dolce, a self-described investor from Freehold. He told Mr. Corzine in Marlboro that his policies had insulted and offended the public “because we’ve been watching you, Jon. Nobody believes you on that! Nobody!”The atmosphere has become so volatile that last week the State Police began checking the audience with metal detectors and searching handbags.Still, most of the meetings have unfolded without incident, with the notable exception of the arrest in Cape May Court House of Mr. Corzine’s conservative nemesis: Steven M. Lonegan, a former mayor of Bogota, an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate and a fixture at these town hall meetings.Outside, Mr. Lonegan and his supporters have distributed fliers and hoisted signs, including one depicting Mr. Corzine as a toll booth collector, with the words: “We accept: cash, check, money order, Visa, MasterCard, first mortgage, first-born child.”A few people have dressed in pig costumes, parodying Mr. Corzine’s admonition that his plan to raise money was necessary because “pigs will fly over the State House before there is a realistic level of new taxes or spending cuts that can fix this mess.”Mr. Corzine’s performance in East Brunswick was typical, and so was the largely suburban crowd: a sea of baseball caps, blue jeans and jogging outfits. Entering the stage to a swirl of applause and jeers, he glanced at both the audience and his 27-slide show and proceeded without any notes.Talking facts and figures, he was clearly in his comfort zone. “Next slide,” he said, over and over.Al Gore he was not. Sometimes, it was hard to see the charts because the words and figures were too small. Sometimes he blocked the view.Maybe it was Mr. Corzine’s calm and serious demeanor. Maybe it was his plodding speaking style. Whatever the case, he managed to deliver his presentation as if he were a business school professor.Reality intruded when he spelled out what he said were the stark alternatives: raising taxes across the board and slashing spending by up to 15 percent, or adopting his toll road plan. A chorus of catcalls inevitably erupted.Later, when he insisted that the new nonprofit agency responsible for overseeing the toll roads would be apolitical, the usual laughter erupted.“Again, let’s try to let everybody listen, and then you can do your hooting and hollering,” he pleaded.Why, some asked, should they trust Mr. Corzine, or anyone else in Trenton? Why not raise the gas tax, one of the lowest in the nation, since it would be more equitable to all drivers, and penalize large, polluting cars like Hummers? What will toll increases do for local roads when drivers flee the toll roads?After Mr. Corzine wrapped up his 38-minute presentation, more than 30 people rushed to line up behind two microphones. (And rushed it was, because Mr. Lonegan and Senate Minority Leader Thomas H. Kean Jr. have urged opponents to position themselves as close to the microphones as possible to stack the questions.)“I must say, I see a lot of the same faces get to the mikes,” Mr. Corzine quipped to reporters afterward.'"
"'08-02-12,'1','The coalition of hedge funds that wants to place directors on the board of The New York Times Company has more than doubled its stake in the company, to nearly 10 percent of the regular shares, according to federal records filed Monday.One of the hedge funds, Firebrand Partners, has said that it wants the company to sell some assets, but that it is not seeking to change the Sulzberger family’s control of the company. In addition to The New York Times, the company owns The Boston Globe, a number of smaller newspapers and About.com; it sold its string of television stations last year.The family trust owns most of the Class B shares in the Times Company; the voting for 9 of the 13 board members is restricted to holders of Class B shares. Firebrand is seeking to install a slate of candidates in the remaining four seats, which are chosen by Class A shareholders.The company disclosed in late January that the coalition, led by Harbinger Capital Partners, a part of the Harbert Management Corporation, had accumulated just under 5 percent of the Class A shares and nominated four people for the board.In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, the group revealed that it had bought many more shares since then. The filing lists several holdings by different entities, many of them appearing to overlap, making it unclear how many shares the coalition controls.The largest stake listed is 14.25 million shares, or about 10 percent of the Class A stock, a figure that might or might not also represent the total that the coalition has accumulated.'"
"'08-02-12,'1','The Dow Jones industrial average is adding two companies, the Bank of America Corporation and the Chevron Corporation, the first change to the blue-chip stock index in almost four years, Dow Jones & Company said Monday.Two others, the Altria Group and Honeywell International, will be dropped from the 30-member index, the oldest and single most-watched gauge of stock performance in the world. The changes will take effect next Tuesday, Dow Jones said.The planned spinoff of Philip Morris International from Altria, which will leave it a purely domestic tobacco company, prompted the change, Marcus W. Brauchli, managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, said.Editors of The Journal determine the composition of the Dow index, which is 111 years old. The Journal is published by Dow Jones, a unit of the News Corporation. The change is the first since April 2004, when three stocks were replaced.Adding Chevron makes sense because the Dow was light on energy at 5 percent, compared with the broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index at 12.5 percent, said Chris Orndorff, a managing principal at Payden & Rygel Investment Management in Los Angeles. Similarly, Mr. Orndorff said, adding Bank of America was appropriate because the Dow represented financials at 10 percent, compared with 18 percent for the S.& P. 500.The decision to drop Honeywell and Altria is unusual because the two stocks have performed well recently. Previous changes often marked the departure of stocks in decline at the time, like Eastman Kodak, International Paper and Sears.'"
"'08-02-12,'1','They have found that immediate social bonding between strangers is highly dependent on mimicry, a synchronized and usually unconscious give and take of words and gestures that creates a current of good will between two people.By understanding exactly how this process works, researchers say, people can better catch themselves when falling for an artful pitch, and even sharpen their own social skills in ways they may not have tried before.“Really good salespeople, and for that matter good con artists, have known about these skills and used them forever,” Jeremy Bailenson, a psychologist at Stanford, said. “All we’re doing now is measuring and describing more precisely what it is they’re doing, whether consciously or not.”Imitation is one of the most common and recognizable behaviors in the animal kingdom. Just as baby chimps learn to climb by aping their elders, so infants pick up words and gestures by copying parents. They sense and mimic peers’ behavior from early on, too, looking up at the ceiling if others around them do so or mirroring others’ cringes of fear and .Such behavioral contagion probably evolved early for survival, some scientists argue. It is what scatters a flock well before most members see a lunging predator.Yet by drawing on apparently similar skills, even in seemingly trivial ways, people can prompt almost instantaneous cooperation from complete strangers.In a recent experiment, Rick van Baaren, a psychologist at Nijmegen University in the , had student participants go to a lab and give their opinions about a series of advertisements. A member of his research team mimicked half the participants while they spoke, roughly mirroring the posture and the position of their arms and legs, taking care not to be too obvious.Minutes later, the experimenter dropped six pens on the floor, making it look like an accident.In several versions of this simple sequence, participants who had been mimicked were two to three times as likely to pick up the pens as those who had not.The mimicry had not only increased good will toward the researcher within minutes, the study concluded, but it also prompted “an increased pro-social orientation in general.”That orientation applies to far more than dropped pens. In a study due out in the spring, Robin Tanner and Tanya Chartrand, at Duke, led a research team that tested how being mimicked might affect the behavior of a potential client or investor.The team had 37 Duke students try out what was described as a new sports drink, Vigor, and answer a few questions about it. The interviewer mimicked about half the participants using a technique Dr. Chartrand had developed in earlier studies.The technique involved mirroring a person’s posture and movements, with a one- to two-second delay. If he crosses his legs, then wait two seconds and do the same, with opposite legs. If she touches her face, wait a beat or two and do that. If he drums his fingers or taps a toe, wait again and do something similar.The idea is to be a mirror but a slow, imperfect one. Follow too closely, and most people catch it — and the game is over.In the study, the researchers set up the interviews so each student’s experience was virtually identical, except for the mimicking.None of the copied participants picked up on the mimicry. But by the end of the short interview, they were significantly more likely than the others to consume the new drink, to say they would buy it and to predict its success in the market.In a similar experiment, the psychologists found that this was especially true if the participants knew that the interviewer, the mimic, had a stake in the product’s success.“This is somewhat counterintuitive,” Dr. Chartrand said in an interview. “Normally, you’d expect when people realize that someone was invested in a product and trying to sell it to them, their reaction would be attenuated. They’d be less enthusiastic.“But we found that people who were mimicked actually felt more strongly about the product when they knew the other person was invested in it.”Any amiable conversation provides ample evidence of this subconscious social waltz. Smiles are contagious. So is nodding, in an amiable conversation.Accents converge quickly and automatically. A country chime or an Irish whistle can seemingly infect the voice of a New Yorker in a 10-minute phone call.“I especially find myself falling into a Southern accent, which is crazy,” Mr. Allieri, the telecom executive, said. “I’m from Boston.“But I think what good salespeople really do is pick up on physical cues and respond to them without thinking much about it.”It is one thing to move like a naturally synchronized swimmer through the pools of everyday conversation without thinking, however. It is another to deliberately employ mimicry to persuade or seduce.Dr. Bailenson, the Stanford psychologist, has been testing the effects of different forms of mimicry by programming a computer-generated figure, an avatar, to mirror the movements and gestures of people in a study.He has found that his subjects pick up the mimicry when it is immediate and precise. If the avatar is slightly out of sync, however — waits four seconds, for instance — then the mimicking goes unnoticed, and the usual rules apply. The virtual creating comes across as warm and convincing, as if controlled by another human.“The point is it’s a delicate balance to get it right, and I suspect that people who are good at this know how to do it intuitively,” Dr. Bailenson said.Or they have developed ways to engage their skills indirectly.Veldon Smith, a musician and legendary salesman living in Centennial, Colo., who spent 30 years in the automobile parts business before retiring a few years ago, said:“One thing I always did, I learned as much as possible about a client before I visited, what their problem was, what they were worried about. Then I would go in with a story about myself being in the same predicament.“So when I walked in, I was in exactly the same frame of mind as the customer. I was immediately on the same wavelength. Everything else kind of flowed out of that.”One reason subtle mimicry is so instantly beguiling may be that it draws on and, perhaps, activates brain circuits involved in feelings of empathy.In several studies, Jean Decety, a neuroscientist at the , has shown that some of the same brain regions that are active when a person feels pain also flare up when that person imagines someone else like a loved one feeling the same sting or ache.A similar process almost certainly occurs when a person takes pleasure in the good fortune of a friend or the apparent enjoyment of a conversation partner, Dr. Decety said.“When you’re being mimicked in a good way, it communicates a kind of pleasure, a social high you’re getting from the other person, and I suspect it activates the areas of the brain involved in sensing reward,” he said.Social mimicry can and does go wrong. At its malicious extreme, it curdles into mockery, which is why people often recoil when they catch of whiff of mimicry, ending any chance of a social bond. Preliminary studies suggest that the rules change if there is a wide cultural gap between two people. For almost everyone else, however, subtle mimicry comes across as a form of flattery, the physical dance of charm itself. And if that kind of flattery doesn’t close a deal, it may just be that the customer isn’t buying.Everyone has the right to be charmed but not seduced.'"
"'08-02-12,'1','Two CBS journalists are missing in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, the network said in a brief statement on Monday.“All efforts are under way to find them,” said the statement, which also asked other news organizations not to “speculate on the identity of those involved.”But in recent years, Basra has been the venue of attacks on Iraqi and Western journalists, and on Monday a semi-independent Iraqi news network, Voices of Iraq, citing Basra police officials, reported on its Web site that a British journalist, apparently a photographer, and his Iraqi interpreter were abducted by gunmen from their hotel, the Qasr al-Sultan, in Basra. CBS declined to comment on those details.The Iraqi police said that the abductees were a reporter and a translator, and that they were taken away in what appeared to be official police vehicles.After the 2003 invasion, the Qasr al-Sultan was commonly used by Western journalists. But after two killings in 2005, journalists have been much more cautious about working on the streets of Basra or staying in its hotels, preferring to stay in compounds guarded by American or British forces near the airport.In July of that year, an American freelance journalist, Stephen Vincent, was killed outside another Basra hotel, and in September, an Iraqi journalist working for The New York Times, Fakher Haider, was also killed after being taken from his home in Basra. In both cases, official Iraqi security forces were implicated, though no one has ever been officially accused of the killings.'"
"'08-02-12,'1','Dr. Debi Yohn, a counseling psychologist based in Shanghai, sees how affairs on business trips continue beyond the one-night stand. “When you are traveling, you feel alone, you’ve had too much to drink, and things lose their perspective,” she wrote in an e-mail interview. “You do it once, get away with it ... do it again. ... Then it seems O.K.”Dr. Yohn counsels expatriate families in their marriage troubles and explained that affairs are very common for men and for women who travel or live abroad.“If you do not have a good marriage, or you are not having sexual relations with your partner, or you have just had another argument with your mate, you are ripe for an attraction to occur.”Mr. Pataky said his marriage broke up, in part, because of the pressures of business travel. He said his wife feared what might be happening while he was traveling. “I had lots of opportunities, but I never did,” Mr. Pataky said.Mr. Sanders counsels: “Seasoned business travelers need hard and fast rules. You go to bed early, you hang out in your room and watch a movie, do some e-mails and get some sleep.”And what of the unwanted advance?When asked for strategies in dealing with those, Terry Neese, president and co-founder of the Women Impacting Public Policy Institute, which advocates for women in business, said, “I have always found that if you act with professionalism and show integrity and total focus on your business, less of those things happen.” If that doesn’t do it, Ms. Neese suggests saying: “I’m not interested in where you’re coming from. I’m here to attend the conference.”There are ways to avoid such awkward moments. On an airline, excuse yourself from the conversation and put on your headphones, says Paul A. Tucci, chief operating officer of a software developer, Iwerk, in Royal Oak, Mich.Mr. Tucci, who wrote “Traveling Everywhere: How to Survive a Global Business Trip,” is an expert in avoiding people he doesn’t want to talk to on planes. He provides this advice: “Make up the name of the hotel, if asked, and never give out your cellphone number or e-mail address. Just smile, be caring and assertive and say, ‘Why don’t you give me yours, and if I have time, I’ll e-mail you,’ and be done with it.”If necessary, he suggests, switch to an empty seat on the plane.Not all executives get even the most obvious of messages. Lydie Thomas, a French woman who runs her own crafts Web site, artchestra.com, from California, said a salesman at a company she once worked for rang her hotel phone at night and then later tried the door. She told him to leave her alone, and the next day he acted as though nothing had happened. “It was very disrespectful of him to pursue me after I clearly told him I wasn’t interested.“Harassment while on business trips isn’t something that only women have to deal with.Kevin Davidson, a public relations executive in the entertainment industry remembers a similar problem he had with a female client who got too touchy. “It was frustrating because I was out on the road by myself. I reached out to my boss and asked what I should do.” His boss was unsympathetic, and reminded him he had work to do, to “just get it done.”“Being away from home gives people a license to be somebody else.” Mr. Davidson added. “They feel they can leave regular lives behind and behave badly.”'"
"'08-02-12,'1','SAN FRANCISCO — The war of words between Yahoo and Microsoft has begun.Hours after Yahoo officially rejected Microsoft’s takeover offer on Monday, calling it too low, Microsoft described Yahoo’s response as “unfortunate” and said its own proposal was “full and fair.”Microsoft’s statement suggests that, at least for now, the company is not willing to raise its price. Microsoft also indicated anew that it was ready for a fight, repeating earlier statements that it might consider “all necessary steps” to ensure the deal is completed.Experts said Microsoft could ratchet up pressure on Yahoo’s board by taking its offer directly to shareholders and waging a proxy fight to oust Yahoo’s directors; it has until March 13 to nominate a new slate of directors.Earlier in the day Yahoo said Microsoft’s bid “substantially undervalues Yahoo including our global brand, large worldwide audience, significant recent investments in advertising platforms and future growth prospects, free cash flow and earnings potential, as well as our substantial unconsolidated investments.”Yahoo said its board would “continue evaluating all of its strategic options.”Microsoft initially offered to buy Yahoo for $44.6 billion, or $31 a share, in a mix of cash and stock. After a decline in Microsoft’s shares, the value of the offer now stands at less than $29 a share.'"

"'08-02-13,'1','“It’s not an accident that he has, I think, according to National Journal, the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate,” he said. “I have one of the most conservative.”Speaking before a crowd at a Wisconsin auto plant, Senator Obama delivered a blistering critique of his Democratic and Republican rivals on Wednesday, blaming Washington for the economic crisis that has gripped the nation.“We are not standing on the brink of recession due to forces beyond our control,” Mr. Obama said. “The fallout from the housing crisis that’s cost jobs and wiped out savings was not an inevitable part of the business cycle, it was a failure of leadership and imagination in Washington.”Mr. Obama opened his campaign for next week’s Wisconsin primary inside a General Motors plant in Janesville, one day after General Motors Corp. posted a $38 billion loss, the largest ever for a U.S. auto company. He criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed during the Clinton administration, and offered a series of plans to inject more jobs into the economy.“You know, in the years after her husband signed Nafta, Senator Clinton would go around talking about how great it was and how many benefits it would bring,” Mr. Obama said. “Now that she’s running for president, she says we need a time-out on trade. No one knows when this time-out will end. Maybe after the election.”Mr. Obama, who has won 21 states in the Democratic presidential nominating fight, is working to add Wisconsin to his string of victories by tapping into an anti-war sentiment. As he pointed out his opposition to the war, he linked Mrs. Clinton with Senator McCain as he pointed out the failures of Washington.“It’s a Washington where politicians like John McCain and Hillary Clinton voted for a war in Iraq that should’ve never been authorized and never been waged — a war that is costing us thousands of precious lives and billions of dollars a week,” Mr. Obama said.In his speech in Janesville, Mr. Obama proposed creating a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank to invest $60 billion over 10 years and create nearly 2 million new jobs in the construction field. He said the program would be paid for by ending the Iraq war. He also renewed his call to create an energy plan to invest $150 billion over 10 years to establish a “green energy sector” to add up to 5 million jobs in the next two decades.“It’s time to stop spending billions of dollars a week trying to put Iraq back together and start spending the money on putting America back together instead,” Mr. Obama said. He added, “We’ll also provide funding to help manufacturers convert to green technology and help workers learn the skills they need for these jobs.”Mrs. Clinton, speaking before an enthusiastic crowd on Wednesday morning in McAllen, Texas, also struck economic themes, saying she offered solutions for voters’ financial struggles while Mr. Obama offered “rhetoric.”The New York Democrat blasted her Democratic rival for the nomination for having “a plan that fails to provide universal health care, fails to address the housing crisis, and fails to immediately start creating good-paying jobs.”She also underscored the critical importance of the Texas primary on March 4, which her advisers describe as a must-win target after a series of Clinton losses to Mr. Obama over the last week.“March 4 is a turning point date,” Mrs. Clinton told the cheering crowd of more than 2,000 people at a convention center in McAllen. “We can send that message across America. Will you stand for me on March 4? If you will stand and fight for me, I will fight for you all the way to victory in November.”Mrs. Clinton headlined a rally with about 12,000 people in El Paso on Tuesday night; as at that event, the McAllen audience was predominantly Hispanic and female — her chief voter bases — and the audiences were two of the most raucous that Mrs. Clinton has seen during this campaign. In El Paso, even her most boilerplate remarks were rewarded with wild hooting from the audience.In McAllen, Mrs. Clinton stood on stage with more than 100 elected officials from the region who had endorsed her, as the audience repeatedly interrupted remarks with chants of “Hillary! Hillary!”“Oh, it is so good to be back in South Texas,” Mrs. Clinton said. “I first came here nearly 36 years ago. I went door to door in the border communities, including McAllen, looking to register voters and to make it clear then as I do now, we must seize the future and everybody has to participate.”Mrs. Clinton hailed two of her “heroines” from Texas, former Rep. Barbara Jordan and former Gov. Ann Richards, and sought to tap their legendary gusto as she looked ahead to the Texas primary and her fight for the nomination against Mr. Obama.“They taught me about courage and determination,” she said. “I can hear their voices saying, ‘you keep going, you give the people a real choice about the future that awaits.’”Mrs. Clinton is counting on huge turnout by Hispanics and women to propel her to victory in Texas. She is holding events in Corpus Christi and San Antonio on Wednesday before heading to Ohio, which also votes on March 4, and plans to return to Texas next Wednesday for campaigning and a debate on Feb. 21.On the Republican side, Senator McCain met with House Republicans on Wednesday morning at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington. The group has not always embraced Mr. McCain, particularly last spring when he championed an immigration bill many of them hated. But as the Arizona Republican seeks to rally the party around him, they proclaimed a unified front.Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri said, “I believe this contest is over, and I believe it’s produced the best possible nominee for us to take back the house.” And Rep. John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican Leader, said, “I’ve watched John McCain be a strong advocate for the principles that I believe in.”Mr. McCain continued to note his desire that Mr. Huckabee bow out of the Republican race, saying that the former Arkansas governor needs more delegates than remain up for grabs to win the nomination.“Of course I would like for him to withdraw today — it would be much easier,” Mr. McCain said. “But I respect, and I have repeatedly said I respect, his right to continue in this race for just as long as he wants to.”'"
"'08-02-13,'1','Stocks rallied on Wednesday for the third day in a row as investors embraced the first positive economic news in weeks: an unexpected climb in retail sales in January. But economists said the report was far from an all-clear on the recession front.The Dow Jones industrials jumped more than 100 points at the opening bell after the Commerce Department said sales of food and retail items rose 0.3 percent last month, reversing a 0.4 percent drop in December. The report, while volatile from month to month, is considered a bellwether of consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation’s economic activity.The blue-chip index climbed throughout the day, closing up nearly 178.83 at 12,552.24, a gain of 1.5 percent. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose about 1.3 percent.Telecommunications and technology companies enjoyed the day’s biggest gains, buoyed by a better-than-expected earnings report from Applied Materials, the California-based manufacturer that supplies equipment for computer chips, solar panels and other electronics. The Nasdaq composite index surged by 2.3 percent.Many financial forecasters, troubled by the grim economic environment of late, had predicted a decline in retail sales as consumers struggle with expensive gasoline, a softer job market and the continuing housing slump. Holiday sales in 2007 were worse than retailers had expected, and other reports seemed to point to a continued slowdown in spending.'"

Producer prices climbed 3 percent in January from a year earlier, after a 2.6 percent gain in December, the Bank of Japan said. Consumer prices rose the most in almost a decade in December, which, combined with falling wages, drove household sentiment to a four-year low. The current-account surplus narrowed for the first time in a year in December as oil pushed the nation’s import bill to a record, a separate report showed. The gap shrank 4.7 percent to 1.69 trillion yen ($15.7 billion) from a year earlier, the finance ministry said.'"

Mr. McCain also prevailed in the District of Columbia, with 68 percent of the vote, and in Maryland, where he had 55 percent of the vote with 67 percent of the precincts reporting.He said of Mr. Huckabee, “He certainly keeps things interesting — maybe a little too interesting at times tonight, I must confess.”Mr. McCain turned his attention to attacks on his Democratic opponents, saying they “promise a new approach to governing but offer only the policies of a political orthodoxy that insists the solution to government’s failures is to simply make it bigger.”In all, 168 pledged delegates were at stake for the Democrats and 116 for the Republicans. The Democrats will divide delegates proportionally to the candidates’ vote statewide and at the Congressional level while the Republican races are winner-take-all.Mr. Obama’s victories gave him a lead over Mrs. Clinton among pledged delegates, according to preliminary counts by the Obama campaign and some news organizations. Obama aides calculate that he also leads in delegate counts that include so-called superdelegates, the party officers and elected officials who control 20 percent of the total delegates to the Democratic convention.Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has suffered in recent weeks from overspending and internal upheaval, including the demotion of the campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, late last week and the resignation Tuesday of the deputy campaign manager, Mike Henry.Mr. Obama, looking ahead to the next contest, was in Madison, Wis., when the results came in. In remarks to a boisterous rally, he did not mention Mrs. Clinton by name. But over loud applause he declared: “We also know that at this moment the cynics can no longer say our hope is false. We have now won east and west, north and south, and across the heartland of this country we love.”Mrs. Clinton essentially conceded the three contests Tuesday morning by leaving Washington to campaign in Texas. She scheduled four days of appearances in Wisconsin, which holds its primary next Tuesday, but where Mr. Obama already has a significant ground operation and is spending heavily on advertising. Hawaii, where Mr. Obama largely grew up, also holds its nominating caucuses next Tuesday. But the Clinton campaign’s major efforts will be in Texas and Ohio, which vote on March 4. Rhode Island and Vermont also hold primaries that day.Mrs. Clinton’s advisers say she will focus on winning over voters in Ohio and Texas to halt Mr. Obama’s growing momentum and to try to stay close in the count of pledged delegates. The Clinton campaign hopes that Ohio, with large numbers of lower-income and older voters, and Texas, with a large Latino electorate, will serve as a seawall against the Obama surge. The Clinton campaign is also looking to Pennsylvania, which votes on April 22, to provide another big-state victory and to stay competitive in the delegate chase.“We are going to sweep across Texas in the next three weeks bringing our message about what we need in America, the kind of president we need on Day One to be commander in chief and turn the economy around,” Mrs. Clinton said at a rally in El Paso on Tuesday night, making no reference to her losses back East. “I’m tested. I’m ready. Let’s make it happen.”But in the meantime, Mr. Obama will have a chance to begin convincing his party that his series of convincing wins in the last week represents a turning point in the campaign and that now is the time for Democrats to begin rallying around him as the strongest candidate to take back the White House.Turnout was brisk in all three jurisdictions, with long lines at polling stations but few serious problems reported. Bill O’Field, spokesman for the District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics said that turnout had surpassed previous primaries, with some precincts ran out of paper ballots, but that voting was never halted because the stations had electronic voting machines as well.In Maryland, polls stayed open an extra 90 minutes, until 9:30 p.m., because of bad road conditions caused by sleet and freezing rain.Three in 10 voters in Tuesday’s Republican primary in Virginia described themselves as very conservative, and two-thirds of them supported Mr. Huckabee. And 6 in 10 evangelical Christians, who accounted for nearly half of Republican voters here, backed Mr. Huckabee.Mr. McCain, for his part, had an edge among voters who said they were “somewhat” conservative, as well as broad support among moderates and non-evangelical Christians.But the exit poll further underscored some of Mr. McCain’s potential vulnerabilities among conservatives going forward. Half of all Republican voters in Virginia said his positions on the issues were not conservative enough. And while 7 in 10 conservative voters said they would be satisfied if Mr. McCain wins the nomination, fewer than 4 in 10 of them would be “very” satisfied.Mr. Obama’s strength in Virginia and Maryland crossed a range of demographic groups, according to exit polls conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool. He received support from voters across all income and education levels, as well as across political ideologies, from those who described themselves as liberal, moderate and conservative Democrats. And independents, who were allowed to vote in Virginia’s Democratic primary and accounted for 2 in 10 voters there, supported Mr. Obama two to one over Mrs. Clinton.Mrs. Clinton received the support of a majority of white women voting in Virginia and Maryland, but Mr. Obama countered with overwhelming support among black voters, men and women alike. Among white men, Mr. Obama won a majority in Virginia and ran close to Mrs. Clinton in Maryland.More than 6 in 10 men in both states supported Mr. Obama, as did a majority of women, big changes from numbers in earlier primaries.'"
"'08-02-13,'1','Mr. Gutierrez, 39, a handyman, said that his children were heartbroken but that from the start the family had been stymied by the mayor’s power. “We’re starting to figure the ways of the political world,” he said.Ms. Saenz-Lopez, breaking a long silence, said in an interview last week with her sister in their lawyer’s office that she had acted to save the flea-infested dog from imminent death. “I made up my mind,” she said, “this is where I draw the line.”She said she had no regrets. “If we can’t be the voice of the people any more, let us be the voice of animals.”Her lawyer, Homero Canales, wearing a black T-shirt with the words “No Culpable” — Spanish for “Not Guilty” — quibbled slightly. “You could have handled it better,” he said.Ms. Garcia looked surprised. “Thank you, counselor,” she said.Puddles/Panchito had no comment. But he sniffed around Mr. Canales’s desk and lifted a leg.The drama began last July when the dog’s family was leaving for an annual long weekend at a water park in the Texas Hill Country. They parked Puddles, whom they had bought for their son Joseph and three other children for $500 the previous February, with Ms. Saenz-Lopez and her husband, Paco, a retired police officer.The dog was suffering the dire effects of a severe household flea infestation, treated with strong chemicals, that left him in need of a $700 transfusion the family could not afford. Still, they thought the dog was rallying, and they left medicine and food for him.But when they called to check on him, said Ms. Cavasos, 37, a licensed vocational nurse, Ms. Saenz-Lopez reported that Puddles had died and been buried in the backyard of a new house she and her husband were moving into several doors down.“Joseph took it hard; he cried,” Mr. Gutierrez said. But he said he was dubious. His suspicions grew stronger, he said, after the family returned and he heard a familiar bark from the house next door. But it was not until Halloween, he said, that his aunt spotted Puddles at a dog groomer’s outside town and took a picture.Mr. Gutierrez said that Ms. Saenz-Lopez would not return his calls and that police officials had rebuffed his complaints.Then things got zanier. Ms. Saenz-Lopez, confronted on her porch by a television reporter, insisted that she was actually her twin sister — until the reporter called out “Ms. Mayor,” and she turned around.As public pressure mounted, Ms. Saenz-Lopez reported her dog Panchito missing and pointed a finger at her neighbors. Mr. Gutierrez insisted that police officers search his house. No Shih Tzu. Then a crew from KZTV in Corpus Christi taped the dog on Ms. Garcia’s ranch outside town.The sisters said a woman had found it and delivered it to them just before the cameras arrived. But three days later, District Attorney Joe Frank Garza of Jim Wells County, running for his fifth four-year term, issued his indictments.Last week, Mr. Canales, the lawyer, characterized the sisters’ untruths as “white lies,” adding, “There’s no malice in these lies.”He called the family’s placement of Puddles with Ms. Saenz-Lopez “tantamount to abandonment,” and he denied that the mayor, who resigned Feb. 1 in the face of a recall petition, had benefited from special treatment. “Man,” he said, “they nailed her to the cross.”The case, which has made headlines around the world, has left the sisters pariahs here and given Alice a new claim to fame 60 years after a suspiciously full ballot box in Precinct 13 gave Lyndon B. Johnson a disputed primary victory, setting him on the road to political stardom.“Alice wants to be known,” said Imelda Ramirez, in her shop, Action Sports and Awards, on frayed East Main Street. “It doesn’t want to be known for a mayor who stole a dog.”'"
"'08-02-13,'1','The Zurich headquarters of Switzerland’s two largest banks may be within walking distance of each other, but when it comes to weathering the credit crisis they are miles apart.One of them, Credit Suisse, said Tuesday that it had write-downs of 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($1.18 billion) in the fourth quarter on debt related to the tight credit market and the subprime-lending crisis in America.Its larger rival, UBS, wrote down $14 billion in the same period. The difference resulted mainly from the scaling back of riskier investments by Credit Suisse’s management before the subprime crisis started.Credit Suisse’s fourth-quarter net profit fell 72 percent, to 1.33 billion francs, from 4.67 billion francs, in the final quarter of 2006. Unlike UBS, which is expected to report a record loss when it announces its results on Thursday, Credit Suisse said its investment banking operation continued to report a profit.Profit from wealth management rose 20 percent, and that from corporate and retail banking increased 21 percent.Credit Suisse said it increased its cash dividend for last year, to 2.5 francs a share from 2.24 francs a share. In Zurich trading on Tuesday, the stock rose 2.5 percent, to 57.5 francs.'"
"'08-02-13,'1','Though this week’s prices were nominal records, the inflation-adjusted record for wheat was set in the mid-1970s, when it exceeded $20 a bushel in today’s dollars after huge sales to the Soviet Union.Foreign buying is driving this market, too, but these buyers include South Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, Nigeria and Venezuela. Economic growth abroad has given people the means to improve their diets, and they are developing a taste for products made from wheat.“We haven’t hit a price that has slowed the international interest,” said Joe Victor of the commodity research firm Allendale. “That is something that definitely has the market excited.”Among the consequences are stretched wallets at home and abroad as food processors pass along higher costs.“When the price of your raw material quadruples, you can’t afford not to raise your prices,” said Timothy Dodd, president and chief executive of the Dakota Growers Pasta Company in Carrington, N.D. “Otherwise you’re out of business.”In a Jan. 30 conference call, the chief executive of Kellogg, A. D. David Mackay, said, “Everyone is feeling these inflationary pressures.” General Mills cited rising ingredient costs when it increased cereal prices last June.The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that world wheat production will rise this year to nearly 664 million tons, from about 655 million tons — not enough to replenish stocks and push down prices. In December, the organization noted that high international grain prices were causing food shortages, hoarding and even riots in some places.To damp volatility, three United States exchanges that trade wheat futures contracts have raised the daily limit on price movements from 30 cents to 60 cents during the past week.For the moment, the mania appeared to be halted in Chicago and Kansas City. March prices for soft red winter wheat, a low-protein wheat that is less favored than spring wheat, fell 41 cents Tuesday, to $10.07, in Chicago.Egypt put out an offer for a large wheat purchase on Monday, but chose not to buy any. That prompted speculation that it was waiting for prices to fall. But Japan was reported to be bidding for 85,000 tons of American spring wheat.“When the last person who has to buy in a market does so, you have a top,” Mr. Boddicker said. “We’re quickly approaching that point, if we haven’t hit it already.”Few farmers have enough wheat on hand to take advantage of the recent increases, the trader said. Most sold last fall for prices that seemed good at the time.The United States Department of Agriculture’s 10-year forecast, released Tuesday, sees the wheat shortage as temporary. Stockpiles were predicted to fall this year to 312 million bushels, from 456 million bushels, before rebounding to about 700 million bushels by the end of the decade.Higher prices “will encourage additional acreage and production,” the report said. Wheat plantings will rise to 65 million acres in the 2008-9 season, from 60.4 million this year, the Agriculture Department said, though it predicted the number would then fall because of competition from other crops.'"
"'08-02-13,'1','Other users have been wary of casting the case as a free-speech issue, partly because they sense that the police crackdown may have strong public backing and partly because Hong Kong laws allow the police to prosecute people who distribute pornography.Some say the backlash from the public could be worse than the crackdown by the police if Internet users oppose it too vocally.“If we listen to radio talk shows and so forth, there are people calling in who say that Internet users are unreasonable and want to pass around dirty pictures,” said Charles Mok, the chairman of the Hong Kong chapter of the Internet Society, an international advisory group on Internet standards.Mr. Mok took a somewhat sympathetic tone toward authorities, noting that just as the police could not ticket every traffic offender, they could not charge everyone who distributed pornography, but did have an obligation to address cases that caught the community’s attention, like videos and photos that appear to show famous singers engaged in sex acts.Mr. Mok did not join Sunday’s march, which the police estimated at 230 people and organizers estimated at more than 400.One of Hong Kong’s most popular singers, Gillian Chung, who has a following of girls in their early teens and younger and who has been prominently featured in ads for Hong Kong Disneyland, seems to appear repeatedly in the photographic material. Ms. Chung is part of a duo known as the Twins.At a brief news conference on Monday, Ms. Chung neither confirmed nor denied that she appeared in the images, but she said she had been “naïve” in her youth and regretted causing distress to her family and fans. The date of the images is unclear, but they appear to have been taken over the last several years.When a few photos began to circulate on the Internet in late January, the Emperor Entertainment Group, the promoter of Ms. Chung and several other singers involved, suggested that the photos had been altered to place the stars’ faces on other women’s bodies in the videos and photographs. Spokesmen for Emperor Entertainment declined to comment on the dispute.Late Tuesday, in an e-mail reply to questions, the Hong Kong police confirmed that they had arrested nine people and said that two had been charged so far with “publishing obscene articles” and one had been charged with “access to a computer with dishonest/criminal intent.”The police declined to address the question of selective enforcement except to say that “any enforcement action taken by the police is in accordance with the laws in Hong Kong.”Some observers say they see the current cases as part of a toughening of Hong Kong police policies. The arrests coincide with preparations for six Olympic equestrian events to be held in Hong Kong in August.Jackie Hung, the vice convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, a broad coalition of nongovernmental groups in Hong Kong, said she knew of 37 protesters arrested last year at nonviolent demonstrations.The crackdown contrasts starkly with Hong Kong’s recent past. When about 500,000 people protested on July 1, 2003, against a proposal for strict internal security laws, the police arrested no one. Afterward, the government withdrew the proposal.Hong Kong media reported this week that a video store across the border in mainland China was selling CDs of the singers’ explicit videos and photos for $2.70 each, but was promptly closed by mainland officials. Discussions of the videos and photos have flooded Internet forums in Hong Kong and the mainland.The photos and videos appear to show a well-known male Hong Kong singer and record producer, Edison Chen, in separate scenes with at least six women, four of whom are also well-known singers. In a video released last week, Mr. Chen apologized “to anyone who has been affected” and asked the public to delete any copies of the photos.“The lives of many innocent people have been affected by this malicious and criminal conduct, and in this regard I am filled with pain, hurt and frustration,” Mr. Chen said.According to the police, Mr. Chen took his laptop computer to a local computer repair shop, and the computer’s memory was copied there. An employee at a downtown computer store, eLiTe Multimedia Ltd., who only gave his last name, Yeung, said on Tuesday that a former employee had been arrested, but he declined to elaborate, citing the police investigation.The current scandal has led Hong Kong tabloids to run reports in the last several days of supposed plans by gangsters to “teach a lesson” to Mr. Chen and perhaps even kill him. Organized crime has long played an important role in Hong Kong’s entertainment industry.Mr. Chen has left Hong Kong but plans to return this weekend and hold a news conference, said Mavis Leung, his spokeswoman, who declined to elaborate.'"
"'08-02-13,'1','According to Wall Street’s forecasters, the recession of 2008 is now unavoidable. That is, if you read between the lines of their predictions.In a survey released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, forecasters said on average there was a 47 percent chance that the economy would shrink in the first quarter of this year. But the economists surveyed, many working for investment banks or Wall Street research firms, are an optimistic bunch, and every time they have gotten so worried over the last four decades, the economy has ended up in a recession.There have been six recessions since 1968, the year that the quarterly survey of economists began. At the start of each one, economists put the odds that the economy would shrink in the current quarter at 40 percent or more.Anxious Index In the latest survey, the forecasters also said there was a 43 percent chance that the economy would shrink in the second quarter of 2008. Every time that reading has risen above 40 percent, the economy has gone into recession.'"
"'08-02-13,'1','Mr. McCain is now the presumptive nominee, although he still faces a Republican competitor, Mike Huckabee, who continues to accumulate delegates despite Mr. McCain’s daunting lead.Mr. Reynolds, who declined to be interviewed for this article, is of critical importance to the McCain campaign not simply because of his wealth but also for his layers of contacts with other wealthy donors. Under campaign finance rules in large part created by Mr. McCain himself under the McCain-Feingold bill, individual contributions are limited to $2,300 each for the nominating contests and the general election every election cycle.The result is that highly connected, prosperous people like Mr. Reynolds are of huge value to a campaign because they can call on many other highly connected, prosperous people to write checks, which is particularly vital to Republicans in a year when Democrats have far outpaced them in fund-raising.In 2004, contributors to Mr. Bush who collected $100,000 in checks, otherwise known as bundlers, were called Pioneers. Those who collected $200,000 were called Rangers, after the Texas baseball team once partly owned by Mr. Bush.Mr. McCain’s advisers said that the senator’s campaign would also be bestowing titles on its most prolific fund-raisers under an “incentive system,” with privileges for those who raised the most money.Mr. McCain’s advisers said that the candidate, despite his signature legislative efforts to restrict the money spent on political campaigns, would not accept public financing and spending limits for this year’s general campaign. But in 2007, Mr. McCain did agree to a nonaggression pact with Senator Barack Obama to accept public financing, about $85 million each for the general election, if the Democratic nominee did the same.Mr. McCain’s advisers insisted that the senator was not turning his back on a campaign finance system, which bans large “soft-money” donations to the political parties, that he helped put in place. “The senator’s always been an advocate of contributions from individual Americans,” said Wayne Berman, a major McCain fund-raiser. “It’s those contributions that are supporting his presidential campaign.”Mr. Berman was one of numerous Bush supporters who signed up to raise money for Mr. McCain early last year, when the senator was in his first incarnation as the Republican front-runner. But the campaign fell far short of its $100 million fund-raising target and by last summer had nearly collapsed in debt and recriminations. In November Mr. McCain took out a $3 million loan to keep the race alive through New Hampshire. His primary victory there on Jan. 8 opened wallets all over the country. Since then he has held 20 fund-raisers and collected more than $12 million.Other major fund-raisers for Mr. McCain include Henry R. Kravis, the financier; A. Gerald Perenchio, the former chairman and chief executive of Univision Communications, the nation’s largest Spanish-language broadcaster; and Lewis M. Eisenberg, the former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee and the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.This week and next Mr. McCain’s advisers are planning strategy meetings to set new money targets, set a fund-raising schedule and discuss how they might use Mr. Bush at fund-raising events. They are also working on hiring staff members and setting up “McCain for president” offices around the country.“We have to talk about the short term and the long term,” Mr. Black said. “Basically you’re changing from a primary campaign that runs on fumes and volunteers to a national campaign.”'"
"'08-02-13,'1','WASHINGTON — Winding down a presidential campaign that sputters — like cleaning up after one of those great Hollywood epics that remain unfinished — can be a complicated, joyless task. After the dream dies, there are lots of bills to pay and loose ends to tie up.A half-dozen senior officials of the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee conferred this week on how to wind down their affairs, and at least one piece of their correspondence painted what appeared to be a bleak picture of the dormant campaign’s financial situation.“We are deeper in the hole than I thought we would be,” John Gross, the campaign’s treasurer, wrote in an e-mail message to several senior campaign aides that was obtained by The New York Times.“Windown is likely to be less than projected, but travel expenses are higher,” Mr. Gross continued. “We cannot prefer any one creditor. We probably could make a 10% payment to all qualified creditors at this point, but probably not much more.”Mr. Gross did not reply to e-mail requesting comment on Tuesday night, but a senior campaign official cautioned against reading too much into Mr. Gross’s message. That official, who discussed the campaign’s finances on the condition of anonymity, said that all creditors would be paid and that a report to be filed this month with the Federal Election Commission would show that the campaign had roughly $9 million on hand at the end of January, with about $2 million in debts.'"
"'08-02-13,'1','WASHINGTON — Making some of his most pointed remarks on race relations, President Bush on Tuesday denounced racially charged incidents involving nooses and called the era of lynchings from the 19th to the 20th centuries “a shameful chapter in American history.”“The noose is not a symbol of prairie justice, but of gross injustice,” Mr. Bush said at a ceremony in the East Room of the White House. “Displaying one is not a harmless prank. And ‘lynching’ is not a word to be mentioned in jest.“As a civil society, we should be able to agree that noose displays and lynching jokes are deeply offensive. They are wrong. And they have no place in America today.”The remarks followed highly publicized cases in which nooses were brazenly and intimidatingly displayed, including at Columbia University and on a Coast Guard cutter. Many of the cases followed a seething racial and legal dispute in Jena, La., where nooses were hung from a schoolyard tree in 2006 and where six black teenagers were charged with beating a white student.The president made his remarks at a ceremony commemorating African-American History Month, an annual event that he has previously used to praise the political, social and economic contributions of blacks, though rarely to speak as passionately as he did on Tuesday.Mr. Bush did not address the Jena case. The case has revived accusations that his administration has not done enough to prosecute hate crimes. In September, when the main case prompted protests and marches over the teenagers’ prosecutions, Mr. Bush said that the events saddened him and that the Justice Department would monitor the problem.'"
"'08-02-13,'1','The legislation helps businesses in two ways. It gives companies a 50 percent bonus deduction on new equipment that would normally be depreciated over many years. And it increases — to $250,000 from $128,000 in 2008 — the limit on expenses that small businesses can deduct from annual income, with a total cap of $800,000.For a small business like Dahm Trucking, which has annual revenue over $5 million, the most valuable provision is the increased expensing.Now, Chris Dahm, its president, said he could buy three trailers, at $100,000 apiece. That means Mr. Dahm can enter contracts with three independent owner-operator truck drivers to haul goods on the trailers, and add a person to his two-member office staff. “It’s going to help us out quite a bit,” he said.Had there been no government intervention, he said, he would have had to just “sit and wait to see what happens.” Expansion would have been out of the question, he added, while layoffs were possible.Business was “very poor” in the fourth quarter, Mr. Dahm said, and so far this year, “it has been a disaster.” While some of the slowdown is seasonal, he said, steel shipments have dropped sharply. That also happened during recessions in the 1980s and early ’90s.Mr. Danner of the advocacy group said many more smaller companies that are in a position to invest in office equipment, vehicles, machinery, and the like would do so.McCutcheon’s Apple Products, which is in the process of completing a major retail expansion, will take advantage of the bonus depreciation, an owner, Bob McCutcheon, said.“We are looking to spend up to $6.5 million on our building,” he said. “The accelerated depreciation will mean we will pay less taxes for quite some time.”Instead of depreciating the cost over a longer period, the family-run business can deduct 50 percent of the total cost this year and the normal depreciation of the remaining cost. “It will give us a lot of money to hire more people and upgrade other systems,” Mr. McCutcheon said.Ms. Weltman cautioned owners to talk to their tax advisers to see if their businesses would be eligible to take advantage of the new provisions. “It’s a huge deal for some businesses,” she said, “but how many small businesses spend $250,000 a year for equipment?”'"
"'08-02-13,'1','The economic stimulus legislation approved by Congress on Thursday includes two provisions that would benefit businesses. The first raises — to $250,000 in 2008, from $128,000 — the dollar amount of limits on expensing. The second allows for a one-year depreciation deduction of 50 percent of the cost of the property, in addition to regular depreciation on the remaining cost. Barbara Weltman, a lawyer and author of “J. K. Lasser’s Small Business Taxes, 2008,” provides examples of how both would work.An independent trucker wants to buy a new rig, which costs about $150,000. Before the new law, he could expense (that is, deduct) only the first $128,000 of the purchase price. Under the stimulus act, he will be able to write off the entire purchase price (up to the new $250,000 limit).Note: The deduction is allowed even if the purchase price is financed in whole or in part. Consult a tax adviser because a business has to be profitable to benefit from expensing.A company spends $1 million on replacing all its computers and servers in various locations. Computers are treated under the tax law as having a five-year recovery period for depreciation purposes.Without bonus depreciation, the company could claim depreciation in the first year of $200,000 (20 percent of $1 million). With the new 50 percent bonus depreciation, the company can deduct $600,000 in the first year (50 percent bonus depreciation of $500,000, plus $100,000, which is 20 percent of $500,000). The remaining cost can be depreciated over the remaining recovery period.Note: Most small businesses would not use bonus depreciation for equipment; they would use expensing. But they might use bonus depreciation for qualified leasehold improvements, which are any internal improvements, not including building additions or anything else benefiting a common area, that are placed in service more than three years after the building goes into service.

"'08-02-13,'1','Like one of its poker-faced characters, “The Slug Bearers,” which was performed at the Kitchen in 2004, exudes a heavy passivity that would be oppressive were it not for the feathery, tickling wit that lurks beneath. Its heroine, GinGin (Jody Flader) — the daughter of the electronics tycoon and philanthropist Dr. Rushower (Peter Friedman) — finds what she reads in the newspapers so upsetting that it’s hard for her to leave her bed in the glamorous penthouse apartment that she shares with her father.Fate — or anyway, strategically spilled strawberry ice cream, dropped from the apartment terrace — unites her with Immanuel Lubang (Bobby Steggert), a young man devoted to the poetry of vintage home-appliance manuals. They develop a shared concern for the exploited workers of Kayrol Island, who transport on their shoulders the metal slugs exported worldwide to weigh down flyaway everyday objects like toasters and telephones.I am delivering this improbable exposition without a wink, because that’s what the show does. Know, though, that even if you enter into the idiosyncratic spirit of the plot as described thus far, you’re unlikely to predict where it will take you.“The Slug Bearers” may deal with subjects common to contemporary satire: fiendish industrial autocrats (in this case, the cackling George Klatter, played by a Lex Luthor-like Stephen Lee Anderson); shortsighted do-gooders; the limited attention span of news gatherers; and the (literal) insubstantiality of a technology-driven culture.But Mr. Katchor is not an attack artist, and “The Slug Bearers” is neither sendup nor angry social rebuke.Instead, like much of this artist’s work, it is propelled by a brooding and amused awareness of the strange, individual quirks and appetites that both keep people apart and occasionally bring them together.This sensibility is conveyed with real enchantment by the set and projection designs of Jim Findlay and Jeff Sugg (subtly enhanced by Russell H. Champa’s lighting), which bring to eye-teasing life Mr. Katchor’s drawings of lonely town (as in New York City) and polluted country (as in the tropical isle of Kayrol). Projections on scrims are used to create some delightful trompe l’oeil moments involving walking amid street traffic, riding elevators and even answering the phone.These are never mere sight gags, though, but part of a thoroughgoing mise-en-scène that melts boundaries between the real and representational. At the same time there’s a strong, melancholy suggestion that the people who inhabit this flat but fluid landscape can never fully step into the world they live in. (And I mean the characters, not the performers.)Mr. Mulcahy’s music, performed by four dexterous musicians, is also flat and fluid, matching the show’s look. Most of the songs are protracted vamps, with a limited range of notes dancing on an extended single line. (Imagine Philip Glass in a party mood.) But the variations he renders within this limited framework range wide: finger-snapping beatnik jazz; fancy-tickling lyricism; hip-swaying calypso; impulse-dictating advertising jingles.The disciplined and charming cast — which also includes Will Swenson, Tom Riis Farrell and, as a happily narcotized slug bearer, the seductively sluggish Matt Pearson — grasp the hard and crucial distinction between human cartoon and overblown caricature. Like Mr. Mulcahy’s music, they pack maximal effect into minimal expression, appropriate to a show that considers the value of heft and weight within paper-thin flimsiness.They were so persuasive, in fact, that when I left the Vineyard and entered the throngs at Union Square, I had to blink to clear my eyes. All the people on the streets appeared to have been drawn by Mr. Katchor.THE SLUG BEARERS OF KAYROL ISLAND (OR, THE FRIENDS OF DR.

"'08-02-13,'1','The offer initially heartened investors, who have grown increasingly alarmed by the drumbeat of grim news from the bond guarantors. Financial shares led the stock market higher for much of the day before the rally faded in the afternoon.But the insurers’ share prices fell as traders considered the implications of Mr. Buffett’s statements on the companies’ business. The offer would do little to alleviate the problems the insurers are facing on securities backed by mortgages, consumer loans and other assets. In fact, reinsuring municipal bonds with Mr. Buffett could make the companies more vulnerable because they would be left with only the riskiest insurance contracts.“Essentially, if any of the companies were to take him up on this offer, it would be almost them waving a white flag saying that they are done,” said Rob Haines, an analyst at the research firm CreditSights. “It does not make sense to give up what is the good part of your business.”In trading Tuesday, MBIA’s stock closed down 15.3 percent, at $11.50. Shares of Ambac were down 15.1 percent, closing at $8.90. F.G.I.C. is privately held.Mr. Buffett’s offer, along with news that mortgage companies would give delinquent borrowers more time to restructure their loans, helped buoy stocks most of the day, but prices fell back toward the end of trading. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closed up 0.73 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average was up 133.40 points, or 1.09 percent. The technology-weighted Nasdaq composite index was essentially flat.Shares of financial companies, which might benefit from a strong company like Berkshire Hathaway’s backing municipal bonds, rose 1.4 percent.In a letter dated Feb. 6 to Lazard, the investment bank that is advising MBIA, Ajit B. Jain, president of reinsurance for Berkshire Hathaway, proposed that MBIA pay Mr. Buffett’s company 150 percent of the premium it earns for insuring its municipal bond portfolio. Typically, insurers cede a share of their premiums, not more than they earn.“I would submit that our proposal at the pricing levels we require is actually a cheap way for MBIA to raise capital as compared to other alternatives and is therefore a great benefit to MBIA’s owners and their municipal bond policy holders,” Mr. Jain wrote. He noted that in recent months, Berkshire had been able to set premiums at twice as much as MBIA used to charge, or more. Mr. Jain estimated that the reinsurance premiums paid by MBIA and Ambac would total about $9 billion.Neither he nor Mr. Buffett returned telephone calls Tuesday.Berkshire Hathaway’s offer was prompted by a call from the New York State insurance superintendent, Eric R. Dinallo, who late last year asked the company to enter the bond insurance business directly and quickly gave it approval to do business in the state. The company has since had similarly warm receptions in other states.In the last couple of months, investors and regulators have focused on the bond guarantors. For state regulators, the main concern has been protecting the $2.6 trillion municipal bond market, about half of which is insured. For some states, cities and other public entities, the cost of borrowing is up noticeably recently because investors are concerned that the guarantors’ backing will turn out worthless.Mr. Dinallo, who regulates MBIA and F.G.I.C., has asked large banks like Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and UBS, many of which hold insurance policies from the guarantors, to devise a plan to shore up the insurers. The officials are discussing investing in the insurers or providing them with lines of credit to cover future losses and restore confidence in them. (Ambac is regulated by Wisconsin regulators.)While the banks and the guarantors continue to meet daily with each other and with Joseph R. Perella, an investment banker who is advising Mr. Dinallo, the Berkshire Hathaway reinsurance plan is seen as a backup solution if those talks are unsuccessful, said a person familiar with the discussions but who was not authorized to speak about them.One analyst said that Mr. Dinallo could be using the Berkshire offer to put pressure on the banks to come up with a plan that addresses both the municipal debt obligations and the mortgage-related securities insured by the bond guarantors.“It may be an effort to get the banks to come to the table and probably do it on better terms than” what Mr. Buffett is offering, said Douglas A. Dachille, chief executive of First Principles Capital Management, a bond firm based in New York.The guarantors — who maintain that while they have made mistakes, they remain in good financial shape — are unlikely to find the reinsurance plan appealing. They would much prefer reinsuring the part of their business that is at greater risk for future losses, and they would like to pay a smaller premium than what Berkshire has suggested.On Tuesday, all three companies declined to comment.In an interview in December, Mr. Buffett said he did not want to enter the business of insuring mortgage-related bonds because those securities were too complex and risky — a view he reiterated Tuesday on CNBC.“The insurance in the market is not doing bondholders any good and is in some cases penalizing bond investors,” Mr. Buffett said. “Our proposal puts the municipals at the front of the line.”'"
"'08-02-13,'1','KBR and other companies, meanwhile, have required Iraq-bound employees to agree to take personnel disputes to private arbitration rather than sue the companies in American courts. The companies have repeatedly challenged arbitration claims of sexual assault or harassment brought by women who served in Iraq, raising fears among some women about going public with their claims.The issue gained national attention when Jamie Leigh Jones, a 23-year-old former employee of KBR, testified at a Congressional hearing in December that she had been gang-raped by co-workers in Iraq in 2005. She appeared again on Tuesday and talked in detail about the episode, urging lawmakers to make it easier for crime victims to sue employers.“Victims of crime perpetrated by employees of taxpayer-funded government contracts in Iraq deserve the same standard of treatment and protection governed by the same laws whether they are working in the U.S. or abroad,” she said.Since she spoke out publicly in December, other women have begun to step forward.Ms. Jones and her lawyers said 38 women who worked as contractors in Iraq, Kuwait and other countries had contacted her since she testified to discuss their own experiences. Now, Congressional leaders are seeking answers from the Pentagon, the State Department and other agencies to try to determine the scope of the threats facing women who are contractors.Paul Brand, a Chicago psychologist who counsels contractors who have served in Iraq, said the harassment of female workers by male colleagues was common. “The extent of the harassment varies greatly from contractor to contractor, depending on how diligently they screen job candidates and management’s willingness to encourage women to report problems,” he said. “In many instances, very little or nothing is done.”Comprehensive statistics on sexual assaults in Iraq are unavailable because no one in the government or the contracting industry is tracking them. Court documents, interviews with those who were victims, their lawyers and other professionals, along with the limited data made available by the Bush administration, suggest a troubling trend.The Criminal Investigation Command of the Army has reported that it investigated 124 cases of sexual assault in Iraq over the last three years. Those figures, provided to Senator Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who has taken the lead in the Senate on the issue, include cases involving both contractors and military personnel, but do not include cases involving contractors or soldiers investigated by other branches of the military.The Bureau of Diplomatic Security of the State Department has separately reported that it has investigated four cases of rape or sexual assault involving female contractors, including Ms. Jones’s case. But the Pentagon has so far failed to respond to a request from Mr. Nelson for more comprehensive data, including the number of rape examinations done by military doctors in Iraq on behalf of female contractors. What is more, the Bush administration has not offered to develop a coordinated response to the problem, aides to Senator Nelson and experts have said.Heather Browne, a spokeswoman for KBR, said the company would protect women working in Iraq. “KBR’s commitment to the safety and security of all employees is unwavering,” she said in a statement. “One instance of sexual harassment or assault is too many and unacceptable.” The company declined to say how many female employees had reported that they were victims of sex crimes in Iraq.The administration’s decision to rely so heavily on outside contractors — about 180,000 contractors work in Iraq, significantly outnumbering United States military personnel in the country — probably made it inevitable that contractor crime would emerge as a problem as the war dragged on. KBR, by far the largest military contractor in Iraq, says that it now has 2,383 women there, of a total work force of 54,170.A shooting in Baghdad last September involving Blackwater guards that left 17 Iraqis dead highlighted the lack of clarity in the laws governing contractors. In cases involving sexual assault, for example, soldiers and other military personnel can be prosecuted under the military justice system, but that system does not apply to contractors.Instead, a little-used law, the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, seems to be the closest statute that could apply to contractors charged with rape, but its legal reach has been under wide debate since the Blackwater shootings.Women who worked as contractors in Iraq say that while on the job they encountered sexual discrimination and harassment, which sometimes veered dangerously to sexual assaults and even rapes.Linda Lindsey, of Houston, who worked for KBR in Iraq from 2004 until early 2007, said that she often saw evidence of sexual harassment or discrimination, and that male supervisors often tried to force female employees to grant sexual favors in exchange for promotions or other benefits.She added that the company’s management seemed unwilling to take action to improve working conditions for women in Iraq. “We filed complaints against one supervisor, and the complaints disappeared,” Ms. Lindsey said in an interview. “The impression you got was that they really didn’t want to hear it, because the money was coming in. Most of it was bad management on-site.”Pamela Jones, of Texas, a KBR logistics coordinator in Kuwait in 2003 and 2004, was sexually assaulted by a supervisor. “It was known that if you started complaining that you could lose your job,” said Ms. Jones, who added that she reported it to management. “They give you an 800 number to report. But then they shoved it under the rug, and they told me I was a pest.”She later won an arbitration award from KBR, according to her Houston lawyer, Peter Costea.Lawyers for women who have reported that they were raped or assaulted while working in Iraq say that one of the biggest obstacles they face is the arbitration requirement.That means that women who say they were victimized have had great difficulty taking KBR to court for failing to better protect its female employees in Iraq.KBR defended the arbitration process, saying it is fair. The fact that Ms. Kineston and Pamela Jones won awards is an indication that the system works, said Ms. Browne, the KBR spokeswoman.Jamie Leigh Jones said she had been fighting to get her case out of the arbitration process and into a federal court, and she testified before a House committee on Tuesday in support of the need to change the laws governing private arbitration. KBR says it “disputes Ms. Jones’s version of the incident she alleges.”After her Congressional testimony in December, she also testified before a federal grand jury in Florida, which has begun a criminal inquiry into her case more than two years after she first reported the rape.Her lawyer, Todd Kelly, says he believes that the government has finally been prodded into action only because of the public attention brought by her case. “Her case came out on television before they said anything about a grand jury,” he said.'"
"'08-02-13,'1','It’s not yet clear which prejudice will infect the presidential contest more — misogyny or racism.Many women I talk to, even those who aren’t particularly fond of Hillary, feel empathy for her, knowing that any woman in a world dominated by men has to walk a tightrope between femininity and masculinity, strength and vulnerability.They see double standards they hate — when male reporters described Hillary’s laugh as “a cackle” or her voice as “grating,” when Rush Limbaugh goes off on her wrinkles or when male pundits seem gleeful to write her political obituary. Several women I know, who argue with their husbands about Hillary, refer with a shudder to the “Kill the Witch” syndrome.In a webcast, prestidigitator Penn Jillette talks about a joke he has begun telling in his show. He thinks the thunderous reaction it gets from audiences shows that Hillary no longer has a shot.The joke goes: “Obama is just creaming Hillary. You know, all these primaries, you know. And Hillary says it’s not fair, because they’re being held in February, and February is Black History Month. And unfortunately for Hillary, there’s no White Bitch Month.”Of course, jokes like that — even Jillette admits it’s offensive — are exactly what may give Hillary a shot. When the usually invulnerable Hillary seems vulnerable, many women, even ones who don’t want her to win, cringe at the idea of seeing her publicly humiliated — again.And since women — and some men — tend to be more protective when she is down, it is impossible to rule out a rally, especially if voters start to see Obama, after his eight-contest rout, as that maddening archetypal figure: the glib golden boy who slides through on charm and a smile.Those close to Hillary say she’s feeling blue. It’s an unbearable twist of fate to spend all those years in the shadow of one Secretariat, only to have another gallop past while you’re plodding toward the finish line.I know that the attacks against powerful women can be harsh and personal and unfair, enough to make anyone cry.But Hillary is not the best test case for women. We’ll never know how much of the backlash is because she’s a woman or because she’s this woman or because of the ick factor of returning to the old Clinton dysfunction.While Obama aims to transcend race, Hillary often aims to use gender to her advantage, or to excuse mistakes. In 1994, after her intransigence and secrecy-doomed health care plan, she told The Wall Street Journal that she was “a gender Rorschach test.”“If somebody has a female boss for the first time, and they’ve never experienced that,” she said, “well, maybe they can’t take out their hostility against her so they turn it on me.”As a possible first Madame President, Hillary is a flawed science experiment because you can’t take Bill out of the equation. Her story is wrapped up in her marriage, and her marriage is wrapped up in a series of unappetizing compromises, arrangements and dependencies.Instead of carving out a separate identity for herself, she has become more entwined with Bill. She is running bolstered by his record and his muscle. She touts her experience as first lady, even though her judgment during those years on issue after issue was poor. She says she’s learned from her mistakes, but that’s not a compelling pitch.As a senator, she was not a leading voice on important issues, and her Iraq vote was about her political viability.She told New York magazine’s John Heilemann that before Iowa taught her that she had to show her soft side, “I really believed I had to prove in this race from the very beginning that a woman could be president and a woman could be commander in chief. I thought that was my primary mission.”If Hillary fails, it will be her failure, not ours.'"

"'08-02-14,'0','“I think the team’s playing pretty good, but I want to be clear: We can play a lot better,” the veteran center John Madden said. “We can just be a more complete team. If we can do that, I think we’d be really hard to beat.”The Devils had a frustrating first period, and the Senators took a 1-0 lead. But the Devils tied the score on Langenbrunner’s first short-handed goal of the season, and his 10th goal over all, at 6:12 of the second period.With Devils defenseman Paul Martin serving a hooking penalty, Patrik Elias won a battle for a loose puck inside the Devils’ blue line. He nudged it to Langenbrunner, who decided to take a slap shot before Elias caught up for a possible two-on-one break.“When you’re short-handed, you can’t afford to miss the net when you take that shot,” Langenbrunner said.The Devils, suddenly energized, took the lead 1:52 later on the fourth goal of the season by defenseman Karel Rachunek. His one-timer beat Gerber for his fourth goal.But the Senators, who added more depth to their lineup by acquiring left wing Cory Stillman and defenseman Mike Commodore in a trade Monday with Carolina, tied the score on a booming shot by Randy Robitaille at 15:29. It was his 10th goal.Robitaille’s shot sailed over the left shoulder of Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur and squeezed into the top right-hand corner of the goal. Brodeur stopped all seven shots he faced the rest of the way to post his 12th straight 30-win season.Sutter said he was pleased that Gionta had scored for the first time in 14 games, but he seemed happier that Gionta had ventured into tough areas on the ice and had held his own lately. He scored the winner from the spot Sutter wants him to occupy.“It’s something we talked about, to try and sit in front of the net instead of on the side of the net,” Sutter said.The Devils had won three of their last eight games before Wednesday, but were still only 1 point behind Pittsburgh, the first-place team in the Atlantic Division, after the Penguins lost, 2-1, Wednesday to Boston.“Right now, it’s that time of year where you need all the points you can get,” Gionta said.THRASHERS 3, CAPITALS 2 Éric Perrin and Slava Kozlov scored on Atlanta’s first two shootout opportunities to secure a victory over visiting Washington.Kari Lehtonen stopped 39 shots before denying Washington’s Alexander Semin and Boyd Gordon in the shootout. Lehtonen, who also had an assist, made a glove save on Gordon’s shot to finish the win.The victory left Atlanta, Washington and Carolina tied for first in the Southeast Division.

"'08-02-14,'0','“If you want the same as we’ve had in the last seven years,” Mr. Obama said, “then I think John McCain’s going to be a great choice.”The exchanges, hardly uncommon in the throes of a biting race, carry residue of a dust-up they had two years ago and provide a window into how they view, and may approach, each other should they battle in a general election.In a debate in 2006 on ethics in the Senate, which Mr. McCain regarded as a signature issue, he dressed down Mr. Obama and accused the freshman senator of disingenuousness. Mr. Obama called Mr. McCain cranky.In public, that dispute melted away when the two cocked their fists at each other and hugged for a mutually beneficial photo opportunity. Their rapport has not advanced, and the two have a distant relationship.The two men are very different. Mr. McCain, 71, is a veteran of political and military battles. Mr. Obama, 46, is community organizer turned Ivy League graduate. Mr. McCain has told friends and associates that he views Mr. Obama as something of an upstart whose charmed political life delivered him to the same place Mr. McCain’s decades of public and military service did.And, associates said, Mr. McCain had always hoped to take on Mrs. Clinton.Although Mrs. Clinton has been in the Senate just four more years than Mr. Obama, she has been on the Armed Services Committee and traveled around the world with Mr. McCain.Examples of their mutual respect typically include a tale of holding a vodka-drinking contest in Estonia. Such a celebration may have been unlikely to happen with Mr. Obama, who on a trip to Russia in 2005 asked that his shot glass be filled with water.The Democratic nomination is far from decided, and Mr. McCain could still have his wish to face Mrs. Clinton. But after winning 21 states, amassing more delegates and building a larger fund-raising network, Mr. Obama has increased his chances week by week, and his advisers are deliberating how to confront Mr. McCain, particularly because a selling point of both is their ability to court independents and moderates.Mr. Obama’s early strategy is clear: No matter what the message, praise Mr. McCain for his service to the country, particularly because Mr. Obama was not in the military. It is, strategists said, a similar approach to how Bill Clinton dealt with Bob Dole in 1996.“By the way, John McCain is a great American hero, a war hero,” Mr. Obama told voters here. “We honor his service.”He proceeded to criticize Mr. McCain for supporting the extension of the Bush administration’s tax cuts. Mr. McCain once opposed the idea.“George Bush may not be on the ballot this fall, but his tax cuts and his economic policies are,” Mr. Obama said. “And if John McCain wants to debate the specifics of how well the economy has worked for ordinary families over the last seven years, that is a debate that I am happy to have, because the American people know that Bush’s policies have not worked for ordinary Americans.”As Mr. Obama seeks to paint Mr. McCain as an extension of the current White House, Mr. McCain is seeking to raise questions about Mr. Obama’s readiness for the presidency. His critique carries a familiar frequency to questions that Mrs. Clinton raises.He said Wednesday: “I’ve not observed every speech that he’s given, obviously. But they are singularly lacking in specifics.”Before an audience of Republicans on Tuesday, Mr. McCain was far more animated. “I have seen men’s hopes tested in hard and cruel ways that few will ever experience,” Mr. McCain said.The exchanges recall the feuding on the ethics bill, which lingered for days and drew considerable notice, given Mr. McCain’s tone to a colleague.“I understand how important the opportunity to lead your party’s effort to exploit this issue must seem to a freshman senator,” Mr. McCain wrote in a letter to Mr. Obama that he sent to every news outlet on Capitol Hill. “And I hold no hard feelings over your earlier disingenuousness.”For his part, Mr. Obama has tended to highlight the generational differences, saying he represents the future and Mr. McCain represents the past. Mr. Obama’s advisers said although they have not determined how to deal with Mr. McCain, they intend to keep their criticism focused on differences over issues.And no, they said, do not expect Mr. Obama to dust off the lyrics to a song he performed on March 11, 2006, when he appeared as a keynote speaker at the Gridiron Dinner in Washington. His words were written to the tune of “If I Only Had a Brain.”“When a wide-eyed young idealist, confronts a seasoned realist, there’s bound to be some strain,” Mr. Obama sang perfectly on pitch. “With the game barely started, I’d be feeling less downhearted, if I only had McCain.”'"

"'08-02-14,'0','Indeed, with its commanding view of Central Park and its Fifth Avenue address, the building has become a symbol of New York corporate power since General Motors moved its boardroom and some 3,300 employees there 40 years ago. Since then, though, G.M.’s presence has shrunk to three floors from 26, and its contractual naming rights for the property expire in 2010.Corporate naming rights for stadiums generate as much as $20 million a year, the book says. Just think what emblazoning a corporate logo across the face of a skyscraper with “global iconic recognition,” media exposure and 365-day-a-year foot traffic, it says enticingly.What the book does not mention are the potential pitfalls. In many parts of the city, zoning restrictions bar an owner from slapping a name on the roof or exterior of a building. Blue chip tenants often insert clauses into their leases prohibiting a building from being named after a competitor.Most of all, no one is sure what the rights are really worth, since they are most often used to clinch a deal with a corporate tenant. (Condé Nast is one well-known tenant whose building is now named after it.) “The value of naming rights is more in securing a deal with an anchor tenant than it is in adding additional income to a building’s bottom line,” the developer Douglas Durst said. In Mr. Macklowe’s case, there is special incentive for adding to the G.M. Building’s revenue stream. He needs to raise more than $1.2 billion to pay off a short-term, high-interest loan that is now technically in default.Mr. Macklowe has said he figures the tower is worth $3.5 billion. According to the sales book, the building generates a relatively slim cash flow of $17.1 million on a net operating income of $130.5 million, after debt service and other expenses.For that reason, Mr. Macklowe, who is more interested in retaining management and a stake in the building than in simply turning it over to a new owner, is doing everything he can to identify new sources of revenue. The sales book points out that General Motors’ lease of 98,000 square feet will expire next year. Based on current leases in the building, the sales book estimates that the effective rent for the space could quadruple to about $20 million a year.Then, there are the naming rights.But even if someone wants to buy them, there are obstacles to overcome. The law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a tenant, has a lease restriction that prohibits renaming the building after another law firm, while Estée Lauder has a provision barring renaming it after other cosmetic firms.City regulations often prohibit large signs by advertisers, as opposed to tenants, with the exception of Times Square, where big neon billboards are encouraged. Zoning regulations for the G.M. Building prohibit a big sign on the roof like MetLife’s at 200 Park Avenue, which was built before that rule went into effect. A corporate logo could go on the side of the tower, so long as it does not rise higher than 25 feet above the curb and does not take up more than 200 square feet on each blockfront.Building names do not always endure. In 1982, the communications giant AT&T built a new 36-story headquarters on Madison Avenue at 56th Street, and carved its name on the building. Nine years later, the company left for the New Jersey suburbs, turning the tower over to Sony. But the name change never really caught on with anyone other than Sony employees.In some famous cases, buildings have remained towering advertisements long after the companies moved away.Frank Winfield Woolworth and Walter P. Chrysler erected two of the most beloved skyscrapers in Manhattan to make a bold corporate statement. Built in 1913, the Woolworth Building rises 54 stories at Broadway and Barclay Streets while the 79-year-old Chrysler Building is an Art Deco landmark on 42nd Street. Their companies have long since left New York, but subsequent owners have not changed the names.The Pan Am Building was able to take on a new identity in the 1990s as the MetLife Building, standing astride Park Avenue next to Grand Central Terminal.It is clear that many companies, and even some individuals, see a value in putting their names on buildings. Donald Trump, whose name is on more than a dozen towers, including some he doesn’t own, quickly pasted the gold colored letters T-R-U-M-P on the G.M. Building in 1999 after he and a partner, Conseco, bought the property and renamed it the General Motors Building at Trump International Plaza.“It’s a branding thing,” Mr. Trump explained at the time. “I can get more rent per square foot, solely and simply because of the Trump name.”Maybe, maybe not. After a falling out with Mr. Trump in 2003, Conseco stripped the lettering off the marble exterior, much to the relief of the tenants, and sold the tower to Mr. Macklowe for $1.4 billion.'"
"'08-02-14,'0','He went on to call for a decade-long investment in a $150 billion plan to create five million so-called “green-collar” jobs to develop energy sources that are friendly to the environment. He also called for a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank, a $60 billion program, which he said would create two million jobs for rebuilding highways, bridges and airports.“I’ve paid for every element of this economic agenda,” said Mr. Obama, who said the money would come from costs associated with the Iraq war and from eliminating tax breaks for corporations.The nation’s economic woes stemmed from failures of government, he said.“We are not standing on the brink of recession due to forces beyond our control,” Mr. Obama said. “The fallout from the housing crisis that’s cost jobs and wiped out savings was not an inevitable part of the business cycle; it was a failure of leadership and imagination in Washington.”The Republican National Committee released what it called an “Obama Spend-O-Meter,” designed to calculate the cost of the programs he has proposed. “Barack Obama may package his economic plans with poetic rhetoric, but it’s fundamentally still the same old tax-and-spend liberal dogma,” said Alex Conant, a committee spokesman.Mrs. Clinton’s campaign noted that she had already supported similar measures. In McAllen, Tex., Mrs. Clinton faulted Mr. Obama’s economic agenda, saying that it “fails to provide universal health care, fails to address the housing crisis and fails to immediately start creating good-paying jobs.”Mr. Obama, who has won 21 states in the Democratic presidential nominating fight, is working to add Wisconsin to his string of victories by tapping into an antiwar sentiment before that state’s primary on Tuesday. As he pointed out his opposition to the war, he linked his criticism of Mrs. Clinton with Mr. McCain as he spoke of Washington’s failures.“It’s a Washington where politicians like John McCain and Hillary Clinton voted for a war in Iraq that should’ve never been authorized and never been waged,” Mr. Obama said. “A war that is costing us thousands of precious lives and billions of dollars a week.”That seemed to be a debate that Mr. McCain was eager to participate in. After receiving the endorsements of the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives — another sign that the party is beginning to coalesce around Mr. McCain, despite the past differences many Republicans have had with him — he brought up the war, too, and criticized the Democrats for their views.“They said that we would never succeed militarily; then we began to succeed militarily,” Mr. McCain said. “Granted, we still have a long way to go in Iraq. And then they said they can’t succeed politically.”In aiming criticism at Mr. Obama, Mr. McCain seemed to ignore his last Republican rival, Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, who continues to give the McCain campaign headaches by doing well in nominating contests even though, as McCain’s campaign noted Wednesday, there are not enough delegates left for Mr. Huckabee to win the nomination. (It calculated that he would need to win 123 percent of the remaining delegates.)“Of course, I would like for him to withdraw today,” Mr. McCain told reporters, referring to Mr. Huckabee. “It would be much easier.“But I respect, and I have repeatedly said I respect, his right to continue in this race for just as long as he wants to.”'"
"'08-02-14,'0','The Coca-Cola Company, the world’s largest maker of soft drinks, reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by higher sales, acquisitions and foreign exchange rates.But some investors were disappointed that overall international volume rose only 7 percent in the fourth quarter, down from 8 percent in the third quarter and 9 percent in the first two quarters, and Coke shares fell.“The Street may look at that as a slowing down, but I look at it as still very good growth, being led by the emerging markets,” said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management, which owns Coke shares in separately managed accounts, but not in its mutual fund.Coca-Cola said fourth-quarter net income jumped 79 percent, to $1.21 billion, or 52 cents a share, from $678 million, or 29 cents a share, a year ago, when the company took a big charge.Excluding charges in the latest quarter, Coke earned 58 cents a share, topping analysts’ average estimate of 55 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.'"

"'08-02-14,'0','CHICAGO (AP) — Employees at the Tribune Company were notified Wednesday that hundreds of jobs would be cut at The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and other publications — the first cutbacks since the investor Samuel Zell took the company private last year.In separate memos, the Tribune publisher Scott C. Smith said 100 jobs would be cut, and his counterpart at The Times, David D. Hiller, said 100 to 150 jobs would be eliminated.Both newspapers reported a total of 400 to 500 cuts companywide, focusing on corporate staff and the company’s newspapers, including Newsday in New York, The Orlando Sentinel, The Baltimore Sun and The Hartford Courant.A spokesman for the Tribune Company, Gary Weitman, declined to comment on that figure.Job cuts in Chicago are expected to come from The Tribune, as well as Hoy in Chicago, RedEye, Chicago Magazine and online products like ChicagoTribune.com, according to a Chicago Tribune media group spokesman, Michael Dizon. The group has about 3,000 employees.He said it was unclear just how many cuts would come from simply not filling current openings, layoffs or from voluntary or involuntary severance packages. In Los Angeles, Mr. Hiller said the cuts would be made in much the same way: attrition, voluntary buyouts and layoffs.Both publishers’ memos cited economic problems at the papers, with Mr. Smith, for example, telling employees that total revenue from the Chicago media group was down 5 percent in January and that “ad revenue was down double digits, a continuation of the trend late last year.”'"
"'08-02-14,'0','José Luis Soberanes, the president of the commission, did not immediately respond to the report. His spokesman, Lazaro Serrania, said a written response would be issued.The lack of response to the commission has been stunning at times. For instance, the commission did an exhaustive investigation into a state crackdown on anti-globalization protesters in Guadalajara in May 2004.The commission’s investigators determined the Jalisco State police had arbitrarily detained 70 people and illegally held them incommunicado. They also found that at least 55 of the detainees were subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment, including 19 who were tortured into signing self-incriminating statements.The governor of Jalisco at the time, Francisco Ramírez Acuña, simply rejected the report, saying he had “no obligation whatsoever to respond.” The commission said it regretted the governor’s position but took no other action. Two years later, President Felipe Calderón named Mr. Ramírez Acuña the Interior Minister. (He resigned in January after failing to push major changes through Congress.)Other cases have attracted less attention. In 2004, for instance, the commission determined that state police in Chihuahua had used electric shocks to force one Daniel Torres to confess to murder, the report said. State prosecutors never took action against the police and the commission later dropped the case. The commission’s investigators made similar charges against the municipal police in Chihuahua and Tijuana that year but they never resulted in an investigation either.Between 2000 and 2006, government authorities rejected one in five the 354 recommendations by the commission to prosecute someone for human abuses. Of the rest, the prosecutions failed to result in a conviction more often than not.In one high profile case, for instance, two peasant leaders in Guerrero, Rodolfo Montiel and Teodoro Cabrera, charged that soldiers had detained and tortured them for two days in 1999, and the commission later recommended the miliary prosecutors press charges, the report said. The army refused to prosecute, saying there was no evidence of torture.Perhaps the biggest failure involved the disappearance of about 500 dissidents, leftists and suspected guerrillas during the 1960s and 1970s. The commission issued a report 2001 saying it had found evidence at least 275 people had vanished after being arrested and tortured by the police and the military.A special prosecutors office was created to investigate the charges. In five years, however, the prosecutor managed to get indictments in only nine cases and never obtained a single conviction, mostly because of stonewalling among military officers, the report said. The commission remained largely silent. The prosecutor´s office was closed last year.Another problem cited in the report is that most of the cases never become public. Nine-tenths of the complaints brought to the commission are settled through a confidential “conciliation agreement” between investigators and the government entity involved. The victims are never consulted about the agreement and the cases are sealed, so it is impossible to judge if justice was served, Mr. Vivanco said.“We don’t have access to this information,” he said. “And I’m not talking about the tip of the iceberg. It’s almost the whole iceberg.”'"
"'08-02-14,'0','FRANKFURT — The German government said on Wednesday that it would participate in a third bailout of IKB Deutsche Industriebank, the lender whose near-collapse in July heralded the arrival in Europe of the crisis stemming from the faltering subprime mortgage market in the United States.The German finance minister, Peer Steinbrück, said in Berlin that the federal government would contribute two-thirds of a rescue package totaling 1.5 billion euros ($2.2 billion). The question of where the remaining euros would come from was open, he said, but a government spokesman said that private banks were expected to contribute.Mr. Steinbrück spoke after a lengthy meeting of the board of KfW, the state-owned bank that is the largest shareholder in IKB.The rescue package aims to resolve the problems at IKB, based in Düsseldorf, which was once a conservative corporate bank but became a global symbol of risky excess.Like many banks, IKB speculated in securities linked to American mortgages. But the market value of those investments has fallen significantly, forcing KfW, which owns 38 percent of the bank, and a consortium of private banks, to recapitalize the lender.'"
"'08-02-14,'0','FOR those who run with their dogs, trying to stay fleet of foot with a dog on a leash can be an exercise in futility. While the two-legged jogger aims for an even pace, the four-legged set sniffs, pulls, doubles back and dashes forward, yanking the shoulder socket. Regular leashes can also cause gait problems for serious runners, said Kelly Liljeblad, a dog owner and marathoner from Boulder, Colo. “If you run with the leash in the left hand, you’ll naturally bend to the left,” she explained.In the last few years, some entrepreneurs and pet-gear companies have introduced hands-free systems, which loop a belt, attached to leash, around the runner’s waist. Recent innovations include swiveling mechanisms for tangle-free runs, quick-release buckles, fixtures for multiple dogs, reflective trim and pouches for personal items.While recovering from a 2:47:13 finish (the women’s winning time) at the Miami Marathon last month, Ms. Liljeblad tested five sets of hands-free leashes on 20- to 30-minute runs around the Boulder Reservoir. Her co-testers were her yellow Labradors, Aggie and Pre.LARZ PET GEAR Z-HANDS FREE LEASH $56 ($85 and up for multiple dogs), www.larzpetgear.com. At first, Ms. Liljeblad said, she found the modular attachments “overwhelming” but added that “it is nice to have options.” She rated this system her second favorite. She said, “This swivel mechanism was the best out of all the leashes” and “the padding is great on the belt if your dog pulls a little.” Because of the variety of attachments, “you can basically design your own belt.”THE BUDDY SYSTEM $26, ($20 for smaller dogs); Lunge Buster, $12.50, www.buddysys.com. A “lightweight, easy-to-use and nonbulky” design earned this “simple” leash best-in-show for Ms. Liljeblad. She liked how it slid around the belt as she ran with Aggie. Also “nice” was the “bungee like” Lunge Buster (the Buddy System has a regular leash). “It was a perfect stiffness and length because it didn’t jerk me around,” Ms. Liljeblad said.CARDIO CANINE $55, www.cardiocanine.com. Ms. Liljeblad appreciated the water-bottle holder and pocket on the back of this system, modeled after a rock-climbing belt. “This would be great for a long run or even a hike,” said Ms. Liljeblad, who also used the leash’s shortened loop to help steer Aggie. But the “metal latches were bulky and heavy” and she missed the bungee leash and swivel action of some other systems. Pre and Aggie, top, fight over the Cardio Canine.RUNNING DAWG $21.95, www.runningdawg.com. “This is a nice, simple leash,” said Ms. Liljeblad, who thought the nylon belt pack was very useful. But the bungee-type leash was “a little too soft and flexible” for Ms. Liljeblad and Pre, who “kept forgetting he was on the leash.” She also wished it had a swivel system, and she had concerns about chafing. “The belt strap wasn’t that comfortable,” Ms. Liljeblad said. “But I like the simplicity.”'"
"'08-02-14,'0','How are you supposed to get a Web site? Who will design it, and who will host it? Who do you pay to place search engine ads for you, and how will you know if they’re working? How do you send out e-mail newsletters without being blocked as a spammer? And how will you know if that effort is paying off?And above all: how much is all this going to cost you?Office Live Small Business (O.L.S.B.) is a centralized Web site where you can set up all of those small-businessy things — a Web site, an online ad campaign, e-mail promotions, in-company communications — all by yourself, even if you’re not very technical. For the first time, these big-league tools are within your reach, partly because you don’t have to hire somebody to set them up and partly because many of them are free.The changes from the original 2006 version are apparent immediately. Internet Explorer used to be the required Web browser to set up your online presence, but now Firefox is O.K., too. And that means you can take advantage of Office Live even if you use (gasp) a Macintosh. That’s the New Microsoft, baby.A credit card is no longer required to get started, either. You can start playing with the service by supplying nothing more than a name, e-mail address and ZIP code.There are no longer three different tiers of Office Live service, with different fees and different features; that’s the Old Microsoft way (see also: Windows Vista). Instead, there’s just one free service that includes a wide assortment of useful tools, plus a handful of á la carte extras.The freebies begin with a Web site for your business, complete with 500 megabytes of storage. Simple tools let you design clean-looking pages, with your choice of color and design themes, logo and photos, links, and so on, even if you have absolutely no experience doing this sort of thing. (You can see the results at, for example, whineranddiner.net, murphyoutdoors.com and ameliascakes.com — real sites created by actual Office Live users.)Microsoft hosts your site free, and also offers free analysis tools. With one click, you can see a graph of your site’s traffic over time; where the visitors are coming from (for example, search engines or links from other sites); and even which Web browsers they’re using.A number of useful Office Live features that used to cost you money are now free. For example, only paid subscribers enjoyed the ability to synchronize their Office Live address books and calendars with Outlook, so they could work on them when not connected to the Internet. That’s now free to everyone.Similarly, if you wanted to design your own Web pages (or hire someone to do it) instead of using Microsoft’s canned page designs, you used to have to pay; now that’s free, too. As a bonus, you can now remove the small Office Live logo from your site — a welcome change.The old fee-based tiers also included a long list of features for the technically inclined: list managers that help you track employees, resources, reservations, and so on; project and time trackers; a document-sharing module; and collaboration tools for internal company discussion. Those are all free now.Unfortunately, Microsoft giveth and Microsoft taketh away.The most famous feature of the original Office Live was the free domain-name registration. That is, your free Web site could have any dot-com name you liked — BobsFleabag.com, for example — and you also got 25 e-mail addresses to match (sales@bobsfleabag.com, info@bobsfleabag.com and so on).Those unheard-of perks are gone; after the first year, Microsoft now charges $15 a year for those custom domain names and e-mail addresses (at least for new members). If you decline, your free Web site will be stuck with a clunky name like bobsfleabag.accommodations.officelive.com.Nor is that the only way Microsoft intends to make money from this service.For example, there are small ads on the Office Live Web site (the one with the tools — not the site you create). Because these ads are aimed at you, the small-business owner, they’re not especially bothersome, for the same reason that people don’t mind, say, ads for cameras in a photography magazine. Meanwhile, Microsoft can charge advertisers more for these ads because they are, again, so targeted.Office Live offers an easy-to-use e-mail marketing system that includes newsletter design and address database. You can also track the results of your e-mail initiatives: how many people opened your mail, as well as how many clicked a link in it. Microsoft even does the e-mail sending for you, so your e-mail won’t get blocked by your own Internet provider as spam. That’s all free during the current testing phase, but Microsoft will charge a monthly fee after that.Ditto for the terrific build-your-own-online-store feature. You get a traditional online shopping cart, integration with eBay, and auto-calculations of shipping and even taxes (according to the buyer’s state). But you’ll pay $40 a month for this high-end luxury, plus a $30 monthly PayPal fee if you want to accept payment by credit card right on your Web site. (Otherwise, your customers will be shunted off to PayPal.com to complete the transaction.) PayPal charges about 3 percent of each sale either way.Finally, of course, you have to pay to place ads in the results of Web search sites; here again, Office Live tracks the results, making it crystal clear which of your ads are producing the best results.This, though, may be the goofiest part of Office Live. You can place ads only on Microsoft’s search sites and Ask.com, which together represent less than 8 percent of search engine popularity. If you’re going to advertise, you’d almost certainly prefer the exposure of the Big Two — Yahoo and Google — but they’re not available through Office Live.Now, plenty of companies sell similar services individually: Web hosting, for example, or online marketing. But Microsoft claims to have no competition for Office Live’s concept. Nobody else offers a complete one-stop self-contained unified Internet toolkit for small businesses — especially not at these prices.The result is exciting for two reasons. First, Office Live Small Business gives the nation’s 25 million small businesses a chance to use the same online tools as the big boys.Second, Office Live Small Business has all the hallmarks of a start-up: innovative, focused, fast-moving, game-changing, quick to respond to customer feedback and nimble in recovering from mistakes. When was the last time anyone described Microsoft that way?'"

"'08-02-15,'0','Last year, Mr. Obama sought an advisory ruling with the Federal Election Commission to see whether the campaign could opt out of public financing in the primary and accept it in the general election. It was merely an inquiry, he said, not a pledge to accept the financing.If he wins the Democratic nominating fight with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Obama said, “my folks will sit down and see if we can arrive at a common set of ground rules.”Candidates who accept public funding are eligible for about $85 million paid for by a $3 checkoff on tax return forms, according to The Associated Press.Before arriving for a campaign rally in Oshkosh on Friday afternoon, Mr. Obama spoke to reporters in a wide-ranging 30-minute news conference in Milwaukee. He accused Mrs. Clinton of attacking him for suggesting he attempted to weaken legislation to regulate the nuclear industry.“I understand that Senator Clinton, periodically when she’s feeling down, launches attacks as a way of trying to boost her appeal,” Mr. Obama said. “But I think this kind of gamesmanship is not what the American people are looking for.”Both parties continued trying to build momentum from declarations of support. On the Republican side, Mr. McCain didn’t use the word “endorsement” or confirm that it was on its way, but he was visibly pleased when he said he would travel to Houston Monday morning to meet with former President George Bush.When he was asked if this was a sign that the Republican Party is rallying around his candidacy, Mr. McCain said: “I hope so, because former President Bush is one of the more respected — most respected — people in our party. He is certainly, maybe the finest gentleman in our party in the view of one and all. He’s a great man, a great American hero going all the way back to World War II, so I’d be honored to be in his company at any time.” (And, in addition to a broad grin, he allowed himself a wink.)And showing the enduring nature of his newly minted nickname of “Mac,” which gained popularity with shouts of “Mac is back!” in New Hampshire, a sign at his town hall meeting in this dairy state said “Wisconsin Loves the Mac and Cheese.”On the Democratic side, the Service Employees International Union gave Mr. Obama its highly prized endorsement on Friday afternoon.The S.E.I.U.’s endorsement is especially coveted because the union has 1.9 million members and has a rank and file that is far more politically active than most other unions. Moreover, its political action committee is expected to collect more than $30 million this campaign, making it one of the biggest PACs in the nation.In a telephone news conference announcing the endorsement, Andy Stern, the union’s president, said: “This is about more than one election. It’s about building for the next generation of America. Barack Obama is creating the broadest and deepest coalition of voters we’ve ever seen.”The union’s executive board cast ballots by e-mail and fax on Thursday night, and union officials were unable to finish the tallying until Friday.With John Lewis, the Democratic Congressman from Georgia and former civil rights leader, indicating on Thursday that he might switch his support to Mr. Obama from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, the S.E.I.U.’s endorsement is expected to further build momentum for Mr. Obama. Mr. Stern, like Mr. Lewis, said it would not be a good idea for superdelegates to ultimately choose the nominee in what could be a highly divided Democratic convention in August.“We think the voters should make the decision, not elected officials and superdelegates,” Mr. Stern said in an interview. “We are very much hoping that by the time we get through the primaries, we will have a nominee without having to count on the superdelegates to make a decision. It would be a bad proposition for America and certainly for the Democratic Party.”Last October, the service employees’ executive board was too divided between Mr. Obama, Mrs. Clinton and John Edwards to agree on an endorsement. But the board did give the union’s state chapters the go-ahead to make endorsements on their own. Many S.E.I.U. members and state chapters backed Mr. Edwards, and his withdrawal from the race helped pave the way for the endorsement of Mr. Obama.The service employees’ chapters in Nevada and California endorsed Mr. Obama shortly before contests in those states. Nonetheless, Mrs. Clinton won both those states, with the union’s leaders saying that if they had made that endorsement several weeks, rather than several days, before those contents, that might have given them time to mount a campaign that made a big difference.The union’s New York chapter was the only S.E.I.U. chapter to endorse Mrs. Clinton, helping her rack up a big victory in the state’s primary on February 5. Union officials said that New York S.E.I.U. leaders abstained in Thursday’s endorsement vote.On Thursday, another large union, the United Food and Commercial Workers, with 1.1 million members in the United States, also endorsed Mr. Obama. As a result of these two endorsements, as well as that of Unite Here, which represents hotel, restaurant, apparel and laundry workers, Mr. Obama has the backing of three unions that have large Hispanic memberships and especially strong ties to the nation’s immigrant community.'"
"'08-02-15,'0','Air Pegasus has been operating the heliport on a monthly permit from the trust since its lease expired. Mr. Trenk said that permit allowed him to continue operating as he has for decades. But the park advocates who sued said that Mr. Trenk’s operation was not grandfathered under the act that created the park.Mr. Trenk said that he was willing to shoulder the cost of moving onto a pair of barges connected by ramps to the heliport’s current location. Mr. Trenk estimated the reconfiguration would cost about $2 million.He said he would make the move to appease the heliport’s critics and settle the litigation, without conceding their points.“We say it’s not unsafe, but if it were, it’s certainly going to be more safe moving it away from the park,” Mr. Trenk said. He also said that he believed that the noise from whirring rotors was “not a factor” because the heliport is adjacent to traffic-choked 12th Avenue.Sightseeing services would use the floating heliport, but it probably could not accommodate as many flights as the existing one does, Mr. Trenk said. “That’s something that we would be willing to negotiate with the city,” he said.Mr. Trenk said that he hoped to have a chance soon to present his proposal to the directors of the Hudson River Park Trust, the city-state overseer of the park. Chris Martin, a spokesman for the trust, said that he had heard about the idea but that it was not scheduled to be considered by the trust’s board.But Daniel L. Alterman, a lawyer representing the Friends of Hudson River Park, sounded unmoved. He said that he had not seen the full proposal but remained opposed to any continuation of sightseeing operations so close to the park.“I’m looking forward to having my day in court and to get rid of what to me is an obvious violation of the act,” Mr. Alterman said.Albert K. Butzel, who was president of the Friends of Hudson River Park when the suit was filed, said that Mr. Trenk’s proposal signaled the weakness of his legal options. Mr. Butzel said that he was open to suggestions about moving the heliport onto the river, preferably to the end of a pier. But he added that any compromise that allowed sightseeing flights to continue was unacceptable.'"

(Later, Mr. Limbaugh dangled the possibility of endorsing Senator .)In an interview after his show, seated behind the black granite desk from which he had done the broadcast, Mr. Limbaugh held out little hope that Mr. McCain could sway him to his side.“It’s entirely possible I will go the distance without saying I support a candidate,” he said, still from his three-hour performance, his blue-and-white striped dress shirt untucked and draped over dark dress slacks.The effect of Mr. Limbaugh’s resistance could be substantial, serving, at the least, to reinforce doubts among other conservatives about Mr. McCain, who would seem to need the party’s conservative base to turn out in force in November.Asked what Mr. McCain might do to change his mind, Mr. Limbaugh said: “I don’t think there’s anything he could do. If he did do it, he would be accused of selling out.” Then, in a familiar baritone as resonant as it is on the air, he added, “If I were to endorse McCain based on the current circumstances, I’d be looked at as a party hack.”To the extent Mr. Limbaugh offered Mr. McCain any consolation, it was this: “What I can tell you I’m sure of is, I’m not going to be endorsing Obama or Hillary — unless it’s a joke to make a point.”In that vein, the daily spankings Mr. Limbaugh has been administering over the air to Mr. McCain are about more than the host’s practiced outrage over the senator’s olive branch to liberals and moderates. Mr. Limbaugh has also seized on the ascension of Mr. McCain to remind the world that his nationally syndicated program still matters and that he has not lost his long-demonstrated penchant for making mischief.“Folks, can we agree, just between us,” he told his listeners, sotto voce, on Wednesday, “has it not been brilliant how strategically I have inserted myself in this campaign?”While other conservative commentators like and have expressed similar reservations about Mr. McCain, neither can claim the reach of Mr. Limbaugh. El Rushbo, as he often calls himself, is heard on more than 600 stations and, according to the industry arbiter Talkers Magazine, has the nation’s largest talk-show audience. It is also noteworthy that this audience remains nearly as big as in 1994, when he helped clear a rhetorical path for ’s Republican takeover of the House, in an era predating the competition Mr. Limbaugh now faces from the Internet, bloggers and the Fox News Channel.Every day since Mr. McCain emerged as the likely nominee in the aftermath of nearly two dozen nominating contests on Feb. 5, Mr. Limbaugh’s switchboard has been lighting up with calls from conservative Republican listeners who say they plan to stay home on Election Day in November.“What he has got to be concerned with,” Mr. Limbaugh said of Mr. McCain, “is all these Republican voters who say right now they’re so fed up they’re not going to vote at all. That’s deeper than they realize.”In a sign that broadcasts like Mr. Limbaugh’s could play a role in the November outcome, Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International, the firms that conduct exit polls on behalf of the television networks and The Associated Press, asked voters in this week’s primaries in and whether they were frequent listeners of conservative talk radio. About one in three said they were.And yet the results in those states suggest that at least some of those listeners do not share Mr. Limbaugh’s concerns about Mr. McCain: though former Gov. of was the most popular candidate among frequent listeners of conservative talk radio in Virginia, Mr. McCain won a plurality of them in Maryland.Reached Thursday, the McCain campaign’s communications director, Jill Hazelbaker, said she had no comment on Mr. Limbaugh’s criticisms. But the senator’s supporters are concerned enough about where Mr. Limbaugh is leaning that former Senator of telephoned the commentator privately late last month from the international economic conference in Davos, , to preach Mr. McCain’s virtues, Mr. Limbaugh said.What people in the mainstream media — which Mr. Limbaugh refers to as the “drive-by media”— do not realize, he said, is that he is less concerned with being viewed as a national precinct captain who can deliver blocs of votes, or someone with the power perhaps to scuttle a presidential campaign, than with being seen as a broadcaster who can hold a huge audience.And purely as a broadcaster, he said, it will not make much difference whether Mr. McCain, Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton wins.“Regardless of who’s elected, there are always going to be liberals who are trying to impose liberalism on the country,” he said. “That means I’m going to be opposing it. It doesn’t matter if they’re in the White House or Congress. They’re always there.”Asked if having Mrs. Clinton return to the White House would not provide him maximum fodder, given how much of it he found in the impeachment of her husband, Mr. Limbaugh said no.By the same token, if Mr. McCain lost, could Mr. Limbaugh not fill any number of hours on the radio by telling his Republican brethren, “I told you so”?“Honestly, I don’t look at it that way,” he said. “If I were to look at it that way, then I’d be admitting that the entertainment quality of the program or the content in general is dependent on others. And it’s up to me. People listen to this program for me.”If he has his way, they will not have to give up their habit any time soon. Mr. Limbaugh, who owns more than 50 percent of his show, signed his current contract with his syndicator, , in 2002. That contract, believed to be valued at nearly $300 million, is due to expire in May 2009.“I have no intention of stopping,” the 57-year-old Mr. Limbaugh said. “I am having as much fun and deriving as much enjoyment out of this today as I ever have.”'"
"'08-02-15,'0','Dana Perino, the White House spokeswoman, said that the White House had tried to compromise with House Democrats to help lawmakers obtain information from Mr. Bolten and Ms. Miers short of public testimony. “Many of the things that they asked for, we were willing to give,” Ms. Perino said. “But instead, they’re going to waste time on this partisan, futile act.”A Congressional subpoena would normally be enforced by the Justice Department. But the White House and Mr. Gonzales’s successor, Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey, have said they would not pursue contempt charges against current and former White House officials who, they believe, are shielded from testimony by executive privilege.That appeared to leave two options for the House — seek the help of the federal judiciary to try to enforce the contempt citations or, less likely, hold its own trial on Capitol Hill for Mr. Bolten and Ms. Miers, similar to an impeachment trial. The House measure passed Thursday gave explicit authority to House lawyers to “initiate or intervene in judicial proceedings” in federal court to enforce the subpoenas.In a statement responding to the House vote, the Justice Department suggested that Mr. Mukasey had not made a final decision to rebuff the House request but noted that “he did not expect that he would act in contravention of longstanding department precedent” against enforcing subpoenas against executive branch officials.The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat, said Thursday on the House floor that he had no choice but to pursue the contempt citations.“The resolutions we are considering today are not steps that I as chairman take easily or lightly, but they are necessary to protect our constitutional prerogatives as a co-equal branch of government,” Mr. Conyers said.House Republican leaders described the contempt vote as a political ploy that drew time away from what they described as a more important debate over extending a federal law to allow eavesdropping on domestic telephone calls and e-mail in pursuit of terrorists.“We have space on the calendar today for a politically charged fishing expedition but not space for a bill that would protect the American people from terrorists who want to kill us,” said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican House leader.Mr. Boehner then instructed other Republicans to exit the chamber in protest. “Let’s just get up and leave,” Mr. Boehner said before walking out with scores of his party’s members.The Senate has not scheduled a vote on the floor on the contempt citation that was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in December against Mr. Bolten and Mr. Rove, also over demands for information about the firing of the United States attorneys.'"
"'08-02-15,'0','BRUSSELS — The European Union said Thursday that it would seek to extend copyright protection for singers and musicians to 95 years — rather than the current 50 — in a move intended to let performers receive royalty payments later in life.The proposals, made by Charlie McCreevy, the commissioner for the internal market, would extend to performers the entitlements to royalty payments already received by their counterparts in the United States, and by composers in Europe, most of whom have 70 years of copyright protection.Mr. McCreevy said that 50 years of copyright protection did not give artists a guaranteed lifetime income.“If nothing is done, thousands of European performers who recorded in the late 1950s and 1960s will lose all of their airplay royalties over the next 10 years,” Mr. McCreevy said.Royalties often make up the “sole pension” for artists, he said, and the loss of them could come during “the most vulnerable period of their lives.”The proposal, which needs approval from governments in the European Union as well as the European Parliament, is intended to benefit not just big-name artists but session musicians and lesser-known performers as well.'"
"'08-02-15,'0','The federal government pledged Thursday to intensify its efforts to move Gulf Coast hurricane victims out of trailers and into apartments or hotels after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finally confirmed that many trailers were contaminated with high levels of formaldehyde.The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which issued about 144,000 trailers to victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, has been widely criticized for its slow response to extensive evidence that many trailers contain unsafe levels of formaldehyde, an industrial chemical classified as a probable carcinogen.About 38,000 families are still living in the trailers and mobile homes, federal officials said Thursday at a news briefing, including more than 7,000 in trailer parks that FEMA had already vowed to close by May, before hurricane season begins again along the Gulf. Most of the other trailers are parked next to flooded houses that families are trying to repair.FEMA will now hasten to move families living in trailers into apartments or, if necessary, into hotels, said R. David Paulison, the administrator of the agency.But many details of the new effort remain unclear. For example, the agency has not yet decided whether to force out people who have the trailers parked on their own property. Nor does the agency have a program to help families that have incurred medical bills because of formaldehyde exposure, Mr. Paulison said, adding that the agency would look into that.'"
"'08-02-15,'0','An $8 million Jean-Michel Basquiat painting whose last known owner was a bankrupt Brazilian banker has been found in a Manhattan warehouse, The Associated Press reported. Federal prosecutors filed papers seeking to seize the 1982 work, “Hannibal,” which was valued at $100 on a customs declaration form when it arrived by courier from London at Kennedy Airport after apparently being smuggled out of Brazil. Prosecutors are seeking to help Brazilian authorities claim the painting, whose last known owner was Edemar Cid Ferreira, former owner of Banco Santos and one of Brazil’s foremost art collectors. The bank went bankrupt in 2005, leaving debts of more than $1 billion. Mr. Ferreira was convicted of money laundering and bank fraud, and sentenced to 21 years in prison; a Brazilian court ordered seizure of $20 million to $30 million worth of his art, saying it was bought with proceeds of illegal schemes, but “Hannibal” was missing.'"

"'08-02-15,'0','Don’t think of “The Jazz Age” as yet another go-round with sloshy Scott, zany Zelda and earthy Ernie, three of the last century’s most overexposed literary figures. Think of it as a chance to see three skilled actors demonstrate that even the familiar can be made very watchable.The play, a new work by Allan Knee, charts the relationships between F. Scott Fitzgerald; Zelda, his sexy, troubled wife; and Ernest Hemingway, whom Scott Fitzgerald helped nudge toward greatness.It’s dangerous territory for a playwright. The Fitzgeralds, especially, have been done to death in print and on film, their personal stories looming as irresistible metaphors. (He flamed out early and died young in 1940; she virtually defined the flapper phenomenon but ended up in a sanitarium, dying in a fire in 1948.)Zelda has essentially become an archetype, but Amy Rutberg here makes her new again, drenching the character in desirability early, getting more wild-eyed as the 1920s give way to the Depression. Dana Watkins’s Scott is less absorbing, but his portrayal has a touch of the effeminate that, once Hemingway shows up, makes for some intriguing dynamics.Mr. Knee may intend the focus of the play to be Fitzgerald’s deterioration, as writer’s block and alcohol squash his promise. But P J Sosko’s terrific turn as Hemingway thwarts that; he’s simply too magnetic to be subordinate. If that costs the play a clear focus, well, so what; we know these figures pretty well anyway.The only real issue in this smooth production, directed by Christopher McElroen and enhanced by a live three-piece band, is Mr. Knee’s choice of how to use his two hours. It seems as if the two literary lions spend an awful lot of time talking like frat boys, while the more substantive aspects of their relationship — presumably there were some — are underexplored.'"
"'08-02-15,'0','He reiterated his intention to become prime minister and to lead the government of his presumptive successor, whom he had selected himself, Dmitri A. Medvedev. He also implied that Mr. Medvedev would follow the course that he had set.“The president is the guarantor of the Constitution,” Mr. Putin said. “He sets the main directions for internal and external policies. But the highest executive power in the country is the Russian government, led by the premier.”He later added that he planned to be the prime minister throughout Mr. Medvedev’s administration, and perhaps beyond. “I formulated tasks for the development of Russia from 2010 until 2020,” he said. “The fate is taking shape in a way that I have a possibility to participate directly in achievement of these goals.”The conference also underscored the degree to which Mr. Putin continued to eclipse Mr. Medvedev.Although Russia is in the middle of the official one-month presidential campaign, there is little sign of competing ideas or public involvement in choosing the next president. And Mr. Putin is not fading from view.Last week, he addressed Russia’s lawmakers with his plans for the country through 2020. On Thursday he threatened to escalate a dispute with Europe and the United States over the future of Kosovo, which is expected to declare its independence next week, with support from the West.Russia has backed its traditional ally, Serbia, and opposed Kosovo’s independence. It has threatened to protest the move at the United Nations Security Council and perhaps to recognize breakaway regions it supports in Moldova and Georgia.“We are told all the time, ‘Kosovo is a special case,’ ” Mr. Putin said. “It is all lies. There is no special case, and everybody understands it perfectly well.”The conference, a question-and-answer format, has been an annual event in which Mr. Putin has often displayed his comfort with power and a command of the fine details of governing.The audience was a mixture of Russian reporters, many openly praising the Russian president, and foreign journalists, several of them pressing him on policies that have alarmed Western governments and undermined his reputation abroad.Mr. Putin basked in the praise and seemed to revel in the criticism, which he rebutted with a mix of long, unapologetic answers and occasional insults.When asked about the decision of the principal international election monitors not to send missions to observe the presidential elections, Mr. Putin was dismissive.The monitors, from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, have routinely found that elections in post-Soviet autocracies, including Russia, have been rigged. And they have said that Russia has unilaterally imposed conditions that make it impossible to assess the current campaign and election fully.Mr. Putin said that the organization needed to be overhauled, and suggested that the monitors intended to teach Russia how to become democratic.“Let them teach their wives to make shchi,” he said. Shchi is a popular Russian cabbage soup.Similarly, Mr. Putin swept aside a remark by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who said that as a former K.G.B. officer, Mr. Putin “has no soul.”“As a minimum, a state official must at least have a head,” he said.Mr. Putin also flashed his annoyance when asked about reports in Western newspapers that he had used his office to accumulate a vast personal fortune. Such “rumors,” he said, “they picked from a nose and smeared onto their papers.”The conference alternated between these occasionally scalding moments and others in which Mr. Putin, answering questions from admiring Russian journalists, was at ease and treated with public fealty.One young woman noted that the conference was held on Valentine’s Day, and asked whether Mr. Putin had received a gift.He said he had been busy doing his morning exercises and preparing for the conference, and had not yet received any presents. The reporter then grinned and said she would like to give him a Valentine, and he invited her to pass it down to him through the crowd.At another point, a French journalist asked Mr. Putin if he thought that the official results recorded in Chechnya during parliamentary elections in December were realistic. According to the Central Election Commission, the voter turnout in Chechnya was 99 percent, and 99 percent of the voters cast their ballots for United Russia, the party Mr. Putin leads.Chechnya sought to break from Russia in the early 1990s, and waged a long insurgency for which it has been intensely punished. Past elections there have been openly rigged, and the latest results were viewed in the West and among Mr. Putin’s domestic critics as unashamedly fake.Mr. Putin, looking confident, asked a state journalist from Chechnya to answer the question. “These are absolutely realistic figures,” the journalist said. “Personally, all my acquaintances, including myself, voted for United Russia.”'"
"'08-02-15,'0','BEIRUT, Lebanon — Hezbollah’s leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, told 10,000 mourners on Thursday at the funeral of a senior commander killed in Syria that Hezbollah was ready to retaliate “anywhere” against Israel, which it blames for the death.No one has claimed responsibility for killing the commander, Imad Mugniyah, one of the most wanted and elusive terrorists in the world, and Israel has distanced itself from any involvement. On Thursday, Israel ordered its military and embassies to heighten security.In one of his most belligerent speeches in several months, shown on a television screen in the hall where the mourners had gathered around the coffin of Mr. Mugniyah, Sheik Nasrallah said Israel had taken the war with Hezbollah outside of Lebanon, and Hezbollah was now prepared to pursue it outside as well.“Today Hezbollah and the Islamic Resistance are ready to confront any possible Israeli aggression on Lebanon,” he said. “You killed Imad outside the battleground. Our battle was inside the Lebanese territory. You crossed the borders. Zionists, if you wanted open war, let it be an open war anywhere.”At the funeral, in southern Beirut, mourners packed the hall and waited outside in the rain.Inside, four Hezbollah guards in black stood beside the coffin, which was wrapped in their militant Shiite group’s yellow colors.'"
"'08-02-15,'0','Steven Mitnick, Mr. Spitzer’s top energy aide, arranged meetings between Ms. Sparks-Beddoe and employees, according to the report, which called his actions inappropriate.Mr. Mitnick “encouraged meeting participants to discuss topics that created ethical problems for all parties involved,” the report said. “The public confidence could be affected by the knowledge that these senior D.P.S. officials were discussing promotions contingent on the continued favor of an executive of a regulated utility.”Mr. Mitnick told investigators for the inspector general that he was simply being “too nosy, too overbearing.”One employee Ms. Sparks-Beddoe signaled she would fire was an ethics officer who had questioned whether she could act fairly as commissioner given her ties to Energy East. Another was a director who had played a key role in a rate dispute between the agency and Energy East.Ms. Hamann’s report found that Ms. Sparks-Beddoe’s actions violated no laws but were inappropriate. And since she was never confirmed, she is not subject to the ethics regulations that apply to state officials.Ms. Sparks-Beddoe did not return a phone call to her home on Thursday.The report was based on two investigations that involved Mr. Mitnick, who was the governor’s top aide for energy and telecommunications until he resigned in September.Last spring, Mr. Mitnick was accused by a Public Service Commission member, Cheryl Buley, an appointee of Gov. George E. Pataki’s, of threatening her with the loss of her job if she failed to go along with Mr. Mitnick’s approach to a Con Ed investigation.The report found that Mr. Mitnick had been overeager to clean house at the commission. But it also said that while he clearly thought Ms. Buley was unqualified, and had requested her resignation on numerous occasions, that was unrelated to the Con Ed investigation.“Although some of Mitnick’s actions were offensive to Buley, these same actions were clearly within his authority,” the report said.People interviewed for the report described Mr. Mitnick as “brash” and “heavy-handed” but said he had nonetheless conducted himself “professionally.” Ms. Buley’s colleagues told investigators they did not believe her claims against him.Diane Burman, Ms. Buley’s former assistant, testified that Ms. Buley liked to “stir the pot.”Ms. Buley said in a telephone interview that she was moving on.“The report has some inaccuracies,” she said Thursday afternoon.“It’s good to have it behind us,” she added. “We have important work to do.”Mr. Mitnick said he felt vindicated. “It’s good to look ahead. It’s like I’m Eli Manning,” he said. “They doubted me in a couple games, but I blew out the favorites.”Republicans swiftly condemned the report. The inspector general’s office has been criticized for not being aggressive enough in scrutinizing the Spitzer administration.A spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, called it “a whitewash,” while George H. Winner Jr., the chairman of the Senate investigations committee, did not rule out having the committee review the case.But the Spitzer administration said it was pleased to have the matter resolved.“The inspector general’s report makes clear that incoming administrations are permitted — and in fact expected — to bring new leadership to government agencies,” Errol Cockfield, a spokesman for Mr. Spitzer, said.He would not comment on Ms. Sparks-Beddoe’s case since it has been referred to the Public Integrity Commission.'"
"'08-02-15,'0','WASHINGTON — Senator John McCain’s presidential campaign said Thursday that it stood by a year-old pledge made with Senator Barack Obama that each would accept public financing for the general election if the nominee of the opposing party did the same. But Mr. Obama’s campaign refused to reaffirm its earlier commitment.The McCain campaign’s latest stand on the issue was first reported Thursday by The Financial Times. On Tuesday, one of Mr. McCain’s advisers told The New York Times that the campaign had decided to forgo public financing in the general election, an awkward admission for a senator who has made campaign finance reform a central part of his political persona.That adviser was speaking on the assumption that Mr. Obama, who has broken all records in political fund-raising and is currently drawing more than $1 million a day, would find a way to retreat from the pledge in order to outspend his opponent in the fall by far. Under public-financing rules, the nominees are restricted to spending about $85 million each for the two-month general election campaign, far less than what Mr. Obama might be able to raise on his own.On Thursday, in an effort by the McCain campaign to speak with one voice and put the onus for abandoning the system on Mr. Obama, several McCain advisers called on him to make good on his pledge. Mr. Obama was the candidate who proposed the pledge in the first place, in February 2007, a time when he was not raising the prodigious sums he is now.Mr. McCain, co-author of the McCain-Feingold act of 2002, which placed new restrictions on campaign financing, was the only other candidate to take Mr. Obama up on his pledge.'"

Andy Lees was named senior vice president for mobile communications operations. Mr. Lees, who had overseen the server business, succeeds Pieter Knook, who, the company said, “made the decision to leave Microsoft to pursue other opportunities.”Microsoft has been paying more attention to its cellphone business following the introduction of Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android software operating system. In only a few months of the iPhone’s release, according to Canalys, a market research firm, Apple gained 28 percent of the smartphone market in the United States, a greater share of the market than the cellphones using Microsoft’s Windows Mobile software. Research In Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, leads the category that has been dominated by phones made for business users.Microsoft is showing more interest in the consumer market.

"'08-02-15,'0','Mr. Romney spent much of the nomination fight attacking Mr. McCain’s efforts to pass an immigration bill that many Republicans loathed as amnesty for illegal immigrants and, more recently, questioning Mr. McCain’s economic acumen. (His campaign labeled Mr. McCain’s shifts on positions, including his support for extending the Bush tax cuts he once opposed, as “Straight Talk Detours.”)Mr. McCain, for his part, painted Mr. Romney as an unprincipled flip-flopper who shifted key positions. His campaign even ran a television advertisement noting that Mr. Romney had distanced himself from former President Ronald Reagan while running for office in Massachusetts (“Mitt Romney was against Ronald Reagan before he was for him”).But the two men were all about mutual admiration and respect on Thursday.“As all of you saw over the past year, things can get pretty rough in a political campaign,” Mr. Romney said. “And in the thick of the fight, it is easy to lose sight of your opponent’s finer qualities. But the truth of the matter is that in the case of Senator McCain, I could never quite do that. Even when the contest was close, and our disagreements were debated, the caliber of the man was apparent.”“This is a man,” Mr. Romney added, “capable of leading our country at a dangerous hour.”Mr. McCain praised Mr. Romney and thanked him for his endorsement. “More than that,” he said, “I thank him for the hard, intensive, fine, honorable campaign that he ran for the nomination of our party.”Of course, Mr. McCain knows firsthand from 2000 what it is like to support a rival who wins a hard-fought election; he eventually campaigned vigorously for George W. Bush after losing to him in a particularly brutal race. “Primaries are tough, and we know it was a hard campaign,” he said. “Now we move forward together.”Mr. McCain has been working to unite the party since he became its presumptive nominee. Already this week he won the endorsement of the House Republican leadership, a group he has sometimes clashed with in the past, and a stream of others.On the delegate front, Mr. McCain began the day with 808 and Mr. Romney with 139, according to a tally by The New York Times, which counts delegates conservatively. (The Associated Press tally put Mr. McCain’s figure at 843 and Mr. Romney’s at 280.) States vary on what to do with the delegates of candidates who drop out and endorse their rivals.But several Republicans, and Mr. Romney’s advisers, said the upshot was that Mr. Romney’s support should put Mr. McCain close to or over the 1,191 delegates he needs.“The practical effect of this is it basically gives John McCain the majority of the delegates,” said Ben Ginsberg, the Romney campaign’s chief counsel.Still, Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, pledged to remain in the race even though there were not enough remaining delegates to put him over the top.“Most people are, right now, saying it looks like McCain is the inevitable nominee,” Mr. Huckabee said on CNN. “But I’m not most people.”'"

The cloning will be conducted by stem cell scientists at Seoul National University, where the first cloned dog, an Afghan hound named Snuppy, was created in 2005, while the company, RNL Bio, looks after the business side. The company said in a statement that is was charging $150,000 to clone Booger, using some ear tissue that the owner had refrigerated. “It seems that she had a disability and her dog helped her cope with the problem, so she was eager to get a clone of Booger,” the company’s chief executive, Ra Jeong-chan, was quoted as telling The Korea Times. “There are many people who want to clone their pet dogs in Western countries, even at this high price.” He said he expected up to 500 orders within a few years, adding that then “the cost for cloning a dog may come down to less than $50,000.”'"

The apparel retailer said it earned $216.8 million, or $2.40 per share, for the quarter ended Feb. 2, compared with a profit of $198.2 million, or $2.14 per share, a year ago. Fourth-quarter sales rose 8 percent to $1.23 billion, from $1.14 billion. The year-ago quarter had an extra week. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expected profits of $2.36 per share excluding one-time items on revenue of $1.25 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year, considered to be a key indicator of a retailer’s strength, were down 1 percent for the quarter. . (AP)LOSS FOR MORTGAGE INSURER Radian Group, whose primary business is insuring mortgages against defaults, posted a massive loss for the fourth quarter as the nation’s housing crisis continued to hurt the company’s bottom line. “2007 was indeed an extremely challenging year,” said S.A. Ibrahim, Radian’s chief executive, during a conference call with analysts. “Market conditions have continued to deteriorate,” he said, adding “The housing downturn will continue to challenge us during 2008 and into 2009.” But he also said Radian is moving to shore up its business. It increased its mortgage insurance loss reserves to $1.3 billion, since the company is on the hook to pay lenders when homeowners default. Radian also posted positive cash flow in the quarter. (AP)FORECLOSURES RISE Countrywide Financial said home loan delinquencies and foreclosures rose in January as more borrowers struggled to make their mortgage payments. The nation’s largest mortgage lender and servicer said loan delinquencies as a percentage of unpaid principal balance increased to 7.47 percent last month from 7.2 percent in December and 4.32 percent in January 2007. Still, the lender’s average daily mortgage applications rose last month to $2.6 billion from December’s $1.5 billion. Interest rates have been falling this year, and that’s fueled a spike in mortgage applications industrywide, particularly as homeowners look to refinance existing loans.

The transaction has received approval from regulators in Maine and the Federal Communications Commission, FairPoint said in a statement. To save on taxes, Verizon plans to spin off the lines as a separate business instead of selling them directly.

"'08-02-16,'0','“Currently, Medicare is a price-setting system in which the government makes decisions about who is covered and how much is paid,” Mr. Leavitt said. “We have a better option, to provide beneficiaries with reliable information about the cost and quality of their care. When given that kind of information, we know that consumers will make decisions that drive costs down and the quality up.”The bill would require the secretary to provide price and cost information to Medicare beneficiaries to help them select treatment options and choose among doctors, hospitals and health plans.Under the proposal, the federal government would have to “release to the public physician-specific measurements of the quality or efficiency” of doctors.Doctors have been working with the government to develop such measures, but many doctors fear that the government will use the data simply to reward the lowest-cost providers.As for the prescription drug proposal, it would create an income-linked system of premiums similar to the one already in effect in Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and outpatient services. Prescription drug premiums would increase for any individual with income over $82,000 and any couple with income exceeding $164,000. Premiums would more than triple for many individuals with incomes over $205,000 and for many couples with incomes over $410,000.While premiums vary by plan, the monthly premium for standard drug coverage, as defined by law, is about $28 this year.Initially, fewer than 5 percent of people with Medicare drug coverage would have to pay the higher premiums. But this proportion would grow because the income thresholds would remain the same, with no allowance for inflation.The president’s package does not include proposals to cut payments to hospitals or other health care providers, which could have touched off a furor in this election year.Reaction to the proposed legislation was mixed.Robert D. Reischauer, a Medicare expert who is president of the Urban Institute, said: “The president’s proposal is pretty thin gruel, compared with what many had expected. It’s not likely to change the long-run trajectory of Medicare spending.”Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the House Republican whip, said: “Without substantial reforms, Medicare will not be able to meet the basic needs of tomorrow’s seniors. The legislation put forth by the president is the needed first step to help give this program a solid economic footing.”Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, said the president was offering “common sense solutions” to Medicare’s looming financial crisis. “Most important,” he said, “this plan does not include any benefit cuts that could limit seniors’ access to health care.”Representative Pete Stark of California, chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said it was hypocritical of Mr. Bush to try to increase some premiums while not proposing any cuts in “overpayments to private insurance companies” that manage care for nearly nine million beneficiaries.Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he was “glad the president is not pursuing the draconian cuts to Medicare originally in the White House’s budget” for 2009.The idea of linking premiums to a person’s income is, in some ways, “an attractive option,” Mr. Baucus said. But he added, “It’s a major change that should be considered only in a broader review of the benefit.”Under the 2003 Medicare law, the president was required to submit legislation to Congress because of a widening gap between total Medicare spending and revenues dedicated to the program, like payroll taxes.'"
"'08-02-16,'0','Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, on Friday renewed his call for the House to approve the Senate bill, and he accused Democrats of trying to enrich trial lawyers suing the telecommunications companies as a reward for donating to Democratic presidential candidates.“It leaves you with the impression that they are more interested in seeing companies in court than seeing terrorists in jail,” Mr. McConnell said.The decision by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to let the temporary surveillance law expire is the Democrats’ most forceful challenge to Mr. Bush on a major national security issue since they took control of Congress last year.And with Democrats emboldened by Mr. Bush’s low poll ratings, the fight over the surveillance program could be a preview of battles to come, particularly over spending on Iraq.At the same time, Mr. Bush is intent on using the surveillance issue and any improvements in Iraq to portray the Democrats as weak on national security issues.“The American citizens must understand — clearly understand — that there still is a threat on the homeland, there’s still an enemy, which would like to do us harm,” Mr. Bush said Friday in the Oval Office after meeting with Republican Congressional leaders. “By blocking this piece of legislation, our country is more in danger of an attack.”Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader, rejected that argument and said at a news conference that Mr. Bush was sending the wrong message to terrorists.“The president’s rhetoric is inaccurate,” Mr. Hoyer said. “It’s also divisive — an attempt to stampede the House of Representatives to rubber-stamp legislation by appealing to the fears of the American people.”Then, looking sternly into the television cameras, Mr. Hoyer declared: “I want to send another message to those who might harm us: We still have in place every capacity to intercept and find out your plans, and we will act swiftly and decisively against them, because there is no division in this country on our commitment to protect America.”'"

"'08-02-16,'0','“Without the profile of Ms. Santiago,” those traces were not useful, he told the jury.Dr. Kobilinsky acknowledged on cross-examination that there was not enough DNA evidence on those two items to match an individual profile even if one had been available.Later, the prosecutor, Ama Dwimoh, told reporters that a DNA profile of Ms. Santiago had not been prepared because there were not enough traces of DNA on any of the items to allow a match.Dr. Kobilinsky’s testimony, she said, did nothing to undermine the case against Mr. Rodriguez.“Nixzmary died a slow death,” she said. “And the people she called Mommy and Daddy failed to get her prompt medical attention.”In the courtroom, the prosecution sought to turn Dr. Kobilinsky’s testimony to its advantage, using his reference to the “passive transfer” of DNA to once again go through the catalog of evidence of Nixzmary’s dismal life and death.The chair she was tied to with a nylon rope was hauled onto a table in front of the largely female jury, and Dr. Kobilinsky was asked if there could have been “passive transfer” of DNA to the ropes that bound her ankles.There could have been, the witness said.“Would it be fair to say that if someone were thrown up against the wall, their blood would end up there?” a prosecutor asked, pointing to a photo of a blood-spattered wall.A pillow with blood stains was another example of “passive transfer,” Dr. Kobilinsky acknowledged. Same for the blood on duct tape that bound Nixzmary and the blood on the belt she was beaten with.Finally, there was the litter box that the girl was forced to use as a toilet, the prosecution’s last example of passive transfer of DNA.Mr. Schwartz said afterward that the defense was not likely to call character witnesses for Mr. Rodriguez but would keep raising questions about the investigation and the failure to focus on Ms. Santiago.Ms. Santiago has also been charged with murder in her daughter’s death and is to go on trial later.The prosecution maintains that the two acted in concert in the girl’s death.Earlier this month, after Ms. Santiago invoked her Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself, the judge ruled that she could not be compelled to testify at her husband’s trial.Nevertheless, although she has been absent from the courtroom physically, Nixzmary’s mother has been a constant presence, invoked often by the defense and Mr. Rodriguez’s main hope in deflecting blame.'"
"'08-02-16,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — A Bush administration official met secretly with Iranian banking officials and senior government aides last month during a multinational conference in Paris to discuss money laundering and the financing of terrorism.The talks took place despite the administration’s near-absolute ban on formal contacts with Iran and while Tehran is trying to head off new United Nations sanctions over its suspected nuclear program.The United States was represented at the meeting by Daniel Glaser, the Treasury Department’s deputy assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes, a senior United States official said. Representatives of several other nations also attended.Iran was represented by senior officials from its central bank, known as Bank Markazi, and its government, according to a Middle Eastern diplomat familiar with the session. Officials spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the discussions.The Treasury Department confirmed late Friday that the meeting took place on Jan. 24 between the Financial Action Task Force and an Iranian delegation to discuss “Iran’s noncompliance with international standards to combat money-laundering and terrorist financing,” said Andrew DeSouza, a Treasury Department spokesman.The United States and Iran have had no diplomatic relations since 1979.'"
"'08-02-16,'0','British Airways and Virgin Atlantic will together pay about $203 million to settle a lawsuit brought by passengers who said the airlines illegally fixed the price of fuel surcharges on long-haul trips.The agreement announced on Friday settles a two-year-old case in United States District Court for the Northern District of California contending that customers overpaid for fuel surcharges, which were meant to help airlines cope with rising fuel costs.Under the pact, American ticket purchasers will receive $59 million and British purchasers will get £73.5 million ($144.4 million) in refunds, according to lawyers representing the plaintiffs.The agreement, which still requires court approval, covers eight million passengers in the United States and Britain who bought tickets from either British Airways or Virgin between Aug. 11, 2004, and March 23, 2006. The airlines will pay one-third of the fuel surcharge the passengers paid for each ticket.Last year, British Airways agreed to pay roughly $247 million in a settlement with British authorities for discussing fuel surcharges with Virgin.Friday’s agreement resolves a civil lawsuit brought in the United States that contended that passengers were overcharged on the fuel surcharges and were told that the added fees were necessary to cover the rising cost of fuel, but in reality were used to increase the airlines’ profits.'"

"'08-02-16,'0','FIDELITY INVESTMENTS is welcoming new shareholders into its venerable Magellan fund after shutting them out for a decade. With the fund’s asset base shrinking, it is a sensible move for Fidelity, but should you accept the invitation?The portfolio had an excellent performance in 2007 — when many others did not — and its manager, Harry Lange, is very well thought of. Anyone interested in a large-company growth fund could do worse than Magellan, but analysts and financial advisers encourage prospective investors to consider some of its competitors, too.Magellan is just one fund among many now, but it used to stand above the rest. Peter Lynch, who ran it from 1977 to 1990, handily beat the market year after year with his aggressive-growth investing style.Then the fund became a victim of its own, and his, success. It grew into the largest mutual fund ever and investors kept pouring money in even after Mr. Lynch retired and his successors showed themselves not to be of his caliber. Fidelity closed Magellan to new investors in 1997 after deciding it had become unwieldy.Investors shut out of the fund did not miss much. Robert Stansky, the manager for most of the time that it was closed, “got away from Lynch’s aggressive, eclectic, growth-oriented style,” Dan Lefkovitz, an analyst at Morningstar, recalled. Magellan took on more of the characteristics of an index tracker and lost its performance edge.'"
"'08-02-16,'0','OSHKOSH, Wis. — Senators Barack Obama and John McCain tussled directly Friday over how they will pay for their campaigns, with Mr. McCain challenging Mr. Obama to abide by his earlier pledge to use public financing for his general election if Mr. McCain does so as well.The squabbling marked the first time the two have directly confronted each other on the issue, which revolves around Mr. Obama’s February 2007 pledge to accept public financing — and the spending limits that accompany it — if he went on to the general election and his Republican counterpart likewise accepted public financing.But since then, the Obama campaign, which has developed the most formidable fund-raising operation of all the campaigns this year, has yet to recommit to that pledge, providing the McCain campaign with an opening for attack.“It was very clear to me that Senator Obama had agreed to having public financing of the general election campaign if I did the same thing,” Mr. McCain said after a town-hall-style meeting here. “I made the commitment to the American people that if I was the nominee of my party, I would go the route of public financing. I expect Senator Obama to keep his word to the American people as well.”Asked if he would use public financing even if Mr. Obama did not, Mr. McCain said: “If Senator Obama goes back on his commitment to the American people, then obviously we have to rethink our position. Our whole agreement was we would take public financing if he made that commitment as well. And he signed a piece of paper, I’m told, that made that commitment.”Mr. Obama did not rule out the possibility of accepting public financing, but declared on Friday, “I’m not the nominee yet.”'"
"'08-02-16,'0','ROME — With voting less than two months away, a bitter debate over abortion has unexpectedly flared up, putting the issue at the center of the Italian electoral campaign.The controversy over Italy’s 30-year-old law legalizing abortion stirred up demonstrations this week in its defense, with Health Minister Livia Turco among the protesters.The demonstrations were touched off by an incident in a Naples hospital on Monday.Acting on an anonymous tip that an abortion had been performed later in a pregnancy than the law allows, police officers entered the hospital and interrogated a Neapolitan woman, identified in the news media only by her first name, Silvana, immediately after the abortion and reportedly while she was still under the effects of anesthesia. They seized the aborted fetus.Carmine Nappi, the chief of obstetrics at the hospital, likened the police intrusion to an anti-Mafia raid. “We’ve had countless complaints, we’re a hospital, but never a blitz like this,” he said by telephone on Thursday.On Thursday evening, protesters gathered in several Italian cities. In Rome, a few hundred women and some men, many holding signs that read, “Silvana, we’re all with you,” stopped traffic in front of the Health Ministry. Ms. Turco praised the turnout. “We’re defending a law that is close to us,” she said.'"
"'08-02-16,'0','But his exploits were legion. He set more than a hundred world records in the skies and on the water, according to his Web site, www.stevefossett.com. (Many of these records have since been broken.)In 2002, Mr. Fossett became the first person to circumnavigate the world solo in a hot-air balloon. In 2005, he became the first solo pilot to fly a plane around the world without stopping to refuel. In 2006, he set the nonstop distance record for an aircraft, flying solo from Florida to England — the long way — for a total of 25,766 miles. (The trip, which included two Atlantic crossings, took 76 hours, 42 minutes and 55 seconds.)Mr. Fossett was an equally accomplished glider pilot. In 2006, he and a co-pilot, Einar Enevoldson, became the first people to fly a glider into the stratosphere, setting an altitude record of 50,671 feet. It was one of 10 world records for the glider set by Mr. Fossett, his Web site said.At sea, Mr. Fossett, set 21 world records, among them the round-the-world speed record for vessels under sail. In 2004, aboard the Cheyenne, his 125-foot maxi-catamaran, Mr. Fossett and his crew circumnavigated the globe in 58 days, 9 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds, shaving nearly 6 days off the previous record.Mr. Fossett also chased records on land. On his flight over Nevada the day he disappeared, he was believed to have been scouting locations for an attempt to break the world land-speed record, 766.6 miles an hour in a turbojet-powered car.With Will Hasley, Mr. Fossett wrote an autobiography, “Chasing the Wind,” published by Virgin Books in 2006.In the weeks after Mr. Fossett disappeared, his friends and family expressed their belief that he would be found alive. After all, he had survived fire, flood and a great deal else.In August 1998, on Mr. Fossett’s fourth attempt to fly round the world in a balloon, he was sucked into a thunderstorm off Australia’s northeast coast. The capsule fell nearly 30,000 feet into the Coral Sea. But it was also on fire, set alight by the balloon’s propane burners. Mr. Fossett was still inside. Sharks were outside.Mr. Fossett managed to grab his life raft and dive out through the capsule’s submerged hatch. He was picked up by a boat after 10 hours at sea.Besides the dramatic dangers, there were persistent discomforts. The capsule of Spirit of Freedom, the balloon in which Mr. Fossett made many voyages, measured just 7 feet long by 5 feet wide by 5 feet high — too small to allow him to stand upright. It was also unpressurized, requiring him often to wear an oxygen mask. And if a fuel tank or burner malfunctioned, he had to climb outside, in temperatures well below zero, to fix it.There was also the risk of being shot down. It was a vivid concern on his fifth attempt at circumnavigation, in December 1998. On that trip, Mr. Fossett, flying with Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand, was barred — too late to alter course — from entering Chinese airspace. There was the real possibility that once the three men were over China, fighter jets would fire on them.At the last minute, diplomacy prevailed, and the men flew over China without incident. (Mr. Branson, the president of Virgin Atlantic and a former balloon racer, underwrote many of Mr. Fossett’s adventures.)But for all the hazards, Mr. Fossett said he felt little pressure. To him, flying, sailing or soaring faster or farther or higher than anyone had done before were merely a series of logistical problems that could be satisfyingly, if expensively, worked out.James Stephen Fossett was born on April 22, 1944, in Jackson, Tenn. He grew up in Garden Grove, Calif., in Orange County, where his father managed a soap factory. As a child, he suffered from asthma, but he pushed himself athletically. He loved hiking and other outdoor adventure.Mr. Fossett earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from Stanford University in 1966 and an M.B.A. from Washington University in St. Louis two years later. He took a job in Chicago running the information-technology division of a department store, but was quickly bored. He decided to switch careers.He went to work for Merrill Lynch, and later started his own brokerage firm, Lakota Trading. Mr. Fossett was also a principal in Larkspur Securities and Marathon Racing, which developed and owned much of the technology he used in his adventures.Besides his wife, the former Peggy Viehland, whom he married in 1967, Mr. Fossett is survived by a brother, Richard L. Fossett III, and a sister, Linda G. Dansby.Mr. Fossett had his detractors. Some critics saw him as a graying playboy, awash in a rich man’s toys. Others took him to task for deliberately courting danger, heedless of the cost to taxpayers of his various rescues. But Mr. Fossett often said that it was novelty and adventure, not danger, that he sought.“I don’t like to be scared, and I spend a lot of effort figuring out how to reduce risks,” he told The Times of London in 2004. “The sports I’m involved in are high risk; to pursue them you have to be risk averse.”Not all Mr. Fossett’s ventures were spectacularly successful. After swimming the English Channel in 1985, for instance, he received a trophy — for the slowest crossing of the year. He managed to scale the highest peak on every continent except Mount Everest.Mr. Fossett also drove a dogsled in the Iditarod race in Alaska (he placed 47th); skied from Aspen to Vail, Colo. (an enterprise of nearly 60 hours); drove a Kremer Porsche 962C for 24 hours in the Le Mans sports car race; sailed an airship to a world speed record; and competed in the Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii.The only frontier on which Mr. Fossett had not made an assault was outer space. This owed, perhaps, to a reluctance to consign himself to the role of mere crewman, as he told Newsweek in 2003.“Flying in the space shuttle would be fascinating,” Mr. Fossett said. “But I’d want to be the pilot.”'"
"'08-02-16,'0','Should it succeed, the accomplishment would embolden those who champion even more spending on top of the $57.8 billion appropriated by Congress for missile defenses since the Bush administration’s first budget in the 2002 fiscal year.It might even revive a dormant effort to focus the military on antisatellite operations, as well. Failure, on the other hand, would be cited as hard and fresh evidence for those who point to the futility of space-warfare programs.Beyond arguments over whether antimissile weapons also provide thinly cloaked antisatellite capabilities, and Russia’s caustic opposition to building American missile defense bases in Poland and the Czech Republic, the highly unusual mission to destroy an American spy satellite has highlighted what historically was a sideshow of superpower nuclear arms control negotiations, the question of whether to ban space weapons altogether.The United States is perhaps the nation most dependent on satellites, both for commerce and for military communications, reconnaissance and targeting. And, to be sure, the Bush administration was harshly critical when the Chinese launched an antisatellite missile last year, the first time any nation had blasted an object in space in the 22 years since the United States last conducted such a test.At the same time, however, the United States has resisted suggestions that a new arms-control regime be negotiated to govern space weapons, and has asserted its sovereign right to defend its own access to space and to deny it to others in future wars.“The administration places a higher priority on military flexibility and does not want to constrain military options,” said Michael Krepon, co-founder of the Henry L. Stimson Center, an arms-control advocacy organization.That assessment is not refuted by White House officials.“The United States is committed to preserving equal access to space for peaceful purposes,” a White House spokesman, Scott M. Stanzel, said Friday. “At the same time, we oppose the creation of legal regimes or other international agreements that seek to limit or prohibit our use of space.”Mr. Stanzel noted that previous administrations opposed similar treaties, in part, he said, because they are hard to verify and police, since any object in space, even debris from a destroyed satellite, can act as a weapon.During the cold war, the United States and the Soviet Union conducted about 50 antisatellite tests: a significant number, but small compared with the 2,000 nuclear weapons tests carried out in that same grim period of superpower arms races.Efforts to ban space weapons, like the treaty proposed by China and Russia, are generally favored by arms-control analysts, even though they view the latest such initiative as deeply flawed.During a session of the Conference on Disarmament earlier this week in Geneva, China and Russia proposed a pact that would go beyond the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which bans orbiting weapons of mass destruction, and would prohibit all weapons in space.Mr. Krepon of the Stimson Center said the problem with the new proposal, a hindrance that has bedeviled previous efforts, was how to define a weapon.For example, lasers can be used harmlessly for determining distances in space and gathering information on objects in space, as well as for beaming communications back to earth, but also can be used as weapons. Similarly, debris from a decaying object in space, a satellite for example, can be as dangerous to other platforms in space as a missile fired from Earth.The new proposal, by focusing on weapons in space, also “does not cover ground- and sea-based means that could be used to harm satellites, such as the Chinese ground-based antisatellite weapon tested a year go,” Mr. Krepon said.Despite renewed interest in antisatellite weaponry sparked by Thursday’s announcement in Washington, the reaction from Beijing and Moscow thus far has been muted.'"
"'08-02-16,'0','The trouble started in late December when the incumbent president, Mwai Kibaki, was declared the winner over Raila Odinga, the top opposition leader, despite widespread evidence of vote rigging. Supporters of the two politicians have battled across the country, and the fighting has mostly been along ethnic lines. The election controversy has also stirred up deep-seated grievances over land and economic inequality that have dogged Kenya since independence in 1963.Mr. Annan said that it was critical for Kenyans from both sides in Parliament to work together to address these issues. He said the government and the opposition had agreed to an ambitious agenda that read like a laundry list of just about everything the country needs to do: electoral reform, constitutional reform, public service reform, police reform, judicial reform.But the reality is that the negotiations, which are being closely watched here and across Africa, are quickly slipping behind schedule. Last week Mr. Annan reassured Kenyans that a political compromise would be completed by the early part of this week. On Tuesday he implied that a deal would come by Friday. Mediators even retreated to a secret location — a game lodge in southern Kenya — to hold their discussions. Now Mr. Annan is saying that nothing will be decided until next week at the soonest.Two officials close to the talks said that the Kenyan government and opposition leaders had agreed in principle to form a coalition government, but that they remained deeply divided over the specifics, especially how much power the opposition would have. The officials said that Mr. Kibaki’s team was not budging and had rejected the opposition’s offer to split power between the president, who would remain head of state and the military’s commander in chief, and a new prime minister position to be filled by Mr. Odinga.Some government officials admit that they have no intention of working with the country’s leading opposition party, which by some accounts from election observers won more votes in both the parliamentary and presidential races.This may be a case of possession being nine-tenths of the law. The government is in power, whether it won fairly or not. Mr. Kibaki has already appointed half the cabinet, including the most important ministries, like justice, finance and defense. Kenya is getting back to normal after weeks of disruptions, and the appetite for street demonstrations and fighting with the police seems to be subsiding.“There will not be any power-sharing deal with the opposition,” said one government official who was not authorized to speak publicly. “These guys are criminals.”Opposition leaders seem to have been more flexible so far, dropping their initial demands that Mr. Kibaki resign and that a new election be held immediately. But the problem for them is that they have been accused of inciting the postelection violence. Kenyan government officials and Western diplomats have said that William Ruto, a charismatic opposition figure from the turbulent Rift Valley, encouraged his supporters to kill members of Mr. Kibaki’s ethnic group. Mr. Ruto vehemently denies this.Many diplomats fear that if the opposition is not given a meaningful role in the government, violence will explode again because opposition supporters will feel that they have no other outlet to express their anger or bring about change. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is scheduled to come to Kenya on Monday to lend the full weight of the American government to the talks.“At the moment, I’m not optimistic,” said David Anderson, a professor of African studies at Oxford University. “I don’t see much motivation to negotiate.”'"
"'08-02-16,'0','As Mitt Romney said this week when he endorsed John McCain, the campaign might have been rough but “we always had good laughs together.” As examples of this hitherto-unnoticed good fellowship, Mitt pointed cheerily to the fact that he and McCain had shaken hands before the debates and “said hi to each others’ wives.”Getting along with people you loathe is part of the business of politics, and nobody is blaming McCain for buddying up to the man he virtually accused of aiding and abetting Al Qaeda during the Florida primary. Although when you’ve said that somebody’s campaign was “based on a wholesale deception of voters,” calling it a “hard, intensive, fine, honorable” effort is perhaps one adjective too many.It’s not as if McCain has been caving in on anything important, like economic recovery ...Perhaps all this is just a momentary lapse, caused by McCain’s need to keep a lid on the Republican right while Mike Huckabee is still in the race. True, Huckabee appears to be hopelessly, impossibly, behind. However, his consultants are said to be working on a new and promising strategy that involves triggering an earthquake along the San Andreas fault, causing the West Coast to sink into the sea, dramatically reducing McCain’s current delegate count.McCain’s inconsistency is actually nothing new. We saw a lot of it during the Bush tax debates. McCain opposed the tax cuts as unwise and unfair, and then opposed getting rid of them under the theory that it would be a shock to the upper-income people who benefited from them and never noticed they were scheduled to expire. McCain seems to have developed a kind of right-to-life theory of economics under which any tax cut that comes into being has to remain on the books for all eternity.'"

"'08-02-17,'0','The problem, human rights advocates say, is that disagreement remains over which tactics are prohibited. Mr. McCain, for example, said waterboarding — a simulated drowning technique — was an illegal form of torture. But while the C.I.A. says it no longer uses waterboarding, the Bush administration has not ruled out its use in the future.“It’s disappointing,” said Jennifer Daskal, a senior counsel at Human Rights Watch, “that Senator McCain, who has long made it clear that Congress had intended to outlaw abusive interrogation techniques including waterboarding, won’t stand up to an administration that continues to say waterboarding is O.K. in certain circumstances.”Although Mr. McCain has battled the Bush administration over whether waterboarding is illegal, his vote on Wednesday allied him with President Bush, who has threatened to veto the bill.Democrats have used the vote to suggest that Mr. McCain was trying to curry favor with conservatives in the Republican Party, who have viewed him with suspicion and whose support he needs as he tries to unite the party behind his presidential campaign. The Democratic National Committee said in a statement last week that Mr. McCain had chosen “pandering over his principles.”Mr. McCain said the vote was consistent, noting in a statement he submitted to the Congressional Record that when Congress voted in 2005 to apply the Army Field Manual to the entire Department of Defense, it deliberately excluded the C.I.A.Mr. McCain, according to a Senate aide of his, believes that while the C.I.A. should be — and is — prohibited from using cruel and inhumane and degrading tactics, it should have the flexibility to use acceptable tactics that are not listed in the Field Manual.Elisa Massimino, the Washington director of Human Rights First, said given the administration’s refusal to clearly ban abusive techniques, it made sense for Congress to be more explicit about what should and should not be allowed. Requiring the C.I.A. to follow the Field Manual, Ms. Massimino added, would be a welcome step in that direction.“We’re very disappointed in his vote,” she said of Mr. McCain. “Because of his personal history and his leadership on this issue, it sends a terrible message to the rest of the world, to Americans, to the troops.”Mr. McCain, in his statement to the Congressional Record, faulted the Bush administration for declining to declare waterboarding illegal. He said Congress intended to outlaw the practice when it passed the Military Commissions Act in 2006 and was even reassured by the administration that it had been.“Staging a mock execution by inducing the misperception of drowning is a clear violation of this standard,” Mr. McCain said in the statement. “Indeed, during the negotiations, we were personally assured by administration officials that this language, which applies to all agencies of the U.S. government, prohibited waterboarding.”“It is unfortunate,” he continued, “that the reluctance of officials to stand by this straightforward conclusion has produced in the Congress such frustration that we are today debating whether to apply a military field manual to nonmilitary intelligence activities. It would be far better, I believe, for the administration to state forthrightly what is clear in current law — that anyone who engages in waterboarding, on behalf of any U.S. government agency, puts himself at risk of criminal prosecution and civil liability.”'"
"'08-02-17,'0','One of the trademarks of Mr. McCain’s rebel image has been his inability to cloak his emotions, especially anger. He has been prone to volcanic blowups over the years. And while he would hardly be the first president with a temper, Mr. McCain has been ever vigilant of late about resisting provocation.He mentioned his recent appearance in Washington before the Conservative Political Action Conference. (No adoring audience, the conventiongoers favored Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, in a straw poll, even though Mr. Romney had quit the race.)“They booed me when I brought up immigration,” Mr. McCain said. “And, automatically, I just smiled.”He repeated himself — “Smile! Smile!” — as if recreating an internal exercise that ensured this triumph of self-possession.Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who backed Mr. Romney in this year’s race, said Mr. McCain, of Arizona, deserved credit for having gone through the entire campaign “under stressful conditions” without any memorable outbursts.“Does he have a capacity to control it?” asked Mr. Santorum, referring to Mr. McCain’s detonations. “Over the course of the campaign, I think he has managed to. But I think it is a legitimate cause for concern.”The more famous McCain outbursts have been widely recalled in recent months, in part courtesy of the Romney campaign, which circulated a “Top 10 List” of Mr. McCain’s explosions.The perception that he struggles to control his anger makes Mr. McCain angry. “I know I sound a little bit defensive,” he said. “But for the last 10 years, I’ve had very little significant disagreement with my colleagues, certainly not personal ones.”That’s not exactly true: fellow senators and staff members cite more recent dust-ups involving profanities, red-faced exchanges and quick-trigger reactions. Still, only one entry on Mr. McCain’s Greatest Fits list occurred in the last year. He complains that people keep invoking “a problem I had with Chuck Grassley,” referring to the debate in which he shouted unprintable profanities at his Republican colleague from Iowa. “It was 12, 14 years ago,” Mr. McCain said. (It was, in fact, 16.)Part of being “presidential” and “uniting the party” involves grinning and bearing a wide variety of grievances — in Mr. McCain’s case, from anti-immigration activists, right-wing talk show hosts and the many lawmakers and lobbyists Mr. McCain has crossed, undermined, annoyed and overshadowed over the years.In addition to winning over his adversaries, Mr. McCain, 71, confronts many obstacles these days, all formidable. He faces well-financed and determined — if not unified — Democrats, questions about his age, and mounting fears about the economy (not his strong suit, he admits).But Mr. McCain’s chief encumbrance might be himself, namely, his historic inability to play the role of go-along-get-along leader. His flirtation with being the front-runner early last year resulted in near disaster. He has charmed the news media with his quippy and accessible style, and made his political name as a party renegade.Being on top with a growing staff, greater scrutiny and all the “best behavior” that demands does not necessary play to his strengths. “If he tries to be someone else, that’s a prescription for disaster,” said Bob Stevenson, a Republican strategist who was an aide to Bill Frist, the former Senate majority leader.“But once you become the nominee of the party,” Mr. Stevenson said, “you begin a transition into a different role, and that transition might be steeper for John McCain than some previous nominees.”It is with some satisfaction — and irony — that Mr. McCain cataloged the list of longtime Republican adversaries who have lined up in the last week to support him. “John Cornyn endorsed me,” Mr. McCain boasted in the interview, referring to the Republican senator from Texas at whom he directed a well-publicized string of profanities in a meeting last year.So did Ted Stevens, Mr. McCain said, referring to the longtime senator from Alaska whose enmity for Mr. McCain — and vice versa — is well known. “It was pretty short,” Mr. McCain said of the Stevens endorsement.“Thad Cochran endorsed me, too,” Mr. McCain marveled, referring to a very brief statement from the Republican senator from Mississippi who recently told The Boston Globe that the thought of Mr. McCain as president “sends a cold chill down my spine.”Mr. Cochran, who declined to comment for this article, went on to call his longtime colleague “erratic,” “hotheaded” and someone who “loses his temper” and “worries me.”Mr. McCain said he encountered Mr. Cochran on the Senate floor on Wednesday and the two exchanged a pro forma hug. There was no mention of Mr. Cochran’s criticisms. “What’s the point?” Mr. McCain said. The point — or one point — is that an earlier version of Mr. McCain might have approached Mr. Cochran with less gracious intent.In the course of a day on the stump, he demonstrated repeatedly that the Old McCain was being retooled on the fly. As his bus wound through Boston on Thursday, Mr. McCain began to tell the gathered-around reporters a sweet story about Senator Edward M. Kennedy. It is an anecdote he has told publicly many times — about how Mr. Kennedy arranged an elaborate birthday celebration for Mr. McCain’s son Jimmy when he turned 11.But Mr. McCain knows that public appreciation for Ted Kennedy is not the best way to win over the Republican base, so he prefaced the story with a request that it not be attributed to him. (Although he has told the story on the record many times.)Mr. McCain was stretched out on a velour-covered seat, holding court. He was on his way to put a happy face on a pained encounter — an endorsement by Mr. Romney, a man whom Mr. McCain’s campaign had not long ago derided as a phony, flailing flip-flopper.Reporters tried to incite Mr. McCain into a wisecrack. One asked if Mr. Romney had “flip-flopped” on his view of Mr. McCain. Mr. McCain grinned tightly, and spoke of how grateful he was for Mr. Romney’s support.Upon arriving at Mr. Romney’s soon-to-close headquarters, Mr. McCain stood dutifully for a photo op. The onetime adversaries gripped and grinned behind a lectern, standing about as far away as two people shaking hands possibly can.Mr. McCain stood to the side while his taller, tanner and better-rested former rival called him “a true American hero.”In turn, the front-runner praised Mr. Romney for running a “hard, intensive, fine, honorable” campaign. “I respect him enormously,” Mr. McCain said, looking solemn, before catching himself and flashing an autopilot smile.'"
"'08-02-17,'0','“This is not a terrorist group hiding in a state,” Mr. Ramon said. “They are the state, and they are a terrorist organization that refuses to recognize Israel’s right to exist.”Gaza, however, is not a state, but part of an occupied Palestinian entity, which is Israel’s problem.Mr. Ramon supports peace talks with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and a simultaneous “war against Hamastan,” as he put it. “No society in the world provides fuel and electricity to a country rocketing it,” he said, although Israeli cuts in supplies to Gaza have already brought fierce criticism from the United Nations and human rights groups about “collective punishment” of civilians and even cautions from Washington.The foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, took diplomats to the Gaza border on Wednesday and warned them that “the situation in the region is unbearable, and the threat of terror from Gaza is growing larger from year to year.” The problem is not simply the rockets, she said, “but also the strengthening of the terror organizations.” She added, “Israel must act to reduce these threats.”Fine, but how, exactly? Shlomo Brom, a retired general at the Institute for National Security Studies, says that none of the military options are especially attractive. To stop rockets, as the army learned in Lebanon, Israel must occupy the launching zones.But the range of the rockets is improving. “That means seizing most of Gaza,” Mr. Brom said, “and no one in Israel other than the fringe right has the appetite to reoccupy the Gaza Strip.” The Israeli Army would win easily, Mr. Brom said, “but it takes a long time, and for what? To regain rule over 1.5 million Palestinians? What’s the exit strategy?”Such an operation could make it impossible for Mr. Abbas, of Fatah, to continue peace talks with Israel, no matter how much he would like to see Hamas weakened or removed from power in Gaza.Other military options include intensifying current operations against Hamas, but that would not stop the rockets. Ground operations with limited goals — making sure Ashkelon is out of range, for example — could mean retaking northern Gaza and a wide swath next to the Gaza-Egypt border to diminish weapons smuggling.Killing Hamas leaders could also deter attacks, but might have unexpected consequences, like a new campaign of suicide bombings.Amos Oz, Israel’s most famous writer, warned, “Israel must not fall into the trap that Hamas is laying for us and march into Gaza.” He added: “The occupying force will not have a single quiet day. Nor will Sderot,” an Israeli town that is often the target of Palestinian rockets.There is another option, he noted, which would be to negotiate the cease-fire with Hamas that its leaders have been proposing. Diplomats say that Egypt, stung by the border crisis, is working on an ambitious package — an exchange of prisoners, including Cpl. Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured in Israel and taken to Gaza in June 2006, and possibly the jailed Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti; a long-term cease-fire in Gaza; and reopening the Gaza-Egypt border.Israel is likely to be cautious. Completing a deal with Hamas would further undermine Mr. Abbas, when Israeli and Western policy is to strengthen him and weaken Hamas.A long-term cease-fire might bring quiet to Sderot, but it would also allow Hamas to regroup, rearm, continue to improve its military capacities and strengthen its political and security hold over Gaza.Still, as Bernard Avishai, author of “The Hebrew Republic,” points out, Israel has a cease-fire with Hezbollah, just as rejectionist as Hamas, coupled with a disengagement of forces. “You have to stop the cycle of violence,” he said. “Israel can’t win a war in Gaza, but it can’t lose a Gazan peace.”A former national security adviser, Giora Eiland, wants to use the threat of harsh military and economic sanctions not to defeat Hamas, but to persuade it to stop the rocket fire — or else. Mr. Eiland proposes a deal: cease-fire, prisoner exchange, normal fuel and electricity supplies, and a reopened, monitored Egyptian border.If Hamas refuses, he proposes a very hard stick: the bombing of Gaza’s ministries, police stations and infrastructure; a halt in the supply of goods, fuel and electricity; and the economic separation of Gaza from the West Bank.It is an unlikely solution, given the international outcry that would follow. A better answer might be a rapid peace treaty creating a Palestinian state, supported by the Arab League and isolating Hamas, with international troops helping to patrol the borders.But because Israel and Hamas have little interest in a final settlement now, that seems like more wishful thinking.'"
"'08-02-17,'0','In the first two years of the event, the Tour of California has not had a rider fail a drug test. This year, the organizers instituted what they said was one of the strictest antidoping regimes of any major race. Each of the 136 expected riders will provide blood samples before the race. Those samples will become part of a permanent record that cyclists will be required to maintain beginning this season.In addition, 30 percent of the riders will have urine samples tested before the start for an array of illegal drugs. Each day during the eight-day, 650-mile race, the stage winner, the overall race leader and six others will be tested for steroids, hormones, stimulants and masking agents — double the usual amount of daily testing at big races.“We want to be sure that this race is clean and fair and that the best riders will win,” Andrew Messick, the president of AEG Sports, which organizes the race, said last month.This year’s field is probably the strongest in the race’s short history, featuring six current national time-trial champions — representing Russia, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden, Britain and the United States — and the national road champions of Germany, Britain and the United States.Leipheimer, the American road champion, won the California tour last year. He led from the opening prologue to the final day, winning by 26 seconds over Jens Voigt, a German racing for CSC.Leipheimer is expected to be a prime contender again, although the prologue — a flat, 2.1-mile time trial around the Stanford campus — is less likely to suit his style than did the short climb that served as last year’s opener.After the prologue, daily stages will wind from Sausalito through the Sonoma wine country and the central California valley. They then cross the toughest mountain on the route, the 4,360-foot Mount Hamilton, in what could be a decisive third stage Wednesday.The race then travels down the Pacific coast to San Luis Obispo before a 15-mile time trial Friday in Solvang. After traveling inland, the race ends next Sunday with a big climb, over the 4,906-foot Millcreek Summit, and several circuits around the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.The race has taken on added importance for Leipheimer and Astana after they were excluded from two of the year’s three major tours, in Italy and France. (Alberto Contador, the Astana rider who won the Tour de France for Discovery Channel last year, is not here.)Astana replaced nearly its entire management structure after it was forced out of the Tour de France last year because its top rider, Alexander Vinokourov, failed a doping test. Johan Bruyneel, the former manager of the Discovery team who took over Astana, said the team would focus on races other than the big tours.“We are now going to look for other goals,” he said in a telephone interview last week. “We have a strong team, and there are other races where we’re wanted and where we will want to win” — if only to prove that the organizers of the Tour de France made a mistake by leaving Astana out.George Hincapie, a former Discovery rider who is racing for High Road, said he thought the team would have a great deal of motivation to ride for the victory, because the team was new and because of the doubts engendered by the withdrawal of T-Mobile.High Road, the only team in cycling’s top rank with headquarters in the United States, was told initially that it would not be included in the Tour of Italy. But on Friday the company that organizes the Italian tour extended an invitation, provided that the team did not have any doping violations before the May race.Rock Racing, a relatively new team that races only in United States events, had been expected to field one of the more visible, if not one of the strongest, teams in California.Founded by Michael Ball, the owner of the Rock & Republic fashion company, the team signed Hamilton, Santiago Botero and Óscar Sevilla. Hamilton served a two-year suspension for blood doping, and Botero and Sevilla have been implicated in the Operation Puerto doping investigation in Spain.“When I put this team together, I wanted guys who were not getting a fair shake, who weren’t getting an opportunity,” Ball said.Although those three riders were included in Rock Racing’s preliminary start list, they were absent when the final roster was released Thursday. At a news conference Saturday, Ball said that the three riders, as well as Mario Cipollini, the Italian sprinter who has not raced in more than two years, would start the race. But Tour of California officials disputed that, and the disagreement may not be resolved until Sunday’s start.Last year’s second- through fifth-place finishers at the Tour of California are riding for the CSC team. Another CSC rider, the Argentine sprinter J. J. Haedo, won two stages at last year’s race. That probably makes CSC the team to beat.“We will have to see which card we are going to play,” Bjarne Riis, the CSC manager, said last week at the team’s training camp in Agoura Hills, Calif. “This is a team that wants to have the victory.”'"

To fuel a frosty morning building stone walls, day laborers invest $3.50 for an arepa packed with hearty carne mechada. High school athletes from New Canaan clean and jerk weighty containers of pork and chicken empanadas with rice, beans, avocado, plantains; blond women in workout wear breeze in for some smoky chipotle sauce to goose a humdrum chicken. Some loyalists eat two meals a day here.Call it a global coffee shop that’s also a fervent foodie’s El Dorado: inventive chews, good prices, no attitude. Valencia is at the crossroads of a changing Fairfield County, nestled amid plenty of Latino residents, and just a few traffic lights from the booming office trade of those multiplying Merritt Seven complexes. And it is close enough to I-95 and the Merritt Parkway to snag hungry commuters.Still, the question hangs, heavy as an overripe plantain: Why would Mr. Young shed his high-end chef’s whites to plunk down empanadas and yuca fries in bandana and T-shirt? Was he finding the upscale Fairfield County food scene as overwrought as the housing market here?He smiled, eyes closed. “I don’t need the stress or pretensions of high-end food. I just didn’t want to worry about the expectations of people buying a $26 entree.” And yes, he thinks the local scene is changing with him. “No one’s going to those tablecloth places like they used to,” he said. “And in some of those restaurants, they’re tamping it down, getting more casual.”Mr. Young’s father, a “100 percent Irishman,” cooked in a restaurant “as French as you could get in Glen Cove, Long Island, in the ’60s and ’70s.” After culinary courses in high school, the son leapt into the scalding Manhattan restaurant scene and shot through eateries and the ranks — busboy, waiter, line cook, chef by 21. He came by his Spanish flair as an acolyte of the celebrity chef Douglas Rodriguez, purveyor of “Nuevo Latino” cuisine at the three-star Patria in Manhattan. At 38, Mr. Young had gypsied through supervisory positions from Aspen to Maine before settling in Connecticut with his pastry chef wife, Jennifer, who grew up in Cheshire.Mr. Chavez is dulce de leche to Mr. Young’s double-shot espresso. Now 32, he came to Norwalk from El Salvador at 13 and after high school worked his way up from dishwasher to cheese grater to cook in a Liberty Park pizza house, went on to the Black Goose Grille in Darien and for a mad, briny spell, shucked 2,000 oysters any given Saturday night at the Chart House. When it closed, Mr. Chavez turned up at Ocean Drive asking to tend its busy raw bar. He could claim warp shucking speed of 12 bivalves a minute. Mr. Young hired him after one trial shift.As partners, they display a Beckham-like agility in the tight space. Generally, when one is waiting on tables, the other is cooking.Catering, offhandedly announced a couple of years back with a small cardboard tacked over the counter, is now 50 percent of their business, from elegant dinner parties to backyard pig roasts.Despite some 72-hour weeks, life is good; both men have young families, a son and daughter each. They make time for vacations, and they say they are grateful to love their work. But as inveterate dreamers, chefs are notorious will-o’-the-wisps, are they not? “We’re getting itchy,” Mr. Young confessed. They have tendered an offer to a landlord in Fairfield and are waiting to hear back. Both men think they could “drop more Valencias” throughout the area. But they know themselves too well. “Chefs are like 3-year-olds,” Mr. Young said. “They have to be babied. And so do restaurants. You just have to watch every second. Neither of us wants to reach too far and go nuts.”'"
"'08-02-17,'0','WITH the recent rise of glass-clad towers and high-end boîtes, the once-modest city of White Plains seems to be doing its best to impersonate Las Vegas, the land that not a single celebrity chef forgot. Developers and restaurateurs, including Rick Laakkonen at Antipasti and Anthony Goncalves at 42, are betting that suburbanites in search of fine dining will snub Manhattan and sink into a banquette closer to home. At the red-hot center of this big push is BLT Steak, a brand from Laurent Tourondel, sleekly ensconced on the ground floor of the new Ritz-Carlton on Renaissance Place.On two nights in late January, we pulled up under the porte-cochere and noted a fleet of new-model luxury cars, including two silver Bentleys and a dazzling white Rolls, parked strategically along the drive. Was it ungenerous of me to think that they had been planted there as props? BLT plays right along with the fantasy that recession is being held at bay. At the end of a particularly rocky week for the stock market, a capacity crowd was eager to peruse a menu that included a densely marbled $92 American wagyu rib-eye and a $45 plate of snowy Dover sole.With six locations nationwide, and more in the works, BLT Steak — the BLT stand for Bistro Laurent Tourondel — is fast spreading, like an exotic species that easily secures a niche where it sees an opening. It’s a modern steakhouse (don’t look for red velvet swags or big cigars) that flirts with a French-bistro aesthetic (slender frites stand upright in paper-lined cones).With BLT Steak, Mr. Tourondel, who staked his first claim at the highly regarded Cello in Manhattan, is mining a vein that might be called relaxed luxe dining. But despite its gorgeous, blond-maple veneers and breathtaking prices, BLT Steak in White Plains still has the by-the-numbers feel of a franchise. On two visits, our waiters led with the same lines and were careful not to stray far from the script.The food at BLT Steak is both serious and populist. Jesse Davis, the chef de cuisine, is a White Plains native and a veteran of Windows on the World and Porter House in New York. The menu is handed down from corporate headquarters, but a dozen daily specials allow Mr. Davis to show his stuff.'"

"'08-02-17,'0','In August 1769, a fleet of 12 Spanish ships carrying 2,000 troops sailed into the port of New Orleans. Alejandro O’Reilly, a Dublin-born officer of the Spanish military, was sent there to punish the rebellious leaders of a French town that had recently become a property of Spain. Since its founding in 1718, tiny New Orleans had scraped by on tobacco and indigo crops, a profitless outback of the French Empire. In contrast, the island of St. Domingue, with 400,000 slaves, had booming profits in sugar. Louis XV, reeling from wartime losses to Britain, gave Louisiana’s city to Spain.Deprived of French markets, Creole planters and merchants ran O’Reilly’s predecessor out of town. O’Reilly promptly ordered that five rebel leaders be shot and five others shipped to prison in Havana, the base of Spain’s colonial empire.Though O’Reilly established Spain’s command “in no uncertain terms,” the policies he and subsequent Spanish governors put in place “were relatively progressive, at least by colonial standards,” Ned Sublette writes in “The World That Made New Orleans,” an absorbing study of the transition from colony to American city. Spanish governors gave Louisiana planters access to Spanish markets. They gave slaves more latitude to buy their freedom, and used blacks in free militias to defend the city and suppress slave revolts. When Spain withdrew from New Orleans shortly before the Louisiana Purchase (1803), no other Southern city had as many taverns that catered to slaves or as many free people of color.The author of the well-received “Cuba and Its Music,” Sublette here explores Cuba and St. Domingue as crucial influences on New Orleans.A slave revolt that erupted in 1791 in St. Domingue ended in 1804 as free blacks proclaimed the Republic of Haiti. In 1809-10, approximately 10,000 Domingans (more than a third of them slaves) who had fled to Cuba immigrated to New Orleans, doubling its population. “No aspect of New Orleans culture,” Sublette writes, “remained untouched” by these whites, blacks and mulattoes. He is a passionate chronicler of the Africans’ resilience, of how they revived a cultural memory that gave life to music and enduring folkways — a memory that would, in the timeless words of an 1819 traveler, “rock the city with their Congo dances.” Sublette spotlights a gathering identity that formed in the open-air slave dances — hundreds of people, gyrating in sinuous rings, resurrecting tribal choreographies of a mother culture. “An African-American music was coming into existence,” he writes.'"
"'08-02-17,'0','We can start by renouncing cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of detainees and unreservedly committing to uphold the Detainee Treatment Act, which passed Congress in 2005 but was diluted by a presidential signing statement. We must also reaffirm our adherence to the United Nations Convention Against Torture, which the Senate ratified in 1990.Just as important, we need to come to grips with the practice known as waterboarding, the simulated drowning of a person to persuade him to talk. There was some progress in recent weeks: the C.I.A.’s director, Gen. Michael Hayden, told Congress that the practice may be illegal under current law; the director of national intelligence, Michael McConnell, told a reporter, “Whether it’s torture by anybody else’s definition, for me it would be torture”; Attorney General Michael Mukasey, after being asked if waterboarding would be torture if done to him, said that “I would feel that it was”; and on Wednesday, Congress passed a law forbidding the C.I.A. to use waterboarding and other harsh techniques.Why a few others in positions of power still find it so difficult to admit the obvious about waterboarding is astounding. We can never retake the moral high ground when we claim the right to do unto others that which we would vehemently condemn if done to us.Once we condemn and stop all waterboarding, what do we do in cases where it was conducted? An obvious step is to prohibit the use of evidence derived by waterboarding in criminal proceedings against detainees. Regardless of whether the technique has produced actionable intelligence, it did not produce reliable evidence with a place in our justice system. Imagine the outrage if the Iranian government tied down an American, convinced him the choices were to cooperate or die, and then used his “confession” as evidence in a death-penalty trial.My policy as the chief prosecutor for the military commissions at Guantánamo was that evidence derived through waterboarding was off limits. That should still be our policy. To do otherwise is not only an affront to American justice, it will potentially put prosecutors at risk for using illegally obtained evidence.Unfortunately, I was overruled on the question, and I resigned my position to call attention to the issue — efforts that were hampered by my being placed under a gag rule and ordered not to testify at a Senate hearing. While some high-level military and civilian officials have rightly expressed indignation on the issue, the current state can be described generally as indifference and inaction.At a Senate hearing in December, the legal adviser for the military commissions, Brig. Gen. Thomas Hartmann, refused to rule out using evidence obtained by waterboarding. Afterward, Senator Lindsey Graham, who is also a lawyer in the Air Force Reserves, said that no military judge would allow the introduction of such evidence. I hope Senator Graham is right about military judges, and it is unfortunate that any might be put in a position where he has to make such a decision.Regrettably, at a Pentagon press briefing last week announcing that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and five others had been charged and faced the death penalty, General Hartmann again declined to rule out the use of evidence acquired through waterboarding. Military justice has a proud history; this was not one of its finer moments.That is not to say those subjected to waterboarding get a free pass. If the prosecution can build a persuasive case without using the coerced “confession,” then whether a defendant endured waterboarding is immaterial in determining guilt or innocence.There are some bad men at Guantánamo Bay and a few deserve death, but only after trials we can truthfully call full, fair and open. In that service, we must declare that evidence obtained by waterboarding be banned in every American system of justice. We must restore our reputation as the good guys who refuse to stoop to the level of our adversaries. We are Americans, and we should be able to state with conviction, “We don’t do stuff like that.”'"

"'08-02-17,'0','If Clemens’s lawyers thought the hearing would resurrect his reputation, they made an expensive mistake.A key question was posed by Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland. Why is it, he asked, that McNamee is telling the truth about injecting Clemens’s former Yankees teammates Andy Pettitte and Chuck Knoblauch, who both have confirmed their use of H.G.H., but “when it comes to you he’s lying?”Clemens didn’t answer the question, digressing instead into comments about Pettitte’s use of H.G.H. Pettitte didn’t tell Clemens about his use of H.G.H., and Clemens didn’t tell Cummings why McNamee would be lying about his use.Did Clemens lie about not knowing that Mitchell was trying to meet with him? It would be difficult to conclude otherwise.Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York, noted that in a “60 Minutes” interview Clemens said he refused to talk to Mitchell on his lawyers’ advice. Yet, in his deposition, she said, “There were six times that you told our committee under oath that you had no idea that Mitchell wanted to talk to you.”Asked to explain the conflict, Clemens said: “The fact of the matter was I was never told by my baseball agent-slash-attorney that we were asked to come down and see Senator Mitchell. If I knew the lies that McNamee was talking about me, I would have been down there to see Senator Mitchell in a heartbeat, in a New York minute.”Clemens agreed with Maloney that his agents had done him “a terrible disservice” by depriving him of a chance to talk to Mitchell before the report came out, but he acknowledged that he had not fired his agents, the Hendricks brothers of Houston, or taken any other action against them.Clemens said he understood that the players association had “reached out to a lot of the players.“It was relayed to Mr. Hendricks,” Clemens added. “It was never brought to me.”Not to defend Randy and Alan Hendricks, but 30 years of dealing with them says there is no way they would not have apprised Clemens, their No. 1 client, of the Mitchell request.Randy Hendricks was asked about it in an e-mail message, but said it would be inappropriate to comment because he is Clemens’s lawyer.As a lawyer, if Hendricks didn’t tell Clemens about the letter and discuss Mitchell’s request with him, he would have violated his ethical obligation to his client.Union officials said Hendricks, like all agents representing players Mitchell wanted to talk to, was aware of Mitchell’s requests.“We were in regular contact with Randy Hendricks,” Steve Fehr, a lawyer speaking for the union, said.Clemens said the union or Commissioner Bud Selig could have told him what was happening. “I’m a public person; I am easy to find,” he said at the hearing. He said that even a former president of the United States, George Bush, found him in a deer blind in Texas to encourage him.“Bud Selig could have found me,” Clemens added. “If he knew within days what this man said was going to destroy my name he could have found me.”But Selig said he didn’t know anything more than Clemens.“I got the report that afternoon,” Selig said. “I was reading it while Mitchell was holding his press conference.”Roger Clemens’s accuser also emerged as credible in his discourse on linguistics, gaining independent and unsolicited confirmation of the meaning of his remark to Clemens in their secretly recorded telephone conversation that “it is what it is.”Lynn A. Westmoreland, Republican of Georgia, pressed Brian McNamee about Clemens telling him that he should tell the truth about injecting Clemens with H.G.H. Westmoreland said that McNamee never responded that he had told the truth.“I did in my own way as I speak,” McNamee said. “If you had known me, you would have known what I meant to answer that question: It is what it is. The truth is the truth. What I said was the truth.”Westmoreland responded: “But you never told Mr. Clemens that what you said was the truth. When he asked you to tell the truth why didn’t you just say in plain English so everybody could have understood you?”McNamee, of course, didn’t know that Clemens would play the tape of the conversation at his televised news conference.However, later in the hearing, another Republican, Mark Souder of Indiana, came to McNamee’s defense. “None of us are prototypical New Yorkers,” Souder said. “I asked a New Yorker on the floor and he said that’s not only Mr. McNamee’s expression, but a New York expression. That’s why he told the truth.”It’s also an oft-used Bud Selig expression, and, he said, “I’m not a New Yorker.”In the space of 14 months, the arbitrator Tom Roberts ruled that owners couldn’t include drug-testing clauses in players contracts, was fired by the owners, was ordered reinstated by another arbitrator and ruled that owners had violated the collective bargaining agreement by acting in collusion against free agents in 1985.With barely a pause in his schedule, Roberts joined with his fellow arbitrator George Nicolau, who had found the owners guilty of collusion in two other cases. They oversaw a settlement of $280 million for players whose rights were violated.“Tom and I, at everyone’s request, designed a framework under which money would be given to players,” Nicolau said. “Tom had done salary arbitration and I had not so it was agreed Tom would decide the claims. I used to kid Tom that giving away $280 million plus interest was a lifetime job. It finished only in the last year or so.”Roberts, 84, died in his sleep last week at his Los Angeles-area home. “He was an extremely kind man, an incredible gentleman,” said Gene Orza, the union’s chief operating officer.In August 1986, the owners fired Roberts after he voided the drug-testing clauses they had forced on players without union talks. The owners, exercising what they maintained was their right, immediately fired him.They said they acted because of his decision, but it was believed they were really concerned about his possible decision in the case he was hearing. That was the collusion case, in which the union charged that the clubs had acted in concert to stifle the movement of free agents.The union filed a grievance over Roberts’s dismissal, contending that an arbitrator couldn’t be fired in the middle of a case. Another arbitrator, Richard Bloch, ruled for the union.Roberts resumed hearing the collusion case, ruled for the players and was fired again. This time the dismissal stuck, but Roberts would return to join Nicolau, his successor, in overseeing the settlement on collusion damages for 1985, 1986 and 1987.'"
"'08-02-17,'0','A New York police officer who was translating wiretapped conversations in a case against a Queens doctor charged in the killing of her estranged husband, a dentist, is under investigation because one of the tapes is missing, officials said on Saturday.The police would not identify the officer. He may have been acquainted with relatives of the doctor, Mazoltuv Borukhova, and he has been placed on modified assignment, a police spokesman said. The officer had been called in to help translate the taped conversations because he is fluent in the language that was spoken on the tapes. Dr. Borukhova is a Bukharan Jew from Uzbekistan, who speaks Russian and Bukhori, a hybrid of Farsi and Hebrew.Dr. Borukhova, 34, was present when her husband, Dr. Daniel Malakov, 34, was shot three times in the chest, in front of his daughter, on the morning of Oct. 28.The existence of the wiretapped conversations was disclosed in court on Friday when Dr. Borukhova appeared before a judge in State Supreme Court in Queens. The developments were reported in The Daily News on Saturday.The prosecutor in the case, Brad Leventhal, told the judge that he planned to file legal notices outlining his plans to use the tapes at trial, said Kevin Ryan, a spokesman for the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown. Such notice is necessary in a short time period.Mikhail Mallayev, 50, an Uzbek immigrant who lives near Atlanta and is related by marriage to Dr. Borukhova’s sister, was arrested in November on murder charges. The criminal investigation uncovered about 90 telephone calls between him and Dr. Borukhova in the weeks before the killing.The Police Department’s Internal Affairs Bureau is conducting an investigation and has spoken with the officer at the center of the allegations. Investigators will try to find out whether the missing tape was taken by the officer or accidentally misplaced.'"
"'08-02-17,'0','In 1965, American Motors introduced the Marlin, a fastback coupe intended to compete with Ford’s recently arrived Mustang. Though it was not designed for Nascar superspeedways, its wind-cheating shape, ideal for racing, inspired designers at other automakers. A wave of slippery new body shapes, like the sloped-back Dodge Chargers of the mid-1960s, soon arrived. These silhouettes helped horsepower-rich engines propel racecars to record speeds.But automakers could not simply make changes to improve aerodynamics and top speed on Nascar’s long high-banked tracks. The rules required that in order to qualify as a stock car, a model had to be available to the public. The catch: a minimum number had to have been sold.This provision, called homologation, varied from time to time in what the minimum number would be. The requirement was as low as 200 in the instance of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo Aerocoupe; in other cases, a formula based on the total number of dealers in the automaker’s franchise was used. Manufacturers would usually produce only the minimum needed to qualify the special homologation cars as race-legal.There was an element of role reversal in this situation — rather than improvements developed on racetracks trickling down to the street, road cars were contributing to success on the racetrack.The golden era of cars built specifically to meet Nascar’s rules coincided with the peak of the American muscle car. Some are well known and easily recognized, like the 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona and 1970 Plymouth Road Runner Superbird, with their sky-high rear wings and pointed appendages at the front.Not all of the aerodynamically enhanced cars were so outrageous. Ford produced a special Torino Talladega, and for its Mercury teams the Cyclone Spoiler II. Before Dodge produced the Charger Daytona, it tried to make do with more subtle changes in a model called the Charger 500.The special models, which typically involved short-run production lines operated by independent vendors, mainly dealt in minor changes. For the Dodge Charger 500 and the Ford Torino Talladega, the inset grilles were pulled forward to mount flush, eliminating the recesses that disrupted airflow. The Charger was also fitted with sloped rear glass to replace the original window set between flying buttresses at the rear of the roof.Such cars were offered with engines to match their intentions. In 1969, Ford introduced a souped-up version of its Torino coupe, called the Cobra, powered by a 429-cubic-inch engine that produced at least 375 horsepower. As the 1970 season loomed, Ford decided it would up the ante with a Torino King Cobra that had a more powerful engine. Dodge offered a 425-horsepower 426 Hemi or a Magnum 440 that made slightly less horsepower despite its larger displacement.For 1970, the Monte Carlo made its debut just as the horsepower party started to wind down. Tighter government controls on exhaust emissions, coupled with soaring auto insurance premiums for these street-legal homologation cars, put a crimp in manufacturers’ plans to produce models with such limited production runs.Officially, Chevrolet maintains that the Monte Carlo was never really intended to be a racecar. It was a personal luxury coupe — a body style for which there was limited demand — that at least took into consideration the needs of Nascar racers when styling was changed.General Motors may hold the distinction of making the last mass-production models to have offshoots tailored specifically for Nascar duty. In 1986-87, Chevy Monte Carlo Aerocoupes and Pontiac Grand Prix Aerodynamic Coupes were built with extended rear windows that gave the cars an advantage on superspeedways.'"
"'08-02-17,'0','Who knows? As a Henry James character said about art: “We work in the dark. We do what we can. We give what we have.”Gingerly, I would like to inject a note of uncertainty into this season of certainty. Covering seven presidential campaigns has made me realize that when it comes to predicting how presidents will perform, “nobody knows anything,” as William Goldman said about Hollywood.You’d think it would be safe to vote on issues, but politicians often don’t feel the need to honor their campaign promises. I covered Bush Senior saying, “Read my lips: No new taxes.” I also covered him raising taxes and saying, “Read my hips.” I covered W. promising a humble foreign policy and no nation-building. I also covered the Iraq fiasco.Voters try to figure out who they trust to have life-and-death power over them, but there’s so much theatricality and artifice in campaigns you can get a false impression of who someone is.And you never know who they will become once they move into the insular, heady womb of the White House — or how they will be buffeted by the caprice of history, and the randomness of crises.At the very moment when politicians should be on top of the world, Ma, embraced by the voters, enhanced by the toys and levers of power, their gremlins surface. They inevitably get hit with trouble that they never could have imagined or prepared for, and that can trigger self-doubt and self-destruction and self-pity.Why didn’t J. F. K. simply toss out the C.I.A. plan developed under Eisenhower to send 1,200 exiles to overthrow a popular Cuban leader with a force of 200,000? He felt the need to prove himself.Why did L. B. J. ignore his own solid political instincts to listen to Robert McNamara and Dean Rusk about Vietnam — falling under their stupid sway because they had been J. F. K.’s advisers?Nixon, driven by the same pathology of envy about Kennedy and other golden boys, conspired in a political crime while coasting to re-election.Why did W. let Cheney and Rummy lead him into hubristic disaster? He, too, needed to prove himself — and outdo Daddy. How could the “compassionate conservative” bike through Katrina?The self-destructive impulses that consumed Bill Clinton detracted from his policy achievements and distracted him from achieving all he could have.The press tends to swallow campaign narratives of sin and redemption, hard lessons learned.After giving up drinking and becoming Texas governor, W. had supposedly changed from an arrogant, obdurate, Daddy-competing loser to a genial, bipartisan, mature winner. As it turned out, a total makeover is not possible after 40.Hillary’s narrative echoes W.’s: After the scalding partisanship of the ’90s, she became a senator and turned the other cheek, working on legislation with Republicans who had pursued the impeachment case against her husband. She has supposedly learned from her White House mistakes on health care, Travelgate and legal issues, from her battles with the right and the press. She knows now that being obstructionist and secretive don’t work.An appealing arc, but is it true? Her campaign shake-up showed that she continues to rank loyalty and secrecy above competence and ingenuity. She is still so guarded that she began answering questions from the press and voters only after she lost Iowa.All of us have known big shots who keep a check on their real feelings and dark tendencies until they get the top job. Then they throw off the restraints and revert to their worst instincts, bullying others and insulating themselves with sycophants.Hillary could be ready on Day 1 — to make up her Enemies List and banish Overkill Bill to a cubbyhole in the Old Executive Office Building. But it’s Day 2 that I’m really worried about.'"

"'08-02-18,'0','It’s more complicated online. Social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace create identities for people, and disseminate information about them to large numbers of people. I am Facebook friends with Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, who is an avid “twitterer.” He uses the Twitter social network to send his friends frequent bulletins, which feed into their Facebook pages, about his whereabouts (Hanoi, the other day) and what he is reading (a lot about telecom immunity).This sort of sharing is unobjectionable because Mr. Omidyar is deciding what information he wants to put out. More problematic is the amount of unintended sharing going on. There have been countless stories of young people losing job offers when prospective employers find their MySpace pages and read tales of alcohol and drug use.Most troubling of all is the growing inclination of Web sites to spread personal information without users’ consent. Facebook was rightly pilloried last fall when it introduced its Beacon service, which notified users’ friends — without the users’ consent — about online purchases. (Hey, Mary bought a pregnancy test!) Google Reader crossed a similar line when it began automatically sharing the news stories users read with their instant-messaging contacts.It’s no secret why Web sites like to spread information of this sort: they are looking for more ways to make more money. Users’ privacy is giving way to Web sites’ desire to market to their friends and family. Technology companies are also stockpiling personal information. Google has fought hard for its right to hold on to users’ searches in a personally identifiable way.What Web sites need to do — and what the government should require them to do — is give users as much control over their identities online as they have offline. Users should be asked if they want information to be viewable by others, and by whom: Their friends? Everyone in the world? Privacy settings, which allow for this kind of screening, should be prominent, clear and easily managed. (I’m not sure I was part of the intended audience for my colleague’s college-years anecdotes.)Before Web sites disseminate information the user did not ask to share, like an online purchase, the user should be notified and should have to affirmatively “opt in.” It should be easy for users to disappear from a Web site that they have been part of, or simply to delete some information about themselves.In a visit to the editorial board not long ago, a top Google lawyer made the often-heard claim that in the Internet age, people — especially young people — do not care about privacy the way they once did. It is a convenient argument for companies that make money compiling and selling personal data, but it’s not true. Protests forced Facebook to modify Beacon and to ease its policies on deleting information. Push-back of this sort is becoming more common.No one should have personal data stored or shared without their informed, active consent. If they still want to tell the world — including job interviewers and employers — about their wild weekends, they’re on their own.'"
"'08-02-18,'0','DALLAS — After more than 40 years under lock and key, a large collection of documents and items related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy was released by the Dallas County district attorney on Monday.The district attorney, Craig Watkins, officially unveiled 15 boxes that had been stored in a walk-in safe on the 10th floor of the Dallas County Courthouse. The boxes held a grab bag of memorabilia, from Lee Harvey Oswald’s clothing to a tooled leather holster used to carry a gun by Oswald’s killer, Jack Ruby.“We decided that this information is too important to keep secret,” Mr. Watkins said.Mr. Watkins said he learned of the documents soon after taking office a year ago. Although his predecessors had chosen to keep the material secret, Mr. Watkins said he saw no reason to do so. The material is now being scanned and will eventually be donated to a museum that can make it public, he said. Mr. Watkins said a museum had not yet been selected, but he mentioned the Smithsonian, in Washington, or the Sixth Floor Museum, in Dallas, as two possibilities.No outside experts have examined the trove, Mr. Watkins said, and even his staff has not reviewed much of the contents of the files, though most of the documents have been scanned.That makes it almost impossible to evaluate how much new information is included among the memorabilia, said Nicola J. Longford, executive director of the Sixth Floor Museum, which is in the former Texas School Book Depository from which Oswald shot President Kennedy.“We don’t know how much is original, copied, or previously available,” Ms. Longford said in an interview. As for the purported transcript of a meeting between Oswald and Ruby, she said, “It’s speculation as to whether is a real conversation or not or part of a movie script.”'"
"'08-02-18,'0','“I’d be honored to have President George Bush’s support, his endorsement, I’d be honored to be anywhere with him under any circumstances,” he said.Referring to the current president, “all I can say is that I’m glad to have campaigned hard for President Bush’s election in 2000, his re-election in 2004, and I’m pleased to have had the opportunity to work with him on many issues,” Mr. McCain said. “Are there issues that we are in disagreement on? Of course. And again, obviously, the American people will judge who they vote for by the qualities of the candidate.”While former President Bush proclaimed himself “happy to help this remarkable patriot carry our party’s banner forward,” he made a point of emphasizing that he was not calling on Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, to leave the race.“Of course, having been a candidate in both a losing and winning effort for the G.O.P. nomination, let me stress that I have not come here to tell any other candidate what to do,” he said. “A very wise man once said that influence is something you always have until you actually try to exert it.”And the former president noted that in 1980, he had found it “tough” to accept that he had failed to win the Republican nomination even after it became apparent to the rest of his team. “It was a hard thing to do, when you’ve been working hard yourself after so much time and exhaustive effort by so many friends,” he said. “It can take a while for any candidate to read the handwriting on the wall. And that certainly was true of me.”The former president, who was often viewed with suspicion himself by conservatives in the Republican Party, was prepared for a question about Mr. McCain’s conservatism with a quote from an unimpeachable source.“Thinking I might get the question,” Mr. Bush said, “I went to the Reagan diaries, and let me just read you a couple of quotes, because I remember Ronald Reagan, when I was his vice president, after he became president, getting the same kind of criticism from the ultra-right.”Mr. Bush read one quote from 1982 in which President Reagan complained that a leading conservative had written about his “betrayal of the conservative cause,” and another in which he complained that he was being painted “as a kind of turncoat conservative.”“You know, you’ve been around the track, you hear these criticisms,” Mr. Bush said. “And I think they’re grossly unfair. He’s got a record that everybody can analyze in the Senate, a sound, conservative record. And yet he’s not above reaching out to the other side. So I hear these criticisms, and Barbara knows, I get a little bit annoyed about them, frankly.”“I just don’t like when I see a friend come under unfair attack,” he said. “He’ll do just fine with the base of the Republican Party.”Mr. McCain proclaimed himself honored by Mr. Bush’s support. “This president is viewed with respect and affection by all Republicans,” he said. “I’m proud to have his support, and I think that our effort to continue to unite the party will be enhanced today dramatically by President Bush’s words and I am proud and grateful and I hope that I can measure up to the honorable service that President Bush has rendered this country.”And Mr. Bush seemed to enjoy his status as one of the party’s elder statesmen.“As one who’s inactive in most things political, I have watched with great interest over the past few months the spirited battle that is raging for the leadership of our great party,” he said at the outset. “It’s been a very strong contest, based on the big issues of our time, and I believe the tenor of our family debate had largely been befitting the high office in play. There are of course a few exceptions: when I saw a snowman asking a question during the YouTube debate, I naturally felt that the good Lord had taken me out of active politics at just the right time.”'"
"'08-02-18,'0','And though he remains relatively popular among Republicans, even there his approval rating has declined to 66 percent.Mr. McCain’s advisers rushed to insist that they were not running away from the president, but rather that they would be reluctant to have any sitting president campaign with Mr. McCain.“What an incumbent president can do is help a new nominee with fund-raisers, maybe with unifying the party, maybe with getting out the vote in Republican areas,” said Charles Black, a top adviser to Mr. McCain and an outside adviser to the White House who has been part of every Republican presidential campaign since 1976. “But the important thing to remember is, the nominee is on their own. And no president, no matter how popular and effective politically, can carry somebody.”Ed Gillespie, the White House counselor to Mr. Bush and the chairman of the Republican National Committee during Mr. Bush’s 2004 re-election campaign, echoed Mr. Black. “Senator McCain has his own identity,” Mr. Gillespie said in an interview, “and he’s going to be campaigning as John McCain and the things that John McCain believes in.”There is a precedent: President Ronald Reagan campaigned only selectively and made only rare appearances at the side of George Bush in the 1988 campaign, even though Mr. Bush was his vice president.So look for Mr. Bush to make solo appearances on behalf of Mr. McCain before evangelicals and in Republican pockets across the country, and to campaign in places where there are important races for the House and Senate, like Idaho and Kansas, which will not be critical destinations for the Republican nominee.Definitely look for him on the dais at big Republican fund-raising dinners. In 2004, Mr. Bush led a Republican fund-raising machine that collected $273 million, and his chief fund-raiser, Mercer Reynolds, will be one of those leading Mr. McCain’s effort.The weekend at the senator’s ranch came as Mr. McCain was about to receive another lift from the Bush family, this one from the former president, who will endorse him Monday in Texas.Those in the strategy sessions with Mr. McCain in Arizona included the senator’s wife, Cindy; Mr. Black; Rick Davis, Mr. McCain’s campaign manager; Mark Salter, a top McCain adviser; Steve Schmidt, an adviser to Mr. McCain and a former aide to Vice President Dick Cheney; and Mark McKinnon, a media adviser to Mr. McCain and a former media adviser to Mr. Bush.Mr. McKinnon told National Public Radio last week that although he supported Mr. McCain, he would not be part of the senator’s campaign if Senator Barack Obama was the Democratic nominee because he met and likes Mr. Obama and would be uncomfortable in a campaign that would inevitably be attacking him.In an interview on Sunday, Mr. McKinnon declined to talk about conversations he had with Mr. McCain on the matter over the weekend, but said he would still support Mr. McCain “100 percent,” even if he was not working for the campaign in the general election.Mr. McKinnon, like Mr. Black and Mr. Schmidt, has close ties to the Bush White House, and is part of a continuing conversation between the McCain campaign and the West Wing. There are frequent contacts between Mr. Black and officials at the White House, including Joshua B. Bolten, the chief of staff, and between Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Gillespie, who worked together in the summer of 2005 as strategists directing the Supreme Court nomination of John G. Roberts Jr. on Capitol Hill.Bush and McCain advisers said they planned to institutionalize contacts between the campaign and the White House once Mr. McCain was the nominee, but that the communication was unlikely to be as formal as the daily 8 a.m. conference call between the Bush campaign and the White House during the 2004 re-election campaign.In that call, White House officials assembled in the office of Karl Rove, Mr. Bush’s chief political strategist, and planned the day’s assault with officials in the office of Ken Mehlman, the campaign manager who was at Bush-Cheney headquarters in Arlington, Va.Despite the shared advisers, there has been plenty of bitterness toward the Bush team among other McCain aides, who accused the Bush campaign of spreading rumors during the 2000 South Carolina primary that Mr. McCain had an illegitimate child. But Mr. McCain, who lost the primary and the nomination that year to Mr. Bush, eventually repaired his relationship with the president and campaigned for him in 2004.Some of Mr. McCain’s advisers admitted that they were slow to come around. “We were dyspeptic jerks who held grudges,” Mr. Salter said.One McCain adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so he could talk freely about internal campaign deliberations, said Sunday that while there were risks for Mr. McCain to appear with Mr. Bush, it would be a bad idea to keep Mr. Bush entirely at arm’s length. The reason, the adviser said, was that “you don’t leave a president who is popular within his own party out of your campaign activities, because then you’re following the campaign strategy of Al Gore.”The adviser was referring to the distance that Mr. Gore kept from President Bill Clinton when Mr. Gore, then vice president, was campaigning for the White House in 2000. Some Democrats have blamed Mr. Gore’s loss in part on his failure to embrace Mr. Clinton, who even as he was mired in scandal remained popular among Democrats.Mr. Black also said that much would depend on Mr. Bush. “When the time comes,” he said, “we’ll sit down and see what he’s willing to do.”'"
"'08-02-18,'0','“They keep telling me it’s very fluid,” said Luke Esser, chairman of the state Republican Party.Aides to Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton have long since left the state.“We’ve chosen our delegates,” said Kelly Steele, a spokesman for the state Democratic Party.Political parties have the authority to decide how they select delegates to their nominating conventions, and Democrats here have continued to rely on the caucuses even after the primary. Democratic leaders say the caucuses are well attended and help build party unity. Republicans, who have often awarded a portion of their delegates through the primary and a portion through caucuses, accuse Democrats of deliberately alienating voters from the nomination process.“They would rather be able to do it more with the insiders,” said Sam Reed, a Republican who is secretary of state and Washington’s top election official.“This is a $10 million taxpayer-funded meaningless beauty contest by Republican secretary of state, Sam Reed, that will pick a handful of Republican delegates at a price of about $526,000 per delegate,” Mr. Steele said.Washington is one of several states that use caucuses and primaries to nominate delegates. Accompanying the blame and questionable relevance, there is confusion.People here do not register to vote by party affiliation, but this year voters in the primary must check a box declaring a preferred party and sign an oath promising that they did not vote in a caucus for another party. There is no mechanism to ensure that people do so — just trust. But if a voter does not select a party and sign the oath, their vote will not be counted in the presidential primary. The changes have not gone over well.“We’re hearing daily, in huge volumes, from voters who are angry with this style of primary,” said Bobbie Egan, a spokeswoman for the King County elections division. Ms. Egan said the department had received 50 to 75 complaints a day in recent weeks.Mail-in ballots received so far show that 25 percent of voters in King County, the largest in the state, are not checking the box. Many are writing notes on their ballots.“This is anti-democracy,” one voter wrote. “Political parties should not control who I can vote for.”Still, people appear to be voting in large numbers. Almost all of Washington voters cast ballots by mail, and Mr. Reed said as many as 30 percent of voters in some counties had cast ballots more than a week before the election. He predicted that 47 percent or more of the state’s 3.2 million voters would participate, a record.“If Hillary Clinton can come back and win the Democratic primary in the state of Washington after Obama won the caucuses, you’d better believe people will be talking about that for a long time as she looks for momentum going into Texas and Ohio,” he said.Mrs. Clinton has fared better in primaries than caucuses. But Cathy Allen, a member of her steering committee in the state, said that other than group e-mail messages being sent to encourage supporters to vote, no great effort was under way to try to win the primary.“There’s a loyal group of Hillary folks who are looking to show our respect,” Ms. Allen said.'"
"'08-02-18,'0','SEOUL, South Korea — President-elect Lee Myung-bak of South Korea was questioned Sunday by special prosecutors investigating accusations that he had engaged in financial fraud.The questioning, which took place eight days before Mr. Lee was scheduled to be inaugurated, on Feb. 25, lasted more than three hours. The questioning took place at an undisclosed location, and the information that he was being questioned about was not made public until afterward.“The investigative team conducted its work in a fair manner and the president-elect answered the questions earnestly and sincerely,” said Kim Hak-geun, a special prosecutor, during a news briefing.Officials on Mr. Lee’s transition team were not immediately available for comment.Mr. Lee, who will be the first president from a business background, was elected Dec. 19 in part on promises that he would improve South Korea’s economy.He has denied any role in a stock manipulation scam that his former business partner Kim Kyung-joon, a Korean-American, is accused of having carried out in 2001. Mr. Kim is on trial on charges of stock manipulation, embezzlement and forgery.Two weeks before Mr. Lee’s election, state prosecutors cleared him of involvement in the suspected fraud. But opponents of Mr. Lee in Parliament voted two days before his election to allow a team of independent counsels to begin a new investigation. The move followed the release of a video clip that showed Mr. Lee telling an audience that he had created a company embroiled in the stock manipulation that Mr. Kim is accused of carrying out.'"
"'08-02-18,'0','Critics who regularly bemoan the dumbing down of television news would most likely have been enraged by the sight, on a recent weekday, of animated characters on an evening newscast explaining the political power wielded by superdelegates.Thankfully, perhaps, for Josh Landis and Mitch Butler, those detractors apparently do not often watch the “CBS Evening News with Katie Couric.”The two men, new to CBS News, are the minds and artists behind “Fast Draw,” an animated series created with dry-erase markers that tries to shed light on news developments.Set to fanciful music, the three-minute segment on the Feb. 8 newscast likened superdelegates to “wizards” who overrule voters. “Like the great and powerful Oz, these superdelegates are pulling the levers of powers in your political party,” Mr. Butler intoned.“Now I get it!” Ms. Couric remarked at the end. Her reaction suggested that “Fast Draw” would reappear on the evening newscast sometime soon. “That was great,” she said, sounding genuinely impressed. “I enjoyed that, that was fun.”CBS made no secret that it wanted to shake up the staid news format when Ms. Couric joined the network in 2006, but with the broadcast stuck in third place, it has since retreated from some of those ambitions. Then again, CBS arguably has the least to lose, so why not try something new? The next day, “Fast Draw” was the most popular video clip on the CBS News Web site, said Mr. Butler, whose animation work has also appeared on the Discovery Channel and PBS.'"
"'08-02-18,'0','Willie is the daughter of Vi, a 46-year-old ex-hippie who is involved in a squeaky-clean romance with her clergyman. But Vi was once a tie-dyed wild thing, to the point where she always told Willie that any one of three candidates could have been her father. Now Vi springs a surprise: She does know the identity of Willie’s father, but she’s not telling. The man is still a citizen of Templeton, so this revelation would be awkward. “It wouldn’t be fair to him,” Vi tells her infuriated daughter. But it would be fair, by the book’s rules, if Willie could do her own prodigious detective work to find him.Thus “The Monsters of Templeton” gets going, fueled by only one real clue: Willie’s father is a Temple. (So is her mother.) And Willie begins piecing together Temple family lore. To Ms. Groff’s credit, this is an exceptionally audacious gambit, especially for a first novel. It leads her to write in the lost voices of many different historical figures, starting with Old Man Marmaduke, who marvels that “a man such as I, a once-unlettered maker of puncheon and barrel, could build himself from nothing and become great.” Ms. Groff gets a boost from the actual Fenimore Cooper style at moments like this, though the reader need not know exactly when she is drawing on his Leatherstocking Tales.The fact that Marmaduke had blue eyes and red hair turn out to be diabolically helpful to Willie’s investigation. Blue-eyed, redheaded babies had a way of turning up unexpectedly in Templeton, which makes Marmaduke a contender for not only multiple paternity but also for a place in this novel’s title.Templeton turns out to have had more than its share of two-legged monsters, once Willie begins putting together her evidence. In a family tree that branches out to include slaves, American Indians (Fenimore Cooper’s Chingachgook, the Mohican chief, and his son Uncas) and maybe even the pack of guys who go on shared morning runs and wave fondly at Willie, there are more than a few miscreants along the way.The high point of Ms. Groff’s mock research is a packet of secret letters, marked “Contents disturbing and painful,” written between two genteel-sounding women. The letters begin politely, but quickly and artfully descend into darkness. Once their secrets come to light, let’s just say that Templeton’s head count would have been higher with neither of these women around.Plot twists like that one are certainly intriguing enough to captivate readers. The trouble with “The Monsters of Templeton” is that its complications seem nonstop. Does the town really need a monster and ghosts and eerie Temple family portraits? (“You rapscallion,” Willie says endearingly to one of them. “I think we know your little secret, my old friend.”) How many illegitimate pregnancies can one book follow? Even the monster turns out to have been ready to procreate — though at least no red hair or blue eyes are genetic factors. How many old Templeton boyfriends can Willie reactivate once she gets to town? How many subplots, like an out-of-town best friend suffering from lupus, can accumulate to no dramatic effect, out of thin air?Ms. Groff’s inexperience shows in this overcrowding, as it does in overly mellifluous turns of phrase (“the deer darting startled through the dark”). And she tries out more voices and documents than she can comfortably create. But it speaks well for her narrative talents that Willie Upton, disarming and smart, holds even more interest than the elaborate events that surround her.“The Monsters of Templeton” is given a great graphic boost by ingenious illustrations that seem to authenticate the characters: old photographs from Ms. Groff’s collection, as well as a computer-generated monster she created using Photoshop. This book’s handsome, vaguely sinister family-tree visual design also heightens the impact of Templeton-style hospitality.'"
"'08-02-18,'0','“The Trip to Bronx Science: A Long Ride to a Choice School” (news article, Feb. 12) evoked memories of my trip to Stuyvesant High School between 1947 and 1951.I lived in the Bronx and chose Stuyvesant for its sports. I lived on 169th Street and boarded the Third Avenue El at that station at 6 a.m. The trip to 14th Street took about an hour and a half and cost a nickel. In the winter, I sought out the warm seats on the train.I didn’t have the luxury of sleeping in comfort as they do in their reclining seats on the bus. I slept with my head hanging. And coming home was homework time.The school was overcrowded at the old facility on 15th Street, so the sessions started at 8 a.m. and ended at 1 p.m., and I had to get home in time for a part-time job from 3 to 6 p.m. Unfinished homework was done after dinner.Those were really great times: a wonderful education and worth all the hassles getting there.As I read “The Trip to Bronx Science: A Long Ride to a Choice School,” I could not help but chuckle to myself. As a student at Ramaz Upper School, a Jewish day school in Manhattan, for me the day described would be an anomaly if it ever happened.I am one of Ramaz’s many commuters, and I make the trip from Teaneck, N.J., to the Upper East Side daily. Though I board the bus at 6:50 a.m., I am lucky to be home by 5:30. This is on a day when I do not choose to stay for extracurricular activities.On the two or three days a week when I stay for an activity, I am lucky to be home by 7:15. Once I get home and eat dinner, I am able to begin my formidable amount of homework at the earliest, 7:35.'"
"'08-02-18,'0','In terms of punctuation, semicolons signal something New Yorkers rarely do. Frank McCourt, the writer and former English teacher at Stuyvesant High School, describes the semicolon as the yellow traffic light of a “New York sentence.” In response, most New Yorkers accelerate; they don’t pause to contemplate.Semicolons are supposed to be introduced into the curriculum of the New York City public schools in the third grade. That is where Mr. Neches, the 55-year-old New York City Transit marketing manager, learned them, before graduating from Tilden High School and Brooklyn College, where he majored in English and later received a master’s degree in creative writing.But, whatever one’s personal feelings about semicolons, some people don’t use them because they never learned how.In fact, when Mr. Neches was informed by a supervisor that a reporter was inquiring about who was responsible for the semicolon, he was concerned.“I thought at first somebody was complaining,” he said.One of the school system’s most notorious graduates, David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam serial killer who taunted police and the press with rambling handwritten notes, was, as the columnist Jimmy Breslin wrote, the only murderer he ever encountered who could wield a semicolon just as well as a revolver. (Mr. Berkowitz, by the way, is now serving an even longer sentence.)But the rules of grammar are routinely violated on both sides of the law.People have lost fortunes and even been put to death because of imprecise punctuation involving semicolons in legal papers. In 2004, a court in San Francisco rejected a conservative group’s challenge to a statute allowing gay marriage because the operative phrases were separated incorrectly by a semicolon instead of by the proper conjunction.Louis Menand, an English professor at Harvard and a staff writer at The New Yorker, pronounced the subway poster’s use of the semicolon to be “impeccable.”Lynne Truss, author of “Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation,” called it a “lovely example” of proper punctuation.Geoffrey Nunberg, a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, praised the “burgeoning of punctuational literacy in unlikely places.”Allan M. Siegal, a longtime arbiter of New York Times style before retiring, opined, “The semicolon is correct, though I’d have used a colon, which I think would be a bit more sophisticated in that sentence.”The linguist Noam Chomsky sniffed, “I suppose Bush would claim it’s the effect of No Child Left Behind.”New York City Transit’s unintended agenda notwithstanding, e-mail messages and text-messaging may jeopardize the last vestiges of semicolons. They still live on, though, in emoticons, those graphic emblems of our grins, grimaces and other facial expressions.'"

"'08-02-19,'0','We live in a world of change, some of which holds great promise for us and all mankind and some of which poses great peril. Today, political change in Pakistan is occurring that might affect our relationship with a nuclear armed nation that is indispensable to our success in combating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and elsewhere. An old enemy of American interests and ideals is leaving the world stage, and we can glimpse the hope that freedom might someday come to the people of Cuba. A self-important bully in Venezuela threatens to cut off oil shipments to our country at a time of sky-rocketing gas prices. Each event poses a challenge and an opportunity. Will the next President have the experience, the judgment experience informs, and the strength of purpose to respond to each of these developments in ways that strengthen our security and advance the global progress of our ideals? Or will we risk the confused leadership of an inexperienced candidate who once suggested invading our ally, Pakistan, and sitting down without pre-conditions or clear purpose with enemies who support terrorists and are intent on destabilizing the world by acquiring nuclear weapons?The most important obligation of the next President is to protect Americans from the threat posed by violent extremists who despise us, our values and modernity itself. They are moral monsters, but they are also a disciplined, dedicated movement driven by an apocalyptic zeal, which celebrates murder, has access to science, technology and mass communications, and is determined to acquire and use against us weapons of mass destruction. The institutions and doctrines we relied on in the Cold War are no longer adequate to protect us in a struggle where suicide bombers might obtain the world's most terrifying weapons.If we are to succeed, we must rethink and rebuild the structure and mission of our military; the capabilities of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies; the purposes of our alliances; the reach and scope of our diplomacy; the capacity of all branches of government to defend us. We need to marshal all elements of American power: our military, economy, investment, trade and technology and our moral credibility to win the war against Islamic extremists and help the majority of Muslims, who believe in progress and peace, win the struggle for the soul of Islam.The challenges and opportunities of the global economy require us to change some old habits of our government as well. But we will fight for the right changes; changes that understand our strengths and rely on the common sense and values of the American people. We will campaign:to balance the federal budget not with smoke and mirrors, but by encouraging economic growth and preventing government from spending your money on things it shouldn't; to hold it accountable for the money it does spend on services that only government can provide in ways that don't fail and embarrass you;to save Social Security and Medicare on our watch without the tricks, lies and posturing that have failed us for too long while the problem became harder to solve;to make our tax code simpler, fairer, flatter, more pro-growth and pro-jobs;to reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil with an energy policy that encourages American industry and technology to make our country safer, cleaner and more prosperous by leading the world in the use, development and discovery of alternative sources of energy;to open new markets to American goods and services, create more and better jobs for the American worker and overhaul unemployment insurance and our redundant and outmoded programs for assisting workers who have lost a job that's not coming back to find a job that won't go away;to help Americans without health insurance acquire it without bankrupting the country, and ruining the quality of American health care that is the envy of the world;to make our public schools more accountable to parents and better able to meet the critical responsibility they have to prepare our children for the challenges they'll face in the world they'll lead.I'm not the youngest candidate. But I am the most experienced. I know what our military can do, what it can do better, and what it should not do. I know how Congress works, and how to make it work for the country and not just the re-election of its members. I know how the world works. I know the good and the evil in it. I know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer, safer and more prosperous world, and how to stand up to those who don't. And I know who I am and what I want to do.I don't seek the office out of a sense of entitlement. I owe America more than she has ever owed me. I have been an imperfect servant of my country for many years. I have never lived a day, in good times or bad, that I haven't been proud of the privilege. Don't tell me what we can't do. Don't tell me we can't make our country stronger and the world safer. We can. We must. And when I'm President we will.Thank you, and God bless you.'"

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index fell 0.43, or 0.03 percent, to 1,349.56; and the Nasdaq composite fell 13.64, or 0.59, 2,308.16.Government bonds dipped as stocks gained. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, jumped to 3.88 percent from 3.77 percent late Friday.The dollar was mixed against most major currencies.Light, sweet crude for March delivery rose $4.51 to settle at a record $100.01 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier rising to $100.10, a new trading record. It was the first time since Jan. 3 that oil had been above $100.Other commodities, including gold and soybeans, rose as well. At the pump, gas prices rose further above $3 a gallon.Beyond inflation, investors also continued to be worried about the financial sector. So far, global banks have written down more than $150 billion from bad bets on mortgage-backed securities -- and more losses are expected to the first quarter.British bank Barclays Group PLC revealed credit-related losses totaling $3.13 billion, up from a smaller write-down in November, while Credit Suisse, Switzerland’s second-largest bank, said it has suspended ”a handful” of traders in connection with the overvaluation of asset-backed securities by $2.85 billion.Also, The Wall Street Journal reported that Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. could see big losses due to its significant investments in commercial real estate loans. Lehman fell $1.35, or 1.3 percent, to $53.42.”Can these financial stocks get to the bottom of their questions of soundness in asset quality? We have to reach a tipping point here,” said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for Stifel Nicolaus. ”That’s the part that I think has to occur for this market to have a sustained advance.”There have been some signs that troubled financial institutions are finding ways to regain their footing, however.Bond insurer Ambac Financial Group Inc. is discussing a plan to raise at least $2 billion in capital to maintain its superior credit rating, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The move would mirror a $3 billion cash-raising effort by rival bond insurer MBIA Inc., which said Tuesday that its former chairman and chief executive has returned to the lead the company.Ambac fell 20 cents to $10.02, though, after a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) analyst cut his price target for Ambac to $7 from $10 and said the company will probably to need to raise about $3.5 billion to maintain its ”AAA” rating. MBIA slipped 38 cents to $11.86.In economic news, the National Association of Home Builders said its index measuring homebuilder confidence inched up in February. Wall Street remains wary about the prospects for the housing market, however.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.63, or 0.09 percent, to 700.89.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to a fairly low 1.07 billion shares.'"
"'08-02-19,'0','He dismissed any comparison to the problems at the French bank Société Générale, where a lone trader has been accused of running up billions of euros of losses with fraudulent trading.“There were pricing issues that were not up to our standards,” Mr. Dougan said, namely that “a small number of traders” had been delinquent in properly marking the value of certain assets.Mr. Dougan said the losses were mostly in the area of residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, and all of the market-related losses occurred since Jan. 1.Credit Suisse said in a statement that an internal review had “resulted in the repricing of certain asset-backed positions in its structured credit trading business” and that the write-down — related to “significant adverse first-quarter 2008 market developments” — would reduce its net income by about $1 billion.The “fair value” reductions of the positions are estimated at about $2.85 billion, the bank said. In fair-value pricing, a financial instrument is assigned an estimated price when no market price is readily available. The market for many mortgage-backed derivatives has dried up as the United States housing bubble has deflated, leaving banks uncertain about the values of many assets.Andreas Venditti, an equity analyst at Zürcher Kantonalbank in Zurich, said: “It’s a blow to confidence. It looked like they had done such a good job in risk management. Today, of course, that looks quite different.”Credit Suisse said last week that it would write off just 1.3 billion francs for the fourth quarter as it posted net profit of 1.33 billion francs, and the bank won praise from analysts for the quality of its risk management. But it said Tuesday that it was studying the possibility that the new write-down would lead it to restate its fourth-quarter results.In the conference call, Mr. Dougan said he had not been aware of the problems when Credit Suisse issued its results last week.Global banks’ write-offs of subprime-related losses are approaching $150 billion. Germany’s finance minister, Peer Steinbrück, has estimated that such losses could grow to as much as $400 billion.The losses now extend well beyond the subprime sector, and global banks are facing a new round of write-downs. High-risk loans used to finance corporate buyouts have plummeted in value. Securities backed by commercial real-estate mortgages and student loans have fallen sharply. Even auction-rate securities, arcane investments usually considered as safe as cash, have stumbled.Analysts noted that the write-downs at Credit Suisse remained an order of magnitude below those of UBS, its bigger rival in Zurich. Credit Suisse’s total write-downs related to the global credit crisis are about $3.7 billion, while UBS has written off about $18 billion.UBS, the largest Swiss bank and the largest in Europe in terms of assets, last week reported a fourth-quarter net loss of 12.5 billion francs.Global banks, including UBS and Merrill Lynch, have had to seek injections of new funds from big sovereign wealth funds to keep their capital above regulatory minimums.On Monday, the government of Qatar bought shares of Credit Suisse on the open market. Under Swiss law, a shareholder with 3 percent of a company’s shares must declare that holding, so the Qatar investment presumably remains below that threshold, because it has made no public statement. In the conference call, Mr. Dougan declined to comment on the bank’s relationship with the Qatar government.'"
"'08-02-19,'0','One of the surprises in the collection was a contract for a movie deal about the killing, signed by Mr. Wade, said Craig Watkins, who became district attorney last year. Mr. Watkins said he did not know if the transcript was meant to be part of the film or why the film was never made.An expert who has written a book on the assassination, Max Holland, said the transcript appeared to be based on a long-discredited claim by a Dallas lawyer named Carroll Jarnagin, who said he and a stripper had seen Oswald and Ruby together and overheard the discussion. “It’s a concoction,” Mr. Holland said, adding that Oswald and Ruby did not know each other.The report of the meeting was debunked by the Warren Commission, he said, which after extensive investigation concluded that Oswald was a lone gunman, not a participant in a conspiracy.The documents have not been examined by outside experts, and even his staff has yet to read most of the material, Mr. Watkins said. Once the material is cataloged and images scanned into computers, it will be donated to a museum and made available to the public, he said. The possibilities include the Smithsonian, in Washington, and the Sixth Floor Museum, in Dallas, in the former Texas School Book Depository, from which Oswald fired on Kennedy’s motorcade.Although his predecessors had chosen to keep the material in a safe on the 10th floor of the Dallas County Courthouse for decades, Mr. Watkins said he saw no reason to do so. “We decided that this information is too important to keep secret,” he said.Mr. Watkins, the first black district attorney in Texas, said he was releasing the material in part because of the window it provided on the racism of the past. The material “takes us back to 1960 and the climate not only of our criminal justice system, but of our country as it relates to race,” he said. He cited the official letterhead of nearby Hunt County, which claimed “the blackest land and the whitest people.”In addition to the transcript, he displayed two sets of brass knuckles that belonged to Ruby, and a letter from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the Dallas police chief, contending that Ruby’s sister said her family had somehow obtained a police report on the preparations for Kennedy’s visit to Dallas.Oswald was arrested for fatally shooting the president on Nov. 22, 1963. Two days later, Ruby shot Oswald to death. He was convicted of murder, but won an appeal. He died of cancer in 1967, before the case was retried.The decision to release the material was praised by Gerald Posner, a lawyer and expert on the Kennedy assassination, who said that even if the transcript turned out to be a fake — “more entertaining than illuminating,” as he put it — historians would probably benefit from seeing contemporary documents related to the investigation.No matter what they contain, Mr. Posner said, the documents were almost certain to feed conspiracy theories. “And if it turns out they are innocuous,” he added, “people will say they must have destroyed the most incriminating documents.”Less than a mile away, vacationing families were celebrating Presidents’ Day by peering at the grassy knoll, now mostly bare dirt, from which conspiracy enthusiasts say a second gunman fired at Kennedy. Visitors there said they were aware of the new trove, but did not expect it to end the controversy.“There’s always going to be a theory,” said Donald E. Knox of Baltimore, here to attend a cheerleading competition with his daughter Samantha, 16, and wife, Sandra.About 1,500 people a day visit the Sixth Floor Museum, which was celebrating its 19th anniversary Monday with a chocolate-and-vanilla cake in the lobby.“A lot of people come here believing they can solve the complex details of this story,” said Nicola J. Longford, the museum’s executive director, adding that she would be delighted if the district attorney turned the trove over to her curators.The conspiracy debate continued to rage just outside the museum, where Roseanne Sande, 77, of Spokane, Wash., and her friend Mary Ann Thompson, 72, of Prescott, Ariz., stood on the corner preparing to enter.“Crazy things happen, and Oswald was crazy,” said Ms. Thompson, who said she believed that Oswald had acted alone.Her friend disagreed. “I think it was a conspiracy, I really do,” Ms. Sande said. “I’ve never had a good feeling about this, and I just can’t get it out of my mind.”'"
"'08-02-19,'0','But tax experts say many Germans have long viewed it as a form of sport to avoid their country’s high tax rates by sheltering their money in havens like Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein, the Alpine principality that is the focus of this investigation.“A lot of Germans are not aware this is a serious crime,” said Manuel René Theisen, a professor of tax law at the University of Munich. “And the sense of it being a game is true on both sides: The state is looking for the people’s money, and the people don’t want to give it up.”Now, though, such ethical laxity is colliding with the new boldness of German tax authorities. Prosecutors have obtained arrest warrants for as many as 700 suspected tax frauds, officials here said, using data on a computer disc that had been stolen from the LGT Group, a banking company in Liechtenstein.The tax scandal has already claimed one of the most prominent corporate leaders in Germany, Klaus Zumwinkel, who was apprehended in a raid last Thursday on suspicion that he used Liechtenstein to evade 1 million euros, or $1.46 million, in taxes. He resigned the next day as chief executive of the German postal service.Prosecutors said little about the targets of the raids Monday, which cut across the country and included the Frankfurt and Munich offices of Metzler, a centuries-old private bank that caters to rich customers.“We do not give any information on places or actions,” said a spokesman for the prosecutor in Bochum, Germany, whose office is coordinating the investigation. “We do not want to create a scavenger hunt.”But with talk that sports stars and other celebrities may be involved, the case is likely to keep Germany in thrall for weeks. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said she would raise the issue with Liechtenstein’s prime minister, Otmar Hasler, when he visits Berlin this week. And the mere threat of prosecutions may be enough to prompt some tax evaders to confess.Andreas Böhm, a partner at a Berlin law firm, Böhm Law Office, said that since Thursday, twice the normal rate of people had asked about reporting their own tax evasion. They ranged from small fry to high earners who genuinely have something to fear, he said.“Some people want to clean their conscience and sleep better,” Böhm said. “Others want to avoid going to jail.”Germany’s top individual tax rate is roughly 45 percent, comparable to other European countries like Spain and Italy. But an extra church tax can push the total rate to half of a high-earning person’s income.Even more than the Siemens and Volkswagen corruption cases, the tax scandal is stoking bitterness toward the German business elite, whom many ordinary Germans view as greedy and unaccountable.A study released here Monday said that the compensation of senior German executives rose 17.5 percent in 2007, at a time of stagnant wage growth, according to the Kienbaum executive search firm.At Siemens, the engineering giant, investigators uncovered “suspicious payments” of 1.3 billion euros, which they say they believe may have used over the years as bribes to win foreign contracts. The company’s chief executive and chairman lost their jobs in the ensuing furor.At Volkswagen, the personnel chief, Peter Hartz, pleaded guilty to paying off the carmaker’s union leader to win his support for company policies. Volkswagen also financed visits to prostitutes, according to prosecutors. Mr. Hartz received a two-year suspended sentence and a fine.“The clubby atmosphere still exists in Germany,” Mr. Krahnen said, “but it is disappearing quickly. We’re going in the direction of a more level playing field, more capital-market-oriented.”The public struggles in Germany are in marked contrast to its neighbors, France and Italy. In France, where a lone trader at Société Générale is under investigation for running up huge losses, raising question about its controls, the bank’s board and the French business elite rallied around the chief executive, Daniel Bouton.By one account, Germany’s drift toward global standards began with reunification in 1990, which imposed a colossal financial burden on the country. It ultimately spent more than $2 trillion to rebuild the East’s tattered infrastructure, requiring it to become a net importer of capital.For German corporations, the change meant that investors in London and New York, rather than Frankfurt, wielded greater influence. And these investors wanted to know that the German business style was evolving away from its clubby roots toward something they recognized.“Unification meant that Germany had to play by the rules of international capital markets,” said Paul Achleitner, chief financial officer of Allianz, the German insurer, during an interview before the scandal broke.Germany’s blue-chip companies — Siemens and Volkswagen, among them — were wrenched abruptly into this new era of shareholder rights and stricter corporate governance. But the wealthy, family-owned companies that form the backbone of Germany’s manufacturing base — the so-called Mittelstand — have experienced the change in a much milder form.The German news media have reported that no prominent executive from a German blue-chip company was implicated in the scandal. If that turns out to be true, experts said, a reason may be that these executives have more experience with the exigencies of global norms and ethics.The widespread tax evasion may also reflect a generally sour mood in Germany, one in which many sides feel like the victims, said Ulf Posé, the president of the Ethics Association of German Business, a group formed in 2002 to address moral questions for business in a global era. That conviction, he said, stems from people’s penchant for comparing themselves to their peers. Executives can look to Britain and the United States and see salaries far greater than in Germany. Lower-earning Germans, in turn, look at their own society and see rising inequality.“You have this kind of behavior when taxpayers feel they are treated badly,” Mr. Posé said. “This happens in small and large form in Germany.”FRANKFURT — The supervisory board of Deutsche Post named Frank Appel, head of its logistics and international mail division, as chief executive on Monday, succeeding Klaus Zumwinkel, who resigned during a tax evasion inquiry.Mr. Appel, 46, has a contract running until Oct. 31, 2012. The supervisory body also agreed to extend the contract of the chief financial officer, John Allan, by two years until the end of 2010, the company said.'"
"'08-02-19,'0','Speaking without notes and with both hands in the pockets of his warm-up jacket, Gagné said: “I’m just here to help the Milwaukee Brewers get to the World Series and get to the playoffs. That’s all I really care about. And since 2004, Major League Baseball has done everything in their power to clean up the game and I think they’ve done a great job. Right now I just want to go forward, and I’m thinking Major League Baseball is ready to go forward and hopefully all the fans are ready to do that.”Gagné followed his statement in English, in which he never mentioned the Mitchell report, with a French version that was slightly more revealing. “I don’t want to look back,” Gagné said. “The Mitchell report did that and it wasn’t fun.”Gagné’s silence the past two months had not been well received in Canada, according to Daniel Cloutier, who writes for Le Journal de Montreal. “For a lot of people, it was like an admission of guilt,” he said.No admission of guilt by Gagné was forthcoming Monday, much to the seeming consternation of the French-Canadian reporters. They packed up their cameras and notebooks and left after Gagné finished his statements.When Gagné met with the news media again after a workout that included throwing off the mound for 10 minutes, he was forthright. Of course, the topic then was limited to baseball.He held himself fully accountable for his struggles at the end of last season as a setup man for the Boston Red Sox after years of being used a closer.Gagné did not blame any residual effects of back and elbow injuries for his lackluster numbers with the Red Sox: a 2-2 record and a 6.75 earned run average. His injuries had limited him to 16 appearances in the 2005 and 2006 seasons. He also did not blame the unfamiliarity of the setup routine or of his surroundings or of his circumstances; his move to Boston was the first time he had been traded in his nine-year major league career.“It’s all excuses, I guess,” Gagné said. “I just didn’t perform.”Gagné was statistically the top closer in baseball between 2002 and 2004, when he played for the Dodgers. The Brewers signed him to a one-year, $10 million contract three days before the Mitchell report was released.In addition to obtaining the 32-year-old Gagné, Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin also traded for the former Mets reliever Guillermo Mota, who served a 50-game suspension at the beginning of last season for using performance-enhancing drugs. And he signed outfielder Mike Cameron, who was suspended for the first 25 games of this season after a second positive test for a banned stimulant.“We looked at their backgrounds, how they were as teammates, their player skills, and we were comfortable with what we found,” Melvin said. He added: “In regards to everything baseball’s gone through, we feel that everybody is on level ground now and people are held accountable. If anything happens from here on out, they’re held accountable, whereas before there wasn’t the testing.”The Mitchell report, and the Balco scandal before it, were the vehicles, Melvin said, “to take things seriously and get things put in place.”Brewers Manager Ned Yost also spoke as if he believed baseball had put the steroid era behind. “I think we’re well on the road to getting past that,” he said.When asked about Gagné’s link with performance-enhancing drugs, Yost said: “This was years and years ago. It wasn’t like it happened yesterday. So as far as I’m concerned, it’s a done deal. It’s over and we move forward.”After an off-season that Gagné described as “really stressful,” he is eager to move forward. After practice Monday, he said, “That’s why I’m pretty happy about being back on the field.”'"
"'08-02-19,'0','“His character was forged in the crucible of war,” Mr. Bush said. “His commitment to America is beyond any doubt. But most importantly, he has the right values and experience to guide our nation forward at this historic moment.”The endorsement marked another turning point in the complex, evolving relationship between Senator McCain, of Arizona, and the Bush family. From his bitter defeat at George W. Bush’s hands in 2000, to their reconciliation, which sometimes led independents to complain that he had allied himself too closely with the president, Mr. McCain has sometimes walked a fine line in the relationship.But if some advisers to Mr. McCain have suggested that he would be careful about when and how he would appear with the president, Mr. McCain himself was enthusiastic about the prospect when asked about it on Monday.“I’d be honored to have President George Bush’s support, his endorsement; I’d be honored to be anywhere with him under any circumstances,” he said.“Are there issues that we are in disagreement on?” he said. “Of course. And again, obviously, the American people will judge who they vote for by the qualities of the candidate.”While former President Bush proclaimed himself “happy to help this remarkable patriot carry our party’s banner forward,” he made a point of emphasizing that he was not calling on Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, to leave the race.“Of course, having been a candidate in both a losing and winning effort for the G.O.P. nomination, let me stress that I have not come here to tell any other candidate what to do,” he said, not naming Mr. Huckabee.Mr. Bush called the suggestion that Mr. McCain is not conservative enough “absurd.” But since Mr. Bush was often viewed with suspicion himself from conservatives in the Republican Party, he came prepared for the question.“I went to the Reagan diaries,” Mr. Bush said, “and let me just read you a couple of quotes, because I remember Ronald Reagan, when I was his vice president, after he became president, getting the same kind of criticism from the ultra-right.”Mr. Bush read one quotation from 1982 in which President Reagan complained that a leading conservative had written about his “betrayal of the conservative cause,” and another in which he complained that he was being painted “as a kind of turncoat conservative.”“You know, you’ve been around the track, you hear these criticisms,” Mr. Bush said. “And I think they’re grossly unfair.”Referring to Mr. McCain, Mr. Bush added: “He’s got a record that everybody can analyze in the Senate, a sound, conservative record. And yet he’s not above reaching out to the other side. So I hear these criticisms, and, Barbara knows, I get a little bit annoyed about them, frankly.”Mr. McCain said he was honored by Mr. Bush’s support.“This president is viewed with respect and affection by all Republicans,” Mr. McCain said. “I’m proud to have his support, and I think that our effort to continue to unite the party will be enhanced today dramatically by President Bush’s words, and I am proud and grateful and I hope that I can measure up to the honorable service that President Bush has rendered this country.”'"
"'08-02-19,'0','DOHA, Qatar — Qatar is buying shares in Credit Suisse and plans to spend as much as $15 billion on European and American bank stocks over the next year, according to its prime minister.“We have a relation with Credit Suisse, and we bought some of the stock from the market, actually,” said Sheik Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, who is also chief executive of the Qatar Investment Authority. “But I cannot say what percentage because still we are in the process.”Qatar, which has a population of fewer than one million, holds 1.3 percent of global crude oil reserves.Sovereign wealth funds in the gulf, whose coffers are swelling from high oil prices, as well as counterparts in Asia, have been snapping up stakes in banks battered by losses from subprime mortgages.In the last six months, sovereign wealth funds made investments in Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Citigroup alone has received $14.5 billion from investors, including Singapore and Kuwait, in the last two months.“Subprime losses are clearly not confined to U.S. banks, and European banks are seeking funding,” said Giyas Gokkent, head of research at the National Bank of Abu Dhabi. “Gulf funds have surpluses to spend and are looking for long-term appreciation. If investments help develop their domestic financial markets, too, so much the better.”'"
"'08-02-19,'0','Nowhere in the nation is wood as beloved as it is here in New England, where winter conjures images of warming up around a potbelly stove. But in the last decade or so, as the price of oil and propane seemed to rise less sharply, devotion to wood stoves waned.In 1993, 3.1 million homes used wood for heat; the number dropped to 2 million in 2001, according to census data provided by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy.But now residents like Dina Benoit of Orleans, Vt., are going back.When Ms. Benoit moved into her home in 1994, it had an old wood stove. Tired of hauling logs through the house and feeding it every few hours, Ms. Benoit switched to a propane heater in 1998. The propane, however, got too expensive, and Ms. Benoit returned to wood. “I didn’t want to become dependent on kerosene or an oil supplier,” said Ms. Benoit, who bought a wood stove and said it cost $600 to heat her house last year. “It’s just so nice to stand next to; it has more of a personality than a regular heater.”The owners of M and M Forestry and Land Management of Brownington, Vt., say they have been delivering more firewood than ever this year.“Generally, say they burn a cord of wood a year, this year they are already on their second cord,” one of the owners, Michael Moore, said. “Some people are planning on burning two or three times more wood than they have in the past.”Statistics from the last survey about the use of wood for heat, conducted in 2006, are not yet public, but the number of households that report using wood as their primary source of heat is expected to jump sharply, said Marie LaRiviere of the Energy Information Administration.Chris Foster of Fisher’s Hearth and Home in Roseburg, Ore., said sales of wood and pellet stoves were up 65 percent in the last year.“Sales go up because of the economy,” Mr. Foster said. “If the economy is good, people go to gas. If the economy is sluggish, people go to wood and pellet stoves.”Jack Murphy of Winchendon, Mass., has long burned wood in his home, but he was tired of buying and splitting the wood, feeding the stove and cleaning the ash. He switched to a pellet stove last year.“Wood heat is dirty, it’s labor intensive, it messes up your yard and your floors when you carry it in the house,” Mr. Murphy said. “With pellets, I put them in my truck, and I bring my entire energy for the year home in one trip. I have two month’s worth just on my back porch.”Air pollution is still a major concern, particularly with wood boilers. A 2006 report from the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, a nonprofit association of Northeast air quality agencies, found that average particulate emissions from one outdoor wood boiler equaled that of 22 wood stoves, 205 oil furnaces or as many as 8,000 natural gas furnaces.The Environmental Protection Agency has set clean-burning performance standards for wood stoves manufactured after 1988, and many communities, including Truckee, Calif., and Dayton, Ohio, have programs that allow owners of older stoves to turn them in and receive rebates or coupons to buy a new wood stove.Sally Markos of the Lane Regional Air Protection Agency in Springfield, Ore., said that air pollution from stoves had gone down since the 1988 regulations took effect, but that it was still a problem. On Jan. 24 the authority asked residents to refrain temporarily from burning wood because tests showed the particulate level to be extremely high.“The air pollution will get worse on days that people are feeling the economic pinch,” Ms. Markos said.The E.P.A. developed similar standards for outdoor wood boilers last year, but unlike the stove standards, they are not mandatory.Many counties and towns, however, have banned or restricted the use of wood boilers. Last year Vermont became the first state to set emissions limits on new wood boilers.Air pollution is not the only concern. New Hampshire’s state fire marshal, J. William Degnan, said that heating systems were the top cause of fire in the state, and that many local departments were reporting an increase in fires from wood stoves.“They’re seeing a rise in chimney fires,” Mr. Degnan said. “Many have fired up stoves they haven’t used for years and haven’t been maintained. There’s creosote in the chimney, and some were improper installations, just a tinderbox waiting to happen.”Randy Swartz of Orleans, Vt., said he spent months researching safety and prices and would not go back to oil. He spent more than $6,000 last fall to buy a new wood boiler that heats his home and water.Mr. Swartz, the maintenance manager at the Cabot Creamery, said he had to buy heating oil at work, and seeing the price of crude oil rise from $18 a barrel when he started his job a decade ago to almost $100 a barrel now made him want to change his personal energy consumption.'"

"'08-02-19,'0','Paul McCartney and Heather Mills had their chance, and now it is up to a judge to determine a divorce agreement and financial settlement for them, The Associated Press reported. As legal teams left the Royal Courts of Justice in London on Monday after no deal was reached between the parties, Mr. McCartney’s lawyer, Nicholas Mostyn, said that Justice Hugh Bennett had reserved his ruling and would spend several weeks working out a settlement. Ms. Mills smiled as she departed. Mr. McCartney did not attend. The terms of a settlement will not become public unless it is challenged in the Court of Appeal or if one of the parties elects to disclose its contents.

"'08-02-19,'0','In “Mackenzie Blue,” on the other hand, a new series aimed at 8- to 12-year-old girls from HarperCollins Children’s Books, product placement is very much a part of the plan. Tina Wells, chief executive of Buzz Marketing Group, which advises consumer product companies on how to sell to teenagers and preteenagers, will herself be the author of titles in the series filled with references to brands. She plans to offer the companies that make them the chance to sponsor the books.Ms. Wells said she would not change a brand that she felt was at the core of a particular character’s identity merely to cement a marketing partnership. “Mackenzie loves Converse,” she said, referring to the series’s heroine and the popular sneaker brand she favors. “Does Converse want to work with us? I have no clue. But that doesn’t negate the fact that Mackenzie loves Converse.”However, when asked what she would do if another sneaker company like Nike (one of her clients) wanted to sponsor the books, she said, “Maybe another character could become a Nike girl.”Ms. Wells, 27, who founded Buzz Marketing when she was just 16, is also seeking a tie-in with a music label to produce a soundtrack for the books. She said she was also interested in enticing companies to sponsor the books in exchange for references to their philanthropic initiatives related to themes like global warming that she plans to address in the story lines; one idea would be to include resource pages at the back of the books.So, for example, one of the characters in the series, Ally, is the daughter of journalists who end up in the Sudan in one of the books. Ms. Wells suggested she could work with Procter & Gamble, which sponsors projects to donate feminine hygiene products to girls in Africa.Susan Katz, publisher of HarperCollins Children’s Books, said she was not concerned about a possible backlash against corporate sponsorship in books aimed at such a young audience. “If you look at Web sites, general media or television, corporate sponsorship or some sort of advertising is totally embedded in the world that tweens live in,” Ms. Katz said. “It gives us another opportunity for authenticity.”As for “Cathy’s Book,” David Steinberger, president of Perseus, said the criticism of the Cover Girl relationship did not affect sales. According to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks about 70 percent of sales, the book has sold 43,000 copies in hardcover. “ ‘Cathy’s Book’ surpassed our expectations and hit best-seller lists in every country,” Mr. Steinberger said, “because teens responded to the writing, the graphics and the interactivity.”Mr. Weisman, an author of “Cathy’s Book,” said in an e-mail message on Friday that he had only just informed an executive with Procter & Gamble that the Cover Girl references had been removed from the paperback. “There was no expectation that the cross promotion would extend past the hardcover launch/ edition,” Mr. Weisman wrote. He added that he and the executive were discussing future marketing relationships. A spokeswoman for beinggirl.com confirmed that discussions were continuing.Mr. Stewart and Mr. Weisman have written a follow-up, called “Cathy’s Key,” which comes out in May. While there are mentions of some brands like TV Guide and BlackBerry, there are no marketing tie-ins, Mr. Stewart said. And this time some of the brands are just made up. Referring to a can of breath-freshening spray that plays a role in the plot, Mr. Stewart said, “To the best of my knowledge, there is no such thing as Cool Peppermint Mouth Mist.”'"
"'08-02-19,'0','Probiotics, the potentially beneficial bacteria and yeasts available as diet supplements and in some foods, may not be as helpful as widely believed. A new study suggests that under certain circumstances, they can be deadly.Researchers studied 296 patients at risk for severe pancreatitis, a potentially lethal inflammation of the pancreas. Each was randomly assigned to receive either a commercially available probiotic or an identical-looking placebo. All patients were otherwise given conventional treatment.There was no significant difference between the two groups in severity of illness at the start of the trial. But while 31 percent of the probiotics group required intensive care, only 24 percent of the placebo group needed it. Eighteen percent of those who took probiotics, but only 10 percent of the others, required surgical intervention. In the probiotics group 24 people died, a death rate more than twice that of those given the placebo.Several smaller studies have associated probiotics with a reduction of infections. But this study, published online Thursday in The Lancet, was the largest randomized, double-blinded trial of its kind, and the authors found no other reason for the harmful effects.'"
"'08-02-19,'0','Bud Light did not exist in 1976, so the modest product placement in the film is for Budweiser and Busch beers.The Moon character wears a jersey that is too tight and shorts that are too tiny. He has made enough money from his single hit song, “Love Me Sexy,” to become the playing owner-coach of the Tropics, a franchise refugee in Flint, Mich., from Jacksonville, Fla., or Juarez, Mexico (an unsettled part of the back story).“But we liked the idea that he grew up in gritty Flint, in the shadow of Motown,” said Kent Alterman, the film’s director.In the Bud Light ad, Moon goes off-script several times in his lusty descriptions of the beer before settling on saying that it “refreshes the palate and the loins.”“Any time you have someone of his popularity so closely tied to your brand, it helps both,” Lachky said. “It gives us an association with him, and gives Will’s camp great pre-publicity for the film. It’s a match made in heaven for us.”Like Bud Light, Old Spice is marketing “Semi-Pro” on television and on its Web site, with variations on a theme of manly perspiration. In one ad, Ferrell combs his armpit hairs; in another, as a “sweat scientist,” he says: “There’s one thing I know: that perspiration serves no purpose, much like the appendix, man nipples and most of the human brain.”Companies like Anheuser-Busch and Procter & Gamble, which makes Old Spice Pro Strength, the new anti-perspirant Moon is promoting, know that Ferrell’s inspired silliness has led to nine-figure grosses.“Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,” his Nascar parody, and “Blades of Glory,” his takeoff on figure skating, brought in a combined $308 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo, a tracking service.In focus groups convened before Sports Illustrated made its deal with Ferrell, young males said “get the guys out” of the swimsuit issue, said Andrew Judelson, the chief marketing officer for the magazine.They didn’t want famous athletes posing with their swimsuited girlfriends or wives, as in the past, but they didn’t mind seeing the right male.“We asked if we got a funny or relevant guy who resonated with them, like Will Ferrell, and they said he’s funny and he’s in movies we love going to,” Judelson said.Time Warner owns the magazine and New Line Cinema, which made “Semi-Pro.”New Line had a patron saint in its midst when the screenwriter Scot Armstrong suggested the film. Alterman, the director and an executive vice president of the studio, was a smart-mouthed teenage Spurs fan who riled opposing players from a close-to-courtside seat he had, thanks to his father and uncle owning a share of the team for $600 to $700.“Scot came to us after doing a lot of writing on ‘Elf,’ and had an idea about a comedy about the A.B.A.,” Alterman said. “That’s all I needed to hear. I had no idea it would turn into a real project.”Alterman said everything — uniforms, team logos and the look of the arenas — was “meticulously researched.”His task was aided by Arthur Hundhausen, a Denver Nuggets fan and the creator of the remembertheaba.com Web site, who advised them on what the courts, scoreboards, press table and locker rooms looked like.“It was like having a second job, because I was talking to their costume designer, their set designer, their prop person all at the same time,” Hundhausen said in an e-mail message.One authentic element cut out of the film was a brief documentary overview of the league, narrated by Bob Costas, the last play-by-play announcer of the Spirits of St. Louis.“The idea was to catch the uninitiated up in 45 seconds,” said Costas, whose movie credits include “Pootie Tang,” but, “apparently it didn’t play.” He will call the action when Ferrell and a co-star, Woody Harrelson, visit the “Today” show next week.'"

Essentially, someone pays me to visit some of the greatest golf courses on the planet. It’s a tough job, but somebody has to do it.Like other road warriors, I have closely followed the travails of domestic and international airlines. I really want to know how these companies operate.Since I’m interested in airlines and fly about 200,000 miles a year, I was approached by the marketing department of Southwest Airlines to attend a cocktail party near Baltimore Washington International Airport. I didn’t have anything else to do that evening, so I figured why not? And so began my journey into the world of modeling.At the meeting, the marketing people asked me what I liked about Southwest. I didn’t shut up for nearly 90 minutes since I felt that as a business traveler their airline “got it,” while others fell way behind in terms of making things easier for frequent fliers and other passengers.As I was talking, you could see the smiles on the faces of the marketing team. They must have thought I was the rarest of creatures: a happy traveler.'"
"'08-02-19,'0','“Everything in the concept has been built, is operating or has a close cousin that is operating,” Dr. Martin said.The Los Alamos proposal does not violate any laws of physics, and other scientists, like George A. Olah, a Nobel Prize-winning chemist at the University of Southern California, and Klaus Lackner, a professor of geophysics at Columbia University, have independently suggested similar ideas. Dr. Martin said he and Dr. Kubic had worked out their concept in more detail than previous proposals.There is, however, a major caveat that explains why no one has built a carbon-dioxide-to-gasoline factory: it requires a great deal of energy.To deal with that problem, the Los Alamos scientists say they have developed a number of innovations, including a new electrochemical process for detaching the carbon dioxide after it has been absorbed into the potassium carbonate solution. The process has been tested in Dr. Kubic’s garage, in a simple apparatus that looks like mutant Tupperware.Even with those improvements, providing the energy to produce gasoline on a commercial scale — say, 750,000 gallons a day — would require a dedicated power plant, preferably a nuclear one, the scientists say.According to their analysis, their concept, which would cost about $5 billion to build, could produce gasoline at an operating cost of $1.40 a gallon and would turn economically viable when the price at the pump hits $4.60 a gallon, taking into account construction costs and other expenses in getting the gas to the consumer. With some additional technological advances, the break-even price would drop to $3.40 a gallon, they said.A nuclear reactor is not required technologically. The same chemical processes could also be powered by solar panels, for instance, but the economics become far less favorable.Dr. Martin and Dr. Kubic will present their Green Freedom concept on Wednesday at the Alternative Energy Now conference in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. They plan a simple demonstration within a year and a larger prototype within a couple of years after that.A commercial nuclear-powered gasoline factory would have to jump some high hurdles before it could be built, and thousands of them would be needed to fully replace petroleum, but this part of the global warming problem has no easy solutions.In the efforts to reduce humanity’s emissions of carbon dioxide, now nearing 30 billion metric tons a year, most of the attention so far has focused on large stationary sources, like power plants where, conceptually at least, one could imagine a shift from fuels that emit carbon dioxide — coal and natural gas — to those that do not — nuclear, solar and wind. Another strategy, known as carbon capture and storage, would continue the use of fossil fuels but trap the carbon dioxide and then pipe it underground where it would not affect the climate.But to stabilize carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere would require drastic cuts in emissions, and similar solutions do not exist for small, mobile sources of carbon dioxide. Nuclear and solar-powered cars do not seem plausible anytime soon.Three solutions have been offered: hydrogen-powered fuel cells, electric cars and biofuels. Biofuels like ethanol are gasoline substitutes produced from plants like corn, sugar cane or switch grass, and the underlying idea is the same as Green Freedom. Plants absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, balancing out the carbon dioxide emitted when they are burned. But growing crops for fuel takes up wide swaths of land.Hydrogen-powered cars emit no carbon dioxide, but producing hydrogen, by splitting water or some other chemical reaction, requires copious energy, and if that energy comes from coal-fired power plants, then the problem has not been solved. Hydrogen is also harder to store and move than gasoline and would require an overhaul of the world’s energy infrastructure.Electric cars also push the carbon dioxide problem to the power plant. And electric cars have typically been limited to a range of tens of miles as opposed to the hundreds of miles that can be driven on a tank of gas.Gasoline, it turns out, is an almost ideal fuel (except that it produces 19.4 pounds of carbon dioxide per gallon). It is easily transported, and it generates more energy per volume than most alternatives. If it can be made out of carbon dioxide in the air, the Los Alamos concept may mean there is little reason to switch, after all. The concept can also be adapted for jet fuel; for jetliners, neither hydrogen nor batteries seem plausible alternatives.“This is the only one that I have seen that addresses all of the concerns that are out there right now,” Dr. Martin said.Other scientists said the Los Alamos proposal perhaps looked promising but could not evaluate it fully because the details had not been published.“It’s definitely worth pursuing,” said Martin I. Hoffert, a professor of physics at New York University. “It’s not that new an idea. It has a couple of pieces to it that are interesting.”'"

"'08-02-20,'1','Falling rates tend to weaken the dollar, and crude futures offer a hedge against a falling dollar. Also, oil futures bought and sold in dollars are more attractive to foreign investors when the dollar is falling. In the moments after the Fed released its forecast, oil prices spiked sharply higher.Earlier, crude prices fluctuated in part because of low trading volumes. Trading in the expiring March contract was about 10 percent of the level of trading in April crude oil, which will become the front-month contract on Thursday. When volumes are low, price moves can be exaggerated. April crude settled unchanged at $99.70 a barrel after rising as high as $100.86 earlier.Oil prices are still within the range of inflation-adjusted highs set in early 1980. Depending on how the adjustment is calculated, $38 a barrel then would be worth $96 to $103 or more today.Two new economic reports Wednesday suggested the economy is cooling.The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index, a measure of inflation, rose by 0.4 percent last month, more than economists expected.The Commerce Department, meanwhile, said construction of new homes and apartments rose by 0.8 percent in January, but that applications for building permits, an indicator of future activity, fell by 3 percent.The reports come a week after the Energy Department, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the International Energy Agency all lowered their oil demand growth forecasts for this year.But the prospect that the Fed will reduce rates proved too strong, feeding a new buying frenzy, analysts said.“This is all about momentum,” driving prices higher right now, Mr. Flynn said.Despite the return of $100 oil, there are also concerns that high oil prices — and the higher gasoline and heating oil prices they spawn — are sowing the seeds of their own destruction by contributing to the economic slowdown.“The price gains raise questions about their sustainability in the face of eroding fundamental strength,” said Antoine Halff, an analyst at Newedge USA LLC, in a research note.At the pump, gas prices rose 2.1 cents to a national average of $3.053 a gallon Wednesday, according to AAA and the Oil Price Information Service. In its weekly survey, the Energy Department said regular gasoline rose 8.2 cents last week to an average of $3.042 a gallon. Retail gas prices, which typically lag the futures market, are following oil higher. Analysts and the Energy Department expect prices to peak this spring well above last May’s record $3.227 a gallon.Other energy futures fell Wednesday. March gasoline slipped 1.79 cents to settle at $2.5852 a gallon on the Nymex, while March heating oil fell 0.68 cent to settle at $2.7546 a gallon.'"
"'08-02-20,'1','It is a familiar theme, but Mrs. Clinton delivered it with fresh intensity after the crushing defeats in Wisconsin and Hawaii on Tuesday.Mrs. Clinton spent Wednesday morning in New York raising money before flying to Texas to campaign. Voters in Texas and Ohio, along with Rhode Island and Vermont, go to the polls in less than two weeks in contests that Democratic strategists say Mrs. Clinton must win if she is to have any hope of capturing the nomination.Mr. Obama sought to counter Mrs. Clinton’s charges at a campaign appearance on Wednesday afternoon in Dallas, saying “it is time to move beyond the politics of yesterday.”“Today, Senator Clinton told us that there was a choice in this race and you know, I couldn’t agree with her more,” Mr. Obama said. “But contrary to what she’s been saying, it’s not a choice between speeches and solutions, it’s a choice between a politics that offers more of the same divisions and distractions that didn’t work in South Carolina and didn’t work in Wisconsin and will not work in Texas.”“Or a new politics of common sense, of common purpose, of shared sacrifice and shared prosperity,” he said. “It’s the choice between having a debate with John McCain about who has the most experience in Washington or having a debate about who’s most likely to change Washington.”One day after victories in Wisconsin and Hawaii, Mr. Obama drew about 17,000 people to a rally at the Reunion Arena in downtown Dallas. While the primary is on March 4, early voting began on Tuesday and Mr. Obama encouraged his supporters to cast their ballots soon.“As this movement continues, as this campaign builds strength, there are those who will tell you not to believe,” Mr. Obama said. “There are those who will tell you it can’t be done.”Saying he offered voters a chance to break from the policies of the past years, including the war in Iraq and the current economic situation, Mr. Obama said the race was a choice “that is not just about turning a page on the politics of the past but of turning the page on the policies of the past.”David Plouffe, the campaign manager for Mr. Obama, said that Mr. Obama had amassed a 159-delegate lead over Mrs. Clinton, based on his campaign tally. Following a win in Wisconsin by 17 percentage points, Mr. Plouffe said Mrs. Clinton would need to win in Texas and Ohio by double-digits to gain an edge in the fight for delegates.“We have opened up a big and meaningful delegate lead,” Mr. Plouffe said, speaking in a conference call with reporters. “They are going to have to win landslides to reverse it.”Reflecting Mr. Obama’s lead on the Democratic side, Mr. McCain focused his criticism on him during a news conference in Columbus on Wednesday. He pounded Mr. Obama yet again for his commitment in writing a year ago to accept public funds for the general election about $85 million for each candidate — if the Republican nominee did the same. In doing so, Mr. Obama would have to surrender a phenomenal advantage in fund-raising and accept the limits of public financing.Mr. McCain, who was the only other presidential candidate to sign on to the pledge, was responding to a column by Mr. Obama in USA Today on Wednesday in which the candidate wrote that he remained open to public financing, but that he was concerned about the spending of outside groups on behalf of candidates and that he wanted to reach a “meaningful agreement” with whoever is the Republican nominee. But he did not expect, he wrote, “that a workable, effective agreement will be reached overnight.”As conditions for such an agreement, Mr. Obama wrote that candidates “will have to commit to discouraging cheating by their supporters; to refusing fund-raising help by outside groups; and to limiting their own parties to legal forms of involvement.”Mr. Obama has broken all political fund-raising records in this election he has taken in more than $150 million so far, $36 million in January alone, and Mr. McCain’s advisers have privately questioned why he would disarm himself of that advantage and not spend the prodigious amounts he has raised on his own. Mr. McCain, who raised $12 million in January, appears to be preparing for that possibility, but in the meantime is attacking Mr. Obama as someone who could not keep his word and should bear the responsibility for breaking the pledge.If Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton do not accept public financing in the general election, Mr. McCain said, “I obviously would have to re-evaluate.”As the war of words continued throughout the day, Bill Burton, Mr. Obama’s national campaign spokesman, e-mailed reporters with the retort that Mr. McCain, who has built a large part of his political persona around limiting the amount of money spent on campaigns, has not accepted public financing for the primaries and caucuses. On that score, neither has Mr. Obama.'"
"'08-02-20,'1','Just as important as the physical makeover, designers and school administrators said they hoped the overhaul would wipe away a dark emblem of this city and the nightmare of one of its most high-profile killings. No monuments will memorialize the dead. It will still be a playground, but for the most part, it will cease to be what it had become.“It’s a new beginning,” said James Harvey, whose son Dashon, 20, was shot and killed in the schoolyard on Aug. 4. “Lives will be built at that site again. We’ll look there for new hope,” he said in a telephone interview.Mr. Harvey and parents of the other victims were consulted on the plans, he said. A memorial for his son and the other victims is being built in a park across the street from the school.Part of the old playground, for the time being, will remain: a low wall where Mr. Harvey’s son; Iofemi Hightower, 20; and Terrance Aeriel, 18, were forced to kneel, and then shot and killed at close range. A young woman, Natasha Aeriel, 19 at the time, survived the attack.The wall supports the parking lot, explained Brian Clemson, a landscape architect with Hatch Mott MacDonald who worked with the students to design the playground. Eventually, he said, an extension of the school building will cover the wall and part of the parking lot it supports.For a long time, Cordel Elcock, 13, one of the design team members, said he did not want to sit on the bleachers by that wall. In the weeks following the murders, the bleachers were where mourners placed flowers and pictures, creating the backdrop for television news reports about the tragedy. “It was sad,” Cordel said.He and the other children channeled their fears into the design process, telling their adult collaborators that they needed a playground that was both peaceful and relaxing.For four months, the group met once or twice a week. “We were teaching them about landscape architecture,” Mr. Clemson said. “They were incredibly bright. They understood their roles as young citizens.” They told Mr. Clemson, for example, that the playground for younger children needed to be separated from the playground for older children, to keep everyone safe.They helped design a jungle gym, to replace ones that had burned down years ago. Senith Thiruchelvam, 11, wanted a football field. But, he learned, “it would have taken up the whole playground.” They settled for a smaller playing field, and basketball courts that could double as a tennis court.Louidgi Colin, 14, said trash cans were important. And Epiphany Pinto, 12, was excited to build the learning garden, where the students could grow strawberries and apples.Newark is quieter than it was last summer, and by Tuesday night, the city had gone 37 days without a homicide, the longest stretch since 1963, when there were no homicides for 40 days. Billboards — “Stop the Killings in Newark Now” — that had been plastered around the city by the local teachers union have been taken down.The men and boys accused of the murders are awaiting trial, and Mr. Harvey said that the killings were a turning point for the city. “As a community, as a people, we needed to say enough is enough,” he said.More than two dozen people attended Tuesday’s community board meeting, where the students showed a power point presentation of their design process.There were a few questions from the audience, about upkeep of the garden, and when it would be completed. One man asked about security; in August, security cameras trained on the schoolyard had not been working.Colleen Graves, a program manager for the Trust for Public Land, said there would be more security cameras, and that construction should be completed in September. There was applause for the children, who by all accounts, had fully grasped the importance of their work.A local councilman, Ronald C. Rice, praised them. “When things are broken,” he said, “When things are not nurtured, tragedy can happen.”'"
"'08-02-20,'1','Is there room in the well-appointed house of Martha for another larger-than-life name brand?Martha Stewart and her new partner, the television chef Emeril Lagasse, are betting that there is. Several pieces of Mr. Lagasse’s culinary franchise were sold to Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia on Tuesday for $45 million in cash and $5 million in stock, the first major acquisition by Ms. Stewart’s media and merchandising company.Industry analysts said the deal would enable Mr. Lagasse to “kick it up a notch” by benefiting from Martha Stewart Living’s brand expertise.In the transaction, Martha Stewart Living will acquire the rights to Mr. Lagasse’s television shows, cookbooks, Web site and licensed products. His 11 restaurants will remain privately owned. In an interview, Ms. Stewart said the two brands would be compatible.“His tastes are very different from mine, as is his food, and I think that’s good,” she said. “Being complementary and different is better than being competitive.”Ms. Stewart is thought unlikely to develop an electric grill anytime soon, but it would be a natural brand extension for Mr. Lagasse. In addition, the chef’s brand stands to gain from Martha Stewart Living’s experience developing product lines for Kmart, Macy’s and Costco.'"

"'08-02-20,'1','Most contributors to political campaigns are probably unaware that their money, under federal and state laws, can be used for all sorts of purposes. It can be channeled to other candidates, stored away for a future campaign or spent on unrelated expenses. A prominent New Jersey politician recently tried to use campaign funds to pay his defense lawyers. The state’s election officials were right to turn him down.Wayne R. Bryant, a former Democratic state senator, has been charged by federal prosecutors with using his position to get a no-show job at the state’s medical college. Prosecutors say he showed his gratitude by directing millions of dollars in grants to the school. Mr. Bryant, a former chair of the appropriations committee, who apparently knows no shame, asked the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission for permission to pay his legal bills from his campaign coffers.The request is unacceptable on its face. When people contribute to a candidate, they are being asked to support the democratic process. It is unlikely that they are expecting their dollars to help their preferred candidate fend off federal corruption charges.Elected officials have to be able to raise money for legal defense funds. When they do, however, they should tell prospective contributors that their money will be used to pay lawyers’ bills.Mr. Bryant isn’t the only politician willing to take such advantage of his contributors. At the federal level, former Representative Randy Cunningham, Republican of California, used campaign funds to help pay for his defense against bribery charges. More recently, Senator Larry Craig, Republican of Idaho, used campaign money to pay lawyers’ fees related to his well-known encounter at an airport men’s room.Mr. Bryant argued that his criminal charges arose out of his work as an officeholder. But it is a very dim view of public service to say that contributors should expect that a candidate may naturally face criminal charges. New Jersey’s commission, to its credit, refused to go along, but this should not be a gray area. Lawmakers in New Jersey and in Washington should expressly bar the use of campaign contributions to pay legal bills.'"
"'08-02-20,'1','Yahoo said on Tuesday that its board was continuing to review all strategic options.With Microsoft’s stock having fallen 13.6 percent since the offer was announced on Feb. 1, the nominal value of the deal has also declined, to just above $41 billion. Many large Yahoo shareholders, including Bill Miller of the mutual fund manager Legg Mason, have said that Microsoft must raise its bid to strike a deal.But raising the $31-a-share offer would cost Microsoft $1.4 billion more for every dollar added.“We sent them a letter and said we think that’s a fair offer,” Bill Gates, Microsoft’s chairman, told The Associated Press on Monday. “There’s nothing that’s gone on other than us stating that we think it’s a fair offer. They should take a hard look at it.”By contrast, waging a proxy fight to oust Yahoo’s directors is comparatively cheaper. Much of the cost involves the hiring of a proxy solicitor and preparing mailings for Yahoo shareholders.Some analysts said that if Microsoft moved too aggressively, it might drive off Yahoo employees. The new severance plan is intended “to help retain the employees, help maintain a stable work environment and provide certain economic benefits to the employees,” Yahoo said in a regulatory filing.The enhanced benefits include continuation of an employee’s base salary, as well as dental and health benefits, for 4 to 24 months, depending on an employee’s job level, the company said in its filing. They also include accelerated vesting for all stock options, restricted stock units and other equity-based awards, and reimbursement for outplacement services up to a maximum of $15,000.Yahoo’s top executives will receive their base salaries for 24 months and be eligible for the maximum $15,000 amount in outplacement-benefits reimbursements.More than 4 in 5 Fortune 200 companies have similar — and sometimes more generous — enhanced severance agreements for top executives after a merger or acquisition, according to Equilar, an executive compensation research firm. But those types of agreements rarely extend to all employees, according to Equilar.Just last week, Yahoo began laying off about 1,000 of its approximately 14,000 workers and said it would take a $20 million to $25 million in pretax cash charges to account for severance packages.Microsoft repeated statements it made earlier that it, too, was interested in retaining important Yahoo employees. In its Jan. 31 offer letter to Yahoo’s board, the company said it intended “to offer significant retention packages to your engineers, key leaders and employees across all disciplines.”'"
"'08-02-20,'1','“All you have to do is beat one guy,” Woods said. “Just beat the guy you’re playing against, no matter how.”That head-to-head aspect of match play is one reason for its visceral appeal. Golf, in effect, becomes like a civilized form of boxing or dueling with pistols at 20 paces. Without the injuries, of course. Here the only bruises are to the players’ egos, and they are assuaged by the $40,000 check for a first-round loss.“It’s kind of do or die here,” said Adam Scott, a 27-year-old Australian who analyzed the differences between the first round of a regular stroke-play event and match play. “Even if I don’t play well on Thursday, I can get myself back into the tournament by Sunday, whereas here you’d better bring it every day.“Otherwise likely you’re probably going home because you’ve got the top 65 guys in the world here.”The finality of elimination in match play brings a pain that lingers, regardless of the round in which it occurs. Scott was one and done last year, losing to Shaun Micheel in 21 holes in the first round. In 2003, Scott lost in the semifinals to Woods.What does he consider his worst defeat?“Losing to Tiger that one year,” he said, five years later.Half the contestants will be gone by Wednesday, and the field will be whittled by 50 percent each day until only two golfers are left standing. Along the way, there will be some compelling theater out on the 7,466 yards of the Gallery. The dream scenario of sponsors and fans is that Woods and Mickelson will work their way through their sections of the draw to face each other Sunday.That would be the first time in the history of the event when No. 1 played No. 2 in the finals. The nearest thing to that came in the finals of 2004, when the No. 1, Woods, defeated the No. 3, Davis Love, 3 and 2.Woods is on a mission. He has four straight victories, the last at the Dubai Desert Classic. He has not lost since finishing second at the Deutsche Bank almost six months ago. He has the stated objective of winning the Grand Slam this year. If he wants to stay undefeated in a year for the first time since he went 36-0 in junior golf when he was 11, he will have to get past J. B. Holmes in the first match and then beat whoever wins the Mike Weir-Arron Oberholser match. Looming down the line on Woods’s side of the draw is Rory Sabbatini. If he and Woods win three matches, they will play each other Saturday.There are many ifs in any scenario predicting how the matches will unfold. One that is certain is this: There will be some casualties among the favored players in the first round. No first round in the nine-year history of the event has had fewer than 11 upsets. The folks at Accenture, who have signed on through 2010 as the sponsors, are definitely hoping there is not a repeat of 2002, when the top three were gone after one round.Odds are there will not be. But, as the players all know, in match play anything can happen.'"
"'08-02-20,'1','“The report details a stunning array of problems that the civil union law inflicts on same-sex couples and their children in New Jersey,” said Steven Goldstein, vice chairman of the commission and chairman of Garden State Equality, a gay rights organization. “The civil union law is failing. The people are hurting.”Since the law took effect, 2,329 couples have entered into civil unions in the state, and 56 more have affirmed their unions from other states. Mr. Goldstein said his organization had received complaints about how the law was put into effect from 568 couples.Leslie Farber, a lawyer in Montclair, testified before the commission in September that she had a client who did not seek a civil union for fear of losing his job in the armed services under the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy (he was also afraid to file a complaint with the state’s Division on Civil Rights). Denoting “married” on military forms, she said, would be less of a red flag.“With the very likelihood that the military serviceman will be called to service overseas in the near future, this client wants to protect his committed life partner,” Ms. Farber told the commission. “The New Jersey Civil Union law automatically outs someone or anyone who gets civil unioned.”Cynthia O. Smith, a spokeswoman for the Department of Defense, said military code required the discharge of “armed forces members who engage in or attempt to engage in homosexual acts; state they are homosexual or bisexual; or marry or attempt to marry a person of the same biological sex.” Between 1997 and 2006, 9,261 people were discharged under these rules. Figures were not available about how many had to leave the service for attempting to marry.Also of concern were married couples in which one spouse has sex-reassignment surgery; some wondered if their marriages would be null and they would have to get civil unions instead.Denise Brunner, 51, a plumber in New Milford who had sex-reassignment surgery in 2006, said she was afraid that if her relationship with her wife, Frances, 50, were changed to a civil union, it could affect their tax filings and financial aid for their children.“Presently we are legally married in the State of New Jersey, and we don’t want to lose that status,” she said, adding that they have spoken publicly to show that the existence of a same-sex marriage in the state has not really changed anything. “We’re still allowed to go into church on Sunday, and ride with the local ambulance corps and help people when they have heart attacks.”Poor couples have also fared poorly under the law, advocates said.“The lesson I learned was just how important this issue was for people who didn’t have a whole lot of money,” said David S. Buckel, senior counsel of Lambda Legal, the gay rights organization that represented the couples whose lawsuit led to the creation of civil unions. “When you have the state sending the message that discrimination is O.K., there’s double discrimination for people who don’t have the resources to try to soften the blow.”Lynn Fontaine Newsome, president of the New Jersey State Bar Association, testified before the commission that “the legal work performed for these clients is double that which is performed for married couples to ensure that they are afforded equal rights.”Sylvia Rhue, director of religious affairs for the National Black Justice Coalition, told the commission: “When employers fail to recognize civil unions as equal to marriage, the couples who get hurt the most are poor couples who are often African-American couples, who cannot afford thousands of dollars to hire fancy lawyers to draft documents like wills, health care proxies, and powers of attorney.”Gov. Jon S. Corzine, who has said he would sign a bill creating same-sex marriage, but not during a presidential election year, said the report raised “significant concerns about whether the law has effectively granted same-sex couples the same rights and benefits of every other family in the state.”“I look forward to reviewing the interim report in more careful detail and working with the commission and the Legislature on ensuring that the basic principles of equal protection under the law as secured by our Constitution are afforded to everyone,” he said in a statement.The report is posted online at http://www.nj.gov/oag/dcr/downloads/1st-InterimReport-CURC.pdf'"
"'08-02-20,'1','Viewers have already become accustomed to a spring lineup from Fox, for instance, and for fresh slates of reality shows during the summer.But the move by NBC Universal, a property of General Electric and Vivendi, represents a particularly bold stroke by a network with the size and clout to move markets. After it announces a list of programs in April, NBC plans to meet with big advertising clients in several cities, followed by a different sort of presentation in May that will encompass all the NBC Universal properties, including cable channels like Bravo, USA and CNBC.What that event will not include is a special introduction of the fall prime-time schedule, which NBC has held for years in Radio City Music Hall and as its broadcast network competitors still intend to do this year. NBC is looking for a different site for the presentation because the Music Hall is not appropriate for the plans it has for that day.But the day will include an introduction of the yearlong programming plans for the press as well as a party for advertising clients that will include some NBC stars. “We still want to keep some of that sizzle,” Mr. Pilot said. Marc Graboff, the co-chairman of NBC Entertainment, said, “This is all about creating a two-way conversation with advertisers.”Senior executives at media agencies greeted the NBC decision with mild to enthusiastic praise. “It’s a step in the right direction,” said Aaron Cohen, executive vice president at Horizon Media in New York. “Something like this was bound to happen.”“I applaud it,” said Charlie Rutman, chief executive for North American operations at MPG in New York, a media agency owned by Havas, because “the idea of a constant stream of new programming is good.”Shari Anne Brill, senior vice president and director for programming at another New York media agency, Carat, described the NBC plan as “a smart idea,” likening it to steps that Fox Broadcasting has tried in the past, announcing several schedules for a season, with new shows coming on the air in September, November and January and in the spring.Asked whether the other broadcast networks may adopt a year-round programming schedule, Mr. Cohen replied: “NBC is the test bed. If buyer reaction is good, it will get considered by the others.”The idea of a 52-week schedule is not really new. Most networks now have programming scattered throughout the year with specific shows set aside for summer, like “Big Brother” on CBS (though it was used in the regular season this year because of the strike) and others for midyear like “24” and “American Idol” on Fox and “Lost” on ABC.But NBC intends to give advertisers a much earlier look at its plans for the entire year. That will presumably make it easier to match advertisers to specific shows, an idea that is growing in popularity. Networks are looking for ways to keep clients paying, even as ratings diminish and programs are replayed on digital recorders with commercials skipped.Ben Silverman, the other co-chairman of NBC Entertainment, who will travel the country with Mr. Graboff making the presentations to advertisers, has been an advocate of linking advertisers to shows. He made a deal with Ford Motor Company, for example, to supply the car used in a remake of the 1980s series “Knight Rider.” A version of that aired Sunday night on NBC as a made-for-TV movie, and Mr. Silverman said Tuesday that its ratings success makes it a likely addition to NBC’s schedule when it is announced in April.As a result of the new plan, Mr. Silverman said, “NBC will have more original programming year-round than anyone else.”The lineup also may receive early input from advertisers who are given an earlier look at it. That may help both parties, Mr. Graboff said. He cited as a cautionary tale the network’s experience with “Kidnapped,” a show from a season ago.“That’s a perfect example,” Mr. Graboff said. “The pilot cost $7 million to produce. We put it on sale to advertisers in May, and they ran for the hills. If we had been able to sit down and have a two-way conversation about them and we told they we had a show about a 13-year-old boy who is kidnapped for the entire season, they would have told us, ‘Good for you, but we’re not putting our clients in it.’ ”But Mr. Graboff said this did not mean NBC would base its programming on input from advertisers. “The ultimate decision is going to be made by program executives who believe in the shows,” he said.One potential benefit of the change, according to Gene DeWitt, chairman of DeWitt Media in New York, is a solution to advertisers’ annual quandary. The last three months of the year are the most important for many marketers — particularly retailers and automakers — but under the current system many of the broadcast shows they are offered then are new and untested.If more shows are brought out earlier in the calendar year, he said, “you’d have a track record of their performance.”“We’d have more reliable rating information,” he added, “so we won’t be going into the fourth quarter blind.”A 52-week broadcast schedule may make it more difficult to track the hits and flops, Mr. DeWitt said, but “it’s the way of the world today — things move faster, and we all have to keep up.”'"
"'08-02-20,'1','TVT Records, long ranked as one of the top independent labels in the recording industry, filed for bankruptcy protection Tuesday as part of an overhaul that involved staff cutbacks and the closing of certain international offices, the company said.Until recently, TVT, based in New York, had been able to weather the industry’s sales falloff with hits from artists like the rapper Lil Jon. But the company was hit last year with a $9.1 million court judgment after a federal jury in Miami decided that it had interfered with another company’s plan to release old recordings of the rapper Pitbull, who is now on TVT’s roster.TVT has suffered from lackluster sales recently, though its founder and president, Steve Gottlieb, pointed to a budding radio hit from Pitbull and a coming album from the rock act Default.Mr. Gottlieb said the label, which he founded in 1985, had laid off about 20 people, which he said was about half its staff.The company’s troubles seemed to cheer at least one of Mr. Gottlieb’s nemeses — Trent Reznor of the industrial rock act Nine Inch Nails, which released recordings through TVT before a dispute resulted in the band departing the label. Mr. Reznor posted a Web link to news about the impending bankruptcy on his band’s Web site, writing “Not ALL news about the music industry is bad these days.”'"
"'08-02-20,'1','“It’s a big shock for the whole market,” said Françoise Mensi, a fund manager at Banque Bonhôte in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. “You just don’t trust the numbers any longer.”The announcement also comes at a time when questions persist about how a giant trading fraud at Société Générale of France, uncovered last month, could have gone undetected for so long.Regarding Credit Suisse, analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort wrote in a note to investors that disclosure of the losses a week after a fairly clean set of results was reported was “impressive proof of zero visibility in investment banks’ balance sheets.”Reuters reported Tuesday that Standard & Poor’s put Credit Suisse’s rating on watch with negative implications, suggesting a possible rating cut.Trying to restore trust, Mr. Dougan said in a conference call that his bank’s risk management procedures were working and detected the errors, which seemed to result from “lateness” in marking investments to the current market price. Credit Suisse expects that it has remained profitable so far in the first quarter.When asked whether there was any indication that the pricing errors were part of a fraud, Mr. Dougan said that “at this point we believe there is no issue around these positions on the book, but there have been some valuation issues around pricing where the pricing did not meet our standards.”“The end result is the valuation adjustments we laid out today,” he said.Still, Andreas Venditti, an equity analyst at Zürcher Kantonalbank in Zurich, called it a “blow to confidence.”“It looked like they had done such a good job in risk management,” Mr. Venditti said.Credit Suisse said last week that it would write off 1.3 billion Swiss francs for the fourth quarter as it posted net profit of 1.33 billion francs ($1.21 billion).Banks worldwide have reported more than $130 billion in write-downs of assets, including collateralized debt obligations or other debt backed by subprime mortgages. But losses have spread to debt not related to mortgages.Analysts noted that the write-downs at Credit Suisse remained far below those of UBS, its bigger rival in Zurich. Credit Suisse’s total write-downs have reached $4 billion, while those at UBS exceeded $18 billion. On Jan. 30 UBS reported a fourth-quarter net loss of 12.5 billion francs ($11.4 billion).On Tuesday, Barclays, one of Britain’s largest banks, increased its 2007 write-down to £1.6 billion ($3.1 billion) but reported profit in line with analysts’ expectations.On Monday, the government of Qatar bought shares of Credit Suisse. Under Swiss law, a shareholder with 3 percent of a company’s shares must declare that shareholding, so Qatar’s investment presumably remains below that threshold, because it has made no public statement.'"
"'08-02-20,'1','Off-Track Betting generates about $125 million in net revenue a year. The racing industry now claims about 70 percent of that money, up from about 55 percent in the mid-1990s. State officials agreed last week to a $105 million deal that calls for the New York Racing Association to continue to run the state’s three major tracks, even though it has had brushes with bankruptcy and scandal in recent years.But that deal did not address Off-Track Betting.“If we did nothing,” the mayor said before the board voted, “by the end of June, OTB would be running a cash-negative operation for the first time in its history.”“I believe that if OTB is unable to operate without taxpayer subsidies, then it should not operate — period,” he added. “The city simply cannot take dollars away from schools and hospitals to pay for a gambling operation. We have no business subsidizing betting parlors.”City officials maintain that the Off-Track Betting board has the authority to do what it did on Tuesday by voting to shut down OTB’s operations. They say that other possible options, like selling Off-Track Betting to another operator, would require the Legislature’s approval.After the board meeting, the mayor criticized the lack of attention to Off-Track Betting in the racetrack deal. “The only way you can get Albany to function is to create a crisis,” the mayor said.He indicated that the shutdown plan was not just a bluff to force state officials to take action. “Once you start down this road, it’s hard to reverse,” the mayor said. “I don’t know why anyone thinks state government will deal with this intelligently going forward when it hasn’t been able to do so in the past.”But Patrick J. Foye, the downstate chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said the issues could be resolved by the June closing date. He said that Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the Legislature “are committed to addressing the issues” that OTB faces.Mr. Foye said in a letter to two OTB officials that its projections indicated that it would fall short “by only $1.1 million in cash in June 2008.” He said that OTB expected July and August to be “cash-positive months,” but that OTB would need about $2.5 million in September.“Clearly, a long-term solution involving amendment of the state’s racing and wagering laws is required,” he said in the letter, “but in the meantime only $1.1 million is required” to see that Off-Track Betting “endures.”When he was asked during a conference call with reporters whether a short-term cash bailout would be required, he said no.“Our emphasis will be on working closely with OTB, the state and the city,” he said. “The state and the city have a common interest in resolving this in a way that does not endanger those 1,500 jobs” and that is consistent with the racetrack deal.Lenny Allen, president of Local 2021 of District Council 37, attended the board meeting and said later that he was optimistic.“According to the time frame that’s being discussed,” he said in a statement, “we are some distance away from the point of a proposed closure” of Off-Track Betting in the city.It has 61 branches, 3 “teletheaters,” 8 restaurant locations and a warehouse in Queens. It also has a center in Midtown Manhattan that handles telephone betting and Internet wagering. Its headquarters are on three floors of the same office building.'"
"'08-02-20,'1','No, Ms. Prada’s black lace dresses are something else. Lace is the fabric of women’s lives, from christening robes to bridal gowns to widow’s weeds. (And let us harmonize: We are fashion nuns!) So, like Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons and perhaps like Azzedine Alaïa, Ms. Prada took a single idea and stayed with it, working the black and beige lace (or orange and blue lace) into coats and slim dresses and tops with stiff satin peplums, all over bodysuits or white cotton shirts. As she said: “You have to go all the way. A little touch of lace becomes pretty.”Structurally, proportionally, the clothes were very direct and simple — the ruffled edges of some of the 1940s dresses repeated in the suede and patent-leather pumps and nylon bags. The lace becomes the intellectual and emotional catalyst. You can’t not ask if the dresses are indecent — many of them are, after all, transparent. But Ms. Prada has made sure that it’s not the only question her collection raises against the female self.To an outsider — woman or man, straight or gay — many of the clothes on the Milan runways would look peculiar. They have no precise fit, no clear design values; and, apart from Sander and Prada, only a superficial waxing of authority. A weird sensitivity has captivated designers, like too many readings of Virginia Woolf, and it has resulted in sagging shapes with carefully placed flounces, practical cloaks and a suicidal palette saved by a bright touch of peacock blue.Collections like Alberta Ferretti and Pringle, designed by Clare Waight Keller, have the range of a conversation conducted over a backyard fence. Ms. Waight Keller has a flair for knits, but her Pringle is all discreet sensibility and no humor. Her press notes refer to a “clean, disciplined correctness,” and that meant capes and austere poncho dresses. But only to a fashion person disciplined in little details would these “correct” clothes have value. To someone else, a blank husband, they would read as “nag, nag, nag: take out the trash.”Christopher Bailey has steadily moved away from the idiosyncratic groundwork he first laid at Burberry. Those clothes were always surprising and informative, a mix of British heritage, new influences and masculine uniform, and they made Mr. Bailey a contemporary pathfinder.His show on Monday restored some of that freshness, particularly in the A-line wool coats worn with bric-a-brac jeweled necklaces (hung on chains like decanter labels), and smart, sculptural knit tops worn with sexy silk trousers. But he still gets lost in the couture effects, like frumpy Empire lines and pleated cloqué, the stiffness and fit making beetles out of supermodels.It took giants to build the Milan fashion houses, and apparently it takes corporations to bury them. Gianfranco Ferré is the latest management fiasco; after Mr. Ferré’s death last June, the company hired the designer Lars Nilsson. That marriage was swiftly annulled — did somebody not ask enough questions at the start? — and the collection on Monday was a respectful team effort that stopped short of embarrassment.Mr. Ferré’s fashion was modernist architecture with the blood thirst of a diva. It always said: Go for it. Designers are fumbling all over Milan, doing delightful things with seams. This would be a lucrative moment for someone at Ferré to get it right.No words could properly describe Cristina Ortiz’s first effort for Salvatore Ferragamo, another house in perpetual transition, until I looked out the car window on my way to Prada and saw a billboard of the tawny mane and cleavage of Celine Dion. But exactly!Like a lot of designers, Angela Missoni finds inspiration in “The Women,” the George Cukor film now in remake, and as she observed on Sunday, “135 actresses and not even the shadow of a man.”Well, not quite. There is the incredible influence of Adrian, the MGM costume designer of the film. Ms. Missoni didn’t attempt to channel Adrian — that would be pointless — but she did appreciate his feeling for asymmetry and unusual prints, among other bygone qualities.Who doesn’t admire self-expressive fashion and wish there were more choices for women? Ms. Missoni’s trouble is that while she understands the principle of having an independent style, she doesn’t have the imaginative powers to realize it in a contemporary way.She may believe that women would feel happier in a poncho lined in a Missoni print, more sophisticated in a turquoise print silk dress over a turtleneck, and more mysterious in a pair of gray flannels with a stiff floral stole, but the results, on this outing, looked self-conscious.'"
"'08-02-20,'1','The Supreme Court of Japan on Tuesday overruled a 2003 Tokyo High Court decision and decided that “Mapplethorpe,” a book of erotic photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe (1946-89), shown at right in a self-portrait, did not violate obscenity laws, The Associated Press reported. The decision should pave the way for sale of the book in Japan for the first time in eight years. Although it decided that the book was not indecent, the Supreme Court rejected a demand by the publisher, Uplink, for government compensation of $20,370, according to Takashi Ando, a spokesman for the court. Takashi Asai of Uplink had been contesting the confiscation of the book in 1999 and his voluntary suspension of its sales in 2000 in response to police warnings. In the Supreme Court decision, by a majority of the five-judge bench, Justice Kohei Nasu wrote that the 384-page volume of black-and-white portraits, including 20 close-ups of male genitalia, “compiles work from the artistic point of view, and is not obscene as a whole.” Mr. Asai sold about 900 copies of the Japanese version of “Mapplethorpe,” originally published in Japan by Random House in 1994 without objection from the authorities. But airport customs officials, declaring the book obscene, confiscated Mr. Asai’s copy when he returned from a trip to the United States in 1999. He called the Supreme Court decision “groundbreaking” and said it “could change the obscenity standard” used for banning foreign films that depict nudity and for censoring photographs in books.'"
"'08-02-20,'1','For the outcast A&E bounty hunter Duane Chapman, the foreseeable future is ending. Mr. Chapman, below, familiarly known as Dog, is going back on the air in his reality show “Dog the Bounty Hunter,” the gossip Web site TMZ.com reported on Tuesday. The site said that preparations were in progress to restart production as soon as possible, although a premiere date had not been set. The series, the most successful on A&E in recent years, was suspended last fall after Mr. Chapman made racially charged comments in a private telephone conversation that was made public by The National Enquirer, which paid Mr. Chapman’s son for it. At the time, A&E announced it was stopping production “for the foreseeable future.”'"

"'08-02-20,'1','PARIS — Credit Suisse on Tuesday announced new write-downs of $2.8 billion that cut $1 billion from its profit, in a stunning reminder of the difficulty banks face in valuing complicated financial instruments under current market conditions.The announcement came just a week after Credit Suisse earned praise from analysts for the quality of its risk management and it jolted investors. In morning trading on the Swiss Stock Exchange, the bank’s shares slid 5.1 Swiss francs, or 9 percent, to 51.65 francs, or $47.12.In a statement, Credit Suisse said that an internal review had ""resulted in the re-pricing of certain asset-backed positions in its structured credit trading business,"" and that the write-down — related to ""significant adverse first-quarter 2008 market developments"" — would reduce its net income by about $1.0 billion.The ""fair-value"" reductions of the positions are estimated at about $2.85 billion, the bank said. Fair-value pricing means a financial instrument is assigned an estimated price when no market price is readily available. The market for many mortgage-backed derivatives has dried up as the United States housing market deteriorates, leaving banks uncertain about the values of many assets.Credit Suisse said its internal review had ""identified mismarkings and pricing errors by a small number of traders in certain positions in our structured credit trading business "". The bank did not detail the problem.'"
"'08-02-20,'1','Because neither mother nor son had experience in food service, Mr. Flynn took a job at a juice bar to see how the business worked. Then he wrote a computer program that allowed online customers to choose the base ingredients for their bars, as well as fruit, protein and vitamin infusions. They could even name the bar whatever they liked. The You Bar (youbars.com) was born.After starting the business in their homes and later borrowing commercial kitchen space from the synagogue that Ms. Bise attends, the duo moved into their own space last summer, not far from the Farmers Market in downtown Los Angeles. The 800-square-foot kitchen and warehouse is bright and neat and filled with jars of nut butters and containers of dried fruits, as well as food scales and mixers.Although the bars are not sold in stores, orders come from all over the world via the Internet. With eight employees, Mr. Flynn and Ms. Bise weigh and mix the requested ingredients, mold the bars and seal them in packages. They then print computer-generated labels stating the bars’ names and nutritional facts.Gary Meyer, a fitness and nutritional consultant who runs the Elite Fitness Center in Wilmington, Mass., stumbled onto the You Bar Web site four months ago while looking online for an organic protein powder. He has ordered them ever since and encourages his clients to do so.“Learning to eat healthy and eat six meals a day is difficult for most people,” he said. “Supplements like nutrition bars have become a necessity because it’s quick and easy. But the wrong kind of bar can be counterproductive. Most of the ones available are just candy bars infused with protein — reverse liposuction.”Mr. Meyer says some members of his fitness center are nervous about making the wrong choices when they design their own You Bars, which cost $40 for a baker’s dozen.“You experiment until you get it right,” he said. Mr. Flynn and Ms. Bise allow customers dissatisfied with their choice of ingredients to return them and reorder.Mr. Flynn said he had received only five or six return orders, usually from people complaining the bar was too dry for whom he would recalibrate the recipe.“Originally I was afraid that I’d see the bad side of humanity come out,” he said of the “satisfaction guaranteed” offer. “But people haven’t taken advantage of it. They’ve been great.”For those who want You Bars but cannot make decisions about the ingredients, the site offers several popular recipes with ideas on customizing them.Ms. Bise, a certified snowboard instructor who specializes in teaching women over 30, said she had never imagined such a partnership with her son. She said each contributed strengths to the business.“He has a lot of energy and interest in technology and was right out of business school,” she said. “I have all these odd things I’ve done over the years. It’s been fascinating to get to know my son not just as my son but as my business partner.”It took a while for suppliers to treat Mr. Flynn as an equal partner in the business because of his youth, Ms. Bise said.You Bar, a private company, prefers not to specify sales, but Mr. Flynn said orders had been doubling each month for the last eight months.“I knew there was an industry where I would wake up every morning just stoked to go to work,” he said. “Every day it’s like I just jump out of bed and love it.”'"

"'08-02-21,'0','Oil prices fell Thursday after a government report showed that the nation’s crude oil supplies rose more than expected last week. At the pump, meanwhile, gas prices rose more than 3 cents overnight, a jump that could be a prelude to a much bigger price spike this spring.The inventory report from the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration was mixed. While crude oil inventories rose by 4.2 million barrels last week, more than the 2.9 million barrel increase analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected, supplies of distillates, which include heating oil, fell by 4.5 million barrels, much more than the 1.5 million barrel forecast.Traders chose to focus on the crude number. Many analysts believe rising supplies and the falling demand noted in a number of recent reports means oil prices will eventually fall.But they’ve been wrong before. Indeed, prices have spiked in recent days on buying fueled in part by investors attracted to the oil market by the falling dollar. Crude futures offer a hedge against a falling dollar, and oil futures bought and sold in dollars are more attractive to foreign investors when the dollar is falling.A battle over these differing points of view is playing out in the oil markets, fueling price volatility.'"
"'08-02-21,'0','Seeking to satisfy European antitrust officials, Microsoft said Thursday that it would open up and share many more of its technical secrets with the rest of the software industry and competitors.Microsoft executives, in a conference call, characterized the announcement as “a major step” and a “strategic shift” in the company’s business practices and its handling of technical information. They also portrayed the moves as only partly a nod to the continuing challenge Microsoft faces from Europe’s antitrust regulators.The broader goal, they said, is to bring Microsoft’s flagship personal computer products — the Windows operating system and Office productivity programs — further into the Internet era of computing. Increasingly there needs to be a seamless transfer of documents, data and programming code among desktop PCs and the Internet, especially as more people make the shift from using software on a PC to using services on the Web.“These steps are being taken on our own,” said Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive. The move, he said, is a recognition of Microsoft’s “unique legal situation,” but it is also the company’s effort to adapt to “the opportunities and risks of a more connected, more services-oriented world.”The first major step Microsoft is taking is to put on its Web site 30,000 pages of technical documentation detailing how its Windows desktop and Microsoft server programs communicate and share information. Until now, that information was only available under a trade secret license from Microsoft.'"
"'08-02-21,'0','REDMOND, Wash.

"'08-02-21,'0','Again, I’m very disappointed in The New York Times piece. It’s not true. And I’ll be glad to respond to any questions you might have.Q Senator, did you ever have any meeting with any of your staffers in which they would have intervened to ask you not to see Vicki Iseman or to be concerned about appearances of being too close to a lobbyist?Q No staffer was ever concerned about a possible romantic relationship?SENATOR MCCAIN: If they were, they didn’t communicate that to me.Q Did you ever have such a relationship?Q Senator, can you describe your relationship with Vicki Iseman?SENATOR MCCAIN: Mm-hmm. I -- (we’re ?) friends, seen her on occasions, particularly at receptions and fundraisers and appearances before the committee. I have many friends in Washington who represent various interests and those who don’t. And I consider her a friend.Q But do you feel like, in terms of your relationship with lobbyists in general, you were closer to her than with others?SENATOR MCCAIN: No. No, I have many friends who represent various interests ranging, from the firemen to the police to senior citizens to various interests, particularly before my committee, and I had meetings with hundreds of them and various interests. And that was my job to do, to get their input. And obviously, people who represent interests are fine. That’s their constitutional right. The question is, is whether -- do they have excess or unwarranted influence? And certainly no one ever has in my conduct of my public life and conduct of my legislative agenda.Q Did -- John Weaver, who is one of your former top aides, is quoted on the record saying that he had a conversation with her, saying -- basically telling her to butt out. Did you not know of that conversation? And do you know why John Weaver would go on the record describing such a conversation?SENATOR MCCAIN: I did not, and I don’t know anything about it.Q And do you --SENATOR MCCAIN: John Weaver is a friend of mine. He remains a friend of mine. But I certainly didn’t know of anything of that nature.Q And do you regret flying on the -- she was -- Iseman was working for this man Paxson. Do you regret flying on his plane or writing those letters to the FCC that is part of this?SENATOR MCCAIN: Well, first of all, on riding on the airplane, that was an accepted practice. I have ridden on many airplanes. And since then the rules have been changed. It was something I supported.On the, quote, ""letters to the FCC,"" interestingly, this was brought up in the year 2000 by The New York Times. I wrote a letter because the FCC, which usually makes a decision within 400 days, had gone almost 800 days. In the letter, I said I am not telling you how to make a decision, I’m just telling you that you should move forward and make a decision on this issue. And I believe that was appropriate. Former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission at the time in 2000 said that that was more than an appropriate role for me to play as chairman of the Oversight Committee. So my answer to you is no.Q You were aware, obviously, of this story being in preparation for a number of months.Q Did you speak to The New York Times? And if so, what did you tell them? And did they ever say that the story was not going to run?SENATOR MCCAIN: We never tried to have any -- a dialogue in that fashion. For months The New York Times has submitted questions and we have answered them fully and exhaustively. And unfortunately, many of those answers were not included in the rather long piece in The New York Times. But we fully cooperated with them in answering many -- any questions that they might have.Q But you never tried to dissuade them from running the story in any fashion?SENATOR MCCAIN: No. In fact, I never spoke directly to them.Q Senator, why do you think they’re running this story now?SENATOR MCCAIN: I don’t know. I really don’t know. I’m very disappointed, obviously. But we’ll move on with the campaign, talk about the big issues, talk about the challenges that people face in their lives, the economy today, our national security issues. And I’m confident that we will move forward and I’m confident that we will continue to compete in the primaries a week from next Tuesday and gain the nomination of the party. And I’m looking forward to it.SENATOR MCCAIN: You know, it’s a little hard for me to see the questioner with the light that bright. If you could turn it down just a little it, I’d appreciate it.Q Yes. The New York Times article quotes you having conversations with Bill Keller, the executive editor.SENATOR MCCAIN: I had one conversation -- I’m sorry, I did have one conversation with him. I -- (let me ?) correct the record. I did have a conversation with Mr. Keller. I called him up when the investigation was going on and I asked him basically what was happening and that we hoped that we could bring this to closure. But it was a very brief conversation.I apologize for that. I was not trying to dissuade him from -- in any way from doing the story. I know The New York Times. (Laughs.) So I wasn’t trying to dissuade him from it.Q What do you mean by closure -- (off mike)?SENATOR MCCAIN: Well, we’d like to have the many months’ investigation closed at some point, and obviously, they did.Q (Off mike) -- confirm again. The New York Times is pretty explicit in quoting a couple of former aides, they say --Q -- saying that some of your aides intervened and confronted not just Ms. Iseman, but you in particular, saying: Stop seeing her, don’t have a relationship with her, because this is going to hurt you. Are you saying that did not happen?SENATOR MCCAIN: I don’t know if it happened at their level. It certainly didn’t happen to me. And I do notice with some interest that it’s, quote, ""former aides""; that this whole story is based on anonymous sources. I don’t think that that’s really something that is -- I’m very disappointed in that. All of it is, quote, ""anonymous sources,"" quote, ""former aides."" You know the staff of the Commerce Committee was around 100 to 150 staffers, as I recall. I’ve had -- it was the largest, one of the largest staffs of any committee. So, quote, ""former aides"" and former staffers could certain encompass a large number of people.Q So none of them, nobody in your campaign said, ""Senator, she’s a problem, don’t deal with her""?Q There were some notable departures from your campaign last summer. Do you believe there’s any reason to think there were hurt feelings or motivations for people to make these claims?SENATOR MCCAIN: I do not. Yeah. I just don’t. I know that those people -- we had a very difficult time in the campaign, to say the least, and we parted as friends from the campaign, and I remain friends with them.Q Senator, have you talked to John Weaver about what he’s told The Times or The Post?SENATOR MCCAIN: No, I have not.Q Did you have a conversation with him during this investigation when they were reaching out to him?Q Did he tell you that he was talking to them?SENATOR MCCAIN: No. I’ve had a couple of conversations with John. He called to congratulate me when we won a couple of the primaries. And I said, ""Thanks, John. Look forward to seeing you."" And we -- we did -- the only subject we discussed on the phone was he congratulated me on how well our campaign -- going. John and I have known each other for many, many years, and we remain -- we remain good friends.Q Are you still in touch with Ms. Iseman in any way?Q With Vicki Iseman. When was the last time you --SENATOR MCCAIN: I have not, obviously, because I haven’t been in Washington. No, not in some time.Q Senator, could you -- just real quick, on public financing --Q -- the FEC says that you don’t have the right to withdraw from the system, and basically your campaign has said yes, you do, and you did. Can you address that?SENATOR MCCAIN: Well, it was done before in another campaign, and I’ve forgotten which one it was now. We think it’s perfectly legal.We have -- one of our advisers is a former chairman of the Federal Elections Commission, and we are confident that it is a(n) appropriate thing to do.Q Mrs. McCain, do you want to comment on what you read in The New York Times?CINDY MCCAIN: Well, obviously I’m very disappointed in The New York Times. And more importantly, my children and I not only trust my husband but know that he would never do anything to not only disappoint our family, but more -- but disappoint the people of America. He’s a -- he’s a man of great character, and I’m very, very disappointed in The New York Times.SENATOR MCCAIN: Mm-hmm. I -- I should have had you conduct this -- this meeting.Q Do you think this will be damaging or distracting, at the very least, to your campaign at this juncture?SENATOR MCCAIN: Something like this is always distracting and very disappointing, and I hope we can by, you know, doing what we’re doing here, put to rest the -- the whole situation. But I would imagine that -- (sighs) -- that, you know, it -- it does distract, and it keeps me from talking about the big issues and the not so -- (chuckles) -- not so big issues. And -- but hopefully we can get this thing resolved and behind us and move forward with a campaign. And I’m confident that we can.Q Senator -- (off mike) -- is a very important state, obviously, in the election, and with the allegations, are you going to have to work harder to campaign to get those votes for March 4th?SENATOR MCCAIN: I think we have a lot of work to do. I’m happy that in the Washington primary and the -- and the other primaries, such as in Virginia and Maryland, those who call themselves, quote, ""conservatives"" -- we were getting a significant and even a majority part of the vote in -- there and in Wisconsin. I still have a lot of work to do to unite the party, and I’ll keep working at it. And hopefully I can show them my conservative record, and we are -- we’ll win enough delegates that will be necessary to secure the nomination. And I’m confident of the progress we’re making, but I also respect Governor Huckabee’s desire to remain in the race and for as long as he wants to.That’s his right to do, and I respect it.Q Senator, do you think this will have blowback against you and conservatives, your ability to attract them into your campaign, talk radio?SENATOR MCCAIN: Well, I hope that -- that -- that the -- all people, all Americans will recognize that this is an issue that I hope I can get resolved and move forward, and I believe we are and can and will. And I think the American people are very fair in their judgment.So, you know, there will be other obstacles in this campaign, I am sure. We all know that presidential campaigns are very, very tough, and so I intend to respond and I intend to move on. And I am confident that we will continue on the path to victory not only in the primary, but in the general election in November, and I look forward to the debate.Q Senator -- (off mike) -- on the campaign trail at every stop talk about how you want to change Washington -- (off mike) -- but you say you want to change Washington. But this kind of story, this really goes to the heart and perhaps contradicting the central theme of your campaign.SENATOR MCCAIN: Well, again, I understand that, and that’s why I’m so disappointed, you know, on a story based on, quote, ""anonymous sources,"" et cetera. But look, I have a long record, as I said, a 50- year record, a 24-year record as a member of Congress, and I’m confident that my record will be reviewed. There are many people who have dealt with me who are now stepping forward and talking about how fairly and objectively I ran the Commerce Committee and the leadership I’ve shown in many reform issues, including my opposition to earmark and pork barrel spending. So I’ll be asking people to look at my entire record, and I think that that will stand.But yes, this is a very disappointing event, pick up the paper this morning -- actually, to hear last night that the story was appearing after months of inquiries from The New York Times.(Laughs.) So I -- you’ll have to -- you’ll have to talk to him about it. So -- but I did not know anything about it, so I can’t comment on it.Q Senator, I spoke with John Weaver this morning, and he --Q -- what we said is that he did speak with Ms. Iseman, and what he wanted to tell her is that he was hearing that she was telling people around town that she had influence with you, and he was worried back then, just like it would today, that it would undermine your campaign. And that’s why he went to her. Knowing that, did he make the right move?SENATOR MCCAIN: I don’t know, because I -- again, I’ve never discussed it with John Weaver and so I -- as far as I know, there was no necessity for it. But that’s -- that’s a judgment that he made, so you’d have to discuss it with him. But I did not know anything about it.Q Is that something that he should have discussed with you?SENATOR MCCAIN: No, not necessarily. I’m not his -- (chuckles) -- no, not that I would think.SENATOR MCCAIN: Thank you all very much. Thanks.'"
"'08-02-21,'0','Mr. McCain also said he knew nothing about confrontations that the newspaper described between Mr. McCain and staff members who were worried that the senator’s relationship with Ms. Iseman would jeopardize his career. “I don’t know if it happened at their level, it certainly didn’t happen to me,” Mr. McCain said.Later in the day, one of Mr. McCain’s senior advisers leveled harsh criticism at The New York Times in what appeared to be a deliberate campaign strategy to wage a war with the newspaper. Mr. McCain is deeply distrusted by conservatives on a number of issues, not least because of his rapport with the news media, but he could find common ground with them in attacking a newspaper that many conservatives revile as a left-wing publication.“It was something that you would see in the National Enquirer, not in The New York Times,” said Steve Schmidt, a former counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney who is now a top campaign adviser to Mr. McCain.The McCain campaign is already using the article in its fund-raising effort. In an appeal describing the article as “a scurrilous attack against a great American hero,” the McCain campaign asks supporters for contributions so the campaign has the resources to “respond and defend our nominee from the liberal attack machine.”“We need your help to counteract the liberal establishment and fight back against The New York Times by making an immediate contribution today,” says the appeal, according to a copy supplied to The Times.Mr. Schmidt, in a lengthy critique of the newspaper to reporters traveling on Mr. McCain’s campaign plane, charged that The New York Times rushed the article into print so that it could beat The New Republic in the publication of an article about the story behind The Times’s investigation of Mr. McCain. The Times article was first published on its Web site on Wednesday night; the New Republic posted its article, which claimed dysfunction in the newsroom and staff conflict over the article, on its Web site on Thursday afternoon.“And it is my proposition that what happened here is, a very quick decision was made: Do we publish a story that we know doesn’t meet our standards, or, do we allow a news organization to once again cast a light and report on goings on in our newsroom, dysfunction in our newsroom, in a way that we don’t want to happen,” Mr. Schmidt said.In response to Mr. McCain as well as media commentary about the timing of the publication of the article, The New York Times released this statement from Bill Keller, the newspaper’s executive editor:“On the substance, we think the story speaks for itself. On the timing, our policy is, we publish stories when they are ready. ‘Ready’ means the facts have been nailed down to our satisfaction, the subjects have all been given a full and fair chance to respond, and the reporting has been written up with all the proper context and caveats. This story was no exception. It was a long time in the works. It reached my desk late Tuesday afternoon. After a final edit and a routine check by our lawyers, we published it.”Asked at his news conference if he thought the article would be damaging or distracting to his presidential run this year, Mr. McCain replied: “It does distract, and it keeps me from talking about the big issues and the not so big issues, and hopefully we can get this thing resolved and behind us and move forward with the campaign.”At a news conference in Houston on Thursday, Mr. McCain’s rival for the nomination, Mike Huckabee, declined to speculate about the possible impact of the story, NBC News reported.“You know, I’ve campaigned now on the same stage and platform with John McCain for 14 months; I only know him to be a man of integrity,” Mr. Huckabee said, according to NBC. “Today he denied any of that was true, I take him at his word. I have no further comment other than that. I think for me to get into it is completely immaterial. Again, I only know him what I know him to be, and that’s a good and decent and honorable man.”The battle over the article drew conservative commentators, many of whom have assailed Mr. McCain throughout the race, to the join in the criticism of The New York Times. Rush Limbaugh opened his radio program on Thursday morning by saying that “if you let the media make you, you are subjecting yourself to the media being able to destroy you.”“The important question for John McCain today is, is he going to learn the right lesson from this, and what is the lesson?” Mr. Limbaugh said, according to a transcript posted on his Web site. “The lesson is liberals are to be defeated. You cannot walk across the aisle with them. You cannot reach across the aisle. You cannot welcome their media members on your bus and get all cozy with them and expect eternal love from them.”'"
"'08-02-21,'0','People who had surgery for spinal stenosis, a common back ailment, had less pain two years later than those who decided to skip the surgery, researchers said. They said the study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, should help patients make an informed decision when they develop the painful condition. “This study says surgery is better,” said the lead author, Dr. James Weinstein of Dartmouth. Spinal stenosis is caused by a narrowing of the spinal canal that gradually pinches off nerves in the spine, making it painful to stand or walk. The findings are part of a five-year, 11-state study looking at the effectiveness of common back surgery.'"
"'08-02-21,'0','Heart surgery patients were more likely to die if given an antibleeding drug, Trasylol, two new studies have found. The manufacturer, Bayer, stopped selling the drug after a Canadian study was halted because of deaths. The research reignites a controversy over Trasylol, which was on the market for 14 years. The studies are being published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine. The first looked at about 10,000 patients who had bypasses at Duke University Medical Center from 1996 through 2005. It found that 6.4 percent of patients who were given Trasylol died within 30 days of the surgery, a rate nearly 2.5 times higher than patients who got another drug or who received no treatment for bleeding. The second study, financed by Bayer, looked at about 78,000 patients nationwide from 2003 to 2006. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers found the risk of death was 64 percent higher in the Trasylol group than in those taking a comparison drug.'"
"'08-02-21,'0','The government’s statistics office said the inflation rate surged to a new record of 100,580 percent in January, up from 66,212 percent in December. Rangarirai Mberi, news editor of the independent Financial Gazette in Harare, said the state of the economy would feature prominently in next month’s presidential and parliamentary elections. “Numbers no longer shock people,” he said. Zimbabweans have learned to live in a hyperinflationary environment, he added, “but the question is, how long can this continue?”'"
"'08-02-21,'0','MEXICO CITY — Investigators have determined that a man linked to drug traffickers was trying to plant a bomb in a police official’s car when it blew up and killed him on a busy avenue here last week, the city’s attorney general said.The attorney general, Rodolfo Félix Cárdenas, said Wednesday that six more people were being sought in connection with the explosion on Friday.The blast unsettled the residents of the capital, which had so far escaped much of the drug violence that has racked other parts of the country.The announcement on Monday that drug traffickers were behind the attack strengthened the impression that the struggle between the government and drug cartels had entered a new phase.The bomber who died was identified as Juan Manuel Meza Campos, 44. Prosecutors say a woman injured in the blast, Tania Vázquez Muñoz, 22, was shown accompanying Mr. Meza, arm in arm, by a video surveillance camera just before the explosion. She is now considered a suspect, the authorities said.'"
"'08-02-21,'0','Toward the end of the second quarter, at the other end of the floor, a third snapshot came into clear focus. O’Neal rebounded a Lakers miss. With both elbows and his tongue sticking out, he held off Lamar Odom and Bryant, who were on him like sweat. Bryant picked up his first foul trying to take the ball away. O’Neal missed the free throws — he was 3 of 8 from the line — but the fans did not seem to care, so enraptured were they with O’Neal’s effort.“I was in better shape than I thought I was,” said O’Neal, who had 9 points in 8 minutes in the fourth quarterSaid D’Antoni, “I thought he’d run out of steam in the fourth quarter, but he didn’t.”O’Neal, who won three N.B.A. titles with the Lakers and another with the Miami Heat, is not that far removed from his days as a headliner. But the Suns do not need him to put up pinball numbers in scoring, as he did in his heyday with the Lakers.They acquired him from the Heat to grab defensive rebounds and ignite the fast break, set picks to make space for Nash and clog the middle so that the other team’s low-post production is reduced to a trickle.O’Neal’s presence seemed to give the team an instant lift where they have been the most flat-footed. In three previous games against the Lakers this season, the Suns had been outrebounded by the Lakers, 152-117. On Wednesday they won the battle of the boards, 46-33.Before the game, D’Antoni acknowledged he had no idea how O’Neal’s debut would play out. “We might look like we have two left shoes on,” he said, adding, “We’ve seen enough of him and what he’s doing to know we’re going to be a better team, whether it’s tonight or two weeks from now.”Much has been made of the fact that O’Neal will turn 36 next month. But Nash turned 34 this month and his body has taken a beating over the years. As much as anything has been able to slow him, it has been his own balky back. Nash has not played 80 games in the regular season since 2004 when he returned to Phoenix, which drafted him in 1996. At 6-3 and 178 pounds, Nash looks like he could be knocked over by a defender’s deep exhale.Against San Antonio last year in Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals, Nash was hip-checked into the press table by the Spurs’ Robert Horry. His teammates Amare Stoudemire and Boris Diaw left the bench to come to Nash’s aid and received one-game suspensions that left the frontline frayed for Game 5, which the Suns lost. The Spurs closed them out in Game 6.What Horry did to Nash seemed an apt metaphor for what happened to the Suns every postseason when they faced a team with a formidable frontline: they got knocked around.The addition of O’Neal gives the Suns the option to go inside in the clutch or when Nash is on the bench resting.“We put so much pressure on Steve,” said Steve Kerr, the Suns’ general manager. “I felt watching some games, Man, wouldn’t it be nice to throw it into the post?”D’Antoni guessed that it would probably take O’Neal, who sustained a hip pointer in game on Dec. 22, 10 games to get his legs as a Sun. And then, O’Neal suggested, watch out.“Give me four or five days to really get attuned out there,” O’Neal said, adding, “When we get used to each other, we’re going to be the most dominant team ever.”On Tuesday, O’Neal was in postseason form when he posted up against the news media. He had everybody laughing with his one-liners. At one point, in a nod to the last big game played in this area, the one pitting the New England Patriots against the Giants, he said, “I’m going to be looking to get out like Randy Moss and Terrell Owens.”The Suns would be happy if O’Neal played like Amani Toomer.'"
"'08-02-21,'0','Q. When I try to add new music to my iTunes library, I keep getting an error message that says I “don’t have enough access privileges for this operation.” This is my own computer, so what does this mean and how can I fix the problem?A. Access privileges, or permissions, are the settings that say which users can read or modify the computer’s files and folders. Even if it is your computer, these permissions files can sometimes get changed or scrambled and cause problems when you try to open certain files or folders, import music from a CD or copy data from one drive to another.In this case, it sounds as if the permissions are not set correctly for the iTunes Music folder or one of its subfolders. Apple has a troubleshooting document on its Web site that details the process for modifying or resetting the permissions in both Windows and Macintosh systems at docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=300198. Windows users can find Microsoft’s own instructions for Windows file and folder permissions at support.microsoft.com/kb/308419/en-us.The Disk Utility program included with Mac OS X can also repair permissions files. To use it, go to the Applications folder to Utilities and open the Disk Utility program. Click on your hard drive’s icon and then click the button for Repair Disk Permissions.'"
"'08-02-21,'0','But Rio Tinto has said it is looking for greater flexibility, including the ability to factor in the relative advantages of freight distances.“Rio Tinto will continue to negotiate to obtain a freight premium, to reflect its proximity to Asia and its major customers,” Sam Walsh, chief executive for the company’s iron ore group, said in a statement.Rio Tinto’s argument is that the steel mills are paying significantly less for Australian ore when it is priced at the Chinese port, and it wants a share of some of that saved money.“We believe that more recognition of our geographical proximity to major markets should be reflected in the price,” a spokesman for Rio Tinto Iron Ore, Gervase Greene, said Wednesday.Freight is a significant factor in input prices, accounting for some 30 percent of the landed cost of Australian iron ore in China, and almost 50 percent of the cost of Brazilian iron ore.At the moment, the benefit of that cost difference is accruing entirely to Asian steel producers.Steel makers in China produce about half the world’s supply, and the country’s growing economy has fueled a rise in raw material prices. Even before the deal negotiated by Vale, iron ore prices had almost tripled in the last five years.Most iron ore is sold under long-term contracts, but companies like Rio Tinto are now trying to sell more on the spot market to take advantage of the increasing premium for spot ore.The benchmark price for iron ore is currently about $60 a ton. On the spot market, driven almost entirely by Chinese demand, prices are just under $200 a ton delivered.Chinese steel producers are already coming under pressure from rising fuel prices and a slowing global economy. Analysts speculated before the announcement that they were looking for rises of around 30 percent.There have been no public comments from Chinese mills since Vale’s announcement.Last month, BHP signed a 10-year deal with Baosteel of China to supply 100 million tons of ore. The deal was not priced on the benchmark.“It was a hybrid pricing model,” a BHP spokeswoman, Samantha Evans, said Wednesday. “Long-term contract prices have traditionally only referred to the benchmark. We are saying they need to have the flexibility to accommodate more market-driven approaches.”Ms. Evans declined to say whether BHP was pursuing similar deals with other customers.'"
"'08-02-21,'0','MOSCOW — Human Rights Watch released a report here on Wednesday accusing the Kremlin of using a host of bureaucratic rules to hinder the work of nonprofit organizations. The group did not have to look far to find what it said was a fresh example of the problem: Its own executive director was denied a visa to come to Moscow to present the report.The executive director, Kenneth Roth, who is based in New York, instead addressed a news conference in Moscow by telephone, noting that this was the first time that the Russian government had refused to issue a visa to an official of Human Rights Watch since the fall of the Soviet Union.Referring to nongovernmental organizations, Mr. Roth said, “This is an unfortunate illustration of precisely the kind of harassment of NGOs that we have documented.”The Russian Foreign Ministry would not comment on the visa denial.Human Rights Watch said in its report, “Choking on Bureaucracy,” that although the Kremlin had pushed through tighter regulations in 2006, it had not conducted a broad-based campaign to close nonprofit organizations, as some had feared. Instead, officials have forced the organizations to comply with the regulations’ onerous requirements, making it difficult for them to operate, the report said. And it emphasized that groups that scrutinized Kremlin policies or were opposed to them tended to receive the harshest treatment.The report said that under the 2006 rules, organizations typically must seek government approval to take on additional responsibilities or conduct new activities. Yet officials can withhold permission if the extensive paperwork that is now mandated has been prepared “in an inappropriate manner,” a category so broad that it can include minor typographical errors.Russian officials have defended the way they regulate the organizations, saying that the rules are no harder to comply with than those in Western European countries. Human Rights Watch disputed that assertion and said studies by international experts had found that the Russian laws were particularly restrictive.'"
"'08-02-21,'0','By early Wednesday, three Navy warships were in position in the Pacific Ocean to launch the interceptors and to track the mission.Radar and other tracking equipment, both in space and on the ground, were monitored at Vandenberg Air Force Base, in California, and at a space command headquarters in Colorado Springs, with control of the operation managed by the Strategic Command in Omaha, Neb.Although the satellite circles the globe every 90 minutes, analysts pinpointed a single overhead pass each day that would offer the best chance of striking the satellite and then having half of the debris fall into the atmosphere in the next three orbits over water or less-populated areas of the Earth.Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who left Washington on Wednesday for a week of meetings in Asia, had been empowered by President Bush to issue the order to shoot down the satellite and gave the order several hours before the strike.The many moving parts of a mission to shoot down a dying spy satellite with an antimissile interceptor were lined up earlier Wednesday after the space shuttle Atlantis returned to Earth, officials said.The goal of the missionwais to prevent the fuel tank from reaching Earth and spilling its hazardous contents in a populous area. In the event that any of the hydrazine fuel falls on a populated area, the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Wednesday issued directions to communities on how to deal with dangerous debris from the satellite.Military officials said their goal had been to carry out the mission before March 1, when the satellite was expected to start skidding against the upper reaches of the atmosphere.That initial friction would bump the satellite into a more unpredictable Earth orbit, even before it started a fiery descent through the atmosphere.Providing new information about how the mission would be carried out, a senior military officer on Wednesday described the vessels, weapons and command structure for the operationThe senior military officer said the mission would be launched in daylight to take advantage of radar, heat-sensor tracking and visual tracking equipment. The Navy had a window that lasted only tens of seconds as the satellite passed overhead, military officers said.An Aegis cruiser, the Lake Erie, has two Standard Missile 3 rockets that were adapted to track the cold satellite, as opposed to the heated enemy warheads for which it was designed. A second ship, the destroyer Decatur, had a third missile as backup. Another Navy destroyer, the Russell, sailed with the convoy for added tracking capabilities.Separately, a Pentagon spokesman, Bryan Whitman, dismissed suggestions that the operation had been designed to test the nation’s missile defense systems or antisatellite capabilities or that the effort had been to destroy secret intelligence equipment.“This is about reducing the risk to human life on Earth, nothing more,” Mr. Whitman said.The 5,000-pound satellite, roughly the size of a school bus, was managed by the National Reconnaissance Office and went dead shortly after it was launched in December 2006.The FEMA document notes, “Any debris should be considered potentially hazardous, and first responders should not attempt to pick it up or move it.”'"
"'08-02-21,'0','She added: “That has not been thought of as the mission of business schools, but it is in the emerging world of today. If we did not do this, we could be accused of staring at our own navel.”C. L. Nikias, provost and head of academic affairs at the University of Southern California, wants the university to become a place where “students and faculty can cross academic and geographic boundaries to innovate, an institution with a public service mission that spans continents.” About 21 percent of the students at the university’s Marshall School are international. The university is “receiving requests to put branches of the school in many countries,” said Adam Clayton Powell III, vice provost for globalization.The Global Access Program at the Anderson School provides a good illustration of the new types of offerings. The program enrolls 175 M.B.A. candidates who are working at other jobs during the three years it takes to earn their degrees. Their average age is about 33. Students consult for six months at a time for international companies that want to get into the American market or simply “operate beyond their current borders,” explained Robert Foster, dean of the program. The students, who work in teams of five or six, average 500 hours of work on a typical project.Payam Tehrani, who graduated last year, counseled ICAR Vision Systems, a developer of identification cards and equipment in Barcelona, Spain. ICAR wanted to break into the American market. But after the students surveyed that market and worked in Spain, Italy and other countries, “we found that its equipment was not advanced enough to make it in the U.S. market, but that ICAR had opportunities for expansion in Italy,” said Mr. Tehrani, a 35-year old electrical engineer who now works for Yahoo. The Spanish company, like all other corporate customers of the program, contributed $15,000 to the Anderson School to cover part of the program’s expenses.Gerald Gutierrez, 33, who also graduated from the program last year, worked with an Italian company that wanted to sell thermoplastics to Boeing and Airbus. But the company’s products were less advanced than the thermoplastics the companies already used to build aircraft. “We advised the company that it needed to do more research and development,” Mr. Gutierrez said.In another case, a team of students studied markets in Russia for the Technology Agency of Finland, a government office, on behalf of software, communications and construction service firms. Why would Finland hire American students to study a market in Russia? The answer, Mr. Foster said, is that the Americans “know how to commercialize technology, to map out the complex of distribution channels, marketing and finance that any product needs to be successful.”The global access program is expanding in 2008 to 240 students and 48 projects, reaching out to India and China, Mexico, Spain and Austria for new companies and opportunities.Global study brings perspective. Ronald Lewis, 21, a student at the Marshall School, studied for four months at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and visited the bustling port city of Shenzhen, China. It was, he said, “my first time immersed in another culture,” an experience that he will bring to a management consultant job at Bain & Company after graduation this year.Alda Mostofi, 28, found that his fellow students of many nationalities, had differing views about Western culture when they visited the General Motors plant in Shanghai as part of their studies for the dual business degree from U.C.L.A. and the National University of Singapore.Ronson Wong, an executive at Reach.com, a Hong Kong-based provider of cable and satellite communications, said, “A degree from an American university, from U.C.L.A., is highly valued in Asia.” He received a dual degree from U.C.L.A. and Singapore last year.American universities are so prized abroad because “we have a different kind of pedagogy,” said James Ellis, dean of the Marshall School. “We are much more inclusive of students, allowing their participation on many levels, in contrast to the classic Oxford lecture model. The students learn from one another, particularly in the global classes where individuals from different cultures work together.”'"
"'08-02-21,'0','And, frankly, I was a little surprised by how few readers saw what was, to us, the larger point of the story. Perhaps here, at the outset of this conversation, is a good point to state as clearly as possible our purpose in publishing.For a year or so, in addition to pieces on issues, candidate interviews, investigations of their business dealings, polling and reporting from the campaign trail, we have been running this series called ""The Long Run."" It is a kind of serial biography of the candidates. We pick key events or themes or questions about a candidate's life that reflect on his or her character and qualifications. (They are all archived here.)These profiles aim to include a mixture of new material and previously known material looked at fresh. Previous installments on Senator McCain have dealt with his family and with his bare-knuckle primary battle against George Bush in South Carolina in 2000.Perhaps the defining narrative of Senator McCain's career is his long, determined recovery from scandal. Elected to public office as a national hero, the senator was tainted by revelations that he had done favors for an unsavory banker he considered a friend. It was — as he describes it in his memoirs — a searing humiliation from which he never recovered. He rebuilt his career and his reputation by becoming a champion of clean government, a critic of lobbyists and the vested-interest money that courses through American politics. More than most politicians, he was keenly aware that, as he put it in one of his books, ""questions of honor are raised as much by appearances as by reality in politics.""The point of this ""Long Run"" installment was that, according to people who know him well, this man who prizes his honor above all things and who appreciates the importance of appearances also has a history of being sometimes careless about the appearance of impropriety, about his reputation. The story cites several examples, and quotes friends and admirers talking of this apparent contradiction in his character. That is why some members of his staff were so alarmed by the appearance of his relationship with Ms. Iseman. And that, it seemed (and still seems) to us, was something our readers would want to know about a man who aspires to be president.Clearly, many of you did not agree.Yes, Mr. Mullaney, I read the commentary you refer to on slate.com. I hope you'll take a look at another piece on slate.com, by Jack Shafer, which defends us. ""The evidence the paper provides more than adequately establishes that McCain remains a better preacher about ethics, standards, appearances, and special interest conflicts than he is a practitioner, something voters should consider before punching the ballot for him,"" is Shafer's conclusion. You can probably guess which commentary I liked better.Did The Times Violate Its Standards on Anonymity?Q. Why did The New York Times not follow its own most-recently publicized rule onsourcing in its stories? As I understand the policy is that The New York Times will only use unidentified sources as a last resource and if it needs to do so it will at least give a reason why these sources have to remain anonymous. This article in The New York Times did neither. Why?Q. There are numerous unnamed sources and a large number of ""staff"" or""campaign"" officials who are quoted or used as references in this story. Has The New York Times exceeded good judgment by having absolutely no named individuals corroborating this story? What procedures did the editors use to ensure that these stories were not the work of a small number of individuals who conspired to embarrass Mr. McCain or The New York Times?A. We have received lots of questions on the use of anonymous sources in the story and these two are representative of many of them.It is always preferable to have named sources in stories. In 2003, The Times appointed a standards editor to the masthead, and tightened its standards for anonymous sourcing in 2004. In the case of our McCain story, Times standards were followed and senior editors knew the identities of the sources for the story, who provided detailed and consistent accounts about their concerns about the senator's relationship with a Washington lobbyist. On many important stories, especially on controversies involving Washington politics and policy battles, sources request anonymity for different reasons. Some fear retribution, including loss of their positions. Some are motivated by a desire to share sensitive information that they deem in the public interest but fear disclosing their identities for a variety of reasons. Others have less selfless reasons.Much as we prefer on-the-record (or even documentary) information, and editors and reporters push hard on sources to let us use their names, without the ability to protect sources newspapers would not have been able to report on important activities of the government and other powerful institutions, and political reporting would be much more a kind of event-driven stenography.Our mission is to inform our readers, which includes giving as much information as possible about sources. Our new standards require that when we use anonymous sources we disclose and publish as much as we can about their backgrounds and motivations. In the McCain story we had named sources and anonymous sources. We disclosed as much about them as we could. In the case of two anonymous sources, the story said, ""The two associates, who said that they had become disillusioned with the senator, spoke independently of each other and provided details that were corroborated by others.""The potential bias of ""disillusioned"" sources was carefully weighed against their accounts. The sources corroborated one another without orchestration, an issue, among others, that our team meticulously investigated. During the long process of our reporting on the story, we attempted, time and time again, to persuade our sources to go on the record and let us use their names. Again, there are named sources in the story but some sources continued to insist on maintaining the cloak ofanonymity. As we neared publication, both the editors and the reporting team once again tested the veracity of these sources to make sure every fact in the story was accurate. We were all fully satisfied.Why Did The Times Endorse McCain?Q. Why did The New York Times strongly endorse Senator McCain to be the Republican Party nominee in January, if at the same time the paper was well aware of and continuing to investigate what it considered to be front-page, damaging, “un-presidential” charges?A. The short answer is that the news department of The Times and the editorial page are totally separate operations that do not consult or coordinate when it comes to news coverage and endorsements or other expressions of editorial opinion. We in the newsroom did not speak to anyone at the editorial page about the story we were working on about Senator McCain. They did not consult us about their deliberations over endorsements of the presidential candidates. I’m the political editor, and the first I knew of the McCain endorsement (and of the endorsement of Hillary Clinton on the Democratic side) was when I read them in the newspaper. In all of our internal discussions about the news story subsequent to the endorsement, I do not recall anyone bringing it up.As your question suggests, this particular situation was especially odd because most everyone in politics and journalism — including, I assume, our colleagues on the editorial page — knew we were working on a story about Senator McCain, courtesy of an item on Drudge in December. Whether that influenced the editorial page’s deliberations, I have no idea.But it meant that there were a lot of people speculating for months about what kind of story we were pursuing and whether and when we were going to publish it. This didn’t influence the timing or the substance of the story at all, but I do think it created a situation in which opinions and battle lines about the story began to develop long before the actual story was published.Q. Why was the ball dress photo used?Q. Did you discuss the damage that might be done to the woman by including hername and photograph? What about John McCain and his family?A. The short, practical answer is that the picture of Ms. Iseman attending an awards dinner in Washington was the only photograph we could find from a legitimate, licensable source (in this case, Getty Images). Some news organizations pulled a low-resolution picture of her from her own professional Web site, but we prefer to obtain our photographs from quality photo agencies whenever possible. We cropped the picture to show only her face, and we ran it on page A19 with the jump of the story, alongside a photo of one of her clients who is referred to in the story. (On the Web, we ran a small head-and-torso crop of the same picture.)The much bigger question implicit in Mr. Pierson's question and explicit in Ms. King's, is, don't people have a right to privacy? Shelves of lawbooks and libraries full of journalism dissertations have been devoted to this question, and I won't pretend to do justice to that debate here. Yes, we do think about and discuss the human consequences of our stories, particularly sensitive stories like this one. (Those of us who have been written about ourselves may be more keenly sensitive on this issue.) I believe that public figures, even people running for high office, are entitled to a zone of privacy. Editors at different publications differ widely on what falls within that zone, and the judgments will vary with circumstances. But oneimportant test is, is this information of value to the public? Does it tell us something useful to voters in appraising the character or performance of people who work, after all, for them? I would argue that a senator's relationship with a lobbyist who represents interests before his committee clearly meets that standard. And it would seem a little ridiculous not to name the lobbyist, who is publicly registered on behalf of her clients, and whose identity is well known within the Washington political world.Why the Reference to Aides' Concerns About Romance?Q. If the real story is the appearance of impropriety by Senator McCain when facilitating donor's interests, why include the sexual innuendo? Wouldn't the implicit accusation of adultery have been better served as its own article, once there was sufficient evidence to support it? Does this story rely on the assumption that the presence of women in male-dominated industries, such as politics or business, inherently creates the perception of impropriety? Why deliberately show Ms. Iseman in a party dress? Were there no available pictures of her in professional attire?Q. The senator denies having a ""romantic"" relationship with the woman in question. Which makes me wonder: Was the word ""romantic"" chosen for its power to obfuscate — perhaps in exactly the same way that President Bill Clinton used a narrow definition of ""sex"" to deny the true nature of his relationship with his now-famous intern? In essence, President Clinton defined ""sex"" as ""sexual intercourse"" — thus excluding his conduct from falling within the meaning of ""sex."" Based on The Times's investigation so far, can we know with reasonable certainty whether Senator McCain is doing likewise? Might he too, be narrowly defining his terms, and shrewdly distinguishing between ""romantic"" relationships (which he claims didn't have) and ""physical"" and/or ""sexual"" ones (which he hasn't technically denied.)? Shouldn't someone ask that as a follow-up?Q. Do you have substantiation in the form of hotel info, cell phone info, airplane manifests, etc., more than just annonymous sources? Anything else?Q. Gabriel Sherman's New Republic piece about your investigation stated that ""reporters investigating the story ... believed they had nailed it."" What did you believe you had ""nailed""? Was it that you had sufficient evidence to imply that Senator John McCain was having an affair with Vicki Iseman? Was it that Ms. Iseman had bought McCain's votes and influence? Was it that McCain is not as morally righteous as he claims to be?A. This batch of questions reflects reader concern over material in the story about the intervention of top McCain advisers who were convinced that Senator McCain's relationship with the lobbyist, Vicki Iseman, had become romantic.Our reporting team learned from several sources that aides to Senator McCain had become concerned that he was having too much contact with Ms. Iseman. Their concern, which became so heightened that they confronted Senator McCain, was triggered by several issues. One was that Ms. Iseman is a lobbyist with clients who have vital business before the Senate commerce committee, of which Mr. McCain was chairman. Another was that she had been talking about her ties to him. Another was that she was showing up frequently in his office, at fund-raisers and other occasions, including a flight on a client's corporate jet. And they were also concerned because they believed the relationship between the senator and Ms. Iseman had become romantic.We believed it was vital for the story to accurately reflect the range of concerns shared by our sources. If they had told us that their concerns stemmed only from Ms. Iseman's lobbying work, this is what the published story would have said. But this was not the case. The Washington Post published a similar story after we posted the Times story on our Web site, and theirs reported that the aides who confronted Senator McCain were concerned about her being a lobbyist. It made no mention of romance. Obviously, I have no knowledge of who The Post's sources were and what they said. I believe The Post story is, like ours, an accurate reflection of what sources told Post reporters.If the editors had summarily decided to edit out the issue of romance, because of possible qualms over ""sexual innuendo"" or some of the others issues cited in the reader questions, our story would not have been a complete and accurate reflection of what our sources told our reporters. The editors and the reporting team believed it was important for readers to know what could have concerned top advisers so much that they confronted their boss. We believe the story did this fairly and accurately, giving readers as much information as we could.Documents are always useful in reporting, but they are not required. The Times story was not about a romantic relationship. It was about a senator who had been embroiled in scandal, then rebuilt his career as a reformer and concern among his aides that his relationship with Ms. Iseman was putting that career at risk.Certainly the story in no way said or suggested that women in male-dominated professions create the perception of impropriety.What Affected the Timing of Publication?Q. Why did you wait this long to go with a story Drudge reported months ago thereby giving McCain time to put together a defense? What is the meaning of ""romantic?"" How do you know you are not being set up? Good reporting.Q. I have heard reports that the timing of release of your story was influenced by a story critical of The New York Times for somehow ""holding"" this same story. Were you aware of this other story?Q. Could you please be more forthcoming about the news judgment that led youto report what you did, when you did? It would also be helpful if we could know whether, as has been reported elsewhere, McCain asked that this story be surpressed. It would furthermore be helpful to know whether other invested parties have pushed or pulled on the story. Did you seek the opinion of legal counsel before printing? May we know whether you have done so in response to external threats?Q. Do you think, realistically, that this story would have broken anyway, whether via The Times or some other news outlet, given the extreme media scrutiny focused on a presidential nominee? (My impression — by the way — is that this story was inevitable, and I'm just glad it was handled in a responsible and thorough fashion by The New York Times — a source I trust.)A. Lots of questions and lots of the comments posted with the story concerned timing. Why NOW? Why not sooner? Why not later? Similar questions often arise when we publish sensitive stories during an election season. If we publish on the eve of a big vote, some will accuse us of a ""sneak attack"" or ""ambush."" If we hold off, for whatever reason, conspiracy theorists will impute other motives — we didn't want to hurt the candidate, or we were threatened in some way, or we wimped out.I can't say this often enough. We publish stories when they are ready. That means we have nailed down all the facts to our satisfaction. It means we have tried to test our information — what we sometimes refer to as ""reporting against the story."" It means we have offered the subjects of the story full and fair opportunity to respond to what we have learned. Itmeans we put the information together as clearly and fairly as possible, including the necessary context and caveats. This can all take a lot of time. Reporters get on airplanes to go interview sources in person, and often it takes multiple interviews. (Or reporters get diverted to work on other breaking news.) Often a story goes through many drafts, and drafts get sent back for additional reporting or clearer writing. Then it gets a final editorial polish. Also, on stories that cast a person or organization in any kind of unflattering light, we ask our in-house lawyers to review them. (Yes, Mr. Crowley, this story was ""lawyered,"" as we say. No, that was not in response to any threat.)We assigned a team of reporters to this story last fall, and it was not ready — that is, it met all the conditions listed above — until this week. Back when the Drudge Report (whose proprietor boasts that he gets things ""80 percent accurate"") reported in December that The Times was working on this story, that's exactly what we were doing: working on this story. Nobody who participated in this venture — neither reporters nor editors — would tell you that we had sufficient confidence to publish astory at that time.Around that time, Senator McCain called me. No, Mr. Crowley, he did not ask that the story be suppressed. He did express concern that all of our digging might give rise to rumors, and he asked that we not let it drag on. I used the opportunity to ask him about the suspicion of some of his staffers that he had a romantic or sexual relationship with Ms. Iseman. He said he did not.Yes, Mr. Cleary, we were aware that a reporter for The New Republic was working on some kind of ""back story"" about our work on this story. No, it did not affect the timing of publication. The latest draft of the story landed on my desk — or, more precisely, in my e-mail — Tuesday afternoon. I thought it was excellent (for the record, I still think so) and we scheduled it for the Thursday paper.David Kirkpatrick, one of the reporters who worked on the story, has filed these additional thoughts:Q. As the story was being prepared, but before it appeared, did The Timesoffer Senator McCain or his staff an opportunity to comment? If so, what was the response?A. The reporting team had various conversations and e-mail exchanges with Senator McCain’s representatives throughout the process. The campaign denied several requests for interviews with the senator.As the story noted, Mr. McCain contacted the newspaper once, calling Mr. Keller to complain about the reporters’ inquiries, in December. The first extensive interview between Mr. McCain’s representatives and the reporting team took place at the lobbying offices of Charles Black, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain, on Dec. 14. In that session, the New York Times reporters requested various documentation, including phone records, office schedules and airplane manifests dating to the 1990s. The reporters followed up with several questions about Ms. Iseman’s lobbying efforts before the senator and his committee. Mr. McCain’s aides agreed to provide as much of the requested information as possible, but noted that this would take some time (they ultimately said they could not locate some of the documentation). Three of the reporters also met with Mr. McCain’s attorney, Robert S. Bennett, at his offices later in December.The exchange of questions and answers continued off and on until Wednesday, when the newspaper submitted another request for an interview with Senator McCain. That request was denied. And, through Mr. Black, Mr. McCain declined to comment on former associates’ accounts of meetings in which he was confronted with their concerns about his ties to Ms. Iseman.The Times also made repeated efforts to seek Ms. Iseman's comments and responses to questions. Beginning in December, she answered some questions by e-mail, though she declined to speak to reporters on the phone. She againdeclined a phone interview the day of publication.Q. While answering questions from Times readers is commendable and should bepracticed by other news organizations, and with Mr. Keller's interview onNPR in mind, hasn't The Times's defense of itself been too aloof andpassive? Anyone who turns on the TV or radio, or logs on to the Internetis viewing a completely lopsided argument. Almost every commentator orguest denounces, curses, or at least questions the NYT, while there isnearly no push-back or defense from The Times. How can you allow yourselfto be punching bags, but still convince the public that your controversialstories have merit? Can't one of the editors or reporters on the story bea presence in this debate on TV without seeming defensive, offensive orpartisan and simply tell the viewers what you are telling readers now onthis Web site? Thanks for making yourself available.A. Well, fair question. We're a little schizophrenic about this. We want tostick up for our journalism, but we resist becoming the story, and weespecially resist seeing a long, painstaking work of reporting reduced to awar of sound bites. Personally, I think there are lots of things televisionexcels at in the realm of news and public affairs. I have enormous respectfor quite a few television journalists, and occasionally one of themconvinces me to subdue my stage fright and go on TV. But in the heat oftelevision, sober reflection on serious, subtle questions tends to lose outto the glib, the confrontational, the sensational, the snide, thebelligerent. At its worst — and on this subject, much of television hasbeen at its worst — it's not discussion. It's mud wrestling. What we'rehaving here on the Web may fall short of a memorable Socratic dialogue, butat least there is time to pause and explain and think.Q. Has the McCain campaign limited The Times's access to Senator McCain orcampaign staffers in the aftermath of the story? How can The Times assureadequate coverage of the Republican side of the presidential race when thepresumptive nominee is crusading against the paper, even using it as arallying cry for donations?A. There are certainly politicians who hold a grudge, and our reportershave spent periods consigned to the doghouse by both Democrats andRepublicans after stories they disliked. But generally with experiencedpoliticians like Senator McCain, disputes like this have a shortshelf-life. Campaign operatives know that cutting off access — especiallyto a paper as influential as The Times — just limits their ability to getout their message. And Senator McCain, I think, actually enjoys the companyof serious reporters. In any case, our reporter traveling with McCain hasexperienced no retribution. As you note, the campaign has used its battlewith The Times in fund-raising appeals, but Mr. McCain himself seems to havemoved on.Q. If you knew 48 hours ago what you know now, would you have run the story?A. Yes. I've written a few mea culpas at this paper, and I believe that whenwe get something wrong we have an obligation to own up to it. This is notone of those times. I'm proud to stand by this story.I wish I had the time and energy to respond to every one of the 4,000(4,000!) of you who submitted questions. We did our best to answer a trulyrepresentative sample, to hit all the most important themes, to give yousome sense of the arduous and complicated process that produced animportant story. And I expect you have not heard the last of us on thissubject. Now I'd like to go tuck in my children.Q. I would like to know if your newspaper will be also that vigilant in pursuing anything controversial about the two Democratic contenders. Just to make a point to your readers that being a liberal newspaper, your editorial staff/reporters will not be biased.A. We not only will be just as vigilant in examining the Democratic presidential candidates as we have been in examining the Republicans, we already have been.For more than a year, The Times has had teams of reporters looking at the lives and careers of all the candidates in both parties, including Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, as well as former Senator John Edwards before he got out of the race. We have already produced a thick catalog of stories about them. You can find our series of biographical pieces archived here.Beyond the biographical pieces, we have made a special effort to explore ties between each of the candidates and people or interest groups that have provided financial support to him or her or might otherwise influence him or her in office.We’ve broken a lot of news on that front and provided readers with a much fuller understanding of how each of the candidates deals with donors, special pleaders, constituents and others who might seek to sway them or be perceived as doing so.Don Van Natta and Jo Becker, two of our most accomplished investigative reporters, gave us ground-breaking stories about the Clinton fund-raising network. They penetrated the secrecy surrounding the William J. Clinton Foundation to show how its fund-raising has at times fostered the potential for conflict. They followed up with a look at how a Canadian mining financier who accompanied former President Clinton on a trip to Kazakhstan in 2005 subsequently won a coveted contract from Kazakhstan’s state-owned uranium agency — and then made a $31.1 million donation to Mr. Clinton’s charitable foundation.We have looked at other elements of Senator and Mr. Clinton’s ties to various interests. We closely tracked the saga of Norman Hsu, a big fund-raiser for Senator Clinton’s presidential campaign, who turned out to be a fugitive and, allegedly, a con man.We have delved as well into Senator Obama’s past and record. Mike McIntire reported recently on his handling of legislation to address radioactive leaks from a nuclear plant operated by the Exelon Corporation, a company based in Illinois whose executives have been major contributors to his campaigns. Among other things, Mike’s story exposed as false a claim Mr. Obama had made on the campaign trail about passing legislation requiring all plant owners to notify state and local authorities immediately of even small leaks.Late last year we took a look at Mr. Obama’s voting record in the Illinois Legislature and found a pattern of “present” votes in which he was able to avoid voting for or against controversial legislation. And we explored his dealings with Antoin Rezko, a Chicago entrepreneur who raised money for him, was involved in a real estate deal with him and is scheduled to go on trial next month on federal influence-peddling charges unconnected to him.We believe that voters should know as much as it is possible for us to tell them about all the candidates, the people and groups who wield influence with them and how they make decisions. That is true for Republicans and Democrats alike. Our stories go where our reporting takes us.Q. Why didn’t you mention the approximately 12 specific times that John McCain voted against positions that Iseman was advocating on behalf of her client on specific legislation? Robert Bennett says that information was furnished to The Times. Was it? Was it relevant? Is his assertion true? Did you even check?A. Mr. McCain’s campaign sent The New York Times a list of 13 legislative items that concerned Ms. Iseman’s clients and those of her firm, Alcalde & Fay. It was entitled: “Senator McCain Introduced Many Bills That Were Opposed by Alcalde and Fay on Behalf of Their Clients.” The campaign also sent us a list of what it said were mostly related requests from Alcalde & Fay that Mr. McCain denied.We spent days reviewing these examples.The list included a few bills that were introduced during different sessions of Congress, but were very similar to one another. A couple of the examples were solid, and we mentioned them in our article.For instance, some of Ms. Iseman’s clients opposed Mr. McCain’s efforts in 2006 to force cable companies to offer their subscribers more say in the channels they receive in their basic programming packages. And, in 2004, some of her broadcasting clients wanted Mr. McCain to further strengthen a proposal they believed would force EchoStar, the satellite television provider, to treat them more favorably.But several other examples were less clear cut.One of the items involved a provision that two of Ms. Iseman’s clients opposed because it would have forced them to shed some of their television stations.But a review of Congressional records found that Mr. McCain opposed that provision, too. He voted against it in 2003 when it was presented as an amendment to a broader bill related to the continued funding of the Federal Communications Commission. He was also quoted as criticizing the amendment in newspaper articles at the time.We asked the senator’s aides whether this was not a matter in which he had actually sided with Ms. Iseman’s clients. They acknowledged the vote, but said the item was included on their list because Mr. McCain continued supporting the larger bill even after that losing vote. (They said he cast his vote against the provision on principle, and in deference to technical experts at the F.C.C.)The campaign’s list also included a couple of very similar cruise-industry bills that it said were of concern to a trade group represented by Alcalde & Fay.The document said the trade group “was critical” of the proposals. But a partner in the firm, Cynthia Colenda, had testified in 1999 that the trade group did not have a formal position on the stipulations because they would not have any effect on its members’ operations. The McCain campaign answered questions about her testimony by saying that the trade group’s overall statements that the bill was unnecessary, and might not achieve its authors’ intent, amounted to a critique.In still other instances, the campaign presented bills that had not necessarily been actively opposed by her clients, but by the large trade group to which they belonged, the National Association of Broadcasters (The NAB Web site says it represents 8,300 television and radio stations.)Responding to follow-up questions, Mr. McCain’s staff said that in some of these cases neither Ms. Iseman nor her colleagues had lobbied Mr. McCain, though they may have discussed the issues with his staff members (they did not say so definitively).We did not necessarily have a lot to work with in this document for the purposes of this particular article, and we took from it what we could. We continue to welcome further clarification from the McCain campaign on any or all of this.'"
"'08-02-21,'0','It turns out that buyers of R2-D2 Interactive Droids ($129) are not the best repeat customers.That left the Sharper Image struggling for an identity in consumer electronics, a product line that is among the most competitive in American retailing.The chain began experiencing “steady sales declines,” in 2004, according to its bankruptcy filing. Its profits fell throughout 2005, 2006 and 2007.It was not alone. Over the last decade, dozens of local and national electronics retailers like Tweeter, Crazy Eddie and CompUSA have either filed for bankruptcy or closed. “It’s a pretty illustrious list,” said David Schick, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.As quickly as an electronic product is introduced, he said, two things happen: dozens of retailers begin to carry it and consumers expect its price to fall. “It is very difficult business,” Mr. Schick said.Sharper Image tried to avoid that problem with distinctive, even zany products that could not be found anywhere else, at least for a while.But that led the company to take big bets on a few products, a risky strategy that cost it dearly in at least one widely publicized case. Sharper Image was an early seller of air purifiers, which it sold, rather briskly, under the name Ionic Breeze.But in 2005, a Consumer Reports study suggested that the product might be dangerous to users because the purifiers generated small amounts of ozone. Sales plunged. Air purifiers, which accounted for 28 percent of the chain’s sales in 2005, fell to 9.4 percent of sales in 2007.Lawsuits from Ionic Breeze owners soon followed. A California case has been certified as a class action, which could translate into significant legal costs for the company.A proposed settlement of an Ionic Breeze lawsuit in Florida was rejected by a judge in October, sending Shaper Image’s stock plunging. Soon after, many suppliers began demanding cash payments upon delivery, which left the chain with little money to run its business, according to its bankruptcy filing.The 2007 holiday season provided little relief. In January, a time when consumers are busy redeeming gift cards, sales at stores open at least a year fell 11 percent at Sharper Image, and overall revenue fell 23 percent.The retailer’s management now says that 90 stores, about half of all Sharper Image’s outlets, are performing poorly and should be closed “as soon as possible.”'"
"'08-02-21,'0','But the concerns about Mr. McCain’s relationship with Ms. Iseman underscored an enduring paradox of his post-Keating career. Even as he has vowed to hold himself to the highest ethical standards, his confidence in his own integrity has sometimes seemed to blind him to potentially embarrassing conflicts of interest.Mr. McCain promised, for example, never to fly directly from Washington to , his hometown, to avoid the impression of self-interest because he sponsored a law that opened the route nearly a decade ago. But like other lawmakers, he often flew on the corporate jets of business executives seeking his support, including the media moguls , and Lowell W. Paxson, Ms. Iseman’s client. (Last year he voted to end the practice.)Mr. McCain helped found a nonprofit group to promote his personal battle for tighter campaign finance rules. But he later resigned as its chairman after news reports disclosed that the group was tapping the same kinds of unlimited corporate contributions he opposed, including those from companies seeking his favor. He has criticized the cozy ties between lawmakers and lobbyists, but is relying on corporate lobbyists to donate their time running his presidential race and recently hired a lobbyist to run his Senate office.“He is essentially an honorable person,” said William P. Cheshire, a friend of Mr. McCain who as editorial page editor of The Arizona Republic defended him during the Keating Five scandal. “But he can be imprudent.”Mr. Cheshire added, “That imprudence or recklessness may be part of why he was not more astute about the risks he was running with this shady operator,” Charles Keating, whose ties to Mr. McCain and four other lawmakers tainted their reputations in the savings and loan debacle.During his current campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, Mr. McCain has played down his attacks on the corrupting power of money in politics, aware that the stricter regulations he championed are unpopular in his party. When the Senate overhauled lobbying and ethics rules last year, Mr. McCain stayed in the background.With his nomination this year all but certain, though, he is reminding voters again of his record of reform. His campaign has already begun comparing his credentials with those of Senator , a Democratic contender who has made lobbying and ethics rules a centerpiece of his own pitch to voters.“I would very much like to think that I have never been a man whose favor can be bought,” Mr. McCain wrote about his Keating experience in his 2002 memoir, “Worth the Fighting For.” “From my earliest youth, I would have considered such a reputation to be the most shameful ignominy imaginable. Yet that is exactly how millions of Americans viewed me for a time, a time that I will forever consider one of the worst experiences of my life.”A drive to expunge the stain on his reputation in time turned into a zeal to cleanse Washington as well. The episode taught him that “questions of honor are raised as much by appearances as by reality in politics,” he wrote, “and because they incite public distrust they need to be addressed no less directly than we would address evidence of expressly illegal corruption.”Mr. McCain started his career like many other aspiring politicians, eagerly courting the wealthy and powerful. A Vietnam war hero and Senate liaison for the Navy, he arrived in in 1980 after his second marriage, to Cindy Hensley, the heiress to a beer fortune there. He quickly started looking for a Congressional district where he could run.Mr. Keating, a Phoenix financier and real estate developer, became an early sponsor and, soon, a friend. He was a man of great confidence and daring, Mr. McCain recalled in his memoir. “People like that appeal to me,” he continued. “I have sometimes forgotten that wisdom and a strong sense of public responsibility are much more admirable qualities.”During Mr. McCain’s four years in the House, Mr. Keating, his family and his business associates contributed heavily to his political campaigns. The banker gave Mr. McCain free rides on his private jet, a violation of Congressional ethics rules (he later said it was an oversight and paid for the trips). They vacationed together in the . And in 1986, the year Mr. McCain was elected to the Senate, his wife joined Mr. Keating in investing in an Arizona shopping mall.Mr. Keating had taken over the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association and used its federally insured deposits to gamble on risky real estate and other investments. He pressed Mr. McCain and other lawmakers to help hold back federal banking regulators.For years, Mr. McCain complied. At Mr. Keating’s request, he wrote several letters to regulators, introduced legislation and helped secure the nomination of a Keating associate to a banking regulatory board.By early 1987, though, the thrift was careering toward disaster. Mr. McCain agreed to join several senators, eventually known as the Keating Five, for two private meetings with regulators to urge them to ease up. “Why didn’t I fully grasp the unusual appearance of such a meeting?” Mr. McCain later lamented in his memoir.When Lincoln went bankrupt in 1989 — one of the biggest collapses of the savings and loan crisis, costing taxpayers $3.4 billion — the Keating Five became infamous. The scandal sent Mr. Keating to prison and ended the careers of three senators, who were rebuked by the Senate Ethics Committee in 1991 for intervening. Mr. McCain, who had been a less aggressive advocate for Mr. Keating than the others, was reprimanded only for “poor judgment” and was re-elected the next year.Some people involved think Mr. McCain got off too lightly. William Black, one of the banking regulators the senator met with, argued that Mrs. McCain’s investment with Mr. Keating created an obvious conflict of interest for her husband. (Mr. McCain had said a prenuptial agreement divided the couple’s assets.) He should not be able to “put this behind him,” Mr. Black said. “It sullied his integrity.”Mr. McCain has since described the episode as a unique humiliation. “If I do not repress the , its recollection still provokes a vague but real feeling that I had lost something very important,” he wrote in his memoir. “I still wince thinking about it.”After the Republican takeover of the Senate in 1994, Mr. McCain decided to try to put some of the lessons he had learned into law. He started by attacking earmarks, the pet projects that individual lawmakers could insert anonymously into the fine print of giant spending bills, a recipe for corruption. But he quickly moved on to other targets, most notably political fund-raising.Mr. McCain earned the lasting animosity of many conservatives, who argue that his push for fund-raising restrictions trampled free speech, and of many of his Senate colleagues, who bristled that he was preaching to them so soon after his own repentance. In debates, his party’s leaders challenged him to name a single senator he considered corrupt (he refused).“We used to joke that each of us was the only one eating alone in our caucus,” said Senator , Democrat of , who became Mr. McCain’s partner on campaign finance efforts.Mr. McCain appeared motivated less by the usual ideas about good governance than by a more visceral disapproval of the gifts, meals and money that influence seekers shower on lawmakers, Mr. Feingold said. “It had to do with his sense of honor,” he said. “He saw this stuff as cheating.”Mr. McCain made loosening the grip of special interests the central cause of his 2000 presidential campaign, inviting scrutiny of his own ethics. His Republican rival, , accused him of “double talk” for soliciting campaign contributions from companies with interests that came before the powerful Senate commerce committee, of which Mr. McCain was chairman. Mr. Bush’s allies called Mr. McCain “sanctimonious.”At one point, his campaign invited scores of lobbyists to a fund-raiser at the Willard Hotel in Washington. While Bush supporters stood mocking outside, the McCain team tried to defend his integrity by handing the lobbyists buttons reading “McCain voted against my bill.” Mr. McCain himself skipped the event, an act he later called “cowardly.”By 2002, he had succeeded in passing the McCain-Feingold Act, which transformed American politics by banning “soft money,” the unlimited donations from corporations, unions and the rich that were funneled through the two political parties to get around previous laws.One of his efforts, though, seemed self-contradictory. In 2001, he helped found the nonprofit Reform Institute to promote his cause and, in the process, his career. It collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in unlimited donations from companies that lobbied the Senate commerce committee. Mr. McCain initially said he saw no problems with the financing, but he severed his ties to the institute in 2005, complaining of “bad publicity” after news reports of the arrangement.Like other presidential candidates, he has relied on lobbyists to run his campaigns. Since a cash crunch last summer, several of them — including his campaign manager, Rick Davis, who represented companies before Mr. McCain’s Senate panel — have been working without pay, a gift that could be worth tens of thousands of dollars.In recent weeks, Mr. McCain has hired another lobbyist, Mark Buse, to run his Senate office. In his case, it was a round trip through the revolving door: Mr. Buse had directed Mr. McCain’s committee staff for seven years before leaving in 2001 to lobby for telecommunications companies.Mr. McCain’s friends dismiss questions about his ties to lobbyists, arguing that he has too much integrity to let such personal connections influence him.“Unless he gives you special treatment or takes legislative action against his own views, I don’t think his personal and social relationships matter,” said Charles Black, a friend and campaign adviser who has previously lobbied the senator for aviation, broadcasting and tobacco concerns.Mr. McCain’s confidence in his ability to distinguish personal friendships from compromising connections was at the center of questions advisers raised about Ms. Iseman.The lobbyist, a partner at the firm Alcalde & Fay, represented telecommunications companies for whom Mr. McCain’s commerce committee was pivotal. Her clients contributed tens of thousands of dollars to his campaigns.Mr. Black said Mr. McCain and Ms. Iseman were friends and nothing more. But in 1999 she began showing up so frequently in his offices and at campaign events that staff members took notice. One recalled asking, “Why is she always around?”That February, Mr. McCain and Ms. Iseman attended a small fund-raising dinner with several clients at the -area home of a -line executive and then flew back to Washington along with a campaign aide on the corporate jet of one of her clients, Paxson Communications. By then, according to two former McCain associates, some of the senator’s advisers had grown so concerned that the relationship had become romantic that they took steps to intervene.A former campaign adviser described being instructed to keep Ms. Iseman away from the senator at public events, while a Senate aide recalled plans to limit Ms. Iseman’s access to his offices.In interviews, the two former associates said they joined in a series of confrontations with Mr. McCain, warning him that he was risking his campaign and career. Both said Mr. McCain acknowledged behaving inappropriately and pledged to keep his distance from Ms. Iseman. The two associates, who said they had become disillusioned with the senator, spoke independently of each other and provided details that were corroborated by others.Separately, a top McCain aide met with Ms. Iseman at Union Station in Washington to ask her to stay away from the senator. John Weaver, a former top strategist and now an informal campaign adviser, said in an e-mail message that he arranged the meeting after “a discussion among the campaign leadership” about her.“Our political messaging during that time period centered around taking on the special interests and placing the nation’s interests before either personal or special interest,” Mr. Weaver continued. “Ms. Iseman’s involvement in the campaign, it was felt by us, could undermine that effort.”Mr. Weaver added that the brief conversation was only about “her conduct and what she allegedly had told people, which made its way back to us.” He declined to elaborate.It is not clear what effect the warnings had; the associates said their concerns receded in the heat of the campaign.Ms. Iseman acknowledged meeting with Mr. Weaver, but disputed his account.“I never discussed with him alleged things I had ‘told people,’ that had made their way ‘back to’ him,” she wrote in an e-mail message. She said she never received special treatment from Mr. McCain’s office.Mr. McCain said that the relationship was not romantic and that he never showed favoritism to Ms. Iseman or her clients. “I have never betrayed the public trust by doing anything like that,” he said. He made the statements in a call to , the executive editor of The New York Times, to complain about the paper’s inquiries.The senator declined repeated interview requests, beginning in December. He also would not comment about the assertions that he had been confronted about Ms. Iseman, Mr. Black said Wednesday.Mr. Davis and Mark Salter, Mr. McCain’s top strategists in both of his presidential campaigns, disputed accounts from the former associates and aides and said they did not discuss Ms. Iseman with the senator or colleagues.“I never had any good reason to think that the relationship was anything other than professional, a friendly professional relationship,” Mr. Salter said in an interview.He and Mr. Davis also said Mr. McCain had frequently denied requests from Ms. Iseman and the companies she represented. In 2006, Mr. McCain sought to break up cable subscription packages, which some of her clients opposed. And his proposals for satellite distribution of local television programs fell short of her clients’ hopes.The McCain aides said the senator sided with Ms. Iseman’s clients only when their positions hewed to his principles.A champion of deregulation, Mr. McCain wrote letters in 1998 and 1999 to the urging it to uphold marketing agreements allowing a television company to control two stations in the same city, a crucial issue for Glencairn Ltd., one of Ms. Iseman’s clients. He introduced a bill to create tax incentives for minority ownership of stations; Ms. Iseman represented several businesses seeking such a program. And he twice tried to advance legislation that would permit a company to control television stations in overlapping markets, an important issue for Paxson.In late 1999, Ms. Iseman asked Mr. McCain’s staff to send a letter to the commission to help Paxson, now Ion Media Networks, on another matter. Mr. Paxson was impatient for F.C.C. approval of a television deal, and Ms. Iseman acknowledged in an e-mail message to The Times that she had sent to Mr. McCain’s staff information for drafting a letter urging a swift decision.Mr. McCain complied. He sent two letters to the commission, drawing a rare rebuke for interference from its chairman. In an embarrassing turn for the campaign, news reports invoked the Keating scandal, once again raising questions about intervening for a patron.Mr. McCain’s aides released all of his letters to the F.C.C. to dispel accusations of favoritism, and aides said the campaign had properly accounted for four trips on the Paxson plane. But the campaign did not report the flight with Ms. Iseman. Mr. McCain’s advisers say he was not required to disclose the flight, but ethics lawyers dispute that.Recalling the Paxson episode in his memoir, Mr. McCain said he was merely trying to push along a slow-moving bureaucracy, but added that he was not surprised by the criticism given his history.“Any hint that I might have acted to reward a supporter,” he wrote, “would be taken as an egregious act of hypocrisy.”Mr. McCain’s presidential campaign issued the following statement Wednesday night:“It is a shame that The New York Times has lowered its standards to engage in a hit-and-run smear campaign. John McCain has a 24-year record of serving our country with honor and integrity. He has never violated the public trust, never done favors for special interests or lobbyists, and he will not allow a smear campaign to distract from the issues at stake in this election.“Americans are sick and tired of this kind of gutter politics, and there is nothing in this story to suggest that John McCain has ever violated the principles that have guided his career.”'"
"'08-02-21,'0','General Cartwright said debris from the strike, with individual pieces no larger than a football, already had begun to re-enter the atmosphere. Most, he said, was predicted to fall into the ocean.Even so, the State Department was alerting American embassies around the world so they could keep their host governments informed, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency had put out instructions to first responders across the United States about steps to take should hazardous debris fall in populated areas.The first international reaction came from China, where the government objected on Thursday to the American missile strike, warning that the United States Navy’s action could threaten security in outer space.Liu Jianchao, the Chinese foreign ministry’s spokesman, said at a news conference in Beijing that the United States should also share data promptly about what will become of the remaining pieces of the satellite, which are expected to re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere and mostly burn up in the next two days.“China is continuously following closely the possible harm caused by the U.S. action to outer space security and relevant countries,” Mr. Liu said, according to the Associated Press. “China requests the U.S. to fulfill its international obligations in real earnest and provide to the international community necessary information and relevant data in a timely and prompt way so that relevant countries can take precautions.”American officials were critical of China last year for using an anti-satellite weapon to destroy a satellite in a much higher orbit in January 2007 and then refusing to confirm the test for nearly two weeks. The Chinese test produced 1,600 pieces of debris that are expected to orbit the Earth for years, preventing other spacecraft from using the same or similar orbits.During a Pentagon news conference Thursday morning, General Cartwright rebuffed those who said the mission was, at least in part, organized to showcase American missile defense or anti-satellite capabilities.He said the missile itself had to be reconfigured from its task of tracking and hitting an adversary’s warhead to instead find a cold, tumbling satellite. “This was a one-time modification,” General Cartwright said.Sensors from the American missile defense system were an important part of this mission, though, he said.He stressed that “the intent here was to preserve human life,” but also acknowledged that “the technical degree of difficulty was significant” and the accomplishment earned cheers from personnel in command centers across the military, as well.Completing a mission in which an interceptor designed for missile defense was used for the first time to attack a satellite, the Lake Erie, an Aegis-class cruiser, fired a single missile just before 10:30 p.m. Eastern time, and the missile hit the satellite as it traveled at more than 17,000 miles per hour, the Pentagon said in its official announcement.“A network of land-, air-, sea- and spaced-based sensors confirms that the U.S. military intercepted a nonfunctioning National Reconnaissance Office satellite which was in its final orbits before entering the Earth’s atmosphere,” the statement said.By early Wednesday, three Navy warships were in position in the Pacific Ocean to launch the interceptors and to track the mission.Radar and other tracking equipment, both in space and on the ground, were monitored at Vandenberg Air Force Base, in California, and at a space command headquarters in Colorado Springs, with control of the operation managed by the Strategic Command in Omaha, Neb.Although the satellite circled the globe every 90 minutes, analysts pinpointed a single overhead pass each day that would offer the best chance of striking the satellite and then having half of the debris fall into the atmosphere in the next three orbits over water or less-populated areas of the Earth.Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who left Washington on Wednesday for a week of meetings in Asia, had been empowered by President Bush to issue the order to shoot down the satellite and gave the order several hours before the strike.The many moving parts of a mission to shoot down a dying spy satellite with an antimissile interceptor were lined up earlier Wednesday after the space shuttle Atlantis returned to Earth, officials said.Military officials said their goal had been to carry out the mission before March 1, when the satellite was expected to start skidding against the upper reaches of the atmosphere.That initial friction would bump the satellite into a more unpredictable Earth orbit, even before it started a fiery descent through the atmosphere.Providing new information about how the mission would be carried out, a senior military officer on Wednesday described the vessels, weapons and command structure for the operationThe senior military officer said the mission would be launched in daylight to take advantage of radar, heat-sensor tracking and visual tracking equipment. The Navy had a window that lasted only tens of seconds as the satellite passed overhead, military officers said.The Lake Erie has two Standard Missile 3 rockets that were adapted to track the cold satellite, as opposed to the heated enemy warheads for which it was designed. A second ship, the destroyer Decatur, had a third missile as backup. Another Navy destroyer, the Russell, sailed with the convoy for added tracking capabilities.The 5,000-pound satellite, roughly the size of a school bus, was managed by the National Reconnaissance Office and went dead shortly after it was launched in December 2006.The FEMA document notes, “Any debris should be considered potentially hazardous, and first responders should not attempt to pick it up or move it.”'"

"'08-02-22,'1','The market’s early decline followed a sell-off Thursday that left the Dow down more than 140 points, or 1.15 percent. Investors worried about a weaker-than-expected reading on regional manufacturing from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia as well as another drop in the Conference Board’s monthly index of leading economic indicators.“I think what really still seems to be dragging the market down are some of the those manufacturing numbers,” said Ryan Detrick, strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati, referring to the Philadelphia Fed report as well as regional manufacturing findings from the New York Fed last week. “It just shows that the fears that the U.S. economy is in recession are continuing to dominate.”Bond prices reversed alongside stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.81 percent from 3.78 percent late Thursday. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices rose.Light, sweet crude for April delivery rose 58 cents to settle at $98.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid concerns about potential supply disruptions and cold weather.The day’s late reversal appeared to ease some of Wall Street’s concerns about the prospects for the financial sector and the overall economy after a stream of mostly weak economic readings. The downbeat economic readings that have arrived in recent weeks have raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve will be able to fend off recession. There have been fears that the United States may be entering a period of stagflation — when stalling growth accompanies rising prices — for the first time since the 1970s.As occurred Wednesday and again late Friday, investors at times set aside those concerns and snapped up stocks either to cover bets that stocks would fall or amid genuine, if tentative, optimism that officials from the Fed to other parts of the government could help right the economy. Wednesday’s gains which followed a quiet start to the week Tuesday — markets were closed for Presidents’ Day on Monday — came after minutes from the Fed’s last meeting indicated that the central bank plans to lower interest rates as needed and look past any gathering concerns about inflation.Wall Street’s bursts of optimism haven’t been long-sustained in recent weeks. Investors remain concerned that the economy could be so weak that rate cuts, which take months to work their way through the economy, won’t stave off a further slowdown. A government-backed plan to aid bond insurers and keep them solvent could help boost confidence in the bond market.The Fed’s next rate-setting meeting is scheduled for March 18. Policy makers lowered key interest rates a half-point to 3 percent on Jan. 30, following an emergency three-quarter point cut the previous week.Mr. Detrick said that among the reports due next week, investors will be looking to readings on producer prices — a key measure of inflation — as well as on consumer sentiment. He noted that recent consumer confidence figures, which have been weak, added to Wall Street’s concerns that hesitant consumers could pare their spending.A pullback among buyers is an unwelcome prospect for investors as consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of United States economic activity.In corporate news, Merrill Lynch lowered its ratings on government-sponsored lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to “sell,” contending the companies face continued headwinds amid the credit crisis. Freddie Mac fell $1.14, or 4.1 percent, to $26.61, while Fannie Mae declined 27 cents to $28.72.The software maker Intuit fell $2.74, or 9.2 percent, to $27.05 after posting a 21 percent decline in its second-quarter profit late Thursday.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.42 billion shares, essentially flat with the low volume seen Thursday.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.85, or 0.12 percent, to 695.43.Overseas, Japan’s Nikkei stock average closed down 1.37 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.74 percent, Germany’s DAX index closed down 1.43 percent, and France’s CAC-40 slid 0.71 percent.'"
"'08-02-22,'1','Mr. Sandlin, who was also indicted on the extortion, fraud, money-laundering and conspiracy charges, was a heavy contributor to Mr. Renzi’s first campaign in Arizona’s First Congressional District, in 2002. The indictment said that Mr. Renzi and Mr. Sandlin concealed at least $733,000 that the Congressman took for helping the lucrative land deal go through.“Congressman Renzi misused his public office by forcing a land sale that would financially benefit himself and a business associate, and in so doing, he betrayed the trust of the citizens of Arizona,” said the United States attorney for Arizona, Diane J. Humetewa.A lawyer for Mr. Renzi, Kelly Kramer, disputed that description of events, telling The Associated Press that the Congressman had done nothing wrong. “We will fight these charges until he is vindicated and his family name is restored,” the lawyer said.Mr. Renzi and another defendant, Andrew Beardall, 36, of Rockville, Md., are also accused of embezzling more than $400,000 in premiums from an account in an Arizona insurance business owned by the Renzi family to help finance Mr. Renzi’s first Congressional campaign.“Essentially, the indictment alleges two courses of criminal activity and conduct,” Ms. Humetewa said at a news conference. ""First, that Congressman Rick Renzi embezzled funds from his own insurance company’s trust accounts, and he used those funds to finance his first congressional campaign in 2001 and in 2002. And acting together, he and Andrew Beardall conspired to get out from under billing statement and state regulatory acts, and in so doing, they made false statements and misrepresentations to regulatory agencies.”“The second pattern of criminal conduct involved Congressman Renzi forcing a land sale that would financially benefit himself and James Sandlin. And in so doing, Congressman Renzi deprived the citizens of Arizona of their right to his honest services as a United States elected representative,"" Ms. Humetewa said.Attempts to reach Mr. Sandlin and Mr. Beardall were not immediately successful.Mr. Renzi has long denied wrongdoing and has called himself the victim of “leaked stories, conjecture and false attacks.”The Congressman has been mentioned in connection with the firings of several United States attorneys in 2006. An aide to Mr. Renzi acknowledged calling the office of the former United States Attorney in Arizona, Paul Charlton, in 2006 to inquire about the investigation of his boss’s affairs. Mr. Charlton reportedly rebuffed the request. He was dismissed not long afterward.Mr. Renzi’s district covers more than half the state of Arizona and is larger than Pennsylvania, according to The Almanac of American Politics. While he has been on the Democrats’ target list almost since taking office, he won re-election in 2006 by 52 to 43 percent over his Democratic challenger (a third-party candidate took the rest), so it is not clear if his departure represents an opportunity for Democrats to add to their 33-seat advantage in the House.But the Democrats seem to think so: Four are actively running for the seat being vacated by Mr. Renzi, while only one Republican is running so far, although a second is expected to enter the race soon. Democrats have a registration edge in the district of about 41.5 percent to 34 percent for Republicans, with the rest independents or Libertarians, according to the Arizona Secretary of State’s office.'"
"'08-02-22,'1','“For me,” she added a moment later, “it really is about what we can do together.”Her opponent, Mr. Obama, spent Friday campaigning in parts of southern and central Texas, targeting areas that are home to many Hispanic voters, who are seen as potentially decisive in the March 4 Texas primary. His first appearance was at the University of Texas-Pan American Friday, his first in the strongly Democratic Rio Grande Valley, where Hillary Clinton has a long history of support. After that, he planned to hold rallies in Corpus Christi and Austin.In an interview on the CBS “Early Show,” Mrs. Clinton was asked directly if her closing debate remarks meant she thought she was going to lose the race. Mr. Obama has won 11 straight contests since the Super Tuesday races on Feb. 5, all by double-digit margins.“No, of course not,” she said. “It is the recognition that both of us are on the brink of historic change. You know, I’m very proud that we have the two of us in this contest seeking the Democratic nomination, hoping to become our next president. Obviously, I believe that, you know, my record and my plans for what we can do for our country are ones that, you know, really are rooted in my experience and my strengths, being able to bring about the positive differences that people talk to me about.”Her appearance in Dallas was marred by the death of the city police motorcyclist killed in a crash while escorting her motorcade. The crash occurred as Mrs. Clinton was being driven from the airport to a rally in the city. The officer was at the head of the line of vehicles. Dallas television station WFAA reported that the motorcycle may have struck a concrete abutment.In the wake of the accident, Mrs. Clinton decided to cancel a rally in Fort Worth, speaking only briefly to the assembling crowds.“Because of this tragedy, we cannot have a rally,” she said. “It is self-evident how much I appreciate your coming, and how important it is that every single day we not only think about those who serve us in all the ways we are served, but that we express that appreciation for those who keep community safe, caring for the sick and teaching our children. So thank you very much for being here and God bless you all.”'"
"'08-02-22,'1','Before the terminal reopens, asbestos must be removed, deteriorating concrete and tiles must be repaired, sections of the roof must be replaced and new doors must be installed, among other measures, Mr. DeCota said.The Port Authority is taking on the work because there were no responses to a request in 2006 for redevelopment proposals, he said. When the building is in better shape, he said, he expected more interest from operators who might use parts of it for an airline lounge, a restaurant, office space, a museum, a hotel or a spa.Christine A. Ferer, a member of the authority’s board of commissioners, said the restoration was “thrilling” but wondered aloud at a subcommittee meeting on Thursday whether JetBlue was paying an appropriate amount for the use of the Saarinen landmark as its front door.“We’re really giving them this beautiful piece of art, this historic building as an entrance to their facility,” she said.Mr. DeCota said that JetBlue was not specifically underwriting renovation of the historic building, but that its rent to the Port Authority was “helping to support this facility” as part of the overall Terminal 5 development project.One element of the Saarinen building will almost certainly not be salvaged: the trumpet-shaped flight departure lounge that used to sit at the end of one of the tubular corridors. Last year, at a cost of about $800,000, it was cut apart from the rest of the structure and moved about 1,500 feet to get it out of the way of construction crews while preservationists, airport officials and airline executives tried to figure out if it could be reused.Though Mr. DeCota declined to say flatly on Thursday that nothing could be done with the trumpet structure, he hinted strongly that the money needed to renovate it — which he put at more than $10 million — would be better spent on the Saarinen head house.The Municipal Art Society, a civic organization that belongs to the redevelopment advisory committee involved with the Saarinen building, believes that any decision to destroy the trumpet structure would be “premature, fiscally irresponsible and historically inappropriate,” said Frank E. Sanchis III, the society’s senior vice president.Mr. Sanchis said that the fate of the trumpet was discussed without consulting the redevelopment committee and that the cost estimates were inflated. On Thursday, the art group appealed to the federal Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in Washington to intervene.'"
"'08-02-22,'1','Mr. McCain said he had never been involved in such discussions. “I don’t know if it happened at their level,” he said. “It certainly didn’t happen to me.”At his news conference, Mr. McCain also said he had no knowledge that a top aide had asked Ms. Iseman to keep her distance from the senator and his campaign. John Weaver, a former top McCain strategist and now an informal campaign adviser, had told The Times that he met with the lobbyist, a partner at the firm Alcalde & Fay, at Union Station in Washington in early 1999.“I don’t know anything about it,” Mr. McCain said. “Since it was in The New York Times, I don’t take it at face value.”Mr. Weaver declined to comment to The Times on Thursday. He told The Washington Post’s Web site, however, that he had not informed Mr. McCain about the meeting in advance.He also expanded on his initial description to The Times of the discussion with Ms. Iseman. He had said, without elaborating, that he had warned Ms. Iseman away because of “what she had told people” that had “made its way back” to the McCain campaign.In a statement to the Web site of The Atlantic Monthly, Mr. Weaver said the comments that concerned him were about “strong ties to John’s committee staff, personal staff and to him.”Later in the day, one of Mr. McCain’s senior advisers directed strong criticism at The Times in what appeared to be a deliberate campaign strategy to wage a war with the newspaper. Mr. McCain is deeply distrusted by conservatives on several issues, not least because of his rapport with the news media, but he could find common ground with them in attacking a newspaper that many conservatives revile as a left-wing publication.“It was something that you would see in The National Enquirer, not in The New York Times,” said Steve Schmidt, a former counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney who is now a top campaign adviser to Mr. McCain.Mr. Schmidt, in lengthy comments to reporters traveling on Mr. McCain’s campaign plane, said The Times had rushed the article into print so it could beat The New Republic in the publication of an article about the story behind The Times’s investigation of Mr. McCain. The Times article was first published on its Web site on Wednesday night; The New Republic posted its account of what it described as staff conflict over the Times article, on its Web site on Thursday afternoon.In response to Mr. McCain as well as news media commentary about the timing of the publication of the article, The Times released this statement from Bill Keller, the newspaper’s executive editor:“On the substance, we think the story speaks for itself. On the timing, our policy is, we publish stories when they are ready. ‘Ready’ means the facts have been nailed down to our satisfaction, the subjects have all been given a full and fair chance to respond, and the reporting has been written up with all the proper context and caveats. This story was no exception. It was a long time in the works. It reached my desk late Tuesday afternoon. After a final edit and a routine check by our lawyers, we published it.”Asked at his news conference if he thought the article would be damaging or distracting to his presidential campaign, Mr. McCain replied, “It does distract, and it keeps me from talking about the big issues and the not-so-big issues, and hopefully we can get this thing resolved and behind us and move forward with the campaign.”While campaigning in Texas on Thursday, Mr. McCain’s rival for the nomination, Mike Huckabee, said of Mr. McCain, “I take him at his word and would have no further comment on it at all.”The article drew conservative commentators, many of whom have attacked Mr. McCain throughout the campaign, to join in the criticism of The Times. Rush Limbaugh opened his radio program on Thursday by saying that “if you let the media make you, you are subjecting yourself to the media being able to destroy you.”“The important question for John McCain today is, Is he going to learn the right lesson from this, and what is the lesson?” Mr. Limbaugh said, according to a transcript posted on his Web site. “The lesson is liberals are to be defeated. You cannot walk across the aisle with them. You cannot reach across the aisle. You cannot welcome their media members on your bus and get all cozy with them and expect eternal love from them.”'"
"'08-02-22,'1','Another shoe dropped this week in a major Congressional corruption scandal. Defense contractor Brent Wilkes was sentenced to 12 years in prison for bribing former Representative Randy Cunningham, a California Republican who was once a high-flying appropriator. Mr. Cunningham had already been sent to prison for eight years for accepting millions in cash, antiques and luxury vacations from Mr. Wilkes.Taxpayers can only hope Congress was paying close attention. The House returns to work next week with one of the Democratic leadership’s main anti-corruption vows — finding a credible way to monitor lawmakers’ ethics — still outstanding.At the top of the House’s agenda should be approving a proposed independent Office of Congressional Ethics as a bulwark against Mr. Cunningham’s way of doing business. While members like Mr. Cunningham and Bob Ney, Republican of Ohio, sold out the public, the House ethics committee became a separate study in scandal. It sat by mutely while Jack Abramoff, the superlobbyist, spun schemes that eroded public trust, until prosecutors had to move in.This see-no-evil approach has to end. The proposed new ethics office would be an early warning system, with six nonpartisan appointees chosen by the two party leaders to investigate charges of lawmakers’ misconduct. Allegations that the office finds to be serious would be referred to a supposedly more rigorous ethics committee for further investigation. The new office would keep track of all of the complaints and report publicly on their final disposition.We urge Speaker Nancy Pelosi to drive this measure to approval. It’s not perfect: the new office should have subpoena power, something anxious lawmakers are resisting. Failing that, there should be other mechanisms for providing investigative muscle.Mr. Wilkes’s sentencing is yet another setback for the House’s tattered reputation. It provides a perfect occasion for the House to, at long last, get serious about holding its members to a higher ethical standard.'"
"'08-02-22,'1','Ray Ozzie, Microsoft’s chief software architect, said that by sharing more information, Microsoft would make it easier for others to write Internet programs that tap into personal information on a PC.That, Mr. Ozzie added, should bring new sets of Web services that, for example, might match a person’s calendar information with a doctor’s schedule. Then smart software could make an appointment. At home, he noted, someone’s digital collection of music, movies and family photos would be more easily shuffled to different devices and screens.“The Internet opens up a world of potential innovation,” Mr. Ozzie said. “And I think we’ve just scratched the surface.”Microsoft announced other plans to open up its technology, like allowing developers to add more non-Microsoft document formats to its Office word processing and spreadsheet programs. Microsoft also made commitments to increase its support for industry standards and work with open-source software developers.European regulators and others have long accused Microsoft of using its dominance in PC operating systems and software to lock out competitors. Last October, after a nine-year confrontation and a ruling against the company by Europe’s second-highest court, Microsoft agreed to share information with rivals on terms it had long resisted. Then, after fresh complaints from Microsoft’s competitors, the European antitrust regulators last month announced that they were opening new investigations of the company.The new inquiry focuses partly on whether Microsoft has withheld essential information from competitors that want to make products that work smoothly with its Office programs. The Office products were not part of the previous European action against Microsoft.After the Microsoft announcement on Thursday, the European Commission issued a skeptical statement. The commission said it “would welcome any move towards genuine interoperability,” or allowing software programs from different companies to work smoothly together. But the commission noted that “today’s announcement follows at least four similar statements by Microsoft in the past on the importance of interoperability.”Asked about the commission’s statement, Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel, said that the company’s moves were “qualitatively and quantitatively different from anything we’ve done in the past.”“People will test us not just by our words but by our actions,” Mr. Smith added.The industry is taking a wait-and-see stance on Microsoft’s plan. Linux, an open-source competitor to Windows, stands to benefit from Microsoft’s more open posture. Regulators and competition are “forcing Microsoft to change the way it does business,” said James Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, a nonprofit consortium.The change comes as Microsoft is trying to buy Yahoo, a huge deal that, if it proceeds, will be closely scrutinized by antitrust officials worldwide. The European regulators typically take a harder line than their American counterparts in challenging takeovers.“To get the deal approved, Microsoft has to convince the European regulators that it has changed its spots on interoperability, no longer acting like a proprietary monopoly,” said Ken Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group that includes Microsoft competitors like I.B.M., Oracle, Sun Microsystems and Red Hat.Microsoft is also trying to win approval from an international standards body for its new document format, Office Open XML. Microsoft contends its format is “open,” meaning files in the format can be created and read by anyone.A different format standard for Internet-based computing, the OpenDocument Format, is supported by I.B.M., Google, Oracle and other Microsoft rivals. They assert that the proposed Microsoft standard is complex and layered with the company’s own features, making it effectively a corporate standard instead of a truly open one.Last September, Microsoft failed to win enough support for its standard from the International Organization for Standardization. But the standards body will review that decision in proceedings that begin next week.'"
"'08-02-22,'1','OTTAWA — As a child in Montreal, W. Graeme Roustan regularly received hand-me-down Bauer hockey skates from his older brother, and he has continued to buy Bauer Supreme skates ever since.But on Thursday, Mr. Roustan, now a private equity investor in Florida, made a bigger purchase, buying the Bauer operation from Nike for $200 million.Mr. Roustan, whose holdings include companies that make ice rink equipment, spoke of his passion for the Bauer name on Thursday, but there was much less excitement for Nike shareholders. The price paid by Mr. Roustan and Kohlberg & Company, an investment firm based in Mount Kisco, N.Y., is well below the $395 million Nike paid for Bauer in 1994.With revenue of about $160 million a year, Nike Bauer Hockey is a sliver of Nike’s $16.3 billion operation. But the discounted sale price was the final humiliation in Nike’s failed effort to use its marketing muscle to raise the profile of hockey in the United States.When Nike acquired Bauer, inline skating was at its faddish peak in the United States. A critical component of the company’s strategy was to transform that into a following for hockey played on concrete using inline skates.'"
"'08-02-22,'1','LONDON — The surprise $2.85 billion write-down at Credit Suisse this week underscored the difficulty banks face in valuing complex investments. But the cause of the blunder may be simple: traders at the bank used old prices.Two managers in Credit Suisse’s investment banking division said Thursday that several traders probably used out-of-date prices to value asset-backed securities. It is unclear whether the traders did so intentionally, according to the managers, who declined to be identified because the bank was still reviewing the episode.A spokeswoman at Credit Suisse declined to comment. The bank said Tuesday that the traders had been temporarily suspended.The mispricings were detected during a review of trading positions that the bank conducted as it prepared to sell bonds. Credit Suisse disclosed the write-down on Tuesday, a week after the bank reported fourth-quarter earnings.The news sent shudders through the financial industry, six months into a global credit market crisis. The episode raised new questions about how banks manage risk and value complicated financial instruments, particularly those linked to mortgages.Concerns about banks’ risk controls are particularly urgent in Europe, where, even apart from the rogue trader case that has rocked Société Générale, banks have shocked investors over the last three months by repeatedly restating write-downs.'"
"'08-02-22,'1','A bank loan that Senator John McCain took out late in 2007 to keep his presidential campaign afloat is complicating his desire to withdraw from public financing for his primary effort.The Federal Election Commission, in a letter it released on Thursday, said Mr. McCain could not withdraw from public financing until he had answered questions about a $4 million line of credit for borrowing that was secured, in part, in December by the promise of federal matching money.Mr. McCain sent a letter to the commission on Feb. 7 saying he had decided to decline the matching money for his primary campaign. His request for public money, in which the government matches campaign contributions, was made last year as the campaign was running out of cash.After his fortunes began to rise from his victory New Hampshire and campaign gifts increased, however, Mr. McCain decided against taking the public money. Taking it would have limited his spending between now and the Republican convention in September to $40 million.Candidates not accepting public money have no limits on spending in the primaries.For the general election, Mr. McCain has challenged Senator Barack Obama, the leading Democratic candidate, to abide by a promise made this year to use public financing for his general election if he is the nominee and if Mr. McCain does so, as well.'"
"'08-02-22,'1','KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Militants using suicide attacks that cause large numbers of casualties in Afghanistan are trying to swing public opinion among NATO nations that have troops here, the alliance’s top official said Thursday.The bombers “want to influence Afghan public opinion, but at the same time the public opinion in our nations who provide the forces,” Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, NATO’s secretary general, said at a news conference with President Hamid Karzai. “Let’s not give them a ticket to ride.”Mr. de Hoop Scheffer said that convincing Western legislatures that the situation was not deteriorating was of “key importance.”He was leading a delegation of the alliance’s North Atlantic Council, consisting of its 26 permanent representatives. They met with local and international officials in Afghanistan.Some NATO members have been reluctant to provide troops for Afghanistan or have limited the nature of their participation, leading some participating countries to threaten to pull their troops out. Canada’s minority Conservative government, bowing to a major opposition demand, said Thursday that its military mission in southern Afghanistan would end in 2011 and would not be extended, Reuters reported. Canada has 2,500 troops in Afghanistan.'"
"'08-02-22,'1','The Bank of New York, in turn, declined to disclose either who was selling the swaps and securities or how the auction went. “In our role as trustee, we can’t comment on the results of this or any other auction,” said Kevin Heine, a spokesman for the bank.So about all that can be said is that the seller is not related to Mr. Ball’s firm — Mr. Heine was authorized to say that the bank picked the firm because it is a neutral party — and had pretty sophisticated tastes.The 55 “synthetic securities” up for bid were described as “pay-as-you-go credit default swaps.” They are a mutation of products originally meant to provide protection to investors if a corporate borrower defaulted on its bonds or other debts. In recent years, however, default swaps have become a popular way to place bets on corporate credit trends among traders with no vested interest in the underlying debt.That has prompted enormous growth both in swaps volume — the market is now estimated at more than $45 trillion — and in the potential risks in what remains an opaque, largely unregulated market. For example, the American International Group recently reported that it had miscalculated the value of swaps contracts on its books, an error that added $3.6 billion to its loss estimates for last year.But unlike plain vanilla credit default swaps — if such a thing can be said to exist — the pay-as-you-go swaps do not involve a one-time payment to cover a default on a corporate bond, a pool of mortgages or some other debt instrument. Instead, they involve the payment of ongoing obligations on debt instruments that, because of their terms, may not be subject to a clear default trigger.These 55 swaps, in particular, involved promises to pay shortfalls on various collections of mortgage loans, most of which have been sharply downgraded by ratings agencies in recent weeks.If these had been more conventional credit default swaps, there would have been a much more visible way to sell them. Indeed, last Tuesday, just such an auction was held for credit default swaps affected by the bankruptcy of Québecor World, a Canadian printing company that filed for protection under Canada’s bankruptcy laws on Jan. 21.There is no mystery about the outcome of that event. Unlike the Houston auction, it was conducted pretty much in plain sight.Bids and offers were submitted through an electronic auction platform created by Creditex, an interdealer execution platform for credit derivatives, and Markit Group, a price information service.The results — which allowed participants to calculate the value of their swap obligations by fixing the price of the underlying debt at 41.25 cents on the dollar — were verified by Markit and jointly announced by the two firms on Tuesday afternoon.In fact, the bids submitted by each of the 13 participating dealers, by name, is posted on the Internet at www.creditfixings.com.“You can go check our math,” joked Mazy Dar, chief strategic officer for Creditex.The firm has now conducted 11 credit default swap auctions, beginning with one for swaps involving Collins & Aikman debt in 2005. Other auctions involved the debt of Market Gallery, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, Delphi Corporation, Calpine Corporation, Dana Corporation and Dura.The process is sufficiently trusted that 589 market participants agreed in advance, through the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, to abide by whatever settlement price the auction established for the Quebecor-related swaps.But unlike widely traded credit default swaps, which have become fairly standardized, pay-as-you-go swaps remain highly individualized.Underscoring how distinctive each of the 55 swap contracts are, Sanders Morris Harris offered to supply “the complete terms of any synthetic security” to interested bidders.And, obviously, since these highly differentiated swaps are rarely traded, there’s no market price to guide bidders — or owners.Hence, the public announcement of the unpublic auction. Bankers said that, while this was not a first, “synthetic securities” auctions like the one in Houston are still pretty rare — so far.But as more holders of these oddball swaps look for ways to value them, or unload them, it might be a good idea to check the legal notices a little more often.'"
"'08-02-22,'1','PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Sam Bith, a former Khmer Rouge guerrilla commander serving a life sentence for masterminding the abduction and murder of three Western tourists in 1994, died last Friday, a government spokesman said. He was 74.Mr. Sam Bith was sentenced to life in prison in December 2002 after being found guilty of conspiring to kill the men — David Wilson of Australia, Mark Slater of Britain and Jean-Michel Braquet of France, all tourists in their late 20s — in 1994.Information Minister Khieu Kanharith announced that Mr. Sam Bith had died, but did not disclose a cause of death. Mr. Sam Bith’s wife, Khem Ri, said he had been ill with diabetes and high blood pressure.Mr. Sam Bith had served as a Khmer Rouge commander in southwestern Cambodia, where a train carrying the three backpacking tourists was ambushed on July 26, 1994.About a dozen Cambodians were also killed and many others wounded in the armed attack by Khmer Rouge rebels at Phnom Voar, or Vine Mountain, 62 miles southwest of Phnom Penh.'"
"'08-02-22,'1','All candidates running for president should be scrutinized appropriately, but the news media should use caution before publishing stories based on rumor.If there is more to this story, then I challenge you to publish everything immediately. The New York Times owes it to its readership to come forth with all the facts.The alternative is an unacceptable drip, drip, drip.You have done a service to voters in publishing your account of Senator John McCain’s sometimes questionable activities.The inconsistencies between his professed beliefs and what he has actually done as well as his impetuous nature must be taken into account when deciding whether or not to vote for him for president.Unfortunately, the media focus on the sensational possibility of an intimate relationship between the senator and a lobbyist obscures this central message, which is supported by an analysis of a number of the senator’s actions.As usual, the right wing in this country is much more interested in whether a public official has had extramarital sex than in whether he or she has violated the public trust or demonstrated inconsistent or imprudent judgment.Senator John McCain’s behavior as described in your article and his reaction illustrate perfectly the real differences between him and Senator Barack Obama, and the choice voters will face.Senator McCain represents old politics: the politics that greases the regulatory path for donors and highly placed friends, and has him jetting off on a private plane with a glitzy young female lobbyist from a corporate dinner.It’s becoming clearer that Americans will face a real choice in November: continuing the old politics represented by Senator McCain or taking a new direction with the leadership of Senator Obama.The article appears largely mired in innuendo and gossip, and as such, falls far below the editorial standards I ascribe to The New York Times.It’s probably inevitable that the Keating Five scandal should re-emerge — and perhaps appropriate — but why are you wasting above-the-fold space with rumors of a romantic relationship? Have we learned nothing from the Monica Lewinsky debacle? Don’t we have more important issues to resolve?I am a liberal Democrat. I admire Barack Obama and have been rooting for him to get the Democratic nomination. I’ve also been a longtime admirer of John McCain. I am truly undecided about whom to vote for in November.I intend to use the next nine months to read everything I can, watch all the debates and talk to as many people as possible as I decide whom to back for president.I want to learn about Senators Obama and McCain and their stand on domestic and international issues. I want to see their concrete plans, not hear pretty rhetoric. I want a campaign of ideas based on a shared love of this country and a desire to see it move forward.Both Senators McCain and Obama are worthy candidates. I honestly do not care if Mr. McCain had a romantic relationship eight years ago with someone other than his wife, nor do I care about Senator Obama’s personal life. These issues are between them, their families and their God.'"

"'08-02-22,'1','HONG KONG — The Chinese government objected Thursday to the American missile strike against a dying United States spy satellite over the Pacific Ocean, warning that the United States Navy’s action could threaten security in outer spaceLiu Jianchao, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a news conference in Beijing that the United States should also promptly share data about the passage of the remaining pieces of the satellite, which are expected to re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere and mostly burn up in the next two days.Later in the day, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who personally gave the order to shoot down the satellite, told reporters in Hawaii that he was prepared to share some details of the operation with China to alleviate its concerns that the debris still may prove dangerous.American defense officials said the missile, launched from an Aegis-class cruiser, had hit the satellite and were optimistic about the likelihood that the impact had destroyed the satellite’s fuel tank.The fuel tank held 1,000 pounds of toxic rocket fuel that the satellite never used because it malfunctioned soon after reaching orbit in December 2006.'"
"'08-02-22,'1','The Davis-Weaver rivalry has lasted for so long because John McCain has a foot in each camp. McCain is, on one level, a figure of the Washington mainstream. He admires Alan Greenspan and Henry Kissinger. He appreciates a steady manager like Davis.But McCain is also a renegade and a romantic. He loves tilting at the establishment and shaking things up. He loves books and movies in which the hero dies at the end while serving a noble, if lost, cause. He loves the insurgent/band-of-brothers ethos that Weaver exudes.McCain was loyal to each camp in a house divided. But the poisons emanating from the rift have spread outward. They are the background for the article my colleagues at The New York Times published Thursday.At the core of that article that began on the front page are two anonymous sources. These sources, according to the article, say they confronted McCain in 1999 with their concerns that he was risking his career by interacting with Vicki Iseman. As a columnist, I’m an independent operator, speaking for myself alone. I have no idea who those sources are. But they are bound to come from the inner circle of the McCain universe. The number of people who could credibly claim to have had a meeting like that with McCain in early 1999 is vanishingly small. I count a small handful of associates with that stature, including Davis and Weaver. There is nobody in that tight circle unaffected by the hostilities that emanate from the rift.Thursday, as McCain was fervently and completely denying the allegations of an affair with Iseman, people in all quarters of the McCain universe were vehemently denying it, too. But even on this embattled day, they broke down into rival camps over the identity of the sources.Many in the Davis camp argued Thursday that Weaver must be the chief anonymous source, and that he had roped in one other confederate. He’s had a hard life, they said, and is driven by demons.Weaver countered by telling reporters that he retains enormous affection for McCain and desperately wants him to become president. Moreover, Weaver had been trying to get back into the fold. There is no way he would be an anonymous source against McCain. Some closer to Weaver theorized that the sources must be former McCain campaign elders from 2000 who worked for rival campaigns in 2008.I checked that possibility out, and it doesn’t hold water. But while calling around to a dozen senior McCain friends and advisers Thursday, what struck me was the enormous tragedy of the rift. They all love McCain. They all say it is absurd to think he abused his power in the way that is alleged. But the rift is like some primal sore. It affected every conversation I had Thursday, as it has infected McCain efforts again and again over the past many years.At his press conference Thursday, McCain went all-in. He didn’t just say he didn’t remember a meeting about Iseman. He said there was no meeting. If it turns out that there is evidence of an affair and a meeting, then his presidential hopes will be over. If no evidence surfaces, his campaign will go on and it will be clear that there were members of his old inner circle consumed by viciousness and mendaciousness.But lingering over everything is the bitterness of the rift, which has caused duplicity and anger to seep into the campaign of this fine man. The poisons have yet to be drained.'"

"'08-02-23,'0','Needle exchange programs save lives. They slow the spread of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and they help get addicts into treatment. Yet when it comes to supporting these programs, it seems that the political cowardice never ends.For the last 20 years, Congress has blocked the use of federal money to pay for needle exchange programs in the United States or abroad. For 10 years, Congress banned Washington from using tax dollars raised in the District of Columbia to pay for needle exchange efforts.Congress finally lifted Washington’s ban in December, stripping that provision in the federal budget that President Bush had signed. The District of Columbia has now allocated $650,000 that will, among other things, pay to open a clinic that combines needle exchanges with H.I.V. testing. In what would be an unconscionable reversal, President Bush’s new budget request would reimpose that ban.Needle exchange programs have proved highly successful around the world, and the country’s most important medical and public health organizations have endorsed the efforts for more than a decade. Opponents’ claims that needle exchanges would encourage addiction have turned out to be nonsense.The nation’s capital has the country’s highest rate of H.I.V. infection, and a recent report by the District of Columbia’s health department found that more than 20 percent of the city’s AIDS cases could be traced to intravenous drug users. Now that Washington has a chance to fight back, the White House must not be allowed to hobble that effort.Congress must insist that Washington be allowed to spend its own money on needle exchange programs. And it must begin passing budgets that allow states — and health organizations overseas — to use federal dollars for these life-saving programs.'"
"'08-02-23,'0','“We believe that any intervention by the federal government will be acceptable only if it is not perceived as a bailout of the bond market,” the financial institution noted.In practice, taxpayers would almost certainly view such a move as a bailout. If lawmakers and the Bush administration agreed to this step, it could be on a scale similar to the government’s $200 billion bailout of the savings and loan industry in the 1990s. The arguments against a bailout are powerful. It would mostly benefit banks and Wall Street firms that earned huge fees by packaging trillions of dollars in risky mortgages, often without documenting the incomes of borrowers and often turning a blind eye to clear fraud by borrowers or mortgage brokers.A rescue would also create a “moral hazard,” many experts contend, by encouraging banks and home buyers to take outsize risks in the future, in the expectation of another government bailout if things go wrong again.If the government pays too much for the mortgages or the market declines even more than it has already, Washington — read, taxpayers — could be stuck with hundreds of billions of dollars in defaulted loans.But a growing number of policy makers and community advocacy activists argue that a government rescue may nonetheless be the most sensible way to avoid a broader disruption of the entire economy.The House Financial Services Committee is working on various options, including a government buyout. The Bush administration may be softening its hostility to a rescue as well. Top officials at the Treasury Department are hoping to meet with industry executives next week to discuss options, according to two executives.“There are a lot of ideas out there,” said Scott Stanzel, a spokesman for President Bush, when asked at a White House press briefing on Friday about a possible buyout program. “There are many different ways in which we can address this problem and we continue to look at ways in which we can do that.”Supporters contend that a government rescue could be the fastest and cleanest way to force banks and investors to book their losses from bad mortgages — a painful but essential first step toward stabilizing the housing market.The government would buy the mortgages at their true current value, perhaps through an auction, at what would probably be a big discount from the original loan amount. The mortgage lenders, or the investors who bought mortgage-backed securities, would be free of the bad loans but would still have to book their losses.If the government took control of the bad mortgages, supporters of a rescue contend, it could restructure the loans on terms that borrowers could meet, keep most of them from losing their homes and avoid an even more catastrophic plunge in housing prices.“Every citizen has a dog in this hunt,” said John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a community advocacy group that has developed its own mortgage buyout plan. “The cost of spending our way out of a recession is something that everybody would have to bear for a very long time.”Mr. Taylor estimated the government might end up buying $80 billion to $100 billion in mortgages. But he said the government could recoup its money if it was able to buy the mortgages at a proper discount, repackage them and sell them on the open market.Surprisingly, the normally free-market Bush administration has expressed interest. Treasury officials confirmed that several senior officials invited Mr. Taylor to present his ideas to them on Feb. 15. Mr. Taylor said he had also received calls from officials at the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is part of the Treasury Department.But even supporters acknowledge that a government rescue poses risks to taxpayers, who could be left holding a very expensive bag.Ellen Seidman, a former director of the Office of Thrift Supervision and now a senior fellow at the moderate-to-liberal New America Foundation, said the government’s first challenge is to buy mortgages at their true current value. If the government overpaid or became caught by an even further decline in the market value of its mortgages, taxpayers would indeed be bailing out both the industry and imprudent home buyers.“It’s not easy, but it’s not impossible,” Ms. Seidman said. “There are various auction mechanisms, both inside and outside government.”A second challenge would be to start a program quickly enough to prevent the housing and credit markets from spiraling further downward. Industry executives and policy analysts said it would take too long to create an entirely new agency, as Bank of America suggested. But they expressed hope that the government could begin a program from inside an existing agency.But even if the government did buy up millions of mortgages and force mortgage holders to take losses, the biggest problem could still lie ahead: deciding which struggling homeowners should receive breaks on their mortgages.Administration officials have long insisted that they do not want to rescue speculators who took out no-money-down loans to buy and flip condominiums in Miami or Phoenix. And even Democrats like Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, have said the government should not help those who borrowed more than they could ever hope to repay.But identifying innocent victims has already proved complicated. The Bush administration’s Hope Now program offers to freeze interest rates for certain borrowers whose subprime mortgages were about to jump to much higher rates. But the eligibility rules are so narrow that some analysts estimate only 3 percent of subprime borrowers will benefit.Bank executives, meanwhile, warn that the mortgage mess is much broader than people with subprime loans. Problems are mounting almost as rapidly in so-called Alt-A mortgages, made to people with good credit scores who did not document their incomes and borrowed far more than normal underwriting standards would allow.Borrowers who overstated their incomes are not likely to get much sympathy. But industry executives and consumer advocates warn that foreclosed homes push down prices in surrounding neighborhoods, and a wave of foreclosures could lead to another, deeper plunge in home prices.Right or wrong, the arguments for rescuing homeowners are likely to be blurred with arguments for rescuing home prices. At that point, industry executives are likely to argue that what is good for Bank of America is good for the rest of America.'"
"'08-02-23,'0','Daniel Billett, a mortgage broker in Seattle, where homes in the downtown area sell for a median price of around $400,000, said that he, like dozens of people he knows, is poised to refinance an existing jumbo loan at a lower interest rate.“As soon as the loan limits are implemented and lenders are accepting applications. I’ll be the first in line,” said Mr. Billett, whose company, Response Mortgage Services, has been receiving a steady stream of inquiries from clients in recent weeks. “I’m going to save hundreds, and I mean hundreds, of dollars every month on my current jumbo loan, by switching to a conventional loan.”For years, rates on jumbo loans, those for more than $417,000, were only slightly higher than rates on conforming loans at or below that limit. But now, with the interest rate on conforming loans at around 6 percent, sometimes less, jumbo loans are at least a percentage point higher.“The difference is as big as it’s ever been,” said Bart Welles, a mortgage broker in Larkspur, Calif.For a high-priced home, 1 percent can make a big difference. A monthly payment on a jumbo 30-year loan of $729,000 at 7 percent would be $4,850. Monthly payments on a conforming loan of the same amount, at 6 percent, would be $4,371, a $479 difference.As the credit squeeze deepens, lenders have been reluctant to underwrite jumbo mortgages. That leaves houses languishing on the market, further depressing an already distressed housing market.The change in loan limits, which allows the federal housing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase or guarantee the mortgages, is intended to encourage lenders to write more mortgages because they can easily sell them to the agencies.It should also stimulate house buying and mortgage refinancing. As the thinking goes, once people start borrowing money, they will set back into motion the economic machine of brokers, agents and lenders that has been stalled for the past year and has helped stall the overall economy.“Of all the various strategies proposed to help the housing market,” said Gus Faucher, director of macroeconomics at Moody’s Economy.com, “I think this one has the greatest potential, particularly for expensive housing markets.”The change in loan limits will go into effect sometime in early March and will last at least through the end of the year. In areas where median prices do not exceed $271,050, such as the entire state of Alabama, the basic loan limit will be $271,050.In areas where the median sales price is higher, the limits will rise to 125 percent of the median price, not to exceed $729,750. (The rules defining which locations qualify and where the borders of the areas will be drawn to determine the appropriate median price are to be written by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.)High-priced housing markets — particularly much of coastal California, with some of the most expensive real estate in the nation — would benefit the most. In a state like California, or in the Northeast and Northwest, where home prices far exceed the national median of about $206,000, jumbo loans are a significant portion of the mortgage market.In San Francisco, where the median home price is $777,000, 35 percent of all loans were nonconforming, according to First American CoreLogic, a data and analytics company in Santa Ana, Calif.The anticipated stimulative impact is all the more important because prices are falling sharply. Prices have dropped 20.4 percent over the past year in Contra Costa County, east of San Francisco, and 13.1 percent in neighboring Alameda County, according to DataQuick Information Systems.Indeed, California is probably the state hardest hit by the housing slump. As inventories rose in most cities, the median price dropped 16.9 percent from May to December, according to DataQuick. (Prices are still high; the California Budget Project, a public policy advocacy group, estimated that a family would need an annual income of $196,878 to afford the median-priced home in San Francisco.)Across the state, homeowners stuck with high interest rates and potential homeowners who are still searching are watching the situation closely.The window in the new law is short. But Mr. Faucher, the economist, said that if problems in the market continued, particularly in expensive markets, he would not be surprised to see the higher loan limits extended. “There’s nothing set in stone,” he said.At first, the strongest interest is expected to come from people refinancing existing loans. In Berkeley, Calif., where the median home is worth about $776,000, MPR Financial, a mortgage brokerage firm, has received dozens of calls from clients asking about the possibility of refinancing their existing loans.“Quite a few people who got their loans when the rates were higher have called in,” said Paul Riccardi, the firm’s president. “We tell them we have their application, and we’ll have it ready to go.”In other places where housing prices are high, there is a similar anticipatory buzz about a change in the conforming loan cap.In San Diego, real estate activity has dropped off noticeably in the past year. According to DataQuick, the number of homes sold in San Diego in January dropped 34 percent from a year ago. A change in the conforming loan limit could give a much-needed boost to the market, said Jim Abbott, a real estate agent there.“The availability of jumbo loans was so easy,” Mr. Abbott said. “Now they’re not, and it’s really exacerbated the problem. But I don’t think anyone is counting on it until it actually happens.”Jim Byrnes, a real estate agent in Palo Alto, Calif., where Zillow.com pegs the median home value at $1.4 million, said he had two clients who were first-time home buyers and were waiting for the new law to take effect.“They’re literally waiting on the sidelines to see what happens,” he said. “If they can get a better interest rate it will make their path so much easier.”Of course, prices for some houses in certain California enclaves and other luxury locations remain so stratospherically high that a change in the conforming loan limit, no matter how drastic, would have little effect.“It won’t make so much difference here,” said Edna Sizlo, a real estate agent in Santa Barbara, Calif., where the adjacent suburb of Montecito has homes valued at a median $4.1 million, making them among the most expensive in the nation. “There’s nothing you can even live in for under $1 million.”'"
"'08-02-23,'0','The commission has taken on the development notions of companies big and small, and entire cities. In 1998, when the Hearst Corporation tried to build a resort complex with hotels and a golf course near the famous castle in San Luis Obispo County, the commission shot it down.The commission has also taken on the wealthy residents of beach areas who believe that their homeownership entitles them to private beaches, most recently the Hollywood mogul David Geffen. Movie stars do not scare commissioners either. Last year, Clint Eastwood backed a plan to develop a stretch of the Monterey Peninsula into a golf course, a proposal that was flattened by the panel.In 1987, the commission was dealt a rare blow by the United States Supreme Court, which ruled against its attempt to permit a homeowner to replace a small bungalow on a beachfront lot with a larger house with the condition that they allow the public access to the beachfront.But earlier this decade, members were back tangling with the city of Malibu over its plan for managing coastal building, essentially dictating to the city what it would do. After several trips to court, the two sides came to a tense accord in 2005.“The commission basically tells us what to do, and we’re expected to do it,” said Jeff Jennings, the mayor of Malibu. “And in many cases that extends down to the smallest details imaginable, like what color you paint your houses, what kind of light bulbs you can use in certain places.”To Mr. Jennings, the battle in Malibu was not over development visions, but municipal rights. And as has often been the case, the city came up short when pitted against the commission.“When we became a city we wanted to make our own decisions,” he said, “and we see this body of nonelecteds and we feel kind of disenfranchised.”The issue before the commission this month was among the tensest in its history. A local transportation authority was seeking permission to extend a toll road 16 miles near San Onofre State Beach in San Diego County to provide an alternate route to congested Interstate 5, Southern California’s main north-south artery.Environmental groups, conservationists and a majority of residents here derided the toll road, saying it would spoil area parks, destroy the waves at a famous surfer beach, hurt Indian burial grounds and imperil the endangered Pacific pocket mouse. Supporters said it was essential to alleviate traffic, and to provide easier access to coastal areas for people living inland.The road was soundly rejected by the commission, which has a history of siding with environmentalists in development fights. Its role to some degree is to protect natural resources from the whims of cash-hungry local governments that may be inclined to give in to developer incentives in exchange for building over natural resources.The commission’s members are appointed in groups of four by the governor and the leaders of the State Senate and Assembly, bodies that have been dominated by Democrats with political and philosophical interests generally aligned with conservation advocates.“The commission reflects a constituency that is important to Democrats,” Professor Zasloff said.With tensions between the commuters of this ever-expanding state, and those who long to protect its natural resources, fights like the one over the toll road are likely to continue. The Transportation Corridor Agencies, which oversee the planned toll road, have filed an appeal with the federal Department of Commerce.While opposed to the toll road, the commission has thoughts on how to deal with transportation problems, said Sarah Christie, the panel’s legislative director.“In reality, Southern California is going to have to come to grips with its traffic problem,” Ms. Christie said. “The Coastal Act does call for infrastructure that would be more supportive of mass transit. We can’t just build our way out with toll roads.”John Gerard, sitting in his pickup near the beach here recently with a sign on his lap that read “Save the Park,” said he was thrilled with the way the commission responded to the outcry against the road.“I’d rather live with a little bit of traffic than ruin this place,” he said.'"
"'08-02-23,'0','“This is the most despicable act of liberal bias that I have seen in my life,” Sean Hannity, the conservative talk show host, said Thursday about the Times article. “They wanted you to come to a conclusion, and that is that Senator McCain had some kind of relationship with a female lobbyist and did special favors for her. It is beyond disgusting and despicable.”Charles Black, a senior McCain adviser who had taken heat from conservative friends after the editorial board of The Times endorsed Mr. McCain in the Feb. 5 New York primary, was pleased. Thursday, Mr. Black said, “was the first day in the campaign that McCain won the day on conservative talk radio.”Later that afternoon, the McCain campaign began using The Times in an fund-raising appeal sent by e-mail to supporters. “Well, here we go,” the letter from Mr. McCain’s campaign manager, Rick Davis, began, then outlined what it characterized as the newspaper’s smear campaign. Mr. Davis quickly got to the point: “We need your help to counteract the liberal establishment and fight back against The New York Times by making an immediate contribution today.”By Friday, the campaign was tracing its jump in fund-raising directly to the article in The Times. “Thank you,” Mr. Schmidt said to a Times reporter on Mr. McCain’s campaign plane as it headed back to Washington from Indianapolis. Then he added to a group of reporters, “There was a lot of outrage across the country on the story, and the campaign has raised a lot of money in the last 24 hours.”Even those conservatives who did not rush to embrace Mr. McCain said his campaign’s condemnations of The Times might have given him an indirect boost, although some were not yet ready to support Mr. McCain’s campaign.“I wouldn’t say that this has turned the tables as far as McCain convincing the base to vote for him,” Matthew Sheffield, the executive editor of the conservative media-watchdog site NewsBusters, wrote to a Times reporter in an e-mail message. “However, this was a terrific opportunity to get that dialogue started. The general sentiment seems to be more of a defense of McCain against an unfair attack rather than a positive reaction to his candidacy.”The White House got into the act on Friday morning when Scott M. Stanzel, a deputy press secretary, responded to a question about whether President Bush supported Mr. McCain by attacking the newspaper instead.“I think a lot of people here in this building with experience in a couple campaigns have grown accustomed to the fact that during the course of a campaign, seemingly on maybe a monthly basis leading up to the convention, maybe a weekly basis after that, The New York Times does try to drop a bombshell on the Republican nominee,” Mr. Stanzel replied. “And that is something that the Republican nominee has faced in the past, and probably will face in this campaign.”Mr. McCain’s operatives — including Mr. Schmidt, who once worked for Vice President Dick Cheney and closely with people in the White House press office — said they had not asked Mr. Stanzel to help them make their case.Over at Fox News, the commentators viewed the article ultimately as a victory for Mr. McCain. “For a lot of conservatives, being attacked by The New York Times is a badge of honor,” the anchor Chris Wallace said Friday morning. “I think they must figure, ‘Well, if John McCain’s being bashed by The Times, he must not be all bad.’ ”Soon after, Mr. McCain, at least, tried to bring the matter to a close. “I don’t have any more comment on this issue,” he said at a news conference in Indianapolis, when asked about Mr. Stanzel’s remarks. “I had a press conference yesterday morning, and I answered every question.” In short, he said, “I do not intend to discuss it further.”Asked later on his campaign plane if he thought the dispute with The Times would help him win over conservatives, Mr. McCain at first replied testily, “How should I know?” But then he circled back to the question and said, more thoughtfully, “We still don’t know how this whole thing ends up.”'"
"'08-02-23,'0','The rift that has divided open-wheel racing in the United States since 1996 and helped lead to the decline of the sport is finally over. Officials from the Indy Racing League announced Friday that they reached an agreement with leaders of the opposing Champ Car World Series to unify the two into one open-wheel racing series.The change will take place this season, and the 16-event IndyCar Series schedule will be expanded to 19 with the addition of three Champ Car races. A news conference is expected to be held in the coming days to discuss details of the unification.“Praise the Lord if that’s the truth,” Chip Ganassi, an I.R.L. and Nascar team owner, said in a telephone interview when told of the announcement. “It’s an end to some confusion in the marketplace. It will hopefully be a springboard to get the sport back to where it needs to be in terms of its relevance on the motorsports scene.”Open-wheel racing used to be the No. 1 motorsports competition in the United States, when Nascar was a mostly southern-based sport. But in 1996, Tony George, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner, led a split from the former C.A.R.T. series. Both of the series that resulted suffered over the years because of it. The C.A.R.T. series declared bankruptcy in 2003, before being resurrected as the Champ Car series. The Indy Racing League has fallen behind Nascar as the premier motorsports series.Asked how damaging the split was, Ganassi said: “It’s incalculable. I think probably the worst thing it did, it not only split the organizations, but it split sponsorships, it split alliances, and, most importantly, it split a lot of friendships.”'"

Greg Norman, who designed the El Cameleon course in Riviera Maya, Mexico, missed the cut with a 79. Norman could not recover from an early five-hole stretch of three bogeys and a double bogey. He finished at nine over, missing the cut by five strokes. The first-round leader, John Merrick, shot a 68 to remain on top at six-under 132. Brian Gay was a stroke back after a 67.Correction: March 1, 2008  The headline on a report in the Sports Briefing column last Saturday about the golfer Nick Price’s strong second-round performance at the Mayakoba Golf Classic in Mexico misstated his standing at that point in the event.

There have also been more urgent fears that the United States may be entering a period of stagflation — when stalling growth accompanies rising prices — for the first time since the 1970s.As occurred Wednesday and again late Friday, investors at times set aside those concerns and snapped up stocks either to cover bets that stocks would fall or because of genuine optimism that officials from the Fed to other parts of the government could help right the economy.Wednesday’s gains followed a quiet start to the week Tuesday — markets were closed Monday — and came after minutes from the Fed’s last meeting indicated that the central bank planned to lower interest rates as needed and look past some gathering concerns about inflation.The Fed’s next rate-setting meeting is scheduled for March 18.

The company said “the decision not to screen ‘Rambo’ will free up screens to show alternative popular new films such as ‘Jumper,’ ‘Be Kind Rewind’ and ‘Juno,’ ” but there was speculation among British movie exhibitors that the cause of the abrupt move was a disagreement over terms between Odeon and Sony, the film’s distributor. “I can’t remember the last time this happened in the multiplex era,” one film booker said.

"'08-02-23,'0','A review of the record, including agency records now at the National Archives and interviews with participants, shows that Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, played a significant role in killing the plan to eliminate the loophole. His actions followed requests by Ms. Iseman and lobbyists at other broadcasting companies, according to lobbying records and Congressional aides.Over the years, Mr. McCain has taken varying positions on broadcast ownership issues. He has supported the relaxation of the ownership rules, but he has also been sharply critical of rules that permit too much concentration of ownership in a single market.By November 1998, the F.C.C. was planning to strike down broadcasting marketing agreements, a potentially ruinous development for Glencairn. But after receiving Mr. McCain’s Dec. 1 letter, it put off consideration of the issue.“To the extent the F.C.C. shows itself incapable of following Congressional intent,” the letter said, “these issues will become part of our overall review of the commission’s functions and structure during the next session of Congress.”The letter, sent from Mr. McCain’s office by his staff at the commerce committee, was also signed by Senator Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana and chairman of a communications subcommittee. It was uncharacteristic of Mr. McCain, according to a review of dozens of letters sent by him to the commission during the same period.It was the only letter that contained a suggestion that a failure to act would result in the possible overhaul of the agency.The letter said that “as a leading participant in the passage of the 1996 Act, I have a very clear understanding” of the law’s intent and why it required the ownership loophole to be preserved. Mr. McCain was one of five senators — and the only Republican — to vote against the act. He has also been an outspoken critic of it.While other companies also complained to Congress about the plan to close the loophole, the issue was particularly important to Sinclair because it had more marketing agreements than any in the nation. For its part, Glencairn appeared to have been getting little support in Congress until it retained Ms. Iseman in 1998.Edwin Edwards, who was the president of the company at the time, said in a recent interview that after retaining Ms. Iseman, he was able to get heard by Mr. McCain.“We were pounding the pavement in Washington,” Mr. Edwards said. “We recruited help from as many people as we could. We knocked on every door just trying to get support.”The campaign said that Mr. McCain never spoke with Ms. Iseman about the issue, but that she did speak to his staff about it. Mr. Edwards and Mr. McCain met on July 20, 1999, according to the campaign.After the commission postponed consideration of the issue, Mr. McCain signed a second letter to the agency on Dec. 7, 1998, in support of local marketing agreements, and a third one on Feb. 11, 1999. The third letter was signed by four other lawmakers. Ultimately, the F.C.C. loosened the rules to permit a company to own two television stations in some markets.The letters Mr. McCain wrote to the commission in the Paxson matter were sent in late 1999 and prompted the agency’s chairman to chastise him for interfering in a licensing matter. The incident embarrassed Mr. McCain, then making his first presidential run, because Mr. Paxson was a campaign contributor and fund-raiser.While the campaign said Thursday that Mr. McCain never spoke to anyone from Paxson or Ms. Iseman’s lobbying firm before sending those letters to the commission, an article posted Friday on Newsweek’s Web site said Mr. McCain had previously acknowledged first speaking to Mr. Paxson. Recounting that conversation, Mr. McCain testified in the deposition, “I said I would be glad to write a letter asking them to act.”The Washington Post reported Friday on its Web site that Mr. Paxson acknowledged in an interview that he had met with Mr. McCain to discuss the letters before they were sent and that Ms. Iseman was probably at the meeting.In three interviews with The Times since December, Mr. Paxson has provided varying accounts about the letters. In the first, he said Ms. Iseman was involved in the drafting of them and had lobbied Mr. McCain. He later said he could not recall who had been involved.'"

One of us posted an electronic copy of the book and invited others to download it and (at another member’s suggestion) send a check to the author. Ethical? — JOHN FELLEMAN, PALO ALTO, CALIF.It is generally illegal to publish — i.e., post — an entire copyrighted work without consent, and quite rightly: people are entitled to be paid for their work. But it is not always unethical. If the work is truly unavailable through normal channels, then more imaginative sources can be sought.The fundamental goal of copyright is not to secure profits but to inspire thought. Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution empowers Congress to write laws that “promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.”When meaningful efforts fail to resurrect an out-of-print book, there’s no good in simply shrugging and allowing its ideas to slip into darkness. To be so cowed by the letter of the law is to undermine its purpose: the promotion of a useful art, in this case flying. In such circumstances, you may ethically download an online version or, if you’re an old-fashioned guy, photocopy a library book.But you and your flying friends have not yet reached that point. If the author or publisher decline to reprint, then next you should inquire about permission and payments for online posting.UPDATE: Some pilots sent checks to the author, Richard Coffey, who returned them because he had no hard copies of his 1996 book, “The Skylane Pilot’s Companion.” He told me by phone: “I’m pleased they still find it useful. They’re welcome to post it and make copies.”'"
"'08-02-24,'0','In a follow-up article on Friday, the newspaper even seemed to play down its role in the sex angle. It described the previous day’s article as talking about McCain’s “ties” to Iseman and his “association” with her. The only mention of romance came in quoting a question to McCain at his press conference.Boiled to the essentials, this is what The Times reported Thursday: In 1999, Iseman, a lobbyist for telecommunications companies with business before a Senate committee led by McCain, started turning up at his fund-raisers, visiting his offices and accompanying him on a corporate jet. “Convinced the relationship had become romantic” and was putting his campaign and career at risk, some top McCain advisers gave instructions to block her access, privately warned her away and repeatedly confronted him.Two former McCain associates, who were quoted anonymously and described as “disillusioned” with the senator, said he “acknowledged behaving inappropriately and pledged to keep his distance from Ms. Iseman.” John Weaver, a former top strategist for McCain, told The Times he had arranged a meeting at Union Station in Washington in which Iseman was asked to stay away from the senator. Weaver said the message of McCain’s 2000 presidential campaign was “taking on the special interests” and Iseman’s presence could undermine that.The article was notable for what it did not say: It did not say what convinced the advisers that there was a romance. It did not make clear what McCain was admitting when he acknowledged behaving inappropriately — an affair or just an association with a lobbyist that could look bad. And it did not say whether Weaver, the only on-the-record source, believed there was a romance. The Times did not offer independent proof, like the text messages between Detroit’s mayor and a female aide that The Detroit Free Press disclosed recently, or the photograph of Donna Rice sitting on Gary Hart’s lap.It was not for want of trying. Four highly respected reporters in the Washington bureau worked for months on the story and were pressed repeatedly to get sources on the record and to find documentary evidence like e-mail. If McCain had been having an affair with a lobbyist seeking his help on public policy issues, and The Times had proved it, it would have been a story of unquestionable importance.But in the absence of a smoking gun, I asked Keller why he decided to run what he had.“If the point of the story was to allege that McCain had an affair with a lobbyist, we’d have owed readers more compelling evidence than the conviction of senior staff members,” he replied. “But that was not the point of the story. The point of the story was that he behaved in such a way that his close aides felt the relationship constituted reckless behavior and feared it would ruin his career.”I think that ignores the scarlet elephant in the room. A newspaper cannot begin a story about the all-but-certain Republican presidential nominee with the suggestion of an extramarital affair with an attractive lobbyist 31 years his junior and expect readers to focus on anything other than what most of them did. And if a newspaper is going to suggest an improper sexual affair, whether editors think that is the central point or not, it owes readers more proof than The Times was able to provide.The stakes are just too big. As the flamboyant Edwin Edwards of Louisiana once said, “The only way I can lose this election is if I’m caught in bed with either a dead girl or a live boy.”The pity of it is that, without the sex, The Times was on to a good story. McCain, who was reprimanded by the Senate Ethics Committee in 1991 for exercising “poor judgment” by intervening with federal regulators on behalf of a corrupt savings and loan executive, recast himself as a crusader against special interests and the corrupting influence of money in politics. Yet he has continued to maintain complex relationships with lobbyists like Iseman, at whose request he wrote to the Federal Communications Commission to urge a speed-up on a decision affecting one of her clients.Much of that story has been reported over the years, but it was still worth pulling together to help voters in 2008 better understand the John McCain who might be their next president.I asked Jill Abramson, the managing editor for news, if The Times could have done the story and left out the allegation about an affair. “That would not have reflected the essential truth of why the aides were alarmed,” she said.But what the aides believed might not have been the real truth. And if you cannot provide readers with some independent evidence, I think it is wrong to report the suppositions or concerns of anonymous aides about whether the boss is getting into the wrong bed.'"

It recently tightened the blockade in response to intensified rocket fire from the strip. Israel, like the United States and the European Union, classifies Hamas as a terrorist organization and refuses to deal with it. Hamas claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Dimona earlier this month.But European Union and United Nations officials have recently raised concerns about the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza. European officials have been trying to bring about discussions among Israel, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority, which is led by President Mahmoud Abbas, about a controlled reopening of the passages into Gaza. The government of Mr. Abbas, which is based in the West Bank, has offered to send back members of the Presidential Guard to secure the crossings.On Thursday, the European Parliament, meeting in Strasbourg, France, passed a nonbinding resolution urging Israel not to inflict “collective punishment” on civilians in Gaza because of the rockets, and called on Israel to lift the blockade.But Israel contends that opening the crossings would strengthen Hamas and is skeptical about the ability of the pro-Abbas forces to act in Gaza independently of the rival Islamic group.The foreign minister of Israel, Tzipi Livni, said Thursday, “It would be better if Europe understood that Gaza is a zero-sum game — either Hamas or the moderates.”She spoke after meeting with Marc Otte, the visiting European Union special representative to the Middle East peace process, and was referring to the Abbas camp, with whom Israel is engaged in peace talks.Also on Saturday, Mr. Abbas ordered an investigation into the death in custody of a Hamas preacher from the West Bank. The preacher, Majed Barghouti, 44, from the village of Kobar, died Friday in a Palestinian intelligence service prison in Ramallah run by pro-Fatah forces loyal to Mr. Abbas. Mr. Barghouti was detained a week earlier. His family alleged that he had been tortured by his interrogators and said that he was healthy when he was arrested. The intelligence service suggested that Mr. Barghouti had died of heart problems.Scores of Hamas members have been detained in the West Bank by pro-Abbas forces since the Hamas takeover of Gaza. Many have been released after handing over weapons.In the West Bank early Saturday, Israeli forces arrested a senior militant of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a militant leftist group, Israeli and Palestinian officials said. The militant, Majdi Mabrouk, was arrested at his home in the Ein Beit Ilma refugee camp in Nablus.'"
"'08-02-24,'0','Leipheimer, the defending champion, remains the overall leader. Millar maintained his second-place spot, 49 seconds back.Even if the Slipstream riders cannot overcome Leipheimer’s lead in Sunday’s final stage, they have already made a strong impression. Three Slipstream-Chipotle were among the top six over all after Stage 6, with Millar second, Christian Vande Velde third (1:08 behind) and David Zabriskie sixth (1:36 back).A fourth Slipstream rider, Tyler Farrar, wore the race leader’s yellow jersey after the second stage, only to have to surrender it when a stomach ailment sent him out of the race during Stage 3.Despite Farrar’s early exit, Slipstream’s performance is the type it needed in its attempt to gain a berth in the Tour de France.Because it is registered in the second level, rather than in the elite level of professional cycling, Slipstream will need an at-large bid to enter the Tour de France in July. Those bids are awarded by the race’s organizer. Slipstream has already secured a spot in the Giro d’Italia in May, its first appearance in one of the three-week grand tours.“I hope everyone’s impressed with what we’re doing,” said Millar, a British road and time-trial champion, who joined Slipstream this year. Speaking at a news conference after his second-place finish in the time trial Friday in Stage 5, Millar said that although the team’s intention was not simply to impress the organizers of the Tour de France, “I like to think they’ve got an eye on us.”The team has made itself conspicuous for at least two reasons: Slipstream’s garish gold-and-blue-argyle uniforms, and its proclamation that it instituted a tough antidoping program.That program, a form of which has also been implemented by at least three other top-level cycling teams, is designed to test the team’s riders throughout the year. It gathers baseline data on each rider’s blood and body functions, in the hopes of spotting if any rider were to begin using performance-enhancing drugs.The effort has won praise from Christian Prudhomme, the director of the Tour de France. “Slipstream’s philosophy is the same philosophy of the future of cycling,” Prudhomme told the magazine VeloNews last month at the Tour of Qatar. He added, “Cycling cannot afford more scandals.”The big difference between this year’s Slipstream team and last year’s is the presence of riders with considerable experience. Millar, a former rider for the French team Cofidis, was suspended for two years and stripped of his 2003 world time-trial title after acknowledging that he used the blood booster EPO. Now, Millar is one of the most outspoken antidoping advocates in the peloton.Zabriskie, the United States time-trial champion, and Vande Velde joined Slipstream this year from CSC.'"
"'08-02-24,'0','Mr. McCain’s advisers say the campaign has yet to discuss vice presidential prospects. “We haven’t spent one second talking about the selection of a running mate, and, as you know, he’s superstitious, so I doubt we will talk about it for a while,” said Charlie Black, a veteran of many Republican presidential campaigns. Asked about the age factor, he drew on his past campaign experience for an analogy of how it might weigh in the selection.“Reagan had a quote ‘age’ issue in 1980,” Mr. Black said. “It wouldn’t go away until the day he picked George Bush as vice president. And then people said, well, here’s a known quantity, the guy has experience, including international experience, and, yeah, he could handle it.”The subject of Mr. McCain’s age has come up, gingerly, on the campaign trail. When one of Mike Huckabee’s biggest supporters, Chuck Norris, 67, said after the South Carolina primary that he did not think Mr. McCain would have “the stamina to run the country for four years,” Mr. McCain responded with a crack that highlighted his gene pool. “I’m afraid that I may have to send my 95-year-old mother to wash Chuck’s mouth out with soap,” he said.Mr. Obama seemed to call attention to Mr. McCain’s age with a bit more subtlety, telling a crowd this month, “Listen, I respect John McCain for his half-century of service to this country.” Mr. Obama has since dropped the “half-century” reference from similar lines. But he has drawn the distinction in other ways, as he did Tuesday in his speech after winning the Wisconsin primary when he said of Mr. McCain: “He represents the policies of yesterday. And we want to be the party of tomorrow.”Mr. McCain, in his own speeches, frequently points to his experience.“My friends, I’m not the youngest candidate,” Mr. McCain said after winning the Wisconsin primary, “but I am the most experienced.”On the trail Mr. McCain has shown his vigor by keeping a punishing schedule that sometimes tired followers less than half his age. In New Hampshire, the state where he saved his struggling candidacy, he did 101 town-hall-style meetings. It was hardly unusual for him to conduct all-day, on-the-record, rolling news conferences aboard his bus, which were interrupted from time to time by a stop for a speech or a town-hall meeting. Unlike most candidates, Mr. McCain rarely paused to collect himself before those events: usually he would rise from the back of the bus, grab an index card reminding him which local dignitaries to thank and walk straight onto the stage.But he does have white hair, scars from a bout with melanoma and limited flexibility from the injuries he sustained as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. And the fact remains that by the end of a second McCain term, he would be in his 80s.When asked if he would consider running only for one term, he has always dismissed such a suggestion, as he did when he was asked about the possibility in January at a Fox News candidates’ forum.“No, because I think then you’re the lame duck, you’re quacking on Inauguration Day,” he said. “But look, I would point out that when Ronald Reagan won the cold war, he was in his second term older than me. I think that’s pretty good, isn’t it? Look, I’ve got the vigor. I’ve been — everybody has seen me here on the campaign trail. We work 16, 18 hours a day.”Jack F. Kemp, a McCain supporter who was the party’s vice presidential nominee in 1996, when the presidential nominee, Bob Dole, was older than Mr. McCain, said Mr. McCain’s choice of a running mate held special significance.“I think his nominee, his choice for vice president, is going to be very important for party regulars, and also in terms of his or her capability someday to succeed as president,” Mr. Kemp said, noting that vice presidents usually eventually run for president.Scholars of the vice presidency said that the age of Mr. McCain’s running mate would probably be just one factor in the selection process. The others would be ideology — some selections could be seen as rallying the conservative base, while others would be seen as reaching out to independent voters — and geography, either to appeal to a region or to try to nail down a state. But several said in interviews that competence would most likely trump the others.“I think nowadays that any presidential candidate has to pick somebody who is a plausible president,” said Joel K. Goldstein, a professor of law at St. Louis University who studies the vice presidency. “I think you can’t put a bozo or a mediocrity on the ticket just because he is the most popular official in a state with 20-plus electoral votes.”He continued, “Senator McCain’s age may make it marginally more important that he select a running mate who is perceived as presidential, but it’s a difference of degree.”Some cautioned that picking too young a running mate might simply call attention to the age difference. “I don’t think McCain will have to worry much about finding a younger candidate — and he would be well advised to remember Dan Quayle if he does so,” said Paul C. Light, a professor of public service at New York University. “It’s not age that he will battle this fall, but vision.”'"
"'08-02-24,'0','He said that careful investments in triple-A-rated mortgage-backed bonds, or similar bank loan funds, could be a good way to bolster the yield of fixed-income portfolios.Adam Topalian, a fixed-income strategist at Lehman Brothers, agreed that there were some opportunities in mortgage-backed bonds, specifically “high-quality mortgage-backed securities that have gotten dragged down with subprime,” he said. But Mr. Topalian preferred municipal bonds to high-grade corporate bonds now, particularly when held in taxable accounts.Martin J. Mauro, a fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch, also emphasizes the municipal bond markets. “The yields on munis are unusually high compared with Treasuries, so munis are attractive for a lot of investors now, not just high-income people,” he said. In fact, he recommended that investors in the 28 percent federal tax bracket or higher invest 90 percent of their taxable bond portfolios in munis.He noted that there were further tax advantages to owning municipal bonds issued in investors’ home states, particularly if they live in high-tax states.Another option for those seeking higher yield is to invest up to 10 percent of a taxable bond portfolio in foreign government bonds, he said, particularly those from countries in the euro zone.John Donohue, chief investment officer in the fixed-income group of JPMorgan Asset Management, also favors euro zone government bonds; he predicted the European Central Bank would eventually have to cut interest rates.“The fact that they’ve held out so long might even make the cuts greater later on,” he said. Bond holders make money when rates are falling, because bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions.But Mr. Donohue had some concern about the currency risk of owning these bonds, because the dollar has already fallen so sharply against the euro. A strengthening of the dollar, he said, could cut into profits for dollar-based investors. So he advised individual investors to ask their brokers to hedge the currency risk from owning foreign bonds.He also favors keeping a somewhat larger-than-usual portion of a bond portfolio in cash.“You want cash on hand later, if the market gives you opportunities to invest again in things like high-yield,” he said.Treasuries with maturity dates from two to five years generally have yields in the 2 to 2.8 percent range, compared with average yields in the low 3 percent range for money market mutual funds (though some of the top-yielding funds are near 4 percent).Mr. Mauro of Merrill Lynch recommends holding somewhat longer-maturity bonds, ranging from 5 to 15 years, because he says he expects rates to go lower.That is largely based on his relatively gloomy outlook for the nation’s economy. “I think we could very well be in a recession now, or if not, soon,” he said. And he predicted that even after the economy emerged from recession, growth could be relatively weak for some time.Mr. Mauro said he thought that the Federal Reserve was far from finished with its rate-cutting. He predicted that it would lower the federal funds rate, now at 3 percent, to 2 percent by year-end, and to 1 percent by the end of 2009. He does not anticipate rising interest rates — which would hurt existing bond holders — for a couple of years.'"
"'08-02-24,'0','AT Public School 308 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, mornings officially begin with an address to teachers and students by the school’s tall and commanding principal, Gail Bell-Baptiste.One morning this month, recent attendance figures were announced, teachers were reminded that “we are preparing for something magnificent here, the magnificent lives of these young people,” and students were invited to buy Valentine’s Day Candygrams from the chess club.Back in her cluttered office, Dr. Bell-Baptiste reflected on a less cheerful aspect of her job: having to perform emergency midyear surgery on her school’s budget. The hard choices she made illustrate the ground-level impact of a $180 million cut in the citywide system’s annual operating budget of $10.3 billion, excluding teachers’ salaries.“Principals are livid about this,” Dr. Bell-Baptiste said. “How can they cut our budget in February after we’ve already made our plans for the year?”On Jan. 31, principals at public schools received an e-mail message from the city’s Department of Education ordering them to cut 1.75 percent from their operating and programming budget. By the next day, the money had disappeared from the schools’ online budgets, forcing administrators to make immediate decisions about whom to let go and which programs to drop.'"
"'08-02-24,'0','THE last time Camille Taylor caught a whiff of fame was more than 60 years ago on the stage of the Apollo Theater in Harlem. Back then, Ms. Taylor was a spunky young woman who had moved to New York from Charlotte, N.C., and edged her way onto the black vaudeville circuit. Her stage name was Big Hat Millie, a nod to the wide-brimmed hats she favored.But after her comedy career sputtered, Ms. Taylor settled into a quiet life in Highbridge in the West Bronx, a neighborhood where she has long been beloved as a foster parent, tutor, baby sitter and mother figure to generations of local children.“All these people were hollering and cursing at the kids, but not me,” said Ms. Taylor, now 93 with shiny silver hair. “I always had patience. When I go out on the street, they yell: ‘Hi, Nana! Hi, Grandma! Hi, Mother Taylor!’ ”Recently, however, this neighborhood fixture has gotten a taste of her old stage life. Ms. Taylor is one of 30 current and former Highbridge residents who have been interviewed for a new documentary, “Highbridge: Past, Present and Future.”The film about this gritty, seldom-celebrated neighborhood, perched on a hill beside Yankee Stadium, is the brainchild of Jose Gonzalez, a 33-year-old video editor who has lived in the area for eight years. He started work on the documentary soon after the fire last March that killed 10 West African immigrants, nine of them children. The fire occurred just three blocks from Mr. Gonzalez’s apartment; his two sons had attended school with some of the children who died.Making the film was his way of trying to help lift local dashed spirits. With small grants and borrowed equipment, Mr. Gonzalez spent the next few months cobbling together a 12-minute trailer, which was screened for an enthusiastic crowd of more than 50 people at a local school last fall.'"
"'08-02-24,'0','PAUL SOKOLOFF, a 51-year-old bartender with a small earring and a smoker’s rusty chuckle, is a blunt-spoken man, not the sort one expects to talk like a civics textbook. But that is how he sounded a few days ago when he described the vote he had cast in his local schoolhouse on the day of the New York primary.“I wanted the opportunity to have a say in our future,” Mr. Sokoloff said during a smoking break outside the Trellis, a diner and bar on Main Street, the primary thoroughfare on Roosevelt Island. “I wanted to vote for the people who make all the decisions in our lives.”Like 2.3 million other New Yorkers statewide, Mr. Sokoloff had voted for a presidential nominee in the Feb. 5 balloting. But that is not the vote he was describing. Immediately after pulling the lever, he had walked to the hallway outside the school cafeteria and entered a booth rented from Election Machine Service Company, of Woodside, Queens. There, he voted to place up to six of his neighbors on the board of the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, the state agency that runs the island.Mr. Sokoloff’s vote was a symbolic gesture, but it was the culmination of an audacious civic experiment. Roosevelt Islanders have grumbled for a decade about the way the island is governed.Although the island is city property, it is leased to the state until 2068. The governor appoints all nine members of the operating corporation’s board, which manages an annual budget of $32.5 million. Legislative efforts to amend the system so that members are directly elected have repeatedly failed in the State Senate.'"
"'08-02-24,'0','Last month, Oracle pulled in another major prize, BEA Systems, a leading software company, for about $8.5 billion. You’ve probably never heard of BEA: it’s doubly obscure, producing the behind-the-scenes infrastructure that large companies use to build behind-the-scenes software systems for their entire business, or “enterprise software.” Both Oracle and BEA are based in Silicon Valley, but their side of the street is not lit by klieg lights and does not get the same attention as the Googles and Yahoos.And, to be honest, it’s not much fun hanging out on the enterprise side of the software business. BEA says its software helps organizations “ensure that business processes are optimally defined, managed, executed and monitored.” Unless you’re playing Business Jargon Bingo, it’s hard to sit still and remain attentive. You have to admire Oracle’s ability to remain focused on the business that serves business and to not be distracted by the buzz of the Web crowd gathered across the street.Microsoft does business software well. Approximately half its revenue comes from business customers for its e-mail infrastructure, database systems, developer tools, Office productivity applications and other mainstays. It has also assembled, through acquisitions, a fledgling line of enterprise software that it calls Microsoft Dynamics. Microsoft would like Dynamics to be viewed as competing head to head with the No. 2 name in enterprise software, Oracle, or the No. 1, SAP of Germany. For the moment, however, Microsoft Dynamics’ parity with those big names is nothing more than wishful aspiration.Professor Cusumano has a suggestion: Rather than acquire Yahoo, Microsoft should pursue SAP.It’s not an outlandish idea. The two companies held merger talks in late 2003, and perhaps since then, too. Microsoft is in an enviable position: it is a nearly universal presence in corporate data centers, and large enterprise customers are arguably the best customers a software company can have. Clients pay very dear prices for the complex, semicustomized software that runs their business. And once they’ve got their systems running — a process that can take years to complete — they aren’t inclined to change vendors lightly.A few dozen well-paying Fortune 500 customers may actually be more valuable than tens of millions of Web e-mail “customers” who pay nothing for the service and whose attention is not highly valued by online advertisers.Today, SAP’s market capitalization is about $59 billion, and a sizable premium to get a deal done would send its price well north of that. Microsoft cannot put both SAP and Yahoo in its shopping cart, deals that together might run well over $120 billion. Microsoft must pick one or the other.Suppose that Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, were the head of Microsoft and was doing the shopping. Which deal would he choose? Past experience suggests that it would not be Yahoo. That acquisition would bring little but duplication headaches — and no large enterprise customers.It’s amusing to note that the most Larry-like choice, Microsoft’s acquiring of SAP and leaving it alone as an autonomous division to avoid a cross-cultural integration fiasco, is the course that would be most discomfiting to Oracle. Frank Scavo, president of Computer Economics, an information technology research firm, in Irvine, Calif., said that “a Microsoft-SAP combination would be Oracle’s worst nightmare.”Google would not be happy with a conjoined Microsoft and SAP, either. It has made a pro forma expression of its own opposition to a Microsoft-Yahoo merger, but we can speculate that it may be cheering that deal on. Working in Google’s favor are the hostile nature of Microsoft’s bid, the colossal potential for integration problems, and organizational paralysis in, and exodus of talent from, Yahoo.But were Microsoft to turn and head in SAP’s direction, Google would have reason for concern. Whatever strengthens Microsoft is bound to influence, later if not sooner, its continuing competition with Google. For its own part, Google is keen to expand its foothold inside large companies. Last year, it acquired Postini, whose software filters corporate e-mail. Google has not done so well with corporate customers on its own, however. Google Apps has conspicuously failed to win adoption quickly.If Microsoft is to rededicate its attention to its most valuable assets, business customers, a prerequisite is dropping its ill-advised bid for Yahoo. And to find the best acquisition strategy, ask, “What would Larry do?”If Microsoft tries to fight Google with wobbly legs, scared witless, it will lose.'"
"'08-02-24,'0','That is, to the sight of a unicorn head mounted on the wall opposite his bed.The head, an antique found in England by a dealer he knew, was the first splurge Mr. Tisci allowed himself after being named creative director at Givenchy. The fantastic creature is actually a lavish piece of jackalope wit: a spiral-contoured narwhal tusk grafted neatly to a horse head. But for Mr. Tisci, the idea of slaying the rarest creature for a trophy’s sake is not gallows humor. “It was my dream to have a unicorn when I was a boy,” he said. “I would never kill one. If I found it, I would want it to stay with me forever.”Mr. Tisci feels passionately about the mount for a variety of reasons: for one, it represents more than one fabled beast. As a hybrid of horse and narwhal, it is quite the chimera, that totally derivative creature of Greek myth.“Definitely, I am a chimera — I’m a mix of different cultures and people,” he said, ticking off his childhood in Italy, his formative years studying in London and his new home in Paris. Working in fashion, he said, you have to accept, if not celebrate, the fact that you’re not always creating something new, out of whole cloth.“Everything has been done, from the ’80s till now,” he said. “It’s all been done before.”The unicorn helps him lay this reality and others aside: “It means many things: power, fantasy. I am very into fantasy, I’m a very dreamy person. A horse is beautiful, it has so much strength, but softness, too. There’s so much light and freedom.”For him, these are truths to remember. “Reality sometimes can be very tough,” he said. “Fantasy is what makes us carry on and be happy.”While many of his own fantasies have become reality, he tries to keep it unreal. “I see people who have everything,” he said. “You need to have something that you need. Dreams make you keep going.”The first thing he sees in the morning and the last at night, the unicorn gives him a feeling of specialness, an essential attitude in the judgmental world of fashion.And if fashion can’t protect you from reality — well, what is fashion good for?'"
"'08-02-24,'0','Ms. Wade started commuting to Point Pleasant in 2005 to begin filming. Eventually, she moved in with the two women. When she began the film, Ms. Hester knew she had only weeks to live. By film’s end, her health had changed greatly, and she is shown being wheeled by Ms. Andree into the Ocean County Courthouse, determined but decrepit, bald from chemotherapy and using an oxygen tank to breathe.The film, which is nominated for an Oscar in the best documentary short subject category and has already taken honors at the Sundance Film Festival and 11 others, flashes from scenes of the couple’s home life, cavorting with their two dogs or being tender with each other, to the courtroom, after their case was attracting widespread attention.Ms. Hester tried to persuade Ocean County freeholders to change their policy, saying that without her pension, her partner, an auto mechanic who works in Brick, would not be able to stay in their home.Her impending death lent a sense of urgency to her cause, and soon her supporters were packing freeholder meetings. The crowds included members of the clergy and members of the gay-rights group Garden State Equality and family and other townspeople. They carried signs that said, “Don’t let Officer Laurel Hester die like this.”Also on the couple’s side were a number of Ms. Hester’s former police colleagues, many of whom testified at each public meeting throughout her 18-month court battle.“I think the freeholders underestimated Laurel’s tenacity and the groundswell of support she would inspire,” Ms. Wade said. “She had all these straight, tough, hetero cops around her, pulling for her — married men, some of them politically conservative.”Ms. Hester died in February 2006, at the age of 49, a month after the freeholders reversed their position and allowed police and fire employees to name anyone, not just a spouse, as a beneficiary.“Freeheld,” which cost Ms. Wade $350,000 and took 13 months to complete, ends with Ms. Hester’s memorial service. There, Ms. Andree stands shoulder to shoulder with Ms. Hester’s former police partner, Dane Wells. The two have since become close, meeting in the evenings and on weekends to fix cars or just hang out.With the pension, Ms. Andree was able to keep her home. She said she respects the film for how it portrays Ms. Hester’s fight, and her victory. “But it still shows Laurel hurting, and that’s hard,” she said.The experience of the last couple of years has changed her in many ways, she said. Though she had never traveled west of Pittsburgh, she decided to accompany Ms. Wade to the Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles.“Stacie has every right to move on — this is a film about her wife dying,” Ms. Wade said. “I’m worried about it being too big and intense for her. But it feels like closure. As long as she’s not overloaded, I’m so happy she’ll be there.”'"
"'08-02-24,'0','Taking in the scene through the bars of a crate was a baby serval, an African wildcat with a spotted coat similar to that of a leopard. The cub was recuperating from an overzealous cleaning by her mother that had resulted in a lost tail.Downstairs, a 160-pound alpaca appeared to be in a sanguine mood, despite a bandaged leg, a result of a foot infection Dr. Stanzione had surgically treated the previous week.“It’s challenging, from one case to the next,” he said. “I could be performing surgery, administering vaccinations to antelope or, if a zebra needs treatment, putting together a carefully planned protocol that will probably include the use of a dart gun. It’s not like treating your average cat or dog.”Yes, there are zebras in Westchester. Three of them reside at the Mount Kisco estate of Michael H. Steinhardt, a former hedge fund manager. Dr. Stanzione spends one or two days a week there, catering to a menagerie of 150-plus animals..On a recent balmy Monday, Dr. Stanzione visited the estate and performed a weekly inspection, checking on the Aldabra giant tortoises, which in winter lounge on a radiant-heated barn floor; looking in on two extremely rare South African blesbok antelopes; and pointing out the capybara, round-bellied beasts known as the world’s largest rodents.“Gil has a terrific enthusiasm, even when dealing with what can be some very difficult and obscure issues that wouldn’t come up in your ordinary practice,” Mr. Steinhardt said.Veterinary school provided Dr. Stanzione with the basics of animal care, but a stint at the Bronx Zoo early in his career helped familiarize him with exotic-animal husbandry, and a more recent course on animal capture sharpened the shooting skills needed when using the dart gun he keeps nearby for on-site visits.Also close at hand is a laser-sighted carbon dioxide pistol to quell any unexpected attacks. “I never forget these are wild animals,” he said.To ensure the legal standing of acquisitions, Dr. Stanzione works with clients on acquiring the requisite permits from state and federal agencies, including the United States Department of Agriculture. The oversight is necessary not only to guard against risk to endangered animals, but also to prevent the spread of disease.An outbreak of monkeypox in the summer of 2003 was spread by wild prairie dogs sold in Midwest pet stores, leading the Department of Health and Human Services to issue an embargo of prairie dogs and rodents from Africa.The risks can go beyond disease: Dr. Stanzione says he has been spit at and kicked by animals, although never bitten. Still, he remains enthusiastic about a specialty that allows him to interact weekly with some of nature’s wildest members.“This is work that is just very, very, different,” he said, “something I just love to do.”'"

"'08-02-24,'0','They printed 400 copies and asked people to pass them on. A friend Mr. Keane hadn’t seen in 20 years gave it to a fellow birder in West Virginia, who turned out to be the older sister of Moriah Dailer.“It was very thoughtfully written,” Ms. Dailer said. “And I liked the pictures around the border.” Camren Weigand was not so sure about the couple in the photographs. “They looked a little old to me,” he said. But they hit it off from the first phone call. The New Jersey couple wanted an open adoption. “We believe secrecy in life is not a good thing,” Ms. Thatcher said. “This should be about what’s best for the child, and we think it’s important that children know where they come from historically and genetically.”While there are no national statistics, open adoption is increasingly common, according to Harold Grotevant, a University of Minnesota professor who is one of the leading experts in the field. He’s been doing research with 35 adoption agencies for the last two decades and says there has been a clear-cut swing from confidential to open adoptions. Susan Caughman, editor of Adoptive Families magazine, started an Ask the Experts column last year on open adoption, which, she says, now gets more queries than any other column at the magazine.When it was time for Ms. Dailer to give birth, the baby’s father as well as the adoptive parents were there in the delivery room. The adoptive parents selected a half-dozen names then let the birth parents make the final choice. Phelan Daniel Thatcher-Keane, 7 pounds, 9 ounces, was born Sept. 29, 2001. The adoptive parents were free to leave West Virginia within a few days, but stayed a week and a half. “We sat around and told stories and got to know each other,” Ms. Dailer said.Since then, the birth parents, their parents and friends have visited Phelan a dozen times. Their level of contact is not typical. More common, said Ms. Caughman, is an exchange of letters and photographs.On one visit to South Orange, six of Phelan’s relatives and their friends stayed at the Thatcher-Keane home: the birth mother, birth mother’s dad, birth mother’s fiancé, fiancé’s mother, and two of the birth mother’s and fiancé’s college friends. They know it sounds strange to outsiders, they know it might not work if people get too territorial or possessive, but it has worked for them. They believe by being open, they will avoid problems that can come when grown children go hunting their birth parents.“It’s worked because we’re all determined to do what’s best for Phelan,” Ms. Thatcher said. “You gradually get to like each other and trust each other. Moriah’s never crossed an inappropriate boundary by trying to correct our parenting.” Each visit, she’s thanked them for the job they’re doing with Phelan.While it’s hard for outsiders to keep everyone straight, Phelan, now 6, seems to have a firm grasp on what’s going on. Looking at pictures with a visitor, he says: “That’s Moriah. She’s my birth mother. Camren, he’s my birth father. And that’s me with Mom and Dad. And that’s Granny Carmen” — his birth father’s mother. For Phelan, it’s meant more cousins and grandparents to play with.Despite the openness, giving up a child still tore at the birth parents. Ms. Dailer went through therapy and says it took two years before she stopped feeling like she was 60. She returned to Berea College in Kentucky to finish her degree and sometimes heard harsh comments from younger students. “No. 1, ‘How could you give up your baby?’ No. 2, ‘What makes you think you’re not screwing up by letting him know he has two moms and two dads?’ ”In 2004 she began a serious romantic relationship; in 2005, Phelan was with her on stage when she got her Berea diploma; in 2007, he was the ring bearer when she married. She and her husband, Ben Kahn, live in Washington State, where she works painting and varnishing boats.Mr. Weigand, the birth father, continues to move around, working now as a farm laborer in Hawaii. “It took six to eight months to stop feeling sorry for myself,” he said. “My dad hasn’t talked to me since the adoption.”But he says: “I really grew to love Kerry and Liane. It was like an aunt and uncle I never had. And Phelan’s not gone. He has a bigger family; he’s got love coming from everywhere. He’s got a great life — a lot’s going on in New Jersey.”Nor does the story end there. Last year, Mr. Weigand’s sister, Sarah Brewer, of Clayton, Ind., unexpectedly became pregnant. She is 29, has four children ages 2 to 11, is in the midst of a divorce and is going back to school to become a medical assistant. As Phelan’s aunt, she knew about his open adoption. At family gatherings, she’d met Ms. Thatcher and Mr. Keane.On Dec. 1, 2007 in Danville, Ind., Mrs. Brewer gave birth to a 7 pound, 5 ounce girl and handed her over to Ms. Thatcher and Mr. Keane for adoption: Tallulah Maria Thatcher-Keane. On paper it keeps getting more complicated. Phelan and Tallulah are brother and sister, as well as cousins. But in person, it just seems like family. Within a few days, papers were signed, but the New Jersey family did not go home. They hung around another week and a half, and everyone had time to tell their stories and get to know one another.'"
"'08-02-24,'0','“Do we really want a rerun of that soap opera?” Among friends and acquaintances talking through their presidential choices, it often comes down to this: excited to have two such inspiring candidates as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, they all roll their eyes at the melodramatic baggage that comes along with the former first couple. Not merely for the undecided voters among us, but for everyone involved, I think the situation calls for a deus ex machina solution drawn straight from the soaps themselves. Whisking a star offstage — often to some dire fate or unspecified location — is the tried-and-true secret to rescuing a flagging story line. For a campaign badly in need of an upswing, the moment has come for Hillary to declare plans to dispatch Bill to Africa once she takes office.The Billary routine, as she has surely noticed, began to wear thin when the former president’s pre-Super Tuesday performances were roundly panned. Clinton haters gloat, “I told you so,” of course. But even supporters sigh, and the waverers out there wonder where this pushmi-pullyu candidacy is leading. Garry Wills recently put the doubt into words: “Do we really want a plural presidency?” After eight years with Co-President Cheney, Americans are understandably wary. If Hillary has trouble controlling Bill on the stump, goes the uneasy refrain, how will she manage him in the White House? When he’s in the campaign spotlight, her feminist trailblazing credentials are questioned. So are his globe-trotting and fund-raising connections — and the last thing Democrats want to worry about right now is what Bill was doing in Kazakhstan with a Clinton Foundation donor/dealmaker. Plot twists like that are better left to Borat.It’s time to turn the page, as someone else said, and let Hillary step forth in her truly pioneering role. What sets her apart is not that she is an independent woman running for a top political office: as a glance around the globe suggests, that is almost old hat. Where she could be breaking genuinely new ground is in mastering a different, and very up-to-date, female predicament: she is the wife in a super-high-profile dual-career marriage who needs to carve out her own power niche with assertive grace.By now there are assorted precedents for the female leader with, in essence, no male appurtenances — a father who is out of the picture and a husband who is a political cipher. Dennis Thatcher minded his own business while Margaret Thatcher tended to the affairs of state. Today, Joachim Sauer, spouse of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, quietly pursues quantum chemistry — spared the burden of beautifying highways, picking china or helping children, much less supplying behind-the-scenes counsel. He didn’t even show up in Parliament to see her elected. It’s a tidy script: no second shift for him, no power sharing for her. The stand-alone profile of a leader like Merkel blurs naturally into the unattached female powerhouse, who no longer raises eyebrows, either; from Golda Meir (who dragged her husband to Palestine, where they drifted apart) to the divorcée Madeleine Albright to Condoleezza Rice, she has become a familiar figure.It’s the dual-politician couple, with husband still alive and wife in the ascendancy, that awaits a model. Elizabeth Dole, who briefly braved the presidential campaign trail only after her husband was demoted to doing ads for Viagra, doesn’t point the way. Nor will you find an exemplar in France, the nation formerly famous for its sangfroid approach to unusual marital arrangements. Just listen to Ségolène Royal, who was the Socialist candidate for president in 2007 while her partner of three decades, François Hollande, headed the Socialist Party: no sooner did she lose the race than she started laying no small part of the blame on his tepid support. (And they split up.)'"
"'08-02-24,'0','As a nonpartisan (not postpartisan) lexicographer, I have tried three times to reach someone in Senator Clinton’s presidential campaign staff to point to, pursue and retrieve the source of this colorful expression, which may be a New York doctrine with an Arkansas corollary. Perhaps the Clinton staff is busy with more immediate concerns or mistakenly suspects my query is some sort of rhetorical trap because my political views are congenitally conservative. Therefore, I must turn further etymology of this rare bit of Americana over to that cultural marvel at the University of Wisconsin, the Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE), whose researchers resolutely bird-dog such dialectical delights.Two presidential elections ago, it was noted breathlessly in this space that “the hot new word in primary politics this season is fire wall.”After John McCain’s victory in the 2000 New Hampshire primary, Karl Rove, then nationally little known as the Bush guru, had just said about the 13 states that were to follow, “Virtually every one of those states presents the possibility of a fire wall.” At that time, the spokesman for the McCain campaign was pleased to point out that “you’ve started to see the Bush people talk about Michigan as a fire wall.”As the French pundit Plusah Shonge might say of this year’s Democratic race, Plus c’est la même chose. “Hispanic voters proved to be a very durable fire wall for Clinton, particularly in California,” noted Mara Liasson, NPR’s political correspondent, right after this month’s Supertuesday. (Copy Ed.: If it doesn’t infuriate the style czar, run that as one word, on the analogy of Superman, Übermensch, etc.) (Mr. Safire: The day before the nominating contests, the style czar in fact issued a directive that the phrase “Super Tuesday” should not appear anywhere in the paper.) A week later, Liasson opined on Fox News that “in the end, even after Ohio and Texas and Pennsylvania, which are the three big fire walls she’s counting on . . . and then in Texas, a lot of Hispanic voters — that’s her coalition — the Clinton people expect that this is going to come down to superdelegates. . . . ” (Copy Ed.: See if I can write that as superdelegates, same stylistic principle as superman, with the prefix fastened to the main word without hyphenation, consistent with Times style on postpartisan.) (Mr. Safire: Agreed.)Fire wall, first cited in 1799 as a literal wall between houses to prevent the spread of fire, gained new popularity in 1991 in computerese. “Fire walls were dedicated pieces of hardware that were placed between the Internet and organizations’ networks to ward off attacks,” says Alan Oppenheimer of the security firm Open Door Networks. As “personal” fire walls became necessary, in 2002 Microsoft and Apple began building them into operating systems; “wireless networking made fire walls even more critical, since access can come not just from the Internet but from your neighbor.”The word burned through the thin, dry-timbered wall of political neology in 1984, as Senator John Glenn’s campaign manager in South Carolina, John Lawson, told the A.P. that Glenn’s campaign “considered six Deep South states to be the crucial states for Glenn — the fire wall, if you will, between Mondale and the nomination.” Fritz Mondale won a majority of those states in Democratic races on his way to ultimate defeat in the general election by Ronald Reagan. “So much for the fire wall,” observes Ben Zimmer of Oxford University Press. “It worked about as well for Glenn in ’84 as Florida did this year for Giuliani and California for Romney.” (Copy Ed.: And while you’re at it, write firewall, along with seawall, as one word.) (Mr. Safire: Thank you for your suggestion.)'"

"'08-02-24,'0','Swap-a-rama Razzmatazz is one of London’s most fashionable club nights — and certainly its most eccentric. Its origins date to the time when a chap named Alex Collins studied abroad and lived on a commune where many garments were communal property. Eager to recreate back home that “year of my life when not having possessions didn’t bother me,” Collins held a party at which guests were told to swap outfits every time a whistle blew. The mayhem inspired Eloise Markwell-Butler, Dean Slydell, Dani Mazzer and Nick Frew to take the concept public, aided by donations from the vintage megastore Beyond Retro. Swap-a-rama Razzmatazz is now held at Favela Chic in the Shoreditch neighborhood once every month. Clotheslines festoon the club, and when the klaxon sounds, you either swap or split: ogling bystanders are evicted. Markwell-Butler likens it to “being in a mad person’s laundry.” Since partygoers keep their booty, at £3 for admission, it’s London’s cheapest way to get a new wardrobe. [?][?][?]SARAH NIR'"

"'08-02-24,'0','The financial divorce occurs when the property division is completed and each party walks away with his or her settlement. But then there is the emotional divorce — and it’s that part I deal with more often than I had anticipated. It’s not at all unusual for clients to become distraught during negotiations.Even though I went through my own divorce decades ago, it didn’t occur to me that my job would involve tears, fears — and sometimes rage — between my client and his or her former spouse.The first time a client started to cry, I instinctively wanted to hug her, but I stopped myself because I quickly realized that this was not the role I needed to play. The shoulder she needed would come from her best friend or someone in her family. It also dawned on me that I always needed to have a box of tissues on hand.To this day, a box is stashed in a drawer in the credenza of my conference room. And, even now, when a client begins to cry, I often have to fight my own tears. I have to let them cry while we focus on figuring out their financial future, however bright or bleak that may appear.At times, even communicating with a client can be difficult. Sometimes, when I’m talking by phone to a client at work, she will whisper or suddenly end the call, and it can take several tries to find a time when she can talk freely.Not infrequently I have to deal with fear — of being uprooted from the only life a client has known or, in one case, of facing the fact that the spouse had gambled away much of the family’s worth.As much empathy as I have, I keep in mind that I’m not a friend, but rather a trusted adviser, the person who educates and empowers clients to make smart decisions for their financial independence. For me, it is especially rewarding when the fear and tears turn to confidence and self-assurance.Often, clients — most are women — come to me to plan an “exit strategy,” especially when there is domestic abuse involved. These situations are tricky. We can’t openly communicate for fear that their spouse will find out. I always have to ask if it’s safe to leave a message on voice mail or to send an e-mail message. Some clients use a post office box or a friend’s address to receive correspondence from me.The most rancorous issues typically involve the marital residence and division of the retirement plans, which often represent the marriage’s largest financial assets. It’s the family home that usually holds a great deal of emotion for the woman because she probably has raised her children there, selected the curtains, painted the bedrooms and so on — so she feels connected to it and doesn’t want to leave even if it doesn’t make financial sense for her to stay there.Other times, the home holds a lot of hostility and she, or he, can’t get out fast enough. Either way, I need to examine how my client feels — but it’s most important that we set aside the emotional aspect and focus on the home from a strategic and logical financial position.There may be a second home they both adore and want to work out a plan to be co-owners and share it. I have to ask, delicately to be sure, how they will feel when their former spouse brings a new partner to share the master bedroom. Often, that puts a different spin on the plan.DELAWARE is a small state, so we often joke about two degrees of separation, not six. That matters, because I can represent only one client during divorce negotiations. But on several occasions I have been contacted by both parties looking for financial guidance, which can be problematic if one party came to me to plan an exit strategy before filing for divorce.Some have become almost hysterical when I’ve told them I couldn’t work with them because their spouse had already contacted me. Once a man walked into his appointment only to announce that he wanted to get to me first — before his wife did.'"
"'08-02-24,'0','FROM at least one perspective, the stock market peak of last October was not accompanied by the speculative excesses found at the height of previous bull markets. This raises hope that the market decline that began in the fall may not turn out to be severe — and that it may have already run its course.The indicator in question focuses on corporate money-raising. Considerable research has shown that when companies turn aggressively to the equity market for their financing needs, through new issues or secondary offerings, it is a sign that the stock market is overvalued. Though there is no easy way to interpret the data, current trends in corporate finance appear no worse than neutral for the stock market’s intermediate-term prospects. And the data may actually be painting a bullish picture.Owen A. Lamont, a former finance professor at Yale and now a fellow at its International Center for Finance, has studied shifts in companies’ use of the equity market to raise money. He has constructed a gauge, which some have called the new-list indicator, based on the percentage of all publicly traded shares that began trading in the trailing 36 months. This proportion increases as new companies go public or already-public companies issue more shares, and decreases as companies engage in stock repurchases or mergers and acquisitions.Professor Lamont, who is also a portfolio manager at DKR Capital, a hedge fund in Stamford, Conn., has calculated the new-list percentage back to 1929. Its all-time high was nearly 15 percent, at the beginning of the Depression. Its second-highest level, almost 11 percent, was in March 2000, just before the Internet bubble burst. (He published these results in 2002 in an academic working paper.)Where does the new-list percentage stand now? In an interview, Professor Lamont said it was at 5.1 percent, or right in line with its long-term average. When the market hit its high in October, he said, his indicator stood at just 5.6 percent. That was only marginally higher than where it finished the year, and about half its level at the market top in March 2000. By this measure of speculative activity, the current market is markedly less overheated than it was before the bursting of the Internet bubble.'"
"'08-02-24,'0','These restaurants on Greenwich Avenue are eclectic and cozy, like the surrounding neighborhood.A Salt and Battery, next to the equally British Tea and Sympathy, is not a theme restaurant, but it definitely has a subtext: fat. It’s an unreconstructed English “chippie,” with battered and fried fish the mainstay of the menu, supplemented by some rarely encountered working-class heroes like chip butties — the chips without the fish but sandwiched between two halves of a buttered roll — and deep-fried Mars Bars, a modern Scottish delicacy.This cozy Belgian cafe is a warm and welcoming stop for couples, and the small tables near the zinc bar are good for solo diners as well. Mussels and frites make a nice midsize meal with one of the excellent Belgian brews, including fruity ales brewed by Trappist monks and tart lambic ales made with natural, airborne yeasts.It is possible to eat unusually, eclectically and very well at this friendly New American place. The burger is big and meaty and sure to satisfy; even better are the grilled marinated skirt steak with parsley-garlic sauce; and the salad of crispy peanut chicken, Boston lettuce, snap peas and sweet corn with a jalapeño dressing.

"'08-02-24,'0','Despite that military provenance, most MRAPs coming out of American factories are made with so many components from International Harvester and Mack — including drivetrains and chassis — that long-haul truckers would feel at home behind the wheel. While the United States military had a handful of these vehicles at the start of the Iraq war, their ability to protect troops from I.E.D.’s has made them vital, igniting a manufacturing frenzy.The most widely used vehicle in Iraq is still the Humvee, but the bottom of even the most heavily armored of these is flat. This provides far more surface area for an explosive impact and allows the shock wave to ricochet from the Humvee to the ground and then back. “A bomb like that would toss a Humvee, split it and penetrate it,” Sergeant Spurlock said.Last May, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, introduced a measure that would allow the Army to replace its armored Humvees in Iraq with MRAPs. In early October, he spoke in support of the measure by citing an I.E.D. attack on an MRAP in Ramadi. The vehicle was blown so high that it literally took down telephone wires. But all seven occupants were relatively unharmed. By the end of 2007, $22.4 billion was earmarked for the MRAP in the military spending budget, with the eventual deployment of about 15,400 vehicles.“Gen. James T. Conway, the commandant of the Marine Corps, has said that you have a 300 percent better chance of surviving a blast in an MRAP vs. an up-armored Humvee,” Senator Biden said.In January, the military reported its first death in Iraq from an attack on an MRAP, when an I.E.D. destroyed a Navistar-made vehicle, wounding three soldiers and killing one, the gunner, who had been partly exposed outside of the vehicle. A few days before the attack, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates had called the vehicle “a proven lifesaver on the battlefield.”He cited Army reports that said since last summer, there had been 12 bomb attacks, with no deaths, on the vehicles.But Force Protection, the Charleston, S.C., company that makes the Cougar, said that over a longer time frame, from shortly after the war began in 2003 through last month, its MRAPs had been attacked with explosives about 3,200 times, resulting in the deaths of five servicemen.Although some current and former marines are critical of relying too much on the vehicles, fearing that they might change the fast-moving nature of the force, by mid-January about 2,500 MRAPs were in Iraq, up from about 100 in June. By this June, the military expected it would have more than 6,000, the bulk in Iraq.Cheryl Irwin, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said nine manufacturers originally competed for contracts to build the vehicles and four were chosen: the Navistar International Corporation, manufacturer of International Harvester trucks; a partnership between Force Protection and General Dynamics; and BAE Systems of Rockville, Md.Visits to the huge, frenetic manufacturing plants of Navistar in Mississippi and Force Protection in Charleston are sobering, but also offer an impressive display of the improvisational thinking that has helped to meet dizzying production demands. As recently as last May, Navistar’s plant in West Point, Miss., was a mothballed factory that once made industrial boilers. Today, the 400,000-square-foot plant has about 900 workers. Tim Touhy, a Navistar spokesman, said the company received its first order, for 1,971 vehicles, which Navistar calls the MaxxPro, last May. Navistar’s total order is for about 4,470 MRAPs and Force Protection’s is for about 3,400.“The whole plant is aware of the seriousness of this work,” said David Creasap, the plant operations development manager. “Many folks have children or parents over there.”Navistar imports its blast-resistant steel hull from Plasan Sasa, an Israeli armor manufacturer. The hull is then shipped to Navistar’s plant in Garland, Tenn. There, it may share the assembly line with a cement mixer or a tractor-trailer body. Bolted to the chassis of International’s 7400 Severe Service truck, the hull is shipped to Mississippi where an Allison 4-by-4 drivetrain is bolted to a 8.7-liter, 330-horsepower six-cylinder International turbodiesel motor.Reaching the assembly team, the four-wheel eight-passenger MaxxPro is part Blade Runner, part Smokey and the Bandit. Any trucker would recognize its cigarette lighter outlets, cruise control, wipers and gauges. But when the doors thunder closed with an ear-popping airlock hiss, it becomes obvious that this is no dump truck. A barometer monitors the interior air pressure, part of a deafening chemical/nuclear/biological air-conditioning and filtration system. Four-point harness seats swing from straps attached to the ceiling.“When a bomb hits, the shock wave rolls up through your legs and the seat,” Mr. Creasap said. “We performed blasts with mannequins and found that putting all the seat stress at the top is the safest way to mount them.” (In the January attack that killed the gunner, the injuries included broken feet.)When Tommy Pruitt, the communications director of Force Protection, joined the company in 2005, it was making “from one to four vehicles a month,” he said. “Now it’s a hundred plus.”Force Protection moved into a 550,000-square-foot campus in 2006, once home to a General Electric turbine engine plant. The plant has about 500 workers.The 4-by-4 Cougar and MaxxPro are Category I, the smallest of three MRAP classifications, while the 6-wheel, 10-passenger models are Category II. The 45,000-pound, six-seat, six-wheel Buffalo occupies Category III by itself.During construction, the Cougar is turned upside down and bolted to a 330-horsepower Caterpillar C7 turbodiesel and an Allison four- or six-wheel-drive transaxle. Unlike the MaxxPro, the vehicle’s padded seats are mounted to the floor.Aside from burly windshields, the front third of the Cougar looks remarkably like any International truck, from the raked hood with shark-gill-style air slots to the trademark split grille. The thickness of the ballistic glass is classified, but Sergeant Spurlock’s Cougar was once attacked by insurgents with AK-47’s. “We just pressed up against the glass and watched the rounds hit,” he said.Outside of the Force Protection plant, a cluster of white Mack semi-trucks line the plant where the Buffalo is built. Inside, crews cannibalize the Macks for engines, transmissions, gauges and other components. Aside from its size and height (the driver sits four feet higher than he would in the Mack or in a Cougar), the most obvious feature of the Buffalo is its remote-controlled arm. This Terminator-worthy appendage uncovers and detonates roadside bombs.Force Protection found that the most effective means of keeping troops planted to the rear seats are simple Corbeau four-point auto racing harnesses, while seats in the driver compartment are the same basic shock absorbing design you might see supporting an M.T.A. bus driver. The telescoping steering wheel in the Buffalo is straight off the Mack. The one in the Cougar is from International Harvester.Height and ungainliness are among the issues critics have with the vehicles.Taylor Biggs, an Iraq veteran and Marine captain, said the MRAP’s weight does not necessarily mesh with the Marine Corps’ lightweight, fast-moving expeditionary nature. He would prefer, he said, to see MRAPs in combination with lighter vehicles like the Humvee, rather than a complete replacement. Indeed, The Associated Press reported recently that it was partly this debate over weight that kept the MRAP from being deployed in large numbers until now.“This is the debate among many Marines, ‘Do we go heavy or stay light as possible?’ ” he said. “You could wrap a Marine head to toe in Kevlar and make him the most survivable guy out there, but he can’t chase down the guy who just threw the grenade at him. Some people would slap me, but I think the up-armored Hummer’s a good truck for what it was designed for. I don’t see the Cougar in places other than on hardball roads or other passable terrain.”The weight issue has not been lost on Force Protection. The company is testing the Cheetah, a far smaller MRAP that the company hopes will become a replacement for the Humvee in many applications.Despite his reservations with MRAPs, Captain Biggs enthusiastically acknowledged their benefits.“When I first showed up in Iraq, we were duct-taping Kevlar to the side of our trucks,” he said. “Still, I had no problem doing a mission in them. But then we got the 1114’s (up-armored Humvees) and said, ‘This is awesome.’ Then when we got the Cougars I felt extremely confident that I could put marines on that road in front of me and if they got hit, I wasn’t going to be calling in a helicopter to pull them out of there.”'"

"'08-02-24,'0','Saudi Arabia has long been one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations — for Muslims making a pilgrimage to Islam’s holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Millions of pilgrims visit each year for either the hajj, which is a pilgrimage at a prescribed time, or umrah, a visit to the sites at any other time of the year. Non-Muslims are forbidden to enter these locations. As for nonreligious tourists, they made up only 7 percent of the country’s foreign tourists in 2006, although that is up from 4 percent in 2004, and most of those visitors came from the Middle East.The ruler of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah, is instituting a number of well-publicized reforms to diversify the country’s economy and insulate it against changes in the oil market. International tourism isn’t part of that program, but domestic tourism is. The government estimates that Saudis who might take holidays in Saudi Arabia are an untapped $15 billion market, and that the international tourism market is tiny in comparison.Still, international tourists do have value to the government as part of a public relations campaign.“Saudi Arabia today faces a big challenge, which is its image,” said Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, secretary general of the Supreme Commission of Tourism of Saudi Arabia. “It is very important for us that people come and see it as it is. Seeing is believing.”Saudi Arabia does surprise most tourists. “Most people think of it as a vast desert with oil wells popping up all over it,” said Robert Parda of Advantage Tours, one of the few American companies that run tours to Saudi Arabia.It is a closed country, but a wealthy one, with a mix of modern buildings and ancient architecture. Although non-Muslims cannot see Mecca and Medina (and those with Israeli stamps on their passports cannot enter the country at all), most can visit the old souks of cities like Jidda, which is well-preserved. The Saudi Red Sea coast is said to have some of the most pristine scuba diving in the world, although the infrastructure for taking advantage of it is not yet in place.The destination with the greatest potential “wow” factor is Madain Salih, an ancient Nabataean city carved into sandstone cliffs. The sister city to Petra in Jordan, it has been proposed by Saudi Arabia as a Unesco World Heritage Site.Though it lacks an iconic building like Petra’s Treasury (the site of the Holy Grail in “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade”), it has many more structures than Petra does, and they are better preserved. Visiting can be a solitary and wondrous experience. “It’s not unusual for no one else to be in the whole site besides our group,” Mr. Parda said.But the biggest draw of Saudi Arabia may be the closed nature of the country itself. The tour operators interviewed for this article said that the majority of clients who went on their Saudi tours were exceptionally well traveled, many having visited 100 countries. Saudi Arabia at this point is a place Western tourists go when they’re looking for something totally different, a culture little touched by the Western world.On one tour to Saudi Arabia last April, a tour bus was passing a local auction in a town square near Dammam on the gulf coast when the tour leader, Rita Zawaideh, directed it to stop. Ms. Zawaideh, an Arab-American who runs Caravan-Serai Tours out of Seattle, began raising her hand to bid, and her mostly female tour group did the same, confusing and ultimately delighting the all-male crowd.“They would joke and say: ‘Raise the prices! The Americans want to buy,’ ” said Ms. Zawaideh, “and then I go at them in Arabic and they say: ‘O.K.! We can’t raise the prices. We’ll lower the prices!’ ” The locals brought out tea and wanted to hear the tourists’ impressions of the country, and the group ultimately purchased pottery, an old sword, an antique window and other items.The act of observing an untouched culture, of course, inevitably touches it. Countries like Bhutan have kept out tourists for that reason. Saudi concern with preventing this kind of change is a reason it has been slow to consider granting independent tourist visas, which are not offered.The country’s leaders are interested in encouraging the Saudis themselves to move around in their country, believing that the growth of a domestic tourism industry would actually solidify their culture. Families would have more options for traveling together and could see the diversity of their country, which Prince Sultan bin Salman thinks would make them recognize their national unity as “nothing less than a miracle.”Still, the domestic tourists are “pathfinders” for the international tourists who will follow, according to the prince, and the government says it will monitor the response to the tourism from the local communities. “We’ve seen how things sometimes happening in a hurry can be detrimental to society and social change,” the prince said. “We’re not in a hurry to do more than we can swallow.”FOR the time being, the experience of visiting Saudi Arabia includes conforming to its norms. No alcohol, pornography or proselytizing materials can be taken into the country. A woman under 30 cannot enter the country without a husband or brother. Women cannot walk about unaccompanied, and they must keep their bodies covered with abayas.And the Saudis aren’t kidding about it. On a tour she led in 2006, Ms. Zawaideh said, she noticed some Europeans walking around with their husbands, probably business travelers, without abayas or head scarves, and she warned them that the husbands could be arrested for this offense. The women brushed her off, she said, and within an hour, she noticed security people talking with the couples, then taking the men away.Ms. Zawaideh says that she has no such problem with her clients. Two women wore the abaya all the way to New York, and some found it had the advantages of helping them fit in and protecting against blowing sand.Joyce Jolley, 76, a retired dental hygienist from Seattle, bought the most severe kind to take home, including a head covering with only an eye-slit opening and a sheer black veil to cover that — more than what Saudi women are required to wear. “It was kind of an adventure,” she said.'"

"'08-02-25,'1','When writing “... hold me, neighbor, in this storm...,” Aleksandra Vrebalov, a Serbian composer living in New York City, was inspired by the musical fusion of diverse cultures in the Balkans, artistic marriages that thrive in a region long troubled by ethnic intolerance.Her work, which seemed particularly relevant in light of recent nationalist rioting in Belgrade, received its premiere on Friday evening at Zankel Hall, one of seven world and New York premieres performed by the Kronos Quartet. Recordings of church bells and Islamic calls to prayer were woven into a vibrant tapestry of urgent, sinister passages with insistent rhythms, lyrical interludes, raucous folk melodies and microtonal whispers. Unusual sonorities, like an emotive viola melody over a muezzin’s call, and the use of a gusle (a bowed string instrument) and a tapan (a large double-headed drum) added further local flavor.A wide range of sources inspired the program on Friday, which opened with Gary Leport’s song “Night of the Vampire,” arranged by Harry Whitney (an undergraduate at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music). Originally recorded in 1961 by the British band the Moontrekkers, the song was once declared “unsuitable for people of a nervous disposition” by the BBC. In this lively version, which colorfully replicates the recording’s spooky effects with both instrumental and recorded sounds, a violin plays the haunted-house tune over a pizzicato ostinato bass line in the cello.Next came Clint Mansell’s three-movement “Requiem for a Dream” Suite, from the 2000 film of that name. It was performed here in a vivid arrangement by David Lang that illuminated moods with gentle melodies, eerie beats, propulsive rhythms and slashing gestures. The musical spotlight then shifted to Buenos Aires with “El Cerezo” (‘The Cherry Tree”), by the Argentine composer Fernando Otero, which blended tango-infused lyrical interludes into a sometimes dissonant canvas.“White Widow” (referring to a type of marijuana), the first movement of “Widows and Lovers” by the Moscow-born Israeli composer Aviya Kopelman, opened with a recording of noisy chatter. An insistent, melancholy string section was punctuated by a recording of techno beats. In “Lovers,” the second movement, languid sultry strings soared over the pulsing sound of a heartbeat, and the concluding “Black Widow” interspersed aggressive, slashing chords with moments of sweetness.A pulsing momentum and propulsive, colorful rhythms distinguished John Adams’s energetic “Fellow Traveler,” based on an aria from Mr. Adams’s opera “Nixon in China.”'"
"'08-02-25,'1','A company spokeswoman, Vanessa Aristide, said Pfizer was working with its advertising agency, the Kaplan Thaler Group, to develop a new campaign.Lipitor, with sales of $12.7 billion last year, is protected by patent until 2010. Some patients have, nevertheless, begun switching to a generic version of a competing cholesterol drug, Zocor.The House Energy and Commerce Committee has been looking into television ads featuring Dr. Jarvik. The committee disclosed that Pfizer agreed to pay Dr. Jarvik at least $1.35 million under a two-year contract that expired next month. John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of that committee, raised questions about Dr. Jarvik’s credentials to recommend Lipitor.Dr. Jarvik, who has recently declined to discuss the Lipitor campaign, could not be reached for comment Monday.The committee’s investigation has rekindled a debate over the so-called direct-to-consumer advertising of pharmaceuticals, a $4.8 billion business. Mr. Dingell and Bart Stupak, another Michigan Democrat who heads an investigations subcommittee, applauded Pfizer’s decision to pull the Lipitor ads.“I commend Pfizer for doing the right thing and pulling the Lipitor ads featuring Dr. Jarvik,” Mr. Stupak said in a statement. “When consumers see and hear a doctor endorsing medication, they expect the doctor is a credible individual with requisite knowledge of the drug.”While endorsing Pfizer’s decision, the committee showed no sign of shutting down its investigation. Mr. Stupak said the committee planned to meet with Dr. Jarvik and collect all of the documents it had requested.The committee had recently asked 10 advertising agencies that worked on the Dr. Jarvik campaign to submit documents about the use of body doubles. The committee has also contacted at least one former colleague of Dr. Jarvik’s who contends that he was not the actual inventor of the artificial heart, as stated in the ads.In a letter to Pfizer in August 2006, three former colleagues of Dr. Jarvik’s at the University of Utah complained that the ads erroneously identified Dr. Jarvik as “inventor of the artificial heart.” That distinction, they said, should go to Dr. Jarvik’s mentor, Dr. Willem J. Kolff, and his associate, Dr. Tetsuzo Akutsu.Pfizer subsequently changed its ads to identify Dr. Jarvik as the inventor of the “Jarvik artificial heart,” but Dr. Jarvik’s former colleagues, members of a large team that worked on the heart, were not entirely satisfied, according to Dr. Donald B. Olsen, a veterinarian who worked on the heart and is president of the Utah Artificial Heart Institute. Dr. Olsen said he was recently contacted by the committee.A long-simmering dispute over assigning credit for the artificial heart boiled over again during a conference last December at the University of Utah. Dr. Jarvik did not attend the conference, which marked the 25th anniversary of the heart’s experimental use to extend the life of Dr. Barney Clark, a Seattle dentist.During the meeting, another former Utah colleague of Dr. Jarvik’s, Dr. Clifford S. Kwan-Gett, stated that the Jarvik series of hearts were simply different versions of prototypes that Dr. Kwan-Gett had made more than a year earlier.Dr. Jarvik’s company, Jarvik Heart, subsequently posted a history of the artificial heart’s development on its Web site, giving his own account of the heart’s development. That posting said Dr. Jarvik’s design overcame two problems of the heart developed by Dr. Kwan-Gett.Jarvik Heart, based in Manhattan, has been working for the last two decades on a continuous flow pump that can be inserted directly into a patient’s damaged heart to bolster its function.'"
"'08-02-25,'1','Visa plans to sell 406 million Class A shares for $37 to $42 a share, with just over half going to the public and the rest to Visa’s member banks.The first $3 billion will be placed into a special account to cover outstanding antitrust and unfair-pricing claims brought by merchants. Visa will use some of the new money to streamline its operations, expand in fast-growing emerging markets and invest in new technology like systems that enable people to make card payments using cellular phones. But the bulk of the capital will end up in the bank’s coffers, from repurchasing stock from them.Visa’s member banks can use the extra cash.If Visa’s shares are valued at a midpoint price of $39.50, JPMorgan Chase, the company’s largest shareholder, would receive an estimated $1.1 billion for its stake. Bank of America would get about $545 million; National City would get about $380 million; and Citigroup, U.S. Bancorp, and Wells Fargo can each expect around $240 million or more.“The credit crunch is pretty cyclical; the prospects for Visa are very strong long-term,” said Marc Abbey, the managing partner of First Annapolis, a consulting firm that works with many banks and payments companies. “I am sure it is convenient for them to have extraordinary gains at the same time they have extraordinary losses.”Since going public nearly two years ago, MasterCard have soared 408 percent, closing at $198.45 on Monday. It now has a market value of $26 billion.MasterCard’s successful I.P.O. prompted Visa to move forward with owns plans to go public. Since October 2006, Visa has reorganized its sprawling management structure, bringing together all of its global operations with the exception of those in Europe. It has also hired Joseph W. Saunders, the former head of Providian Financial Corporation, as its chairman and chief executive, giving him a pay package worth $11.1 million in cash for 2007. Upon completion of the I.P.O., he is expected to receive an additional $11.5 million in stock and options, according to Equilar, a compensation research firm.Visa transactions accounted for roughly 66 percent of all credit and debit card purchases in the United States in 2006, compared to about 26 percent for MasterCard, according to The Nilson Report data.Growth in card transactions, the foundation of the companies’ businesses , has historically held up well, even when the economy and consumer spending slows.“If you look back at the last recession, card transactions did not drop — they took a dip in growth, but they didn’t fall below prior year,” Mr. Robertson said.“There is no reason to think that growth in the United States is going to sink Visa’s boat,” he said. “Whatever lackluster growth in the U.S. should certainly be matched and exceeded by what occurs outside the U.S.”The prospectus for the sale lays out a convoluted capital structure, with four classes of shares, including three which go to the banks. But the deal, which is underwritten by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, also raises potential conflicts for the banks underwriting the shares.Both institutions have strong ties to the financial services industry. But JPMorgan is Visa’s largest shareholder and largest customer. It is a member of the bank syndicate that agreed to lend $3 billion to the company. And it could reap more than 1.1 billion in proceeds from the I.P.O.Goldman, meanwhile, will serve as the “qualified independent underwriter” in setting the price of the offering, according to public filings. Its independence is not deemed in question even though Suzanne M. Nora Johnson, a Visa director, used to be a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs.'"
"'08-02-25,'1','The backlog of unsold homes continued to pile up in January, a sign that home prices will continue to drop as would-be buyers hold out for better deals.Sales of previously owned homes fell for the sixth consecutive month, dropping 0.4 percent, to an annual rate of 4.89 million, the National Association of Realtors said on Monday. While the decline was less than forecast, the sales pace is the slowest since the survey began nearly a decade ago. The median home price dipped to $201,100, down 4.6 percent from a year ago.At the current sales rate, it would take 10.3 months to sell off the current inventory of unsold homes. “That’s enormous,” said Joshua Shapiro, an economist at the research firm MFR. “That’s double the normal amount and well above where we were a year ago.”In a research note, Mr. Shapiro noted that inventories may actually be higher “if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market instead of pulling it off in the face of weak demand and eroding prices.”And economists see little relief in the months ahead, as a combination of tighter lending standards, the softening job market, and elevated inventories keep buyers on the sidelines.'"
"'08-02-25,'1','“It was a tough movie to watch,” said Sam Joseph, 49, who lives in South Orange. “I’ve been with my partner for 30 years and it’s always been an issue: What if one of us get sick?”None of the five Ocean County freeholders, who ultimately voted to extend benefits to same-sex couples, were at the screening.Some in the audience on Sunday were same-sex couples who said they were still fighting for benefits for their partners.Craig Ross, 46, watched the movie with his partner, Richard Cash, 54, for whom he is trying to obtain insurance through his employer, a technology company based in the Midwest.“I have asked about it, but they don’t recognize civil unions, only marriage,” Mr. Ross said.Mr. Cash added, “Like Laurel said, we don’t want to be treated differently than anybody.”In 2006, Gov. Jon S. Corzine signed legislation extending benefits to same-sex couples under a civil union law.According to Steven Goldstein, president of Garden State Equality, more than 2,400 couples in New Jersey have entered into same-sex unions, and about one-fourth of them have filed complaints with Garden State Equality over benefits. The group is an advocacy organization for gay, lesbian and transgender people in New Jersey.“I wish this film had a happy ending,” Mr. Goldstein shouted to the crowd after the credits rolled. “It does not. Our civil union law is failing; it is not respected like marriage.”Between the showing of the film and the beginning of the Oscar broadcast, Ed Mather, 66, of Morris County, said he was still working for the right to marry his partner of 39 years, the Rev. Robert O. Kriesat, with whom he attended the screening.“The goal is full marriage rights,” he said.Mr. Kriesat, 68, who appeared briefly in the film petitioning the freeholders, said it was the second time he had seen the movie, and it again made him think of what could happen if he or his partner fell ill.“It’s almost as hard to watch the second time,” he said.Though about half the audience left after the screening, the rest watched the broadcast, anxiously waiting for the category in which “Freeheld” was entered.In stark contrast to the somber film, the Oscar party afterward was a raucous event, in which wine and Champagne flowed, and breathless quips about moviegoers’ clothes were made by a Joan Rivers impersonator.A cheer went up when “Freeheld” was announced as the winner. Joan Hervey, 53, who appeared in the film, said she felt “a rush of joy,” and David Smith, 23, managing director of Garden State Equality, said, “I feel empowered.”'"

"'08-02-25,'1','Mr. McCain and his allies say they remain proud of the deal they cut because it avoided a potential constitutional crisis in the Senate and led to the confirmation of two Supreme Court justices named by President Bush, as well as several federal appeals court judges. They say there is no certainty that Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican who was then the Senate majority leader, had the votes to win approval of his rules change, which was dubbed the nuclear option because of the chaos it was predicted to cause.With the possibility of a Democratic White House and Congress in the future, Mr. McCain said protecting the right of the minority party to force the majority to produce 60 votes to confirm an objectionable judge might not seem like such a bad idea.“Find me a Republican senator who now supports 51 votes for the confirmation of a judge,” Mr. McCain said.Mr. McCain’s recent clash with The New York Times over his reported ties to a lobbyist appeared to have bolstered the senator, at least temporarily, with some in the conservative wing. But the question of judicial appointments is a matter of fundamental concern to conservatives who see the courts as a counterbalance to the shifting politics of Congress and the executive branch.Some Republicans say they fear that a President McCain, faced with a Democratic Congress, could use judicial appointments as a bargaining chip to achieve policy compromises.Conservatives say Mr. McCain needs to make it clear that he intends to name like-minded judges and to hit the issue much harder than he has when appealing to Republicans with doubts about him.“He needs to do some formulation of ‘No more Souters,’ ” said Richard Land, an official with the Southern Baptist Convention, referring to Justice David H. Souter, an appointee of the first President Bush who has been a disappointment to the right.Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, broke with Mr. McCain over the Gang of 14 but has endorsed his presidential bid. Mr. Cornyn said he would encourage the Arizonan to put more emphasis on his views on judges.“That is one issue that cuts across all aspects of the Republican coalition,” Mr. Cornyn said. “I will encourage him to make it a prominent part of his pitch.”The Gang of 14 is hardly the only point of contention between Mr. McCain and some conservative factions. His signature issue, campaign finance reform, is anathema to many conservatives, as was his push for comprehensive immigration legislation. Some conservatives say his role in brokering the judicial compromise may rank behind those two in generating right-flank ire and is fading as an issue.But to others, it remains a telling moment for Mr. McCain, who has been a supporter of Republican judicial choices but has not typically been a central player in the nomination fights.The underlying fight erupted after Republicans took back control of the Senate in 2003 and Democrats filibustered 10 of Mr. Bush’s judicial choices, characterizing them as too conservative. Republicans grew increasingly frustrated over their inability to force votes on the candidates and, in 2005, began threatening to seek a simple majority vote on a change in the rules so that filibusters against judicial nominees would be prohibited.The prospect consumed the Senate, and Democrats threatened procedural retaliation. Hoping to head off a confrontation, a group of seven Republicans and seven Democrats began meeting to forge an alternative.As the floor vote loomed, the Gang of 14 unveiled their agreement, clearing the way for votes on three of five stalled appeals court nominees. They agreed that future filibusters could be waged only in extraordinary circumstances.The steam went out of the filibuster movement; two Supreme Court nominees, John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr., moved through the Senate in the ensuing months — Mr. Roberts later in 2005 and Mr. Alito in 2006.“We did the Senate a service,” said Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, a principal in the Gang of 14 along with Mr. McCain and the Democrats Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Ben Nelson of Nebraska.Mr. McCain, who backed an unsuccessful filibuster of a Clinton judicial nominee in 1994, has begun to discuss his support for Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito as illustrative of the types of judges he would seek out. “I am proud of my advocacy of Alito and Roberts,” Mr. McCain said. “A whole lot of people applauded what we did. We got them all done without a filibuster.”'"

Minor leaguers could check in for the camp Sunday, but neither Koby nor his father arrived before the minor league clubhouse closed at 5 p.m.Roger Clemens has attended with his son the past few seasons. He has a personal services contract with the Astros that will begin when he officially retires.Houston Manager Cecil Cooper said he was expecting Roger Clemens to attend but said he did not know when he might arrive. BUEHRLE SCRATCHED Mark Buehrle was scratched from his scheduled outing in a Chicago White Sox intrasquad game because of soreness in his shoulder.Buehrle, a left-hander who is scheduled to start the season opener, had been expected to throw two innings Monday in Tucson.He said he felt a little tight but it was nothing serious, and he plans to pitch against Arizona on Feb. 29 in Chicago’s third spring training game.BACKE HAS BONE BRUISE Astros pitcher Brandon Backe has a bone bruise on his right foot after he was hit by a hard grounder during batting practice Saturday in Kissimmee, Fla.X-rays were negative. Manager Cecil Cooper said the injury was not serious, but he was still going to hold Backe out of Sunday’s workout.“We’re going to get him some extra rest to make sure he’s O.K.,” Cooper said. “At this point, nothing to be alarmed about. I’d just rather be cautious than take a chance.”DEROSA OUT OF HOSPITAL Chicago Cubs second baseman Mark DeRosa was released from the hospital, the team said, a day after complaining of a rapid heartbeat during fielding drills. The team initially said DeRosa was released Saturday evening but later said he was kept overnight at Banner Desert Medical Center in Mesa, Ariz., as a precaution.He is expected to be examined by a cardiologist Monday, the Cubs said.DeRosa, who turns 33 on Tuesday, began complaining of a rapid heartbeat during ground ball drills Saturday morning. After being examined in the clubhouse by a team doctor, he was taken to the hospital in an ambulance.KIM DEAL COMPLETED The free-agent pitcher Byung-Hyun Kim completed a one-year, $850,000 contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates, four days after agreeing to terms.General Manager Neal Huntington said Kim would be used exclusively in relief.DEAL FOR STEWART Shannon Stewart, a right-handed-hitting outfielder, and the Toronto Blue Jays agreed to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training in Dunedin, Fla.Stewart, who turns 34 on Monday, spent last season with the Oakland Athletics, batting .290 with 12 homers and 48 R.B.I. in 146 games.'"
"'08-02-25,'1','The Carmel Group, a research firm in Carmel-by-the-Sea, Calif., predicts that revenue in the United States from digital signs will grow to $2.6 billion by the end of 2010 from $1.5 billion in 2007.While a handful of companies are using digital signs for one-way communication, like sending coupons to cellphones, Akoo (pronounced AH-koo) says its technology is different because it allows consumers to control content on digital advertising screens to see something they choose. “This is the only digital out-of-home billboard network that’s fully interactive with mobile phones,” said Andy Stankiewicz, vice president for marketing at Akoo.The content for the system, he said, is being supplied through deals with the Universal Music Group, Sony BMG Music Entertainment and Fashion TV, which have collectively made more than two million clips available to m-Venue.Advertisers are being lured to Akoo’s network by its potential customers, who tend to be young and hard to reach. Cellphone users can register online for the service and choose to receive offers. The system also interests marketers given its proximity to the cash register, where 70 percent of purchase decisions are said to be made.“We can tie back a mobile phone user to the customer’s purchase history,” said Niko Drakoulis, the chief executive of Akoo, based in Chicago. This works partly by identifying a person’s location when they use the system.Akoo, which was founded in 2001, has done some early trials with McDonald’s. At one Chicago store, Akoo said, a 14-day trial with the digital screens helped increase business 17 percent.Ad agencies have shown both interest in and trepidation about cellphone-activated digital signs. The creative agency Leo Burnett and its nontraditional sister shop, Arc Worldwide, both part of the Publicis Groupe, have signed an alliance with Akoo. The digital agency Avenue A/Razorfish, which is owned by Microsoft, is also discussing trials.Texas State University became the first college to become part of Akoo’s network after Akoo made a deal with the food provider Chartwells, which manages food services for 200 American universities and is part of the Compass Group.Akoo’s other public partners are mainly in the Chicago area, including the restaurant chain Bob Chinn’s Crabhouse; the Cubby Bear, a Chicago sports bar with live music; and Ala Carte Entertainment, the owner of several bars and restaurants in the area. Mr. Stankiewicz declined to say how many display screens were in the network.Other ad agencies, while not familiar with Akoo, say they see interesting possibilities for the marriage of mobile and digital signs. “I can’t see how marketers in today’s environment couldn’t look at something like this and say it completely makes sense,” says Ross Dobson, managing partner for digital, direct and analytics at the ad agency Mullen in Wenham, Mass., a part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. “I hope they’d embrace this before they embrace other disruptive advertising on mobile devices.”Mr. Dobson said some clients had shied away from marketing with digital signs because of the potential for lawsuits that could result from the distraction posed by moving images.Bill Reynolds, vice president and head of media for the Interpublic Group agency Erwin-Penland, said, “These installations initially attract consumer attention, but much of it is for the novelty effect. Many of these will wear out pretty quickly, so it will be a challenge to keep them fresh and engaging.”'"
"'08-02-25,'1','“I got a lot of notes from old Forbes colleagues,” Ms. Waxler said.Among business journalists, Gorkana created awareness of the people on the advisory board of Pro Publica, a new and closely watched investigative journalism service run by Paul E. Steiger, the former top editor of The Wall Street Journal. Gorkana also reported on a new business newspaper that is expected to start in Abu Dhabi later this year, and listed editorial staff members.The newsletter — which reaches the in-boxes of about 5,000 journalists and will come out five times a week starting March 1 — is the American counterpart to a British version, which was started as a service to public relations firms and journalists, said Rob Ingram, director of the Gorkana office in Lower Manhattan. (According to the company’s Web site, the name Gorkana means “food for thought” in Hindi and is drawn from a military experience of one of the founders.)In 2003, the two British public relations people who set up Gorkana started sending e-mail messages to publicists that listed reporters’ moves, and their popularity grew by word of mouth, Mr. Ingram said, adding that the goal of the newsletter, and the database of journalists and contact information that Gorkana sells to public relations firms, is to cut down on what reporters and publicists hate: the embarrassing and awkward phone call.“You can’t do anything about bad P.R.,” he said, “just like you can’t do anything about bad reporters, but at least you can try to help around the margins.”When Julia Berris, a British journalist working for The Lawyer in London, moved to its New York offices about a month ago, Gorkana quickly listed her transfer. “They’re pretty much hot off the mark,” she said. She looks to Gorkana to find out where her journalism school friends have ended up.“People do respect it and use it as sort of a hub” in Britain, she said, noting most of her moves in British business journalism were listed by Gorkana almost immediately.Bob Herguth, the new managing editor of The Business Journal of Milwaukee, said he received e-mail messages from friends around the country after his move from The Chicago Sun-Times (he took a buyout last month) was listed in the e-mail message. “I guess I read it now because I’m wondering if I know anybody who’s on there,” he said.'"

A Feb. 14 court filing put it starkly: “Members of Britney’s household,” it said, “have been paying for her basic necessities, including medicine, food, and other day-to-day needs.”On Feb. 1, the day after Ms. Spears was involuntarily admitted for treatment at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center, her estranged father, Jamie Spears, was named her co-conservator, giving him control over her treatment, security, visitors and daily life.Mr. Spears is sharing oversight of her estate with an independent lawyer, Andrew M.

With the court’s permission, they immediately fired her business manager.Another team of lawyers was hired for the conservators and quickly set out to assess the financial damage. Yet another lawyer was appointed by the probate court, as is routine, to look out solely for Ms. Spears’s interests. Ms. Spears’s brother Bryan, along with a lawyer, were given control of her revocable trust, which contains all her liquid assets, so they could begin paying her bills. And Ms. Spears’s criminal lawyer, Blair Berk, was said to be overseeing the whole Humpty Dumpty-like effort.All the independent lawyers aside, one cannot ignore money as a motivating factor as the estranged Spears parents joined forces. Since she first became a pop star in 1999 on the strength of her hit “Baby One More Time,” she has helped her father financially.The earning power of her 16-year-old sister, Jamie Lynn, the star of “Zooey 101” on Nickelodeon, probably suffered in December when she announced her pregnancy, which also helped sink her mother’s deal to write a book on parenting.What little light has been shed on Ms. Spears’s finances came last May, when part of an income statement surfaced in her divorce case. It put her average monthly earnings at more than $730,000, mainly from royalties, but said she earned only $13,000 a month from investments. (Her spending, including $102,000 a month for entertainment, gifts and vacation and $16,000 for clothes, was more eye-catching.)The nature of her investments might be unclear as well. Accountants are trying to learn whether her money was moved into overly risky investment vehicles, whether any business deals need to be undone and whether her assets were outright looted. (Her father filed a report of grand theft, according to The Los Angeles Times, asserting that paintings, jewelry and other valuables had been stripped from her Beverly Hills home).Though she is said to own large swaths of Louisiana timberland, Ms. Spears is not a real estate tycoon in the classic Hollywood sense: she owns a house in a gated hilltop community near Mulholland Drive but listed it for sale a year ago at an asking price of $7.5 million, scarcely more than the $7.2 million she paid for it.She sold a house in Malibu last summer for $10 million after paying $6.9 million for it in 2004, and she unloaded her Lower Manhattan condominium for $4 million in 2006, after buying it for $3 million in 2002.Ms. Spears’s career first began to sputter after her last major tour was cut short, nearly four years ago. Based on the strength of her first two albums, “Baby One More Time” and “Oops! I Did It Again,” she received nearly a $10 million advance for her 2003 album “In the Zone” and a net earning of $6.5 million after production costs, according to reports published after her prenuptial agreement was leaked.By contrast, she was paid $4 million for “Blackout,” her latest album, according to people briefed on her affairs, but she probably took home only a fraction of that for the album, which was more than a year in the making. Ms. Spears’s label, Jive Records, continues to promote singles from “Blackout,” without her active participation. (The recording industry has much experience with artists who have become incapacitated or unavailable or dead.)But digital music has been punishing for performers like Ms. Spears, one of the last to sell more than 10 million copies of an album before the shift to downloads. The first two “Blackout” singles, “Gimme More” and “Piece of Me,” have sold a combined 1.54 million copies through digital services like iTunes, but industry experts say Ms. Spears might collect only $150,000 from that source.Compared with touring, albums are loss-leaders for pop stars of her magnitude. Ms. Spears’s five major tours have sold some $140 million in tickets, according to PollStar, a music industry service. Her take, after deducting costs for arena rentals, equipment, crew and all those backup dancers, is much smaller.The real money is made not from ticket sales but from the sale of T-shirts, key chains, dolls and countless other Britney-branded goods.“It’s a gray area nobody ever focuses on,” said Steve Lunt, who oversaw Ms. Spears’s musical endeavors as a vice president at Jive until 2006. But, he said, merchandise revenue could be as much as or more than her share of ticket proceeds. “And that’s unadulterated profit margin.”At her peak, Ms. Spears earned well over $12 million for endorsing companies like Toyota, Nabisco, Kirin beer, Sketchers, Clairol and McDonald’s; $9 million was from Pepsi alone. And Ms. Spears still gets at least $2 million to $3 million a year from a perfume deal she signed with Elizabeth Arden in 2004. The company continues to build on what it has made worldwide from three Britney perfume lines. There is particularly strong demand for them in Dubai, the company says.While some of these deals remain in place, it is hard to imagine a company seeking her endorsement now except for pure shock value.For now, the people around Ms. Spears are occupied with more basic questions — about how she will live, rather than whether she might perform again. Lawyers and her parents are trying to find the appropriate middle ground between confining Ms. Spears physically and allowing her too much freedom for her own good.This is not an easy balance to strike, said one expert on conservatorships for the infirm, Marc B. Hankin, who at one point represented Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. “With good social support and good pharmacologists, you can help people come back to life, and a lot of people will never come back without that,” he said.If Ms. Spears regains her health — and her desire to tour — will there still be an opportunity?A return would require corporate sponsors, who for the moment would be likely to shun Ms. Spears but who might come around, according to Mr. Lunt, the record executive.“My gut feeling is people will still want to be associated with her,” he said. “Everyone thinks there’s going to be a comeback at some point. You could mention her name in Afghanistan, Israel, Greece or South Africa, and everyone knows who she is. You can’t buy that.”The people around Ms. Spears say she is not so far gone as a star. “She’s not someone who can’t put the tools back together and function,” said one such person, who because of a relationship with Ms. Spears spoke on the condition of anonymity.“Because we’re so incredibly fickle as a society, the perfect entertainment is someone who’s in the bottomless pit and rising again,” the person said. “If she’s together, fit, beautiful and on her game, it’ll be just printing money.”'"

"'08-02-26,'1','Sales of Aranesp, Amgen’s best -selling product, declined to $3.6 billion last year from $4.1 billion in 2006.One option that analysts expect to be discussed at the meeting in March would be to bar use of the drugs for specific types of cancer, such as breast cancer and head and neck cancer. Another option would be to delay treatment with the drugs until patients became more anemic than the current threshhold, a change that would more closely match the Medicare reimbursement policy.A third option, which many analysts say is unlikely, would be for the F.D.A. to no longer authorize the drugs’ use in treating anemia caused by chemotherapy. The drugs would still be allowed to treat anemia caused by kidney disease, which is the other big use of the medicines.Jim Birchenough, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, estimated in a report on Monday that removal of the approval for chemotherapy-induced anemia would cut Amgen’s sales of Aranesp by $1 billion a year. A change in the label to match Medicare’s policy would cut $300 million.The new meta-analysis on death risk, which could play into the discussion at the March 13 meeting, combines data from 51 clinical trials involving 13,611 patients. The study also found a 57 percent increase in the risk of blood clots in veins, a known side effect of the drugs.Dr. Bennett, an oncologist and hematologist, said he did not believe the higher risk of death came from those blood clots. Rather, he said, there is evidence that the drugs, which are synthetic forms of a natural hormone called erythropoietin, directly stimulate the growth and spread of tumors. But Amgen scientists dispute that explanation.Procrit, which Johnson & Johnson sells under license from Amgen, was approved for treatment of cancer patients in 1993 and Aranesp in 2002, based on their ability to reduce the need for blood transfusions. But the studies on which the approvals were based were not large enough and long enough to measure an impact on patients’ longevity.So efforts have been made to pool the results of many smaller trials to look for safety problems. A meta-analysis published in 2004 by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international research group, found that patients who got the drugs tended to live longer.But in recent years there have been some new clinical trials aimed at showing that using the drugs at higher doses than indicated in the label would actually improve survival. Those studies instead found the opposite, and as they were added to the compilations the safety balance appeared to shift.A meta-analysis published in 2006 by the Cochrane Collaboration found an 8 percent higher risk of death among users of the drugs, but the result just missed being statistically significant. The analysis being published Wednesday adds some more recent studies and reaches statistical significance.That still leaves unclear whether the drugs are dangerous if used at the levels indicated in the label, a question that bedeviled an F.D.A. advisory committee last year and is likely to do so again in March.“We didn’t ask the right questions for 15 years,” said Dr. Bennett.'"

"'08-02-26,'1','Mark Ellerbrook, who manages Seattle’s homeownership program, said that, aside from residents hoping to apply, few people were enthusiastic about the program. He said he understood that reaction, given the local housing market.“People struggle to buy homes in this city, for sure,” Mr. Ellerbrook said. “And then you have what looks, on the face of it, like the city giving money to people who made bad decisions.”In Massachusetts, MassHousing, a quasi-state agency, began a loan refinance program last summer that relies on bond revenue. After its initial public relations effort, the agency had to make clear “that this is not taxpayer-funded,” said Tom Farmer, an agency spokesman.“The talk radio was all up in arms: ‘Why should we be helping these people out?’ ” Mr. Farmer said. “ ‘They should have known what they were doing.’ ”The goal of these programs is not just to keep people from losing their homes, but also to limit broader economic fallout, including plummeting property tax revenues and widespread declines in home values. Still, they pit what some government officials say are practical economic solutions for the common good against individual ideals of fairness and personal responsibility.The opposition may be rooted in “this ancient notion of deserving versus undeserving, and you’re undeserving if you made a bad decision,” said Nicolas P. Retsinas, the director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.While the negative reactions have not stopped the assistance efforts, it has put some local officials on the defensive and forced them to try to sell the programs to the general public, not just to the intended recipients.“This is not a bailout,” Joseph Smith, the commissioner of banks in North Carolina, said this month in announcing a program to direct $300,000 in taxpayer money to mortgage counselors who could help homeowners refinance. “We’re not paying off anybody’s mortgage.”Small, government-supported “rescue loan” programs have been used in many places before. Those efforts, as well as the current ones, typically have been cast as having broader benefits, similar to the way public health programs are portrayed, Mr. Retsinas said.“Much of the rationale,” he said, “is less the notion of keeping an individual from getting sick than it is, ‘If we vaccinate this person, their illness won’t cause other people to get sick.’ ”The program in Seattle is intended to help about 40 homeowners threatened with foreclosure. In Ohio, two government-sponsored programs offer similar assistance. Massachusetts, Maryland and other states also have loan or refinancing programs.Some of these programs tap into into taxpayer money directly, while others use revenue from the sale of bonds or other sources. Most require borrowers to pay back the loan eventually, though some forgive them altogether.Some programs, like Maryland’s, are designed for people caught in subprime mortgages, and these can have more generous terms. Several of the programs, including Seattle’s, aim to help low- or moderate-income borrowers facing an unexpected financial hardship, like loss of a job or illness. Many have strict requirements that often prevent people from qualifying, sometimes leading to charges that they do not go far enough.Government has a history of getting involved in foreclosure crises. During the Great Depression, the federal government created the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, which helped refinance about a million loans — and made a profit in the process. In December, Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, suggested that government provide assistance to homeowners facing foreclosure.Until recently, the Bush administration has focused on getting banks and lenders to restructure or refinance home loans, but critics say it is unclear how many people will be helped.Bruce Marks, the chief executive of the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, which works with lenders to restructure loans under terms that homeowners can afford, said giving loans to homeowners improperly focused public frustration on borrowers instead of banks and lenders.“Before you criticize other people, ask your family members, ask your neighbor, ask your co-workers whether their home is at risk of foreclosure, and you will find that the people closest to you are about to lose their homes but they’re too embarrassed to tell you and to reach out for help,” Mr. Marks said. “That’s how pervasive this crisis is.”Alex J. Pollock, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who has written about the foreclosure prevention programs of the Great Depression, echoed concerns that, in some cases, government intervention could reward irresponsibility and make markets unpredictable. “The problem on the other side,” he said, “is if you have a general problem that threatens to cause a general downward spiral, then everybody’s going to suffer.”Ryan Ellis, the tax policy director for Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative antitax group, said his group opposed efforts by the Bush administration to nudge banks and lenders into restructuring some loans, much less direct government loans to homeowners facing foreclosure.“You can call it community reinvestment, neighborhood protection, whatever you want,” Mr. Ellis said, “but if you’re taking away the downside risk of a loan, you’re bailing them out.”Foreclosures have increased as the national real estate market continues to decline. On Monday, the National Realtors Association reported that the sales of existing homes declined in January, the sixth consecutive month that sales have dropped. The median home price in January was $201,100, down 4.6 percent from a year earlier.Prevention programs and the way they are received can vary depending on the region. In Ohio, foreclosure rates are among the highest in the nation because of fallout in the mortgage industry but also because of the widespread loss of manufacturing jobs. Two state programs there are offering nearly $5 million in loans to homeowners.Lou Tisler, executive director of Neighborhood Housing Services of Greater Cleveland, which administers funds for the programs statewide, said political opposition had been little more than background noise. “We’re all suffering together through the whole economy,” he said. “It’s not just the housing bust. It’s not just people losing their jobs. It’s not just medical costs. It’s everything together. It allows for a stretch of innovation.”In Maryland last month, the Department of Housing and Community Development started its “Bridge to Hope” loan program, which caps loans at $15,000 and focuses on keeping low- to moderate-income homeowners in their homes. The program has an initial budget of $400,000.Clarence Snuggs, the deputy secretary of the department, said Maryland was ranked fifth nationally for its rate of so-called subprime loans.“There are good people out there who are in bad loans that put them in tough situations,” Mr. Snuggs said. “We need to find ways to help them to help us all.”In California, the notion of a government loan program seems remote to some state leaders, given how big such a fund would have to be and that California’s budget deficit is larger than most state budgets.State Senator Michael Machado, a Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Finance and Insurance, is from Stockton, where the foreclosure rate increased 271 percent in 2007.“If they got into a situation that got bad for them, they need to live through that and they shouldn’t expect government to bail them out,” he said, summarizing what he says is a commonly held view. “And when you’re dealing with a $14.5 billion deficit like we are here in California, it’s difficult to do that anyway.”'"
"'08-02-26,'1','WASHINGTON — For decades, the International Monetary Fund has played a pivotal role in rescuing insolvent countries and stabilizing the world economy. But after years of budget problems, the fund received approval on Monday from the Bush administration to sell gold bullion to stabilize its own shaky finances.The sale, which Congress also must approve, must be accompanied by cuts in the fund’s budget and changes in its governance to give more influence to emerging countries and perhaps less to Europe, said David H. McCormick, under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs.“The I.M.F. must reform to remain relevant,” Mr. McCormick said in a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “The world economy is constantly changing, and the I.M.F. must now change with it, as it has successfully done in the past.”Mr. McCormick called for the fund to reduce the number of executive board members to 20, from 24, and to make room within the 20 for developing countries. The emerging economic powers, including China, Brazil, Russia, India and Mexico, have agitated for more such board seats in recent years. The fund took a step in that direction in 2006 but now needs to do more, he said.Fund officials say they have been trying to move in that direction but have met resistance from European countries. Europe’s representation has been high since the fund was created at the end of World War II to help restore economic stability after years of violence and recession.In the 1990s, the I.M.F. played a central role in the bailout of countries in Asia and Latin America, engendering bitterness among their citizens because of the austerity programs imposed as a condition of the rescue. Since then, most of those countries have gotten back on their feet and prospered from their exports, accumulating vast reserves.Many of them have repaid the I.M.F. and are now talking about setting up their own monetary funds and reducing the I.M.F.’s influence. The I.M.F. has lost income as its lending activities have shrunk, and it faces $100 million in cuts from a $900 million budget. It also plans to sell some of its 103 million ounces in gold bullion to set up an investment fund to generate revenue.'"
"'08-02-26,'1','The backlog of unsold homes continued to pile up in January, a sign that home prices will continue to drop as would-be buyers hold out for better deals.Sales of previously owned homes fell for the sixth consecutive month, dropping 0.4 percent, to an annual rate of 4.89 million, the National Association of Realtors said on Monday. While the decline was less than forecast, the sales pace is the slowest since the survey began nearly a decade ago. The median home price dipped to $201,100, down 4.6 percent from a year ago.At the current sales rate, it would take 10.3 months to sell off the inventory of unsold homes. “That’s enormous,” said Joshua Shapiro, an economist at the research firm MFR. “That’s double the normal amount and well above where we were a year ago.”In a research note, Mr. Shapiro said that inventories might actually be higher “if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market instead of pulling it off in the face of weak demand and eroding prices.”Economists see little relief in the months ahead, as a combination of tighter lending standards, the softening job market and elevated inventories keep buyers on the sidelines.“Home sales have not hit bottom yet,” Mr. Shapiro said. “Prices haven’t declined enough to stimulate enough demand for sales to turn up.”'"
"'08-02-26,'1','A company spokeswoman, Vanessa Aristide, said that Pfizer was working with its advertising agency, the Kaplan Thaler Group, to develop a new campaign.Lipitor, with sales of $12.7 billion last year, is protected by patent until 2010. Some patients have, nevertheless, begun switching to a generic version of a competing cholesterol drug, Zocor.The House Energy and Commerce Committee has been looking into television ads featuring Dr. Jarvik. The committee disclosed that Pfizer had agreed to pay Dr. Jarvik at least $1.35 million under a two-year contract that expires next month. John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of that committee, raised questions about Dr. Jarvik’s credentials to recommend Lipitor.Dr. Jarvik, who has recently declined to discuss the Lipitor campaign, could not be reached for comment Monday.The committee’s investigation has rekindled a debate over the so-called direct-to-consumer advertising of pharmaceuticals, a $4.8 billion business.Mr. Dingell and Bart Stupak, another Michigan Democrat who leads an investigations subcommittee, applauded Pfizer’s decision to withdraw the Lipitor ads.“I commend Pfizer for doing the right thing and pulling the Lipitor ads featuring Dr. Jarvik,” Mr. Stupak said in a statement. “When consumers see and hear a doctor endorsing medication, they expect the doctor is a credible individual with requisite knowledge of the drug.”While endorsing Pfizer’s decision, the committee showed no sign of shutting down its investigation. Mr. Stupak said the committee planned to meet with Dr. Jarvik and collect all of the documents it had requested.The committee recently asked 10 advertising agencies that worked on the Dr. Jarvik campaign to submit documents about the use of body doubles.The committee has also contacted at least one former colleague of Dr. Jarvik’s who contended that he was not the actual inventor of the artificial heart, as stated in the ads.In a letter to Pfizer in August 2006, three former colleagues of Dr. Jarvik’s at the University of Utah complained that the ads erroneously identified Dr. Jarvik as “inventor of the artificial heart.” That distinction, they said, should go to Dr. Jarvik’s mentor, Dr. Willem J. Kolff, and his associate, Dr. Tetsuzo Akutsu.Pfizer subsequently changed its ads to identify Dr. Jarvik as the inventor of the “Jarvik artificial heart,” but Dr. Jarvik’s former colleagues, members of a large team that worked on the heart, were not entirely satisfied, according to Dr. Donald B. Olsen, a veterinarian who worked on the heart and is president of the Utah Artificial Heart Institute. Dr. Olsen said he had recently been contacted by the committee.A long-simmering dispute over assigning credit for the artificial heart boiled over again during a conference last December at the University of Utah. Dr. Jarvik did not attend the conference, which marked the 25th anniversary of the heart’s experimental use to extend the life of Barney Clark, a dentist in Seattle.During the meeting, another former Utah colleague of Dr. Jarvik’s, Dr. Clifford S. Kwan-Gett, stated that the Jarvik series of hearts were simply different versions of prototypes that Dr. Kwan-Gett had made more than a year earlier.Dr. Jarvik’s company, Jarvik Heart, subsequently posted a history of the artificial heart’s development on its Web site, giving his own account of the heart’s development. That posting said Dr. Jarvik’s design overcame two problems of the heart developed by Dr. Kwan-Gett.Jarvik Heart, based in Manhattan, has been working for the last two decades on a continuous-flow pump that can be inserted directly into a patient’s damaged heart to bolster its function.'"
"'08-02-26,'1','Visa plans to sell 406 million Class A shares for $37 to $42 a share, with just over half going to the public and the rest to Visa’s member banks.The first $3 billion will be placed into a special account to cover outstanding antitrust and unfair-pricing claims brought by merchants. Visa will use some of the new money to streamline its operations, expand in fast-growing emerging markets and invest in new technology like systems that enable people to make card payments via cellphone. But the bulk of the capital will end up in the banks’ coffers, from repurchasing stock from them.Visa’s member banks can use the extra cash.If Visa’s shares are valued at a midpoint price of $39.50, JPMorgan Chase, the company’s largest shareholder, would receive an estimated $1.1 billion for its stake. Bank of America would get about $545 million; National City would get about $380 million; and Citigroup, U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo can each expect around $240 million or more.“The credit crunch is pretty cyclical; the prospects for Visa are very strong long-term,” said Marc Abbey, the managing partner of First Annapolis, a consulting firm that works with many banks and payments companies. “I am sure it is convenient for them to have extraordinary gains at the same time they have extraordinary losses.”Since going public nearly two years ago, MasterCard shares have soared 408 percent, closing at $198.45 on Monday. It now has a market value of $26 billion.MasterCard’s successful I.P.O. prompted Visa to move forward with its own plans to go public. Since October 2006, Visa has reorganized its sprawling management structure, bringing together all of its global operations with the exception of those in Europe.It has also hired Joseph W. Saunders, the former head of the Providian Financial Corporation, as its new chairman and chief executive, giving him a pay package worth $11.1 million in cash for 2007. Upon completion of the I.P.O., he is expected to receive an additional $11.5 million in stock and options, according to Equilar, a compensation research firm.Visa transactions accounted for roughly 66 percent of all credit and debit card purchases in the United States in 2006, compared with about 26 percent for MasterCard, according to The Nilson Report data.Growth in card transactions, the foundation of the companies’ businesses, has historically held up well, even when the economy and consumer spending slows.'"
"'08-02-26,'1','MEXICO CITY — Mexicans working in the United States sent back almost $24 billion to their families at home last year, almost the same amount as the year before, the Mexican central bank reported on Monday.The bank said the economic slowdown and the crackdown on illegal immigrants in the United States helped to explain sluggish growth in money transfers, known as remittances.Remittances grew 17 percent in 2006, in line with the annual double-digit growth over much of this decade. But in 2007, they increased by just 1 percent, to $23.98 billion.The sharp contraction in the United States housing industry last year had a particularly noticeable effect on remittances because many Mexicans are employed in construction.The central bank added that heightened border security was making it much harder for Mexicans to enter the United States in search of work without authorization. Once in the country, it is harder to find jobs because of tighter controls against employers who hire the undocumented.Remittances are among Mexico’s largest sources of foreign currency. Last year, foreign companies invested $23.23 billion to build factories or set up other businesses in Mexico, the second-highest total for foreign direct investment ever. That was still less than the money that the largely low-skilled Mexicans sent home in the form of remittances.'"
"'08-02-26,'1','“She has an addiction to lawsuits,” Mayor David Roberts said in a recent interview. “Beth can’t stop suing — she loves it.”A spokesman for the city said that an appeals court’s decision in January compared Ms. Mason’s actions to “a fishing expedition.”But the way Ms. Mason, a Democrat, sees it, she is simply trying to get answers from a hidebound and historically corrupt city that drags its feet when asked to provide answers.To that end, Ms. Mason — the president of the New Jersey Foundation for Open Government, an advocacy group — tapes meetings of the Board of Education and posts documents like the city budget on her Web sites, masoncitycouncil.org and wethepeoplereports.com.“We know corruption sits in these hidden places,” said Ms. Mason, adding that officials should be able to produce whatever information she asks for. “If I ask for all of City Hall, what’s the problem?” she said.Both the American Civil Liberties Union and the New Jersey Press Association have filed briefs on her behalf, and supporters say that Ms. Mason’s legal odysseys could lead to significant changes in the state’s public records laws.An affable pit bull, she tears into her targets with a smile. After a Supreme Court hearing on a records request case last Wednesday, she approached one opponent, Assistant Attorney General Lewis Scheindlin, with a grin and a handshake. “You’re a good man,” she told him.Mayor Roberts, who appointed Ms. Mason to the Planning Board in 2001, acknowledged that she was right in at least one instance: When Ms. Mason requested the city’s general ledger (essentially all of its financial transactions) in 2004, she received a letter from the business administrator explaining that “corrections” needed to be made before the information was released.“When you throw enough stuff against the wall, sometimes it sticks,” said Mr. Roberts, adding that the business administrator’s response was a mistake.Ms. Mason has also successfully sued to lower the copying costs that the city charges per page: from 16 to 7 cents.Grudgingly, Mr. Roberts conceded that Ms. Mason’s litigiousness has also done some good, and that whenever “publicity is given that makes the government more transparent, it’s good and it’s positive.”Mr. Kleinman said that she had made the city more careful in its responses. “We’re forced to look at OPRA in a very careful light,” he said of the records act, “because we know if she’s unsatisfied, she’ll sue.”As for the 70,000 construction documents, Ms. Mason said she had a good reason to request them. “The mayor had made statements about how many construction permits had been given during a time frame,” she said. “What, are we supposed to take someone’s word for it?”Last week, Ms. Mason reached a settlement with the school board, in which it acknowledged violating both the Open Records and the Open Public Meetings Acts. So far, she has been successful in two of her eight cases, and has settled parts of others.She got a hearing — and a lot of wary questions — on one of her cases before the state’s highest court last week for arguing that anyone denied records should be given a two-year statute of limitations to sue, instead of the current 45 days. Her lawyer, Jeffrey Kantowitz, also argued that lawyer’s fees should be paid by a municipality if a litigant wins a case.

"'08-02-26,'1','ROCKY RIVER, Ohio — Senator John McCain said Monday that he needed to convince the American people that the troop escalation in Iraq was working and that American casualties there would continue to decline. If he did not, he said, “I lose” the election.“Is there any doubt?” Mr. McCain said to reporters on his campaign bus.But then he pulled back from his blunt assessment. “Let me not put it that stark,” he said, explaining that he believed people would judge his candidacy on his ability to handle the economy, which has emerged as a pre-eminent voter concern, as well as on national security.Nevertheless, Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, made clear that he believed his prospects in November would rest in large measure on the way the situation in Iraq played out.“If I may, I’d like to retract ‘I’ll lose,’ ” he said. “But I don’t think there’s any doubt that how they judge Iraq will have a direct relation to their judgment of me.”Mr. McCain said he believed opinion was shifting to his point of view, referring to a recent USA Today poll that, he said, showed that “now the majority of Americans believe the surge is succeeding.”'"
"'08-02-26,'1','TAMPA, Fla. — Hank Steinbrenner, the Yankees’ senior vice president, said Monday that he was open to discussing a contract extension for General Manager Brian Cashman.“It will happen eventually,” Steinbrenner said, referring to a meeting with Cashman. “It might be during the season, it might be after. We could just be talking at a game. It will happen when the time is right.”Steinbrenner wanted to trade for pitcher Johan Santana this winter, but Cashman and Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees’ general partner, did not. That decision could haunt Cashman if the Yankees stumble and Santana thrives with the Mets. Yet Hank Steinbrenner said he supported the direction the Yankees had taken under Cashman, who has been in his job for 10 years.“As far as me wanting him to stay, I don’t see why not,” Steinbrenner said. “He’s been with us a long time, and I like what he’s done with the organization.”Cashman assumed greater control over the baseball operations department in October 2005, when he signed a three-year contract extension. Steinbrenner praised the team’s scouting director, Damon Oppenheimer, and the senior vice president for baseball operations, Mark Newman, for reviving the Yankees’ farm system since then.Steinbrenner stressed that Cashman would have to want to return, adding that Cashman, who makes about $1.8 million a season, was well paid. Steinbrenner said he would not “beg anybody to stay” and did not know what Cashman wanted.Cashman would not answer directly when asked if he wanted to come back. But he said he did not need to resolve his future soon.'"
"'08-02-26,'1','For its part, JetBlue said it was considering creating enhanced front cabin seating to attract business travelers willing to pay for perks like more legroom.Several of these efforts are receiving a positive reception from industry analysts, business travelers and the managers who make decisions about which carriers employees can or must fly.“They’re moving in the right direction,” said Michael Boyd, president of the Boyd Group aviation consulting firm, referring to Southwest’s strategy to court more corporate fliers.“To get the business traveler, you need a number of things,” he said. “Reliability — they’ve got that. Frequency — in most markets, they’ve got that.“But you’ve also got to have a low-anxiety product,” he added, mentioning that Southwest’s seating policy may need some refining.Last fall, Southwest, known for its first-come-first-served boarding process, changed that to ensure that those paying the highest ticket prices — $10 to $30 extra for its “business select” fares — are placed at the front of the line.All boarding passes are now numbered so passengers no longer have to line up early, which was a major turn-off to many business travelers already stressed and pressed for time.So far, Southwest is selling an average of two to three business select tickets per flight, Mr. Kelly said, and it aims to earn an additional $100 million a year in incremental revenue from these fares.Although Mr. Boyd praised that change, he said that Southwest might have to offer assigned seating or other enhancements to woo the business crowd. He noted, for instance, that JetBlue’s wider seats and live television were competitive advantages, compared with major carriers’ economy cabins.Southwest and JetBlue have also been able to outshine their older competitors in customer service.“JetBlue does not have passengers; they’ve got groupies,” Mr. Boyd said. “They’ve gotten where they’ve gotten strictly because of good service.”Southwest also had the best on-time record of the 10 largest domestic carriers last year, according to data compiled by the Department of Transportation.That is a big reason Joshua White, an accountant in Melville, N.Y., gives Southwest almost all of his business, flying out of MacArthur Airport on Long Island to visit clients about two to three times a month.Mr. White also appreciates the new numbered boarding procedure, saying it “alleviates the panic” previously associated with lining up for seats. He said he had paid the extra fee for the business select ticket a few times, mostly to get priority boarding on longer flights.“It’s no guarantee of a completely comfortable flight,” he said. “But your odds will bump up a bit if you pay the extra money.”Corporate travel managers also report an increased receptiveness to low-cost carriers among their clients.“There’s definitely a willingness to fly low-cost carriers as they continue to add services,” said Mary Ellen George, general manager for Advito, a travel management consultant based in Dallas.To capture a bigger share of those corporate travel dollars, however, a more important factor may be offering the discounted contracts that businesses have long negotiated with the larger airlines.“Southwest is starting to move into that territory, albeit very slowly,” said Dale Eastlund, director for the air consulting group at Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a travel management company. “They’ve had discussions with companies, but companies are trying to weigh the benefit of a corporate contract with Southwest versus just using them when they offer the lowest fares.”Given the current economic climate, price may ultimately dictate which airline business travelers choose to fly.'"
"'08-02-26,'1','But the NYT/CBS News poll shows that Mr. Obama’s coalition — originally derided by critics as confined to upper-income reformers, young people and African-Americans — has broadened widely. In December, for example, he had the support of 26 percent of the male Democratic primary voters; in the latest poll, that figure had climbed to 67 percent.“He’s from Illinois and I’m from Illinois and he reminds me of Abraham Lincoln,” said Dylan Jones, 53, a laborer from Oxford, N.C., who was interviewed in a follow-up to the poll. “I can see him out there splitting rails. I don’t have anything against Hillary Clinton, so I guess it’s because he’s new blood.”Similarly, Mr. Obama’s support among those with household incomes under $50,000 rose to 48 percent from 35 percent since December. His support among moderates rose to 59 percent from 28 percent. In contrast, Mrs. Clinton’s strength among Democratic men dropped to 28 percent from 42 percent in December; her support among voters in households making under $50,000 held stable.Even among women, Mr. Obama made strides — he had the support of 19 percent of white women in December, and 40 percent in the most recent poll. White women, however, remain Mrs. Clinton’s most loyal base of support — 51 percent backed the senator from New York, statistically unchanged from the 48 percent who backed her in December.“I like them both,” said Ann Powers, 63, a coordinator for special-education programs in Fort Dodge, Iowa. “I just think he is too inexperienced and she’s dealt with more in the last 20 years.” Billie Stimoff, a 72-year-old retiree from Kodak, Tenn., said, “It’s time to see what a woman can do because men sure have made a mess of things.”The national telephone poll was conducted Feb. 20-24 with 1,115 registered voters, including 427 Democratic primary voters and 327 Republican primary voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all voters, plus or minus five percentage points for Democratic voters and plus or minus five percentage points for Republican voters.The poll showed Republicans settling in with their likely nominee. Eight in ten said they would be satisfied if Mr. McCain wins their party’s nomination, although just 3 in 10 said they would be very satisfied. Nearly 9 in 10 said he was prepared for the presidency and more than 8 in 10 said they had confidence in his ability to deal with an international crisis, while a remarkable 96 percent said he would likely make an effective commander in chief.But misgivings remain among those who describe themselves as conservative Republicans, with a majority of those voters saying his positions on the issues are not conservative enough.On the Democratic side, primary voters indicated they saw few substantive differences between their candidates on issues like the war in Iraq and health care. Most Democratic voters have confidence in both candidates to handle the economy, the war in Iraq and an international crisis. And large numbers think it is likely that either candidate would make an effective commander-in-chief.Mr. Obama’s advantages are more apparent on other measures. Nearly 6 in 10 say he has the best chance of beating Mr. McCain, double the numbers who believed Mrs. Clinton was more electable. He is also viewed by more Democratic voters as someone who can bring about “real change” in the way things are done in Washington and is willing to compromise with Republicans “the right amount” to get things done.Democratic voters are also more likely to say Mr. Obama cares a lot about them, inspires them and can unite the country. Sixty-three percent of Democratic voters said he cares a lot about them, while fewer than half think Mrs. Clinton does. Nearly seven in 10 say he inspires them about the future of the country; 54 percent say Mrs. Clinton does. Three-quarters say he would be able to unite the country as president; 53 percent say Mrs. Clinton would.Mrs. Clinton also has her strengths: Her supporters are, in general, more committed; nearly 8 in 10 of Mrs. Clinton’s backers say they strongly favor her, while 6 in ten of Mr. Obama’s supporters strongly favor him. Only 18 percent of her supporters back her with reservations; about a third of Mr. Obama’s supporters said they had reservations about him.Democratic women are also more likely to say that the news media have been harder on Mrs. Clinton than on other candidates: 56 percent felt that way, compared with 39 percent of the Democratic men. Both men and women were more likely to think the media have been harder on Mrs. Clinton than on Mr. Obama.Not surprisingly, Democratic primary voters have an opinion on the appropriate role of the 795 super-delegates who could decide this year’s election; more than half said that these uncommitted delegates should vote for the candidate who received the most votes in the primaries and caucuses.'"

"'08-02-26,'1','SHANGHAI — One of China’s best-known human rights lawyers has been repeatedly beaten by police officers outside his home here in recent days, according to his wife and associates.The lawyer, Zheng Enchong, who has lived under house arrest for several months, has been seriously injured by plainclothes police officers who, in one attack, knocked him down, then repeatedly hoisted his body parallel to the ground and dropped him on the concrete, people who have visited him said. He has been seen walking with a limp.In a telephone interview, Mr. Zheng’s wife, Jiang Meili, described another beating, which she said took place as her husband tried to leave his house for church. “A guy stopped him and pushed him to the ground,” Ms. Jiang said. “One man held him by the neck, while another kneed him in the stomach. Then five or six men carried him back upstairs, beating him in the elevator, too.”Ms. Jiang said the beatings represented a sharp escalation of a recent campaign by the Shanghai authorities to silence Mr. Zheng. Associates who have spoken with him say the beatings started after he began advising residents who had organized a campaign against a high-tech railroad that would cut through middle-class areas of the city.Others said Mr. Zheng had also recently spoken of details of what he called evidence of high-level corruption in Shanghai involving real estate speculation and influence peddling. “They’ve been very annoyed by this,” Mr. Zheng’s wife said.The government is struggling with competing priorities as it works to put on its best face for the world as the host of the Olympic Games. It appears eager to eliminate dissent but would like to avoid being tagged as a gross violator of human rights.Mr. Zheng’s corruption allegations, according to other human rights lawyers, have focused on Huang Ju, a deputy prime minister who died last year, as well as sons of former President Jiang Zemin. Mr. Jiang, who was once Communist Party secretary for the city, developed Shanghai into a personal power base.'"
"'08-02-26,'1','Although some of the scenes she has recreated from her youth (which are told in colorful, streetwise argot) can feel self-consciously novelistic at times, Ms. Jones has done an amazing job of conjuring up her old neighborhood. She captures both the brutal realities of a place where children learn to sleep on the floor to avoid the random bullets that might come smashing through the windows and walls at night, and the succor offered by family and friends. She conveys the extraordinary stoicism of women like Big Mom, her foster mother, who raised four grandchildren while working a day job and a night job. And she draws indelible portraits of these four kids who became her siblings: two young girls she would help raise, and two older boys, whom she emulated and followed into the Bloods.Ms. Jones — or Bree, as she was known to family and friends — was abused as a child, put in foster care, and after three years of carrying a trash bag filled with her possessions from one temporary home to another, ended up, at 8 ½, in Big Mom’s home in South-Central — a part white, part Native American girl who looked utterly out of place in this nearly all-black world.Bree had been told she had attention deficit disorder, reactive attachment disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and labeled “S.E.D. (severely emotionally disabled).” By age 8 she had “decided not to hurt anymore” and mastered the art of detachment: “I was shocked that I hadn’t thought of it before. I would watch my life from the outside rather than feel it from within. If I couldn’t feel it, it couldn’t hurt me.”Though her foster family’s love would help heal Bree’s heart, the numbness always threatened to return, and she observes that this sort of emotional hibernation was rampant in South-Central. When Bree went to visit her foster brother Taye in prison — he’d been sentenced for selling drugs — he told her he loved her but didn’t want her to come back for any more visits: waiting for visits and letters, he said, “was killin me,” and he’d decided he wasn’t going to “even find out what was up wit y’all.” He had to do his “time solo” or he “ain gonna make it.”Ms. Jones’s portraits of her family and friends are so sympathetic and unsentimental, so raw and tender and tough-minded that it’s clear to the reader that whatever detachment she learned as a child did not impair her capacity for caring. Instead it heightened her powers of observation, enabling her to write with a novelist’s eye for the psychological detail and an anthropologist’s eye for social rituals and routines.She tells us how her brother Terrell became an “official” Blood, getting “jumped into” the gang by surviving a savage initiation beating. (“So five grown men beat 13-year-old Terrell for two minutes in the street.”) She tells us about getting a .38 for her 13th birthday and learning how to cook up a batch of crack to pay her family’s overdue water bill. She tells us about survival tips for visiting the local park. (“You must always scan the park, figure out who is where and the best escape route from each direction.”) And she tells us about the iconography of the tattooed tear many prisoners and ex-prisoners wear on one cheek. (It “can mean a few things, but usually it’s that the wearer killed someone in prison or lost a loved one while in prison.”)Ms. Jones’s own story is strewn with loss and death and grief. She saw a gang elder named Kraziak, who’d patiently taught her about the history of L.A., gunned down by rival Crips. She saw her next-door neighbor Big Rodney, who used to give her books to read, grabbed by the police in a violent raid.Both her older brothers, Terrell and Taye, were sent to prison, and after his release, Terrell, who’d talked of getting a straight job so his children wouldn’t grow up in the ’hood, was shot to death by Crips as he sat outside Big Mom’s house, waiting to meet his son for his weekend visit. Ms. Jones’s friend Marcus, a brother figure with whom she used to drive around Los Angeles, dreaming of what life might be like “beyond the lights” of the city, was shot and killed, she says, and her boyfriend, Slikk, was arrested for an attempted murder he didn’t commit.Although one of Bree’s teachers urges her to apply to college, the idea initially seems “almost unimaginable” — “so beyond my reach that I couldn’t really picture myself doing it.” Finally, however, she does apply and eventually graduates from the University of Oregon with a degree in ethnic studies. She finds love with, of all men, a Crip who “changed every detail of my life” and who taught her that “we are not each other’s enemies,” we “were just born into different streets and neighborhoods.”“Unlike most of my homies,” she writes, “I made it out of L.A. with my life and without a prison record. Wait, let me reword that, as it is not entirely true as it stands. I made it out of L.A. with what life I had left. I wake up in the morning, and where I live, in a little house on a dead-end street in a small Oregon town, I hear birds singing in a big-leaf maple outside my bedroom window, and I thank God because I know it shouldn’t have been so.”There are “some parts of me that did die in L.A.,” she adds, “and that I’ll never get back, and other parts of me that die daily because I exist away from the city, in a world where people can’t begin to imagine what it was like where I grew up.”One of her friends in prison writes her that “so few of us will ever get the chance to see what it’s like outside L.A.,” that she should “be our eyes.” That Ms. Jones has done, and with this remarkable book she has also borne witness to the life in the ’hood that she escaped, conveying not just the terrible violence and hatred of that world, but also the love and friendship that sustained her on those mean streets.'"
"'08-02-26,'1','I asked an industry analyst, a frequent business traveler who studies brand loyalty, and a foreign airline’s chief executive how they see things shaping up.“I see a reduction of options for the passengers along with an increase in fares,” said William F. Shea, a former associate administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and a former aviation director in Portland, Ore., who is now a lecturer on aviation issues. “I am also very concerned about the smaller communities that I see losing more air service.”Air service has already been reduced in many small and even some midsize markets. The trend is accelerating as major airlines use fewer small, fuel-inefficient regional jets and shift bigger aircraft to profitable international routes and to domestic routes that will provide feeder traffic for international connections.At some airports that now depend on small regional jet service, “the runways are limited — they can’t handle bigger planes,” Mr. Shea said.James T. Kane, who studies brand loyalty — and flies frequently — as a partner at Brookeside Group, expressed resignation at the prospect of mergers.“The airline industry and the banking industries are the most hated industries on the planet, with the most disloyal customers,” he said.“From my standpoint, if mergers simply reduce the bad choices from six to four, fantastic. Go for it,” he added.Mr. Kane said he was amazed at how little the needs of customers were figuring into merger discussions and negotiations.“All the talk is about fuel prices, pilot contracts, share prices,” he said. “They’re not even talking about customers.”Mr. Kane predicted that low-cost domestic airlines would increasingly take business from the legacy carriers, defined as American, United, Delta, Continental, US Airways and Northwest.Already, aggressive low-fare competitors with solid brand loyalty, including Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, are adding flights and even buying planes to compete more aggressively for the aggrieved business traveler.Meanwhile, foreign airlines are waiting for the start of the Open Skies agreement between the United States and Europe, the first phase of which takes effect next month. Ultimately, several major foreign airlines hope, Open Skies will allow them to acquire attractive low-cost carriers in the United States, rather than merely hold minor stakes in them.The big German carrier Lufthansa recently acquired a 19 percent stake in JetBlue, which, in turn, recently expanded some domestic routes and flights.In an interview, Wolfgang Mayrhuber, Lufthansa’s chief executive, described the JetBlue stake as “a financial investment with strategic implications.”Initially, the prize is JetBlue’s strong brand loyalty and its wealth of slots in New York at Kennedy Airport. Those augment Lufthansa’s own slots there and can form the basis of a fledgling network, with JetBlue feeding Lufthansa international flights and Lufthansa feeding JetBlue’s domestic flights.“Jointly, we can optimize” the Kennedy slots, Mr. Mayrhuber said. “At the end of the day, they would have bigger planes, and we would coordinate the traffic flows so we can bring more passengers through each slot.”'"
"'08-02-26,'1','You wouldn’t know it to look at them, but political consultants are as faddish as anyone else. And the current vogueish advice among the backroom set is: Go after your opponent’s strengths. So in the first volley of what feels like the general election campaign, Barack Obama has attacked John McCain for being too close to lobbyists. His assault is part of this week’s Democratic chorus: McCain isn’t really the anti-special interest reformer he pretends to be. He’s more tainted than his reputation suggests.Well, anything is worth trying, I suppose, but there is the little problem of his record. McCain has fought one battle after another against lobbyists and special interests. And while I don’t have space to describe all his tussles, or even the lesser ones like his fight with the agricultural lobby against sugar subsidies, I thought that, amidst all these charges, it might be worth noting some of the McCain highlights from the past dozen years.In 1996, McCain was one of five senators, and the only Republican, to vote against the Telecommunications Act. He did it because he believed the act gave away too much to the telecommunications companies, and protected them from true competition. He noted that AT&T alone gave $780,000 to Republicans and $456,000 to Democrats in the year leading up to the vote.In 1998, McCain championed anti-smoking legislation that faced furious opposition from the tobacco lobby. McCain guided the legislation through the Senate Commerce Committee on a 19-1 vote, but then the tobacco companies struck back. They hired 200 lobbyists and spent $40 million in advertising (three times as much as the Harry and Louise health care reform ads). Many of the ads attacked McCain by name, accusing him of becoming a big government liberal. After weeks of bitter debate, the bill died on the Senate floor.In 2000, McCain ran for president and reiterated his longstanding opposition to ethanol subsidies. Though it crippled his chances in Iowa, he argued that ethanol was a wasteful giveaway. A recent study in the journal Science has shown that when you take all impacts into consideration, ethanol consumption increases greenhouse gas emissions compared with regular gasoline. Unlike, say, Barack Obama, McCain still opposes ethanol subsidies.'"

But he will not run, he said.“I listened carefully to those who encouraged me to run, but I am not — and will not be — a candidate for president,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “I have watched this campaign unfold, and I am hopeful that the current campaigns can rise to the challenge by offering truly independent leadership. The most productive role that I can serve is to push them forward, by using the means at my disposal to promote a real and honest debate.In a switch, the mayor said that if one of the candidates offered a practical approach and challenged party orthodoxy, he would work to help elect that person.“And while I have always said I am not running for president, the race is too important to sit on the sidelines, and so I have changed my mind in one area. If a candidate takes an independent, non-partisan approach — and embraces practical solutions that challenge party orthodoxy — I’ll join others in helping that candidate win the White House.”'"
"'08-02-27,'1','“Microsoft was the first company in 50 years of E.U. competition policy that the commission has had to fine for failure to comply with an antitrust decision,” Ms. Kroes said in a statement. “I hope that today’s decision closes a dark chapter in Microsoft’s record of noncompliance with the commission’s March 2004 decision.”Last Thursday, Microsoft published 30,000 pages of previously secret software code for the Windows operating system on its Web site. The company called the move a significant concession toward greater openness and compatibility with competitors. The commission greeted that news coolly, noting that Microsoft had made “at least four similar statements” in the past.Though the latest fine is for Microsoft’s noncompliance with the 2004 decision, the commission’s assertive stance will be noted by other high-tech corporations, including Intel and Qualcomm, whose business models are being scrutinized by the European regulator, and Google, whose acquisition of DoubleClick is before the commission.Microsoft, too, has pending business. The commission is examining whether the bundling of Internet Explorer into Microsoft Windows has unfairly excluded competitors from the Web browser market. It will also investigate whether Microsoft withheld essential information from companies that wanted to make products compatible with its ubiquitous software, including the Office word processing and spreadsheet programs.Microsoft said it was “reviewing the commission’s action,” adding that the fines were “about the past issues that have been resolved.”The comments of Ms. Kroes Wednesday scarcely sought to disguise her annoyance with Microsoft. They also appeared to end any hope Microsoft may have entertained that it was entering a new era of cooperation with Ms. Kroes.Rapprochement seemed to be in the air after Microsoft agreed in October to fall into line with the 2004 decision. Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive, agreed to do so after meeting Ms. Kroes in a restaurant near her home north of The Hague. But on Wednesday, in a revealing comment, Ms. Kroes underlined how little trust she had in Microsoft.“I can remember four times when, if you were naïve, you could have thought everything was fixed,” Ms. Kroes said. “This didn’t seem to be the reality. They have to deliver and implement.”The March 2004 decision required Microsoft to disclose within 120 days information that allowed rival vendors to interoperate with the dominant Windows system. European antitrust officials said the company had sought too much in royalties and patent fees for competitors to use the data.Ms. Kroes said the fine was calculated on the basis that Microsoft was in breach of the commission’s order for 488 days. It represented 60 percent of the maximum $2.25 billion that the commission could have imposed, she said.The commission had already fined Microsoft more than $600 million in 2004, when it determined the company had abused the dominance of its Windows operating system, and more than $350 million in July 2006 for failing to comply with a requirement that it license network communications technology.Ms. Schweitzer, the law professor, said the amount of the fine Wednesday was striking given the nature of the issue — a ruling that its royalty pricing should be reasonable.“I am surprised that they have imposed such a high penalty over such a vague and difficult concept as reasonable pricing,” Ms. Schweitzer said, “although the difference between the royalties originally charged by Microsoft and the one ultimately found to be reasonable is indeed significant.”Adam Collinson, a partner at the Eversheds law firm in Britain, said that Ms. Kroes’s “personal irritation at the Microsoft situation is palpable.” He added, however, that the situation may not have been straightforward for the corporation because “Microsoft had to make a judgment as to what levels of royalty would be regarded as reasonable for supply of the interoperability information.”Thomas Vinje, a spokesman for the European Committee for Interoperable Systems, a group including several Microsoft competitors, praised the decision.“Commissioner Kroes is to be commended for her perseverance over the last three years in the face of Microsoft’s foot-dragging and appeals,” he said.'"
"'08-02-27,'1','Stocks ended little changed Wednesday after a rally fizzled when doubts emerged that the lifting of investment caps on the two largest home financing companies was enough to prevent deeper damage to the housing market.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 9.36 points, or 0.1 percent, to end at 12,694.28. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 1.27 points, or 0.1 percent, to finish at 1,380.02.

"'08-02-27,'1','Senator John McCain, looking ahead to a possible general-election matchup with Senator Barack Obama, attacked Mr. Obama on Wednesday for what he called a weak and naïve approach to the conflict in Iraq and the effort to combat international terrorism.Seizing on a comment from Tuesday night’s Democratic debate, Mr. McCain, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, said that Mr. Obama’s plan to rapidly withdraw American troops from Iraq would leave the country in the hands of Al Qaeda and possibly other terrorist groups.In response to a hypothetical question at the debate, Mr. Obama said that although he intended to withdraw American forces as rapidly as possible, he reserved the right to send troops back in “if Al Qaeda is forming a base in Iraq.”Mr. McCain pounced on the remark. “I have some news,” he said at a town hall-style meeting in Tyler, Tex. “Al Qaeda is in Iraq. It’s called ‘Al Qaeda in Iraq.’ My friends, if we left, they wouldn’t be establishing a base. They’d be taking a country and I’m not going to allow that to happen.”Mr. Obama, in Columbus, responded soon after. “I have some news for John McCain,” Mr. Obama said at a large rally at Ohio State University. “There was no such thing as Al Qaeda in Iraq until George Bush and John McCain decided to invade Iraq.”'"
"'08-02-27,'1','Sharply lower prices failed to perk up sales of new homes in January, a government report showed on Wednesday, as a closely watched index fell to its lowest point in 13 years.Sales of newly constructed homes dropped 2.8 percent from December, to an annual rate of 588,000. It was the third consecutive monthly decline. The median price of a new home sold in January fell to $216,000, down 15 percent from a year ago, according to the Commerce Department.“Another month, another disastrous U.S. new home sales report,” wrote Dimitry Fleming, an economist at ING Bank. “New home prices have not dropped this fast in over 35 years.”In an ominous sign for builders, inventories of unsold homes continued to rise. At the current sales rate, it would take nearly 10 months to sell off the backlog.The housing market is struggling to shake off a wave of foreclosures and more stringent lending standards for mortgages. Would-be buyers are waiting for prices to fall even further, economists say, and many predict sales to stay light through at least the summer. A general slowdown in the economy is also expected to keep demand weak.'"
"'08-02-27,'1','Over the long haul, the bigger worry for Mr. Bernanke may not be import prices as much as interest rates and the dollar’s value. While the Fed has direct control over overnight interest rates, long-term interest rates for mortgages and business purposes are affected in large measure by the flow of trillions of dollars in cheap foreign money.Foreign capital inflows were a crucial contributor to the boom in housing prices and the persistence of low mortgage rates even after the Fed raised rates in 2004. If capital flows are now slower, or come with higher demands, mortgage rates are likely to stay high even if the Fed cuts its benchmark rate.Even as Mr. Bernanke repeated the Fed’s mantra about closely monitoring inflation trends, investors on Wall Street immediately recognized that the Fed chairman was leaving the door open to lower interest rates when he promised to provide “insurance” against a possible downturn.An old rule of thumb in monetary policy, seared into the memory of policy makers in the late 1970s, is that it is much easier to fix a mistake about economic growth than it is to fix one about inflation.But as the Fed grapples with both the clear danger of a recession and rising consumer prices, policy makers are now putting far more emphasis on fighting a slowdown than on fighting inflation.In his testimony Wednesday, Mr. Bernanke acknowledged that the central bank faces increasingly contradictory pressures of slowing growth and rising consumer prices.The “economic situation has become distinctly less favorable” since last summer and “the risks to this outlook remain on the downside,” he told the House panel, whose leaders focused on the deep slump in the housing industry.Mr. Bernanke signaled that at least for now, policy makers are more worried about averting or at least softening a possible recession.Though the Fed is still predicting that the economy will narrowly escape a recession, policy makers have slashed their forecasts for growth in 2008 to less than 2 percent and expect almost no expansion during the first six months of this year.But Mr. Bernanke warned that even that forecast may prove optimistic. He predicted that the housing downturn will continue to slow the economy “in the coming quarters,” noting that financial markets are still in turmoil and that it has become more difficult to obtain credit. Consumer spending has “slowed significantly,” he said, partly because of rising gasoline prices, slowing job growth and the decline in household wealth as a result of falling home prices.In exchanges with the lawmakers, Mr. Bernanke agreed that regulation needed to be tighter, or at least more efficient, to avoid another epidemic of mortgage defaults, and for that matter to deter abuses in the credit-card industry.“We don’t want to create a chilling effect,” Mr. Bernanke said. “We don’t want to shut down these markets. We just want them to work better and, in particular, we think it’s important for consumers to have a better understanding of what it is that they’re buying when they purchase products in these markets.”The Federal Reserve has proposed rules intended to curb shady lending practices and impose more clarity on lending terms.The committee chairman, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said it was clear that the housing collapse was due in large measure to “the ideology of deregulation.”“We are in the most significant economic troubles since at least 1998,” Mr. Frank said. “And the single biggest cause was a failure for regulation to keep up with innovation. And it’s, of course, had international consequences as well.”Mr. Frank said he had often agreed with Mr. Bernanke’s predecessor, Alan Greenspan, whom he credited with patient and prudent leadership on monetary policy. “But in another area I think he erred,” Mr. Frank said. “His view that regulation was almost never required.”The committee’s ranking Republican, Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, was less pessimistic than Mr. Frank. He said he was confident that the Fed’s careful monitoring “combined with responses from the private sector and the natural operation of the business cycle” would steady the economy sooner rather than later.But he went on, “One lesson we’ve learned from the subprime contagion is just how highly interconnected our financial markets are.” Mr. Bachus cautioned against “overregulation” caused by different agencies monitoring different sectors of the economy.“But there may be gaps in the regulation, and I wonder if that is in fact the case,” he said. “There may be areas where the regulation needs to be strengthened or regulation needs to be coordinated better between different regulators, both state and federal.”Mr. Bernanke tried to make it clear that the Fed is watching inflation closely. He acknowledged that inflation may climb slightly more rapidly than the policy makers projected in January. Fed officials then estimated that consumer prices would climb to a range of 2.1 percent to 2.4 percent in 2008.“Any tendency of inflation expectations to become unmoored or for the Federal Reserve’s inflation-fighting credibility to be eroded would greatly complicate the task of sustaining price stability and could reduce the flexibility of the F.O.M.C.,” Mr. Bernanke warned Wednesday, referring to the Federal Open Markets Committee, which sets interest rates.“Accordingly, in the months ahead, the Federal Reserve will continue to closely monitor inflation and inflation expectations.”But even as he acknowledged the growing dilemma between fighting the downturn and fighting inflation, Mr. Bernanke appeared to put more weight on promoting growth and made it clear he has not shut the door on more reductions in interest rates.Noting that monetary policy “works with a lag,” the Fed chairman said, “it is important to recognize that downside risks to growth remain.”More important, he repeated the Fed’s recent promises to “act in a timely manner as needed to support growth and provide adequate insurance to downside risks.”'"
"'08-02-27,'1','As of Tuesday, regular gasoline was selling at a nationwide average of $3.14 a gallon, according to AAA, the automobile club, up from $2.35 a year ago. The price has jumped 19 cents a gallon in two weeks.Energy specialists predict that, as demand picks up further this spring and summer, retail prices will surpass the high of $3.23 a gallon set last Memorial Day weekend. That high fell short of the inflation-adjusted record of $3.40 in today’s money that was set in 1981.On Tuesday, diesel prices rose to a record $3.60 a gallon, compared with $2.62 a gallon last year.For a decade, rising oil prices failed to dent global economic growth. In the United States, consumers absorbed the higher costs because of easy credit and rising prosperity, while in developing countries, government subsidies helped ease the pain. The rise in energy prices was a result of growing demand around the world.The price of oil has quadrupled in six years, and the close Tuesday was not far below the inflation-adjusted high set in April 1980, after the Iranian revolution. That record, $39.50 a barrel, equals $103.76 in today’s money.As oil prices spiked last fall, low wintertime gasoline demand helped keep prices in check. But now, experts say, the price of oil is finally showing up at the pump.For ordinary Americans like Phyllis Berry, a 31-year-old factory worker for General Motors in Cleveland, gasoline costs are starting to hurt.“I used to fill it up pretty regularly, but now I drive it until the tank is almost empty, looking for the cheapest place to buy gas,” said Ms. Berry, who drives a beat-up Dodge Caravan.She said that she used to take her four children to the movies four or five times a month. But with the cost of gas, tickets, popcorn and soda adding up to $70, they now go only once a month.Still, things are not quite as bad as during the 1970s and 1980s oil shocks. In the early 1980s, at the height of the last energy crisis, energy accounted for about 8 percent of household spending. As prices fell and the economy became less energy-intensive, energy costs fell under 4 percent of household spending in the early 1990s.With the run-up in prices in recent years, economists say energy’s share of disposable income is slowly creeping up again. In December, that figure reached 6.1 percent, the highest level since 1985. The increase of two percentage points — amounting to $200 billion — is a huge sum, a little less than half what Americans spend each year on new cars and automobile parts.“You’re adding an oil shock on top of a crunch on credit and a housing collapse,” said Nigel Gault, an economist at Global Insight. “Even the U.S. economy cannot withstand all of that at the same time.”American consumers have responded belatedly by cutting back on their energy use. Oil demand in the United States grew by just 0.4 percent in 2007 and is expected to be flat in 2008.But global oil demand, the relentless driver behind higher prices, is still expected to increase by 1.4 million barrels a day this year, analysts estimate. That growth, from China and the Middle East, may help keep prices up, whatever happens to the American economy.According to the latest forecast by the Energy Department, gasoline prices should peak near $3.40 a gallon this spring.But many analysts consider the government’s forecast conservative, foreseeing a sharper spike as refiners come out of the seasonal maintenance period and start producing summer-grade gasoline in March and April.“We’ve gone this high without the normal summer dynamics,” said Tom Kloza, publisher and chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service. “That’s when I think we will have the big jump — of 50 cents to 75 cents a gallon.”Mr. Kloza said he expected gasoline to peak around $3.50 to $3.75 a gallon nationwide. Geoff Sundstrom, AAA’s spokesman, echoed that view and added that gas at $4 a gallon is possible this summer. “We’ve gone from a worrying situation for gasoline to one that is quite alarming,” Mr. Sundstrom said.Oil prices are unlikely to drop anytime soon, analysts said. Barclays Capital recently increased its long-term prediction, saying prices could reach $137 a barrel in 2015, up from a previous target of $93 a barrel.“The remorseless move up in long-run prices has not yet fully played out,” Barclays analysts said in a note to investors.While demand keeps growing, producers are struggling to catch up. They are not replacing the oil they are pumping out of the ground fast enough because of restrictions on access to fields, as well as rising costs. Meanwhile, demand in China, India and the Middle East is expected to push oil consumption up by more than one million barrels a day, each year, for the next decade.“An oil crisis is coming in the next 10 years,” John B. Hess, the chairman of the Hess Corporation, said at a recent conference held by Cambridge Energy Research Associates. “It’s not a matter of demand. It’s not a matter of supplies. It’s both.”'"

"'08-02-27,'1','PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — Pedro Martínez knows he has a lot to prove with the Mets this season, knows that the one solid month he had last September has not answered all the questions about whether he can successfully return from rotator cuff surgery almost 17 months ago.That is why Martínez, who is in the final year of a four-year, $53 million contract, will not ask the Mets for an extension if he is pitching effectively and feeling strong later in the season. But, if the Mets want to begin a dialogue with Martínez, he will embrace the discussion.“If they approach me, that’s fine,” he said. “But I’m very content, very satisfied with the way that they’ve treated me here. They have my respect regardless of whether they offer me or not or I have to go somewhere else.”After Martínez said the Mets would know “when to do it” and “if they want to do it,” he playfully said that he would be fishing from 6 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. in the off-season and that they would need to leave him lots of messages. But then he turned serious again.“I’m going to have to prove that I’m worth another contract,” Martínez said. “And that’s being realistic. I’m not going to hide anything. But at the same time, I feel like I’m committed to pitching and doing for this team what I didn’t do last year. They probably needed me more than I thought.”'"

"'08-02-27,'1','Mr. Bloomberg said that the sales of counterfeit goods cheated the city of $1 billion in sales tax a year and led to money laundering and bloody turf wars. “It is organized crime,” he said.In a statement, Terranova Properties, the owner’s managing agent, said: “We have been working together with New York City and will continue to cooperate to the utmost degree with the New York City Police Department and the mayor’s office to remedy this situation on Canal Street.” The assistant who read the statement, Leah Terranova, declined to comment further.Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said that in 2007, counterfeit goods worth $25 million were seized throughout the city, about three times more than in the previous year.There were no arrests on Tuesday, but as the investigation proceeds, there could be criminal charges. Through the civil suit, a temporary restraining order was imposed to keep the buildings shuttered until the owner can prove there is no more illegal activity. The owner must also pay a fine of $1,000 a day from the first official notice of illegal activity — in this case, in early January. The city will also ask the State Supreme Court to impose other fines, said Jason Post, a spokesman for the mayor.The three buildings that were closed have multiple addresses for the shops within them: 224-230 Canal Street; 232 Canal Street, 234-238 Canal Street; 106 Baxter Street; 112-116 Walker Street; 118 Walker Street; 120-124 Walker Street and 152-156 Centre Street. Some of the shops share an address.The undercover operation started nearly two months ago as a joint effort between the New York Police Department and the mayor’s Office of Special Enforcement.They gained entry using saws and bolt cutters and seized hundreds of items. The city filed the civil lawsuit using the nuisance abatement law against four trustees of the Terranova estate: Robert Becht, Edward T. Borg, George Terranova and Carl Terranova, said Mr. Post, the mayor’s spokesman.Shari C. Hyman, director of the Office of Special Enforcement, said that the city had filed civil lawsuits against the Terranova owners of 234-238 Canal Street in 1999 and against 232 Canal Street in 2003, but that despite the family’s agreement to try to curb the counterfeit sales, they resumed.In late 2006, eight makers of luxury goods, including Burberry, Givenchy and Marc Jacobs, sued a trust created by the Terranova estate in Federal District Court in Manhattan in connection with six properties in Chinatown, asking, among other things, that the tenants of those buildings be evicted. A lawyer for the estate, Paul Kurland, said a short time later that the parties had settled, and said they were doing their best to rid the buildings of vendors of counterfeit items.Mr. Kurland could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.“It was the owners’ unwillingness to comply with repeated attempts to get counterfeiting activity out of the buildings that made us decide to go against them in this aggressive action,” Ms. Hyman said, speaking about the Tuesday events.'"
"'08-02-27,'1','DETROIT — Despite big losses at the auto and mortgage lender GMAC, General Motors is confident that its partner, the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, can fix the troubled financing business.G.M.’s chief financial officer, Frederick A.

"'08-02-27,'1','Neither did Mr. McCain, who spoke for about a half hour. Afterward, however, Mr. McCain held a scheduled news conference and immediately addressed the comments, evidently informed about them by his aides.“It’s my understanding,” he said, “that before I came in here a person who was on the program before I spoke made some disparaging remarks about my two colleagues in the Senate, Senator Obama and Senator Clinton. I have repeatedly stated my respect for Senator Obama and Senator Clinton, that I will treat them with respect. I will call them Senator. We will have a respectful debate, as I have said on hundreds of occasions. I regret any comments that may have been made about these two individuals who are honorable Americans.”Responding to questions from reporters, Mr. McCain said he did not hear what Mr. Cunningham had said; when he arrived, Mr. Portman was on stage, he said.“Whatever suggestion that was made that was any way disparaging to the integrity, character, honesty of either Senator Obama or Senator Clinton was wrong,” Mr. McCain said. “I condemn it, and if I have any responsibility, I will take the responsibility, and I apologize for it.”Mr. McCain called Mr. Obama a “man of integrity” and said he was someone he had come to know “pretty well and I admire.”He also said that it was not appropriate to invoke Mr. Obama’s middle name.“I absolutely repudiate such comments,” Mr. McCain said. “It will never happen again.”Mr. McCain was criticized in November when he failed to admonish a woman in South Carolina who, in asking a question about Mrs. Clinton, referred to her as a “bitch.”Mr. Obama’s middle name, which is Muslim in origin, comes from his late father, Barack Hussein Obama Sr., a Kenyan. Mr. Cunningham, like some other conservative commentators, uses it frequently when referring to Mr. Obama, apparently to draw attention to his ancestry. Mr. Obama has been dogged by whispered rumors that he is a Muslim; he is a Christian.Bill Burton, a spokesman for Mr. Obama, issued a statement later in the day, saying: “We appreciate Senator McCain’s remarks. It is a sign that if there is a McCain-Obama general election, it can be intensely competitive, but the candidates will attempt to keep it respectful and focused on issues.”Mr. Cunningham later posted a video on his Web site, asserting his right to free speech and referring to Mr. Obama as a “hack Chicago politician from the Daley political machine.” He did not use Mr. Obama’s middle name.He added: “I’m angry at McCain. Why would John McCain repudiate me? I’ve been able to unite McCain and Obama against me. I might become a supporter of Ralph Nader.”The contretemps between Mr. McCain and Mr. Cunningham continued well into the evening, when Mr. Cunningham then announced that he was going to endorse Hillary Rodham Clinton. He also said, contrary to Mr. McCain’s claim that he had never met Mr. Cunningham, that he had encountered the senator at an earlier Cincinnati fund-raiser. Mr. Cunningham said on CNN that he had twice met Mr. McCain, though he did not explain the circumstances.Late Tuesday, the McCain campaign acknowledged that the men might have met.“Senator McCain gave an honest answer,” said Mark Salter, one of Mr. McCain’s senior advisers. “He doesn’t recall meeting him. He’s at thousands of events. If Mr. Cunningham said he was at the fund-raiser, perhaps he was. He was one of 100,000 people McCain has shaken hands with this year.”'"
"'08-02-27,'1','With public financing for the primaries, candidates are eligible for millions of dollars in matching money from a taxpayer fund but must abide by strict spending caps until the party conventions. As a result, the dispute has the potential of dealing Mr. McCain a crippling blow in his ability to compete financially against his Democratic opponent.Mr. McCain sought public financing when his campaign was struggling and on the verge of bankruptcy, but now he is the presumptive Republican nominee and money is coming in.Democratic officials are hinging their arguments on two issues. The first is a $4 million loan Mr. McCain secured last fall to keep his campaign afloat.To pull out of the public financing system, a candidate cannot have used the matching money as collateral in securing the loan, but the Democratic National Committee said in its complaint that documents made clear that Mr. McCain did use it in applying for the line of credit.Mr. McCain’s campaign, however, produced a letter Monday from lawyers for the bank that provided the loan stating he had not used the promise of matching money as collateral.Second, the officials object to the way Mr. McCain used his certification for federal matching money to get on the ballot in states like Ohio and Delaware. That certification allowed him to bypass the signature collection usually required to get on the ballot, and saved the campaign money — which should bar him from withdrawing from the system, the Democrats say.Trevor Potter, a lawyer for Mr. McCain, said that the law in Ohio allowed campaigns to get on the ballot either by relying on the certification for public financing or collecting signatures, but that nothing prevented Mr. McCain from being able to withdraw from public financing.Complicating matters, the Federal Election Commission, which normally has six commissioners, has four vacancies, rendering it unable to rule on disputes.Kenneth Gross, a lawyer in Washington who advises Democrats and Republicans on campaign finance, said it sounded as if Mr. McCain’s campaign had been “tiptoeing through the legalese” and “may have avoided running afoul of the law.”Even if Mr. McCain winds up being wrong and the election commission is fully staffed, Mr. Gross said it was unlikely that it would force Mr. McCain to pay back all the money he had spent beyond the spending cap.“The magnitude of it almost makes it impossible for the F.E.C. to do anything,” he said.'"
"'08-02-27,'1','BANGKOK — Seventeen months after being ousted in a military coup, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was set to return to Thailand on Thursday, officials close to him said Tuesday.With the installation of a sympathetic government that replaced a military junta, Mr. Thaksin was prepared to face corruption charges that have been filed against him, Foreign Minister Noppadol Pattama said.Mr. Thaksin was removed in a nonviolent military coup in September 2006 while he was abroad and has mostly lived in London since then, although he has traveled often to Asia and has remained active behind the scenes in Thai politics.Mr. Thaksin has not publicly announced his plans, but on Tuesday his official Web site posted a notice to his supporters to greet him at the airport at 9 a.m. on Thursday.“Welcome home Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra whom we love, miss and have been waiting to return for more than a year,” the Web site said.'"
"'08-02-27,'1','WASHINGTON — Senior nonpolitical staff members at the Environmental Protection Agency wrote an impassioned plea for a former agency chief to deliver to the current E.P.A. administrator about an important decision on greenhouse gas emissions from cars, according to documents released Tuesday by a Senate committee.The “talking points” for use by William K. Reilly, the administrator from 1989 to 1993, in a conversation with the current E.P.A. leader, Stephen L. Johnson, ask of Mr. Johnson: “You have to find a way to get this done. If you cannot, you will face a pretty big personal decision about whether you are able to stay in the job under those circumstances.”The decision facing Mr. Johnson involved California’s request to set rules for the emissions, which were to be adopted by 16 other states as well. He rejected the request in December, saying that federal authority pre-empted state action. His decision on the standards, which were vigorously opposed by the auto industry, created a furor among state officials and environmental groups.The document by the senior E.P.A. staff members is unusual in its tone and in its very nature. Civil servants, who expect to have careers that stretch across several presidents and agency heads, work for the “politicals,” those appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, but they seldom work with ones whose terms are over.“This is a choice only you can make, but I ask you to think about the history and the future of the agency in making it,” the document said, adding that if Mr. Johnson denied the request, “I fear the credibility of the agency that we both love will be irreparably damaged.”The document was released Tuesday by Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, who wants the denial reversed. She said the draft, as well as internal agency e-mail messages she released, demonstrated that the E.P.A. was “in crisis.” Mr. Johnson’s decisions, she said, “went against the professional scientists and the professional legal experts.”'"
"'08-02-27,'1','The F.D.A. ordered stronger warnings on the drugs’ labels last year, after a flurry of studies suggested that the products, if used too aggressively, could worsen cancer conditions or hasten death. And Medicare sharply restricted reimbursement for the drugs when used to treat anemia caused by cancer chemotherapy.Sales of Aranesp, Amgen’s best-selling product, declined to $3.6 billion last year from $4.1 billion in 2006.One option that analysts expect to be discussed at the meeting in March would be to bar the use of the drugs for specific types of cancer, like breast cancer and head and neck cancer. Another would be to delay treatment with the drugs until patients became more anemic than the current threshold, a change that would more closely match the Medicare reimbursement policy.A third option, which many analysts say is unlikely, would be for the F.D.A. to no longer authorize the drugs’ use in treating anemia caused by chemotherapy. The drugs would still be allowed to treat anemia caused by kidney disease.Jim Birchenough, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, estimated in a report on Monday that rescinding approval for chemotherapy-induced anemia would reduce Amgen’s sales of Aranesp by $1 billion a year. A change in the label to match the Medicare policy would cut them by $300 million.The new analysis on death risk, which could play into the discussions on March 13, combines data from 51 clinical trials involving 13,611 patients. The study also found a 57 percent increase in the risk of blood clots in veins, a known side effect of the drugs.Dr. Bennett, an oncologist and hematologist, said he did not think that the higher risk of death came from those blood clots. Rather, he said, there is evidence that the drugs, which are synthetic forms of a natural hormone called erythropoietin, directly stimulate the growth and spread of tumors. Amgen scientists dispute that explanation.Procrit, which Johnson & Johnson sells under license from Amgen, was approved for treatment of cancer patients in 1993, and Aranesp in 2002, based on their ability to reduce the need for blood transfusions. But the studies on which the approvals were based were not large and long enough to measure the effect on patients’ longevity.As a result, efforts have been made to pool the results of many smaller trials to look for safety problems.A meta-analysis published in 2004 by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international research group, found that patients who were given the drugs tended to live longer.But in recent years, some new clinical trials, aimed at showing that using the drugs at higher doses than indicated on the label would improve survival, found the opposite. As those studies were added to the compilations, the safety balance appeared to shift.A meta-analysis published in 2006 by the Cochrane Collaboration found an 8 percent higher risk of death among users of the drugs, but the result just missed being statistically significant. The analysis being published Wednesday adds some more recent studies and reaches statistical significance.That still leaves unclear whether the drugs are dangerous if used at the levels indicated on the label, a question that bedeviled an F.D.A. advisory committee last year and is likely to do so again in March.“We didn’t ask the right questions for 15 years,” Dr. Bennett said.'"
"'08-02-27,'1','By the time they had been fully spackled and bewigged, the models were barely recognizable. And this is one of the more demented aspects of the business: how after going to the trouble of selecting prized specimens from the global gene pool, what designers like best is to render their beauty invisible.Sometimes this takes the form of face-covering nylon headpieces that make the models’ heads look like sacks of blocks (Junya Watanabe) or funnel collars (Martin Margiela) that convey the impression that the wearer has fallen down a well. Sometimes it is just that big architectural eye.“She’s like a homing pigeon, this one,” Ms. McGrath said Monday, referring to the Brazilian Raquel Zimmermann, who currently holds the No. 1 position on the model-rating Web site Models.com. The passion that some people bring to reading the stock market index, others devote to this site. And weird as it may seem, there is a certain utility in a Web locale dedicated to charting the fortunes of people who are beautiful occupationally. Fashion is a consensus business, after all, based to a large extent on wholly subjective markers of taste. Vogue isn’t called that for nothing.“Raquel flies away,” Ms. McGrath said airily. “But she always comes back.”By that Ms. McGrath was indicating that Ms. Zimmermann had gone missing from this season from the catwalks in Milan. The reason was simple: her United States visa was due for renewal. She might also have meant, though, that although Ms. Zimmermann’s good looks are incontrovertible, she is an industry anomaly.A decade older, at 26, than most of the competition, she is proof that the immortal Heidi Klum-ism about being in fashion one day and out the next miscalculates the intervals of change. Ms. Zimmermann has been in the business since she was 16 and has had all the magazine covers and walked all the runways and shot all the campaigns and yet somehow manages to seem fresh again each season.“Why has she lasted so long?” a Vogue editor remarked on Tuesday (speaking anonymously, for fear of going off message and being banished to a job at a knitting catalog). “Maybe it’s that combination of a Nordic head on a Brazilian body.Fashion is a funny business, Ms. Zimmermann mused as the hairdresser Teddy Charles readied her mane at Dior. “People are always taking care of you, you have a car and driver 24 hours a day, they’re treating you like a star. You can lose yourself in the fantasy.”For a middle-class girl from the south of Brazil who had planned on becoming an architect, she suggested, the trick to achieving longevity has been perspective. “Absolutely, you can enjoy all the shows and the creative people and the fabulousness,” she said. “But in the end, you have to know how to go back to normal.”'"
"'08-02-27,'1','BEIJING — China said Tuesday that it would resume a human rights dialogue with the United States, in a move that appeared to be aimed at countering criticism from activists ahead of the Olympic Games here in August.Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice won agreement to restart the talks after discussions with Chinese officials here on Tuesday on the second leg of a three-nation tour that began in South Korea and will end in Japan on Thursday.But she said no date had been set for the next round.China suspended the exchanges in 2004 after the Bush administration sponsored an unsuccessful resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Commission attacking China’s human rights record.“We are ready to resume the human rights dialogue,” the Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, said at a news conference with Ms. Rice in Beijing, Reuters reported. “We are willing to have exchanges and interactions with the U.S. and other countries on human rights on a basis of mutual respect, equality and noninterference in each others’ internal affairs.”China is anxious to prevent critics and activists from linking its human rights record with the Olympic Games.'"
"'08-02-27,'1','The next day, high-school girls in miniskirts, Uggs and goose bumps stood outside Yolato on the Upper West Side, spooning up soft-serve. “We come here every day,” said Shira Cohen, a 10th-grader. “I start thinking about the toppings even before second period.”No wonder entrepreneurs, despite the freezing weather, are not waiting to stake a claim. Did the slight chill of the Yukon prevent the gold rush?“New York has many women, many young people, many Asian-Americans, and many people with a high income,” said Eric Yun, the United States president of Yogurberry, a Korean franchise with a new store on a busy strip of Jackson Heights, Queens. “All of those people love frozen yogurt.”Yogurberry, which follows the basic pattern of tart yogurt with healthy and not-so-healthy toppings, has outlets in Korea, Malaysia, China and Thailand, and is about to open in Syria and Dubai. The first Yogurberry opened in 2004; Red Mango appeared in Seoul in 2002; Pinkberry opened in West Hollywood in 2005. “There’s a lot of give and take in this business,” Mr. Yun said of the endless speculation over which of the oddly similar, warm, inviting yogurt chains with bright color schemes and Scandinavian design was the prototype.“It’s like fashion,” said Pinkberry’s founder, Young Lee. “One season, suddenly everyone is doing bell-bottoms, or boot cuts. It’s the nature of fashion and the nature of competition.” Mr. Lee, a 1989 graduate of Parsons, claims credit for the design elements that make the Pinkberry stores subtly appealing: the hanging lamps that look like big creamy swirls of yogurt; the bouncy pebble floors that make each store feel like a playground; the opportunity to pay $5 for a cup of frozen yogurt with blueberries and “to have a luxury experience, by sitting at a $500 table in a $350 chair, while you eat it,” Mr. Lee said. (Among the retailers he admires most, he said, are Apple, In-N-Out Burger, Target and Hermès.)As the chains are trickling in, a few visionary New Yorkers have already struck out on their own, convinced that they can build a better yogurt. (Most of the chains use a dehydrated yogurt formula that is rehydrated and churned in the store.)The most extremely artsy — even artisanal — rendition is \eks\, appropriately located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where the yogurt is made from scratch. “We start with gallons of low-fat milk, we inoculate it with the live cultures, and we sweeten it with a little organic sugar,” said the owner, Neo Kim.Mr. Kim also designed the cherry-red stencils that cover the space (“parlor” or “shop” being far too cozy to describe this echoing, Pop Art basement). Last weekend, a second \eks\ outlet began dispensing yogurt in Manhattan, inside a Beard Papa’s cream puff shop at 740 Broadway, near Astor Place, making the storefront one of New York’s many centers of Asian-dessert-youth-pop-culture.Helen Lee, a Brooklyn resident who graduated from the French Culinary Institute and cooked at Per Se and Jean Georges, is one of a group that opened Oko in Park Slope last summer. Oko focuses on eco-friendliness, with cups made of corn and spoons of potato starch, as well as on flavor. “Of course, we tasted the competitors’ before developing our own recipe,” she said. “Our yogurt is all natural, with lingering flavors and a clean finish, and it’s even locally sourced.” The yogurt Oko freezes is made by a Greek family-owned creamery in Queens, she said.Flurt, with outlets in Gramercy Park and Battery Park City, is New York’s first homegrown chain. Its nonfat formula appeals to the yogurt-is-lunch weight-loss crowd.Since the first frozen-yogurt craze of the 1980s, many New Yorkers have kept the flame alive, searching for a frozen treat that will magically combine the pure and satisfying taste of ice cream with the appetite-controlling qualities of diet drugs. Most of the early versions of frozen yogurt contained only a small amount of actual yogurt, according to the National Yogurt Association. But frozen yogurt can also be quite luxurious. Yogurt itself can have up to 9 percent milk fat. Both Ciao Bella and Il Laboratorio del Gelato, among New York’s best local ice-cream artisans, make wonderfully rich gelato flavored with plain yogurt.After the initial go-round, plain-flavor frozen yogurt was quickly eclipsed by new fakeries like Tofutti and Tasti D-Lite. But it never completely left the city. A small band of devotees would trade tips about the holdouts at Bloomingdale’s Forty Carrots, the cafe at Zabar’s, and a chain of suburban parlors called Last Licks.Apparently frozen yogurt spent its decades in exile well, mutating and gathering strength. Depending on whom you believe, this transformation may have taken place in the timeless gelaterias of Bologna, where a lone genius named Luciano Rabboni perfected the formula for yogurt-flavor gelato. (This is the Pinkberry creation legend.) Or it was bubbling up in the nascent youth-pop culture of Seoul, where the possibility of health benefits often fuels unstoppable food trends (Red Mango).But that perfect churn of air and water, cream and tang, sweet and sour is elusive, and subjective. Some like it fluffy; others, dense. Some find the tang of Pinkberry excessive, even aggressive; others say that yogurt without tang is just low-fat ice cream. The taste of a good plain yogurt is full of lactic acid, a natural byproduct of fermentation that also gives depth to the flavors of foods like Parmesan cheese and prosciutto. Some of the newfangled yogurts also add citric acid for flavor, lending a bright lemony flavor that is very appealing on top of the sweetness, dairy and lactic tang.Pinkberry’s yogurt is certainly more sour than that of Red Mango, but beyond that the distinctions become arcane, and often bogged down in calorie-counting, the odd flavors of sugar substitutes, and obscure health claims. (Red Mango boasts that there are more than 400 million live cultures in each gram; Yogurberry says that its yogurt has the lowest glycemic index on the block.)“Ultimately, it has to be about the taste of yogurt,” said Mr. Lee of Pinkberry’s recipe for success. “If the product didn’t back it up, Pinkberry would just be a furniture showroom.”'"
"'08-02-27,'1','Mr. Anderson said in the memo that Delta would “continue to look at strategic alternatives” while also pushing forward with the airline’s standalone plan. A spokeswoman, Betsy Talton, would not elaborate.Douglas Steenland, chief executive of Northwest, also sent a note to workers Tuesday, and he, too, took a cautious tone in addressing a merger, while not naming Delta.“We continue to believe that consolidation among the network carriers is inevitable,” Mr. Steenland said in the memo. Among other things, a merger would need to “provide greater long-term security and growth opportunities for our employees,” he added. “We continue to consider strategic alternatives based on these criteria.”An age mismatch raises the stakes in any melding of seniority lists, with the potential for junior pilots to leapfrog more senior ones and take away more lucrative and attractive assignments. The lists are used to decide who is a captain and who is a co-pilot, pay rates, work schedules, how big an airplane a pilot gets to fly, and who is laid off first in a downturn.“Seniority — it’s very sacred ground,” said Jack Stephan, who heads the Air Line Pilots Association local for the 2,700 pilots from the old US Airways side of that merger.Even if union leaders at Northwest and Delta agree to a seniority plan, clearing a path for the largest airline merger ever, the deal could be scuttled months later if rank-and-file pilots decide the plan treats them unfairly.A union spokeswoman for the 6,300 Delta pilots, Kelly Regus, declined to comment. Union officials for the 4,500 Northwest pilots did not return calls.The US Airways dispute shows how hard times in the industry — including pay cuts, lost pensions and longer work hours — have brought out the fratricidal tendencies of pilots.Each side, though represented by the same union, pushed seniority arrangements that would have put pilots on the other side toward the bottom of the list. They refused to compromise.And an arbitrator’s award last May favored the America West pilots, setting off a campaign to decertify the union that has gathered strong support from old US Airways pilots, who outnumber their America West colleagues.If a new union, the US Airline Pilots Association, wins an election starting next month to represent pilots at the merged airline, it said it would try to scrap the arbitrator’s award and install a seniority list based on date of hire. That would heavily favor the older pilots from the old US Airways side.If that happens, said John McIlvenna, who heads the union local for the 1,500 former America West pilots, “we will be in all-out warfare.”Regardless of the outcome, US Airways and its pilots face months, or even years, of litigation over the seniority list.This turmoil makes clear why Delta and Northwest management want a seniority deal before they announce a merger. If a deal is made, it could prompt other airline mergers, but each would have to address pilot seniority.The Delta pilots are younger, on average, in large part because more than 1,100 Delta pilots took early retirement in 2005 to collect lump-sum pensions before the carrier’s bankruptcy led it to terminate its pension plan.So, a merged list based strictly on date of hire would favor Northwest pilots. A list that simply shuffles in the two groups — one from Northwest, one from Delta, and so on — would put younger Delta pilots ahead of older Northwest colleagues.The union also uses what are known as fences to protect groups of pilots from being displaced. A portion of the fleet, say, can be reserved for a set number of years to be piloted by those who currently fly those planes.But the US Airways case suggests that making a seniority deal — and making one that sticks — will be difficult.When US Airways and America West merged in the fall of 2005, pilot officials from both sides expressed optimism that seniority could be worked out in a matter of months. But a year of direct talks failed. A mediator in October 2006 could not bring them together. So they entered binding arbitration before a panel led by George Nicolau, an 82-year-old New York arbitrator with experience in seniority disputes.“All of us on the board kept saying, ‘Sit down, work this through,’ ” Mr. Nicolau said. But he added: “The intransigence worked all the way through. We simply couldn’t shake them.”The US Airways pilots felt that after two bankruptcies and lost pensions, they needed to make up ground, and so they proposed a list that had 900 or so US Airways pilots atop it and that would have placed some furloughed US Airways pilots above active America West pilots.The America West pilots, meanwhile, argued that their company saved US Airways from liquidation. So they wanted a list shuffling the two groups together, which essentially ignored date of hire. And they wanted hundreds of US Airways pilots at the bottom of the list so that America West pilots would be insulated from layoffs.“Neither side blinked,” said Mr. Stephan, the union chief from the US Airways side.The arbitrator’s award put 423 US Airways pilots at the top, to keep them on international routes they coveted, but mostly shuffled the two lists together, a huge win for the much younger America West pilots.The US Airways pilots sued to overturn the decision. But a splinter group formed US Airline Pilots and quickly gathered enough authorization votes to force a union election. If those who signed authorization cards vote for the new union, it would have enough votes to oust the Air Line Pilots Association and represent both old US Airways pilots, known as the East, and America West pilots.“The Nicolau award enraged the East pilots,” said Scott Theuer, an officer of the group seeking to oust the old union. “We have a lot to recoup.” The group said, however, that it would offer fences to America West pilots to preserve their current jobs.The new group is led by Stephen Bradford, 54, a US Airways pilot since 1986. Like many, he has been promoted to captain and twice bounced back to first officer status as the airline shrank. The last time, between pay-level cuts and losing his captain’s status, his pay was reduced by more than $100,000. His colleague, Mr. Theuer, said: “The East pilots had lost so much over the years. Seniority was all we had left.”'"
"'08-02-27,'1','PARIS — A senior White House official on Tuesday outlined a new tactic aimed at convincing a skeptical Europe that the Bush administration would support a meaningful agreement to limit global warming.The official, James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said the United States could accept a binding treaty if it included mandatory steps by China and other big developing countries as well.An acceptable pact, he said, would have all the world’s economic powerhouses, established or emerging, agree to a long-term goal for deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions at some point, and commit to take measurable, verifiable steps domestically in the short term.The new approach reflected a shift in tone and language by the Bush administration on climate negotiations. Instead of focusing on what it would reject, the statements focused on what the United States would accept. And echoing language Mr. Bush made in his State of the Union address, they indicated that the United States was not intractably opposed to binding commitments.Mr. Connaughton and other American officials are capital-hopping in Europe this week in an effort to gain momentum for climate talks organized last year by the United States among the countries responsible for the brunt of greenhouse-gas emissions. President Bush has pledged to forge an agreement on a long-term goal for emissions cuts and short-term steps among those countries by the end of 2008.'"

"'08-02-28,'0','Dell has said it will not give investors forecasts of its earnings for the current quarter or the fiscal year.The company also said it would spend at least $1 billion to repurchase its shares in the current quarter.Dell said net income in the fourth quarter included 11 cents a share in one-time charges related to acquisition costs, severance and facility closures, other one-time expenses. The company said the year-ago fourth quarter profits were affected by 11 cents a share in charges.Wall Street analysts have expressed skepticism that Dell is headed in the right direction as it seeks to transform from a business-centric computer maker to one that puts more emphasis on selling to consumers — through retail channels.“The sentiment is pretty negative,” said Chris Whitmore, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, who has a buy rating on the stock.Mr. Whitmore said that at conference call with investors in November the company outlined five specific areas of focus — consumer market, large enterprises, small business, emerging markets and notebook computers. But Mr. Whitmore said the company did not give sufficient detail to satisfy Wall Street about how it would improve its effectiveness in those areas.The bears put a stronger point on it.“There is confusion inside the Dell message right now,” said Shaw Wu, an analyst with American Technology Research, who has a hold rating on the stock. “The company is going through an identity crisis. They haven’t quite figured out what they want to do and they haven’t articulated it to the street.”Mr. Wu said that the problem he sees derives from a fundamental contradiction inside Dell: on one hand, it wants to take on new markets with new products, on the other hand, it wants to keep its costs down.“It’s a contradiction,” he said. “All those initiatives sound nice, but they all cost money.”For his part, Mr. Wu believes that Dell can afford to spend a little money because it has a relatively low cost structure already. But others on Wall Street believe that Dell must continue to push down its costs.Mr. Whitmore said the company’s operating costs are 13 percent of revenue, but should be 12 percent or 11 percent. “The cost structure is pretty burdened,” the analyst said, noting that among other things, he would like to see streamlined marketing in various regions around the world.More broadly, a good example of the kind of challenge faced by Dell relates to its efforts to expand overseas. At present, about 40 percent of Dell’s business comes from overseas. By comparison, around 70 percent of Hewlett-Packard’s sales come from overseas. The diversity cushions H.P. against a decline or a slowdown in a particular region.Dell said sales were up 16 percent outside the United States and accounted for 49 percent of the company’s total revenues in the fourth quarter. In Brazil, Russia, India and China, collectively, revenue grew 36 percent and unit shipments increased 50 percent, from the year-ago quarter. In its Asia Pacific and Japan region, revenue grew 28 percent on a 41 percent increase in shipments.But such diversification costs money, analysts note. In the fourth quarter, Dell announced a partnership to sell in China through a major retailer, Gome. That provides a new channel for Dell, but also one that — unlike its direct-to-consumer sales channels in the past — requires the company to pay a cut to the retailer. In addition, Dell faces a tough marketing war against other PC makers who are fighting with discounts or added features to win consumers in the emerging markets.To be sure, Dell remains a juggernaut in the industry, at home and abroad. But its growth has lagged that of its major competitors. According to Gartner, a market research firm, Dell’s shipments of personal computers rose 17 percent in the fourth quarter over a year ago. Gartner said H.P.’s shipments grew 23.2 percent, Acer’s 22.9 percent, and Lenovo’s 21.5 percent.Another challenge for Dell is in the services market. The problem for Dell, industry analysts said, is that the kinds of services it is likely most able to provide are the relatively low-margin ones — like providing tech support or fixing broken computers.“They’re not likely to try to take on I.B.M. and Accenture in consulting,” Mr. Whitmore said.There remains a debate on Wall Street whether Mr. Dell, the founder who returned to lead the company early last year, is the right man to take the company back to its former glory. Some analysts said that the changing market — the new emphasis on retail channels, for example — should invite a different and new kind of leader than Mr. Dell.But others assert that what he has done once he can do again.“He was the guy for 25 years and the market changed several times in those first 25 years,” Mr. Whitmore said, “It’s not like he’s applying the same formula. He’s making some pretty significant changes.”'"
"'08-02-28,'0','Senator John McCain stepped up his critique of Senator Barack Obama on Thursday by accusing him for the second consecutive day of a willingness to hand over Iraq to Al Qaeda, as the Democratic contenders released record-breaking fund-raising figures.At a news conference at Hobby Airport in Houston, where Mr. McCain was endorsed by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Mr. McCain opened with a formulation of why he contended Mr. Obama is not ready to be commander in chief.“On the issue of my differences with Senator Obama on Iraq, I want to make it very clear: This is not about decisions that were made in the past,” Mr. McCain said. “This is about decisions that a president will have to make about the future in Iraq. And a decision to unilaterally withdraw from Iraq will lead to chaos.”Mr. McCain, the likely Republican nominee for president, was reacting to Mr. Obama’s response to a hypothetical question in a debate in Cleveland on Tuesday night, when Mr. Obama said that although he intended to withdraw American forces as quickly as possible, he reserved the right to send troops back if Al Qaeda were forming a base in Iraq.“Al Qaeda is there now,” Mr. McCain said in Houston, with a tone of belittlement in his voice. “So to state that somehow if Al Qaeda were there that he would consider going back militarily is really a remarkable comment, and I don’t think displays an understanding of the size of the threat and what’s at stake in Iraq.”'"
"'08-02-28,'0','Either way, said Susan Urahn, the center’s managing director, “we aren’t really getting the return in public safety from this level of incarceration.”But Paul Cassell, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former federal judge, said the Pew report considered only half of the cost-benefit equation and overlooked the “very tangible benefits — lower crime rates.”In the past 20 years, according the Federal Bureau of Investigation, violent crime rates fell by 25 percent, to 464 for every 100,000 people in 2007 from 612.5 in 1987.“While we certainly want to be smart about who we put into prisons,” Professor Cassell said, “it would be a mistake to think that we can release any significant number of prisoners without increasing crime rates. One out of every 100 adults is behind bars because one out of every 100 adults has committed a serious criminal offense.”Ms. Urahn said the nation cannot afford the incarceration rate documented in the report. “We tend to be a country in which incarceration is an easy response to crime,” she said. “Being tough on crime is an easy position to take, particularly if you have the money. And we did have the money in the ‘80s and ‘90s.”Now, with fewer resources available, the report said, “prison costs are blowing a hole in state budgets.” On average, states spend almost 7 percent on their budgets on corrections, trailing only healthcare, education and transportation.In 2007, according to the National Association of State Budgeting Officers, states spent $44 billion in tax dollars on corrections. That is up from $10.6 billion in 1987, a 127 increase once adjusted for inflation. With money from bonds and the federal government included, total state spending on corrections last year was $49 billion. By 2011, the report said, states are on track to spend an additional $25 billion.It cost an average of $23,876 dollars to imprison someone in 2005, the most recent year for which data were available. But state spending varies widely, from $45,000 a year in Rhode Island to $13,000 in Louisiana.The cost of medical care is growing by 10 percent annually, the report said, and will accelerate as the prison population ages.About one in nine state government employees works in corrections, and some states are finding it hard to fill those jobs. California spent more than $500 million on overtime alone in 2006.The number of prisoners in California dropped by 4,000 last year, making Texas’s prison system the nation’s largest, at about 172,000. But the Texas legislature last year approved broad changes to the corrections system there, including expansions of drug treatment programs and drug courts and revisions to parole practices.“Our violent offenders, we lock them up for a very long time — rapists, murderers, child molestors,” said John Whitmire, a Democratic state senator from Houston and the chairman of the state senate’s criminal justice committee. “The problem was that we weren’t smart about nonviolent offenders. The legislature finally caught up with the public.”He gave an example.“We have 5,500 D.W.I offenders in prison,” he said, including people caught driving under the influence who had not been in an accident. “They’re in the general population. As serious as drinking and driving is, we should segregate them and give them treatment.”The Pew report recommended diverting nonviolent offenders away from prison and using punishments short of reincarceration for minor or technical violations of probation or parole. It also urged states to consider earlier release of some prisoners.Before the recent changes in Texas, Mr. Whitmire said, “we were recycling nonviolent offenders.”'"

The police discovered a suitcase full of pornography, a flag bearing a swastika hung in a closet and more than a half dozen weapons after finding the agent, Mark Juvette, dead. Mr. Juvette, 40, was an agent with ICE’s Dallas Office of Detention and Removal, which transports detainees, manages them while in custody and deports illegal immigrants.'"
"'08-02-28,'0','This latest bill focuses on neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick and Harlem, where a paucity of supermarkets makes many residents rely on bodegas for food purchases. A 2006 health department survey found that only 20 to 40 percent of bodegas in those neighborhoods carried apples, oranges and bananas and that only 2 to 6 percent stocked leafy green vegetables.“Our bill targets neighborhoods where existing businesses have been unable to fully bridge the health gap and sell fruits and vegetables,” Ms. Quinn said, adding that the bill would help save lives.The measure had the backing of antihunger and child-advocacy groups, and when it was introduced it appeared to have strong support on the Council. But support began to waver amid heavy lobbying from the retail food industry, leading to a flurry of late changes and compromises.Among them, the administration reduced the number of carts from 1,500 to 1,000 and dropped 9 of the 43 police precincts in which the vendors would be allowed to operate. One of those precincts dropped, the 50th in the Bronx, which includes Riverdale and Kingsbridge, where there are already numerous neighborhood grocers that offer fresh produce, was crucial to winning the swing vote of Councilman Oliver Koppell in moving the bill out of committee.Mr. Koppell, one of the bill’s original sponsors, expressed the concerns of many council members when they learned that neighborhoods were targeted based on consumption rather than supply. Put simply, neighborhoods where more than 15 percent of residents said they had not eaten fruits or vegetables in the last 24 hours made the list, regardless of how many area stores offered fresh produce.“I think it’s important to have these green carts where supply is really not available, and it’s hard to say whether these consumption numbers are the best way of gauging this or not,” Mr. Koppell said.Sung Soo Kim, president of the Korean-American Small Business Service Center of New York, said he applauded the spirit of the measure. “It’s the execution that’s wrong,” he said. He and other industry advocates said the city should identify neighborhoods where fresh fruits and vegetables were not available before deciding where to place vendors.Mr. Kim added that the bill was unfair to Korean-American vendors who since the 1970s have become part of the fabric of the city, selling fruits and vegetables in low-income and high-crime neighborhoods where other businesses often hesitate to go. Korean-Americans make up about 1,200 of the city’s nearly 2,300 greengrocers, Mr. Kim said.Councilman John C. Liu of Queens, who led a protest by 100 Korean-American business owners at City Hall on Monday, urged that the concept be tested with one or two vendors to see if demand increased.“Where do we have an example where increasing supply actually increases demand?” Mr. Liu said. “That is backwards voodoo economics. It doesn’t work.”Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the city’s health commissioner, said that consumption data was used because it was reliable and available. Compiling reliable data on retailers that sell a proper variety of quality fruits and vegetables, at affordable prices, was much more complex, he said.The consumption data also corresponded to maps showing neighborhoods with the highest rates of obesity and diabetes.“This is not going to end the obesity epidemic,” Dr. Frieden said, “but it is an important step to increase access to healthy food in the communities that need it most.”'"
"'08-02-28,'0','In all, Fordham has lost 33 consecutive games, with its last victory on Feb. 4, 2006, against Duquense. Perhaps the only relief for the Rams is that they have time to avoid breaking the N.C.A.A. record of 58 consecutive losses, set by Long Island University from 1987 to 1989.Even in the face of months of defeat, Andruzzi continues to convey an air of relentless positivity and has tried to lower expectations. This, she insists, is the inevitable nadir of what she considers a monumental rebuilding process for a perennial losing program. The Rams honored only one departing senior Wednesday night — forward Beth Troutt, who is averaging less than 5 points a game — and have lost several players to injuries. They dressed eight players Wednesday night. Their leading scorer, Megan Mahoney, is a freshman.“We cannot match the talent of some of our competitors,” Andruzzi said. “I’m not going to beat up these kids.”In a telephone interview Wednesday, Fordham’s athletic director, Frank McLaughlin, insisted that Andruzzi, a Staten Island native and veteran of the women’s basketball scene as a coach, administrator and broadcaster, would return next season. She is in the second year of a five-year contract.“Oh, absolutely,” McLaughlin said of Andruzzi, who went 3-25 in her first season. “That’s not even been discussed or thought of.”McLaughlin acknowledged that several followers of the program had made anonymous criticisms of the losing streak and of Andruzzi’s coaching methods on message boards. But he insisted he had seen no evidence to validate the complaints. He pointed to the career of the former football coach Dave Clawson, who went 0-11 in his first year at Fordham before going 10-3 in 2002. Clawson moved on to Richmond, and he recently became the offensive coordinator at Tennessee.“I think we can see the light at the end of the tunnel,” McLaughlin said.Still, the weaknesses of this season’s team are glaring, even to Andruzzi. Fordham came into this game shooting 35 percent from the field, and managed only 29.6 percent last night. It had been outrebounded by an average of more than 10 a game (it was by 50-31 last night), and had twice as many turnovers as assists (19 turnovers and 8 assists against Charlotte).Despite those statistical deficiencies, the Rams have remained competitive in several games. In addition to the two overtime losses, Fordham fell by 6 points to Monmouth, by 8 to Troy, by 6 to Longwood, by 9 to LaSalle, and by 2 to Massachusetts and to Rhode Island.“We’re fine,” Andruzzi said. “It’s the people on the outside who saying, ‘You’re losing, how are your kids feeling?’ They’re fine. The kids are fine. It’s most important that people leave them alone.”'"
"'08-02-28,'0','But given mounting interest, the campaign recently asked Theodore B. Olson, a former solicitor general now advising Mr. McCain, to prepare a detailed legal analysis. “I don’t have much doubt about it,” said Mr. Olson, who added, though, that he still needed to finish his research.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and one of Mr. McCain’s closest allies, said it would be incomprehensible to him if the son of a military member born in a military station could not run for president.“He was posted there on orders from the United States government,” Mr. Graham said of Mr. McCain’s father. “If that becomes a problem, we need to tell every military family that your kid can’t be president if they take an overseas assignment.”The phrase “natural born” was in early drafts of the Constitution. Scholars say notes of the Constitutional Convention give away little of the intent of the framers. Its origin may be traced to a letter from John Jay to George Washington, with Jay suggesting that to prevent foreigners from becoming commander in chief, the Constitution needed to “declare expressly” that only a natural-born citizen could be president.Ms. Duggin and others who have explored the arcane subject in depth say legal argument and basic fairness may indeed be on the side of Mr. McCain, a longtime member of Congress from Arizona. But multiple experts and scholarly reviews say the issue has never been definitively resolved by either Congress or the Supreme Court.Ms. Duggin favors a constitutional amendment to settle the matter. Others have called on Congress to guarantee that Americans born outside the national boundaries can legitimately see themselves as potential contenders for the Oval Office.“They ought to have the same rights,” said Don Nickles, a former Republican senator from Oklahoma who in 2004 introduced legislation that would have established that children born abroad to American citizens could harbor presidential ambitions without a legal cloud over their hopes. “There is some ambiguity because there has never been a court case on what ‘natural-born citizen’ means.”Mr. McCain’s situation is different from those of the current governors of California and Michigan, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jennifer M. Granholm, who were born in other countries and were first citizens of those nations, rendering them naturalized Americans ineligible under current interpretations. The conflict that could conceivably ensnare Mr. McCain goes more to the interpretation of “natural born” when weighed against intent and decades of immigration law.Mr. McCain is not the first person to find himself in these circumstances. The last Arizona Republican to be a presidential nominee, Barry Goldwater, faced the issue. He was born in the Arizona territory in 1909, three years before it became a state. But Goldwater did not win, and the view at the time was that since he was born in a continental territory that later became a state, he probably met the standard.It also surfaced in the 1968 candidacy of George Romney, who was born in Mexico, but again was not tested. The former Connecticut politician Lowell P. Weicker Jr., born in Paris, sought a legal analysis when considering the presidency, an aide said, and was assured he was eligible. Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. was once viewed as a potential successor to his father, but was seen by some as ineligible since he had been born on Campobello Island in Canada. The 21st president, Chester A. Arthur, whose birthplace is Vermont, was rumored to have actually been born in Canada, prompting some to question his eligibility.Quickly recognizing confusion over the evolving nature of citizenship, the First Congress in 1790 passed a measure that did define children of citizens “born beyond the sea, or out of the limits of the United States to be natural born.” But that law is still seen as potentially unconstitutional and was overtaken by subsequent legislation that omitted the “natural-born” phrase.Mr. McCain’s citizenship was established by statutes covering the offspring of Americans abroad and laws specific to the Canal Zone as Congress realized that Americans would be living and working in the area for extended periods. But whether he qualifies as natural-born has been a topic of Internet buzz for months, with some declaring him ineligible while others assert that he meets all the basic constitutional qualifications — a natural-born citizen at least 35 years of age with 14 years of residence.“I don’t think he has any problem whatsoever,” said Mr. Nickles, a McCain supporter. “But I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if somebody is going to try to make an issue out of it. If it goes to court, I think he will win.”Lawyers who have examined the topic say there is not just confusion about the provision itself, but uncertainty about who would have the legal standing to challenge a candidate on such grounds, what form a challenge could take and whether it would have to wait until after the election or could be made at any time.In a paper written 20 years ago for the Yale Law Journal on the natural-born enigma, Jill Pryor, now a lawyer in Atlanta, said that any legal challenge to a presidential candidate born outside national boundaries would be “unpredictable and unsatisfactory.”“If I were on the Supreme Court, I would decide for John McCain,” Ms. Pryor said in a recent interview. “But it is certainly not a frivolous issue.”'"
"'08-02-28,'0','“Microsoft was the first company in 50 years of E.U. competition policy that the commission has had to fine for failure to comply with an antitrust decision,” Ms. Kroes said in a statement. “I hope that today’s decision closes a dark chapter in Microsoft’s record of noncompliance with the commission’s March 2004 decision.”Heike Schweitzer, professor of competition law at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, said the high penalty “can only be understood as a reaction to a behavior by Microsoft.”She added that the commission interpreted it as “a blatant circumvention of the rules it imposed, and as a strong signal that, under such conditions, the commission will go close to the limits in order to provide for effective deterrence.”Last Thursday, Microsoft published 30,000 pages of previously secret software code for the Windows operating system on its Web site. The company called the move a significant concession toward greater openness and compatibility with competitors. The commission greeted that news coolly, noting that Microsoft had made “at least four similar statements” in the past.Microsoft said it was reviewing the commission’s action. It added that the fines were “about the past issues that have been resolved.”While the fine closes this chapter of the commission’s dispute with Microsoft, the company has other pending matters before the commission. The commission is examining whether the bundling of Internet Explorer into Microsoft Windows has unfairly excluded competitors from the Web browser market. It will also investigate whether Microsoft withheld essential information from companies that wanted to make products compatible with its ubiquitous software, including the Office word processing and spreadsheet programs.Ms. Kroes, in her comments, scarcely sought to disguise her annoyance with Microsoft. Her actions also appeared to end any hope Microsoft might have entertained that it was entering a new era of cooperation with Ms. Kroes.Rapprochement seemed to be possible after Microsoft agreed in October to fall into line with the 2004 decision. Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive, agreed to do so after meeting Ms. Kroes in a restaurant near her home north of The Hague. But on Wednesday, Ms. Kroes underlined how little trust she had in Microsoft.“I can remember four times when, if you were naïve, you could have thought everything was fixed,” Ms. Kroes said. “This didn’t seem to be the reality. They have to deliver and implement.”The decision in March 2004 required Microsoft to disclose within 120 days information that would allow rival vendors to interoperate with the Windows system. European antitrust officials said the royalties and patent fees the company sought for use of the data were excessive.Ms. Kroes said the fine was calculated based on the fact that Microsoft was in breach of the commission’s order for 488 days. It represented 60 percent of the maximum $2.25 billion that the commission could have imposed, she said. (The dollar amount of the fines, which were levied in euros, have been converted using the exchange rates that then prevailed.) The commission had already fined Microsoft more than $600 million at the time of the 2004 ruling, and more than $350 million in July 2006 for failing to comply with a requirement that it license network communications technology.Ms. Schweitzer, the law professor, said the amount of the fine Wednesday was striking given the nature of the issue — a ruling that royalty pricing should be reasonable.“I am surprised that they have imposed such a high penalty over such a vague and difficult concept as reasonable pricing,” Ms. Schweitzer said, “although the difference between the royalties originally charged by Microsoft and the one ultimately found to be reasonable is indeed significant.”Adam Collinson, a partner at the Eversheds law firm in Britain, said that Ms. Kroes’s “personal irritation at the Microsoft situation is palpable.” He added, however, that the situation may not have been straightforward for the corporation because “Microsoft had to make a judgment as to what levels of royalty would be regarded as reasonable for supply of the interoperability information.”Thomas Vinje, a spokesman for the European Committee for Interoperable Systems, a group including several Microsoft competitors, praised the decision.“Commissioner Kroes is to be commended for her perseverance over the last three years in the face of Microsoft’s foot-dragging and appeals,” he said.'"

The team doctor Stephen Adams said DeRosa was expected to return to Arizona on Sunday, be back on the field as early as Monday and could be ready to play in spring training games by March 8.“Theoretically, this should take care of the problem,” Adams said.WESTBROOK HELD OUT Cleveland Indians pitcher Jake Westbrook was scratched from his scheduled start in Thursday’s spring training opener against the Houston Astros because of soreness in his right arm. Westbrook said he did not expect the soreness to last.NO DEAL FOR PéREZ Neifi Pérez and the Colorado Rockies agreed to a $750,000 minor league contract on Tuesday, a good-will gesture that Manager Clint Hurdle called a lifeline for a popular player who has hit hard times. But the team later had second thoughts and decided against bringing him back. “We just didn’t feel like it was a good fit,” the assistant general manager Bill Geivett said.Pérez, the first major leaguer suspended for stimulants since they were banned before the 2006 season, has 18 games remaining on an 80-game suspension he received last season after testing positive for a third time.UP FOR SALE The chief executive of the Tribune Company said he would not hesitate to sell the naming rights to Wrigley Field.During an interview on CNBC, the C.E.O., Samuel Zell, said he planned to sell the Cubs and Wrigley separately and in his own time frame. He also disclosed that Major League Baseball had approved “four or six” potential ownership groups.The sale of the team has been delayed by Zell’s plan to sell the team and the stadium separately, and to have a state agency acquire and renovate Wrigley.'"
"'08-02-28,'0','Agent Corbett’s lawyer, Sean Chapman, said the agent, who has been assigned to administrative work, opened fire after Mr. Domínguez, angry and frustrated at the prospect of being arrested, had threatened to “crush his skull” with a stone.The accounts by his companions are unreliable, Mr. Chapman said, because they were “corrupted and influenced” by Mexican consular officials who met them afterward. The Cochise County Sheriff’s Department, he added, “did a horrible investigation.”Tensions along the border are increasing. Human rights groups on both sides accuse the Border Patrol of overly aggressive tactics. The agency says its officers face increasing violence from smugglers frustrated at tightened enforcement.The Border Patrol would not comment on the trial, a rare criminal prosecution of an agent for on-duty action. The only other agent in a recent murder trial was acquitted in 1994, also in Arizona.The agency recorded 987 assaults on agents in the last year, often with stones, almost three times the 2002 number.In the last two years, officials said, agents have killed 12 people and injured 116. A spokesman for the patrol, Ramon Rivera, said other data was not available.The patrol has said it tries to respond with nonlethal weapons when possible, but even that has caused friction. This month, Mexico demanded that the patrol stop firing tear gas into Tijuana neighborhoods to stop the throwing of stones at agents.The case of two other agents, Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos, continues to linger. They were convicted two years ago in federal court in Texas of assault, civil rights violations and other charges in the shooting of an unarmed drug smuggler. That case has been a cause célèbre for conservative commentators. They have argued in vain for a presidential pardon for the agents.About a dozen supporters of Agent Corbett demonstrated on Tuesday at the courthouse, carrying American flags and signs reading “Free Corbett” and “Support the Border Patrol.”Agent Corbett nodded and shook their hands as he walked in with his lawyers and then gave a quick glance at a shrine that human rights groups had set up in Mr. Domínguez’s honor.The rights groups say this case is part and parcel for a patrol too quick to use deadly force. “If Agent Corbett is not found guilty, it will send a message to all members of the Border Patrol that they are free to do as they wish, including murdering migrants,” said a spectator at the trial, Cecile Lumer of Citizens for Border Solutions, a group in Bisbee.Agent Corbett and Mr. Domínguez’s family members sat on opposite sides of the courtroom. Mr. Domínguez’s mother, María, sobbed when Mr. Woods displayed a photo of her son, who worked at a factory in New York.The shooting was 100 yards from the border. Mr. Woods said Mr. Domínguez was trying to take relatives to the New York region to work. After the Border Patrol saw them and others in their group broke off, the Domínguez group tried to return to Mexico. Agent Corbett drove up, circled them in his truck and exited holding his gun, Mr. Woods said. He ordered group members to their knees and struck Mr. Domínguez as he struggled, to make him comply. Mr. Domínguez, Mr. Woods added, was shot from less than a foot away. The bullet entered under an armpit, pierced the heart and lodged in the abdomen. Mr. Domínguez died at the scene.Mr. Chapman did not dispute that Mr. Domínguez had been shot at close range, saying it was in self-defense because he was about to strike Agent Corbett with a stone.“Nicholas Corbett did not want to shoot this man,” Mr. Chapman said. “But if he hadn’t done it, he might be dead today.”'"
"'08-02-28,'0','“Quite honestly, open-wheel motor racing in the United States just wasn’t going anywhere,” Kevin Kalkhoven, a Champ Car co-owner, said at the news conference. “If we were to have an opportunity to develop it for the future, we should take that opportunity.”Eight to 12 cars from the Champ Car series are expected to join the IndyCar Series, whose crown jewel is the Indianapolis 500. Kalkhoven said he thought the former Champ Car teams could place in the top five by the end of the season.Of larger importance is the marketing of a series that, other than the Indy 500, has been eclipsed by Nascar. Three former Indy 500 winners — Sam Hornish Jr., Dario Franchitti and Jacques Villeneuve — are racing stock cars this year.“A unified open-wheel series should really help galvanize everyone,” said Roger Penske, who fields powerful stock-car and IndyCar teams. “Not only will all the teams and drivers benefit from being together, but it should create more opportunities for sponsors as well, and that means more marketing and promotion for the series.”Hornish drove in the Daytona 500 in a car owned by Penske, who also owned the winning car driven by Ryan Newman. Penske’s drivers have won the Indianapolis 500 a record 14 times, and he is still an unabashed advocate for open-wheel racing.Penske said Wednesday that he hoped there would be closure in the open-wheel civil war. “But there’s a lot of hard work to be done,” he added. “What we do know is we have a great sport, with very talented athletes and teams and some of the best racing venues in the world.”Danica Patrick, Marco Andretti and Dan Wheldon will continue racing in the IndyCar Series, which opens March 29 at Homestead. Graham Rahal, whose father, Bobby, won the Indy 500 in 1986, is among the Champ Car drivers who will join them.An IndyCar Series race will be held in Japan on the same weekend as the Long Beach Grand Prix. Drivers in both races will earn points toward the IndyCar Series championship. Then the unified series will move ahead, with IndyCar teams providing some technical assistance to the Champ Car teams to adapt to the new cars.“It’s been a very rapid time line we’ve had to keep here,” George said. “We really only reached agreement a few days ago. The discussions have been going on over the last few weeks. But there were a number of elements we felt we could really bring to enhance the value of the 2008 season for all the teams and sponsors and the fans.”'"
"'08-02-28,'0','“Another month, another disastrous U.S. new-home sales report,” an economist at ING Bank, Dimitry Fleming, wrote. “New home prices have not dropped this fast in over 35 years.”In an ominous sign for builders, inventories of unsold new homes continued to rise. At the current rate, it would take nearly 10 months to sell the backlog.“Prices will need to fall further to help clear the market,” said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist at MFR, a research firm. Would-be buyers are waiting for better deals, say economists, who predict that sales will remain light through at least the summer.Sales have gone south amid a wave of foreclosures and more stringent lending standards for mortgages. The number of new homes on the market in January dropped as well.Toll Brothers, a leading luxury builder, said on Wednesday that first-quarter sales fell 23 percent, leading to a $96 million loss. The company was forced to write down $245 million in unsold properties, double the amount from a year ago.“Ceaseless talk of a recession continues to dampen the mood of consumers in general, whether or not a recession actually occurs,” the company’s chief executive, Robert I. Toll, said in a statement. “We believe that revived buyer confidence is paramount to getting the market moving again.”In January, sales of new homes fell 10.3 percent in the Northeast; 7.6 percent in the Midwest; and 2.4 percent in the South. Sales rose 2.2 percent in the West.The weak housing data coincided with new evidence of other economic troubles. A separate Commerce Department report showed that businesses spent less on durable goods in January, a sign that companies were hesitant to make large purchases.Over all, new orders of durable goods — those that last for several years — fell 5.3 percent last month, dragged down by a sharp drop in transportation goods like aircraft. It was the first monthly decline since October.“It falls in with a lot of other economic indicators that are pointing to a weakening in the economy,” Mr. Baumohl, of the Economic Outlook Group, said of durable goods. “That’s the only way you can really portray it.”TOKYO (Bloomberg News) — January factory production in Japan fell twice as much as economists had predicted as manufacturers anticipated a deepening slump in the United States would weaken demand.Companies cut output 2 percent from December, when it rose 1.4 percent, the trade ministry said Thursday.A separate report showed retail sales increased 1.5 percent in January from a year earlier, though most of the gain was driven by higher gasoline prices.'"
"'08-02-28,'0','FRANKFURT — European Union regulators on Wednesday said they would investigate whether bailouts of two German banks hit by the subprime lending crisis had violated rules on state aid for ailing enterprises.The rescues involved credit lines of about 26 billion euros, or $39 billion. In one, the state-owned bank KfW chipped in to cover potential losses at IKB Deutsche Industriebank, a corporate lender. In another, SachsenLB, a state-owned regional bank, was aided by other regional banks and the state of Saxony.Both banks had bet on securities linked to the subprime mortgage market in the United States. The European commissioner for competition, Neelie Kroes, said taxpayers should not be required to cover the resulting losses.“It is hard for European citizens to understand why they have to suffer from the economic downturn, while taxpayers’ money is poured into once-profitable banks that took excessive risks and might now avoid paying for their risky strategies,” Ms. Kroes said in a statement.Under European rules, the companies can be required to repay any aid if the European Commission concludes there was a violation. Sanctions could also involve a forced sale of the banks.'"
"'08-02-28,'0','An insurgent group operating in Iraq, called Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, is actually a homegrown Sunni Arab extremist group that American intelligence agencies have concluded is foreign led. The extent of its links to Osama bin Laden’s network is not clear. Some leaders of the group have sworn allegiance to Mr. bin Laden, but the precise links and extent of affiliation are unknown, and it was created after the American invasion.In the exchange of charges between Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, both essentially ignored Mr. Obama’s Democratic rival, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was campaigning in Ohio on economic and trade issues. Mrs. Clinton, speaking to reporters Wednesday morning, said she was pleased with her debate performance and indicated that she intended to pursue the nomination even if she loses the Ohio and Texas primaries on Tuesday.“I think what’s important is that we have a lot of people yet to vote,” Mrs. Clinton told reporters traveling on her plane.Later, in Zanesville, Ohio, Mrs. Clinton said she remained optimistic about the race because she was raising $1 million a day online. “People have just been really rallying to my candidacy,” she said.Mrs. Clinton had been asked at Tuesday’s debate about the public release of her tax returns and thousands of pages from the archives of Bill Clinton’s presidency, and offered assurances that both would be forthcoming. On Wednesday, a Clinton campaign spokesman said she would release them “as the Democratic nominee” in April, at tax time.As for the archives, Mrs. Clinton had suggested that she was waiting for the White House to complete its part of the process. However, on Wednesday a White House spokeswoman kicked the issue back to Mrs. Clinton, saying there were no requests pending for the release of records.Mr. Obama’s campaign said Wednesday that it had received campaign contributions from more than a million people, most of them relatively small donors. The Obama campaign has been raising considerably more money than the Clinton campaign since the beginning of this year. A Clinton spokesman said the campaign had not released the total number of its donors.In Columbus on Wednesday morning, Mr. Obama delivered one of his sharpest critiques yet of Mr. McCain. For several minutes, Mr. Obama mocked his potential Republican rival as he answered Mr. McCain’s charge that he lacks sufficient foreign policy experience for the presidency.“I’ve been paying attention, John McCain,” Mr. Obama said, speaking to a crowd of 7,000 in the St. John Arena on the Ohio State campus. “So John McCain may like to say he wants to follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, but so far, all he’s done is follow George Bush into a misguided war in Iraq.”He added, “I respect John McCain, but he’s tied to the politics of the past — we are about the policies of the future. He’s the party of yesterday. We want to be the party of tomorrow.”Meanwhile, Tennessee Republican officials defended a press release issued Monday that said Mr. Obama was anti-Israel and was supported by anti-Semites like Louis Farrakhan, founder of the Nation of Islam. The release uses Mr. Obama’s middle name, Hussein, and includes the widely distributed photo of Mr. Obama in native Somali garb on a trip to Africa in 2006.Mr. Obama, responding to a question at Tuesday’s debate, rejected Mr. Farrakhan’s support and proclaimed his support for Israel.Bill Hobbs, spokesman for the Tennessee Republican Party, said the party issued the release because “Barack Obama has surrounded himself with people who do not have the best interests of Israel at heart.” He said the party had gotten complaints from Democrats and some Republicans, but had not heard from the McCain campaign.Mr. McCain said he could not control the activities of such groups until he was the nominee.'"
"'08-02-28,'0','Limited Brands reported Wednesday that its fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell nearly 12 percent on a substantial decline in sales after its decision last summer to get out of the apparel business.It warned that its first-quarter earnings would miss Wall Street estimates and that sales for February would be worse than it previously forecast.The company, which operates the Bath & Body Works and Victoria’s Secret stores, said it made $388.6 million, or $1.10 a share, in the quarter ended Feb. 2, compared with $439.8 million, or $1.08 a share, in the period a year earlier, when there were fewer shares outstanding. Sales totaled $3.28 billion, down from $4.02 billion in the corresponding quarter.Excluding a pretax gain of $47.8 million from unused gift cards at Victoria’s Secret and a tax benefit of $28 million, Limited Brands would have made $331.7 million, or 94 cents a share, in the quarter.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected a profit of 91 cents a share on revenue of $3.26 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year, a gauge of a retailer’s health, fell 8 percent in the quarter. It operated 2,926 stores at the end of the quarter, compared with 3,766 a year earlier.'"
"'08-02-28,'0','The writing is often stilted, and the game’s text is riddled with misspellings like “departement” and “pilote” and job descriptions like “responsible of the control room” that suggest the game’s French design team, Lexis Numerique, had the entire game translated by the summer intern.Yet it is fascinating to browse through the researchers’ papers, which are a mix of love letters, gossip, paranoid musings and fascinating scientific papers on mysterious creatures called Tyriades that communicate entirely through scent. Other papers deal with the guinea pig humans who have been exposed to a mysterious Tyriadian gas and sent out into the jungle.The Experiment is as frustrating as it is intriguing. Manually switching cameras to watch Lea is cumbersome, but the option to have the game automatically choose the best camera does not work. It often jumps away from a good view of her to show you an empty room nearby.Security cameras have many blind spots, and at times you have to lead Lea to places you can’t see. (Gamers are used to dealing with security cameras in stealth games in which blind spots are a good thing, so it’s interesting to see the other side of security.)Machines are especially awkward to operate. You can use the keyboard to control them, but when you adjust a camera, the control window loses focus and you have to click on it before you can use the keyboard again.You can excuse many of the flaws by noting that they are true to life; The Experiment works hard to be convincing by having you watch Lea explore the ruined ship and later the Tyriades’ exotic jungle home through awkwardly placed, sometimes broken security cameras.So realistically, security software would be poorly designed to help a woman escape a research vessel. Things that would annoy me in other games, like Lea’s leisurely amble from place to place, add to the game’s veracity. And for all its rough edges, The Experiment creates a world so vivid and unusual that it held my attention where many slicker games have left me with a been-there-done-that feeling.The great failing of The Experiment is actually not in its design but in its protagonist. While a security report refers to Lea’s “rich and unique personality,” she is actually inhumanly dull, revealing little emotion and expressing herself in the bland tone of an automated answering system.This is particularly frustrating because the game’s design makes it an ideal vehicle for a memorable character. A basic dramatic failing of video games is that the player can’t really connect with the game characters. Lea could have been anything — frightened, dashing, vulnerable, caustic — but instead she’s nothing at all. Had The Experiment explored the personality of a woman on a ship of dead comrades whose only company is an unseen camera operator, the game could have created a strong emotional bond with the player.Ultimately, this is an imaginative game that paradoxically suffers from a failure of imagination. This is a pattern for Lexis Numerique, which has previously combined game design ingenuity with bland characters and poor storytelling in games like Evidence: The Last Ritual.No game so desperately needs the input of an experienced writer as much as The Experiment, which creates an intriguing world but fails to create an intriguing character or a satisfactory conclusion. If I ever meet any of the designers I will drop to my knees and beg them to hire a writer, because I admire their determination to create something truly unique. And while I am on my knees, I might just suggest one more thing: run the text through a spelling checker.'"
"'08-02-28,'0','A former executive at UBS who sold nonpublic information about the bank’s stock recommendations and a former trader who used those tips pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges of insider trading.Mitchel Guttenberg, 42, a former institutional client manager in UBS’s equity research department, and David Tavdy, 39, a former trader at the broker-dealer Assent, both pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud during separate hearings before Judge Deborah A. Batts in Federal District Court in Manhattan.The two were among 13 people, including employees of Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns, who were charged last year in what authorities called one of the most pervasive insider trading rings since the 1980s.Now, 12 of those people have pleaded guilty. Another broker at Assent, Samuel Childs, has pleaded not guilty.Mr. Guttenberg admitted that on many occasions from 2001 to 2006 he told two traders about coming stock recommendations by analysts. “Both men paid me for this information,” Mr. Guttenberg told the judge. “I deeply regret my actions.”The information was used to execute hundreds of transactions, reaping more than $17.5 million, said Andrew Fish, an assistant United States attorney.'"

"'08-02-28,'0','BRUSSELS —European antitrust regulators on Wednesday fined Microsoft $1.3 billion for failing to comply with a 2004 judgment that the company had abused its market dominance. The new fine by the European Commission was the largest it has ever imposed on an individual company, and brings the total in fines imposed on Microsoft to about $2.5 billion, in current exchange rates.Microsoft had earlier been fined after the commission determined in 2004 that the company had abused the dominance of its Windows operating system to gain unfair market advantage. The commission imposed the new fine Wednesday, it said, because the company had not met the prescribed remedies after the earlier judgment.“Microsoft was the first company in 50 years of E.U. competition policy that the commission has had to fine for failure to comply with an antitrust decision,” the European competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said in a statement.“I hope that today’s decision closes a dark chapter in Microsoft’s record of noncompliance with the commission’s March 2004 decision,” Ms. Kroes said. The commission is the executive arm of the European Union.The commission had ordered Microsoft on March 24, 2004 to disclose within 120 days information which would allow rival vendors to interoperate with Windows. But antitrust officials said the company had sought too much in royalties and patent fees for competitors to use the data.'"
"'08-02-28,'0','BANGKOK — Saying “I miss my motherland,” former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra returned to Thailand on Thursday, 17 months after being ousted in a coup, and said he was ready to face corruption charges that have been brought against him.A crowd of about 4,000 supporters cheered as his plane landed at the international airport here to open the next chapter in a political confrontation that has set back democracy in Thailand.His return followed the installation of a civilian government packed with his supporters that was elected in December, in defiance of the military junta that had sought to purge the country of his influence.Earlier, as Mr. Thaksin, 58, prepared to board his flight in Hong Kong, he said, “I believe in the Thai justice system, especially the court system.” Although he has already been active behind the scenes with the new government, he repeated a frequent pledge to stay out of politics, saying, “I’m finished.”The authorities took Mr. Thaksin into custody at the airport and drove him to the Supreme Court, where he was released on bail on corruption charges pending a hearing on March 8. He was barred from leaving the country without the court’s permission.'"
"'08-02-28,'0','“I’ve talked to C.E.O.’s in New York, even the president of the United States,” Mr. Jindal said in an interview, and when “you ask them for more investment, more help on the coast and other areas, their first reaction always is: ‘Well, who do you need to know? Who do I have to hire? Is this money going to end up in somebody’s pocket?’ ”That had to change, the governor said, and he was using his “narrow window” — his honeymoon at the Capitol — to do it.The volume of grumbling suggested real change was afoot.“This is huge,” said D. W. Hunt, a veteran lobbyist at the Capitol. “This is a sea change. This will seriously, dramatically change things. The meta-theme is the transparency.”Barry Erwin, president of the Council for a Better Louisiana, a good-government watchdog group, described the new bills as “a major change in the culture.”“It’s a world of difference, particularly on the disclosure side, and the same thing with conflict-of-interest,” he said.The new requirements will force all state legislators, as well as most other elected and appointed officials around the state, to disclose all sources of income, real estate holdings and debts over $10,000. (Judges are exempted.) Lawmakers and executive branch officials will no longer be able to get contracts for state-financed or disaster-related work. Lobbyists will also have to disclose their sources of income and will be limited to spending no more than $50 per elected official, per meal; splitting the tab, say among other lobbyists or legislators, will also be prohibited.The new income disclosure requirements for legislators are comparable to those of Washington State, ranked first in the country by the Center for Public Integrity.Mr. Jindal was unable to persuade lawmakers to pass another bill that would have ended retirement benefits for public officials convicted of crimes related to their state work.Similar indulgences, of course, have gone on in other state capitals, though Louisiana does rank low nationally on state ethics charts. Here, however, they are carried out with particular frankness: lawmakers are known to scour the chambers for willing lobbyists when a day’s session ends, hoping to cadge a dinner invitation. They need not look far.Mr. Jindal took that penchant on as well, effectively aiming a blow at the Capitol’s de facto sister institution, Ruth’s Chris Steak House, where business is transacted nightly, courtesy of lobbyists (“sponsors,” in legislators’ parlance).The governor, ignoring cries of pain and going against the unswerving devotion to Louisiana’s food culture, pushed for the $50-a-meal cap, at any restaurant. No more unlimited spending.In a town where legislators have been known to proclaim paid-for meals a principal draw to public service, this was an especially unpopular move. Last week, State Representative Charmaine L. Marchand of the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans said the limit would force her and her colleagues to dine at Taco Bell, and urged that it be pushed to $75 per person, to give them “wiggle room.”No public groundswell took up her cause, and the $50 limit held.Meanwhile, the mood is feverish but still merry at Ruth’s Chris. A recent night found it packed with lobbyists and legislators. With the Capitol five miles away, its popularity will be threatened when the new rules go into effect on March 30. But the lavish springtime banquets held by lobbyists, where tables groan with choice Louisiana seafood, do not appear to be immediately endangered.In the legislative chambers, the votes for this ethics makeover were mostly unanimous, though the sarcastic commentary suggested that enthusiasm might not have been what was motivating legislators. Mr. Jindal has public opinion on his side, however.“I want to know who’s doing the corrupting,” a state senator, Francis Thompson, said, mock-seriously, to Mr. Jindal’s principal ally in the State Senate, its president, Joel T. Chaisson. “Any time there’s some abuse, I wish you would let us know, as our leader,” he said to Mr. Chaisson, as other senators chuckled.The point was not lawbreaking, though, but what has long been permitted under existing loose laws, say reform advocates like Mr. Jindal.Four stories up, in the skyscraper Capitol built by Huey Long, Mr. Jindal is unconnected to the slow-moving rural Louisiana of Long and those who followed him. At 36, he appears to be a young man in a hurry, acutely conscious of Louisiana’s poor national image, aware of his own rising star among Republicans and analytical about the historic missteps that have led Louisiana to coast on its mineral wealth, straight to the bottom of national rankings in ethics and a host of economic and social indicators.In an interview in his office, words and prescriptions come shooting out in a rapid-fire nonstop monologue. Inside of a half-hour, Mr. Jindal shoehorned a brief history of Louisiana’s political and economic problems, a historical excursion on the office he was sitting in, an agenda for his remaining four years, an analysis of why the state’s government had failed, a recapitulation of his recent campaign, a paean to his father, an explanation of why he pushed the ethics bills, and other topics.Mr. Jindal said Hurricanes Katrina and Rita had presented him with a unique moment in his state’s history to enact reforms; as he put it, the storms “caused people to rethink how they wanted their social institutions to be designed, how they wanted services to be delivered, what kind of state they wanted to call home.”What follows could be much tougher, given the scope of Mr. Jindal’s ambitions — detractors grumble that they are limitless — the bruised feelings among legislators and the scope of Louisiana’s challenge: a poorly educated work force, bad roads and infrastructure, a persistent stream of residents leaving the state, and little business investment. He has already talked of cutting taxes on business, prompting questions about whether he will move beyond such traditional Republican economic strategies.“My biggest concern is, we’ll run out of time,” Mr. Jindal said. “There are so many things we need to do in our state. It’s like being in this endless buffet and having this incredible appetite, but knowing there’s no way you’re going to be able to eat everything you want to eat, or taste everything that’s out there.”'"

"'08-02-29,'0','The 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago — to say nothing of the violent confrontations between police and antiwar protesters that simultaneously seethed in the city’s parks and streets — can hardly be called an obscure historical event. Demonstrators chanted, “The whole world is watching,” and so it was. Images of blue-helmeted officers and their long-haired antagonists have been part of the collective memory ever since.Some of the best accounts of what happened, what it felt like and what it all seemed to mean, were produced while the smell of tear gas still hung over Michigan Avenue. The nostalgic or the curious can seek out Norman Mailer’s “Miami and the Siege of Chicago,” for example, which analyzed events inside and beyond the convention hall with its author’s characteristic, and in this case perfectly appropriate, blend of intellectual grandiosity and journalistic acumen.There is also the vérité-is-stranger-than-fiction chronicle in Haskell Wexler’s film “Medium Cool” and the courtroom reportage of Jason Epstein in “Trials of the Resistance,” mainly about the conspiracy charges brought against prominent radicals in the wake of the disturbances. Those are all, in their way, partisan documents, broadly sympathetic to the cause of rebels in the streets, but they also allow the reader or viewer to glimpse a larger context of political crisis and cultural transformation.“Chicago 10,” Brett Morgen’s semi-animated, semi-documentary attempt to make the ’60s cool for a new generation of kids, does the opposite. It is a narrow, glib dollop of canned history, an affirmation of received thinking rather than a challenge to it. Squandering 40 years of hindsight, Mr. Morgen is content to trot out the tired mythology of the era one more time. His mélange of styles and techniques shows visual ingenuity, but not much in the way of historical insight. He takes the intricate, frequently self-contradictory theater of the New Left at face value, and panders to the credulity of the audience by breathing new life into old clichés. Groovy! Power to the people!The addition of anachronistic music selections, including tunes by Eminem and the Beastie Boys, seems like a bid for contemporary relevance, as does the use of animated renderings of the conspiracy trial, complete with voice-overs by famous actors. The script, adapted from official transcripts of the conspiracy trial, is full of found absurdity and unlikely profundity. It is fun to hear Hank Azaria doing Abbie Hoffman, Nick Nolte growling as the lead prosecutor, and Roy Scheider, in one of his last film roles, impersonating Judge Julius Hoffman, no relative of Abbie’s.'"
"'08-02-29,'0','The synopsis of “Bonneville” makes it sound like “Thelma and Louise” in first gear: A recent widow named Arvilla Holden (Jessica Lange) and her two best friends, Carol and Margene (Joan Allen and Kathy Bates), hit the road in Idaho in a 1966 Pontiac convertible to deliver an urn full of ashes to a funeral in Santa Barbara, Calif., bickering, bonding and facing hard truths along the way.The 50-something leads and meandering pace distinguish “Bonneville” from other movies of its type. But the film’s most striking characteristic comes to the fore when the women pick up a hunky young hitchhiker named Bo (Victor Rasuk).Not only is there no furtive hookup, we sense that none of the travelers would seriously consider having one. When the women sit in a diner watching the shirtless hitchhiker wash their car in the parking lot, they’re just window-shopping. We learn the source of their restraint when Bo and the ladies part ways, and Carol offers him a parting gift: her copy of the Book of Mormon.As it happens, Carol, Margene, Arvilla and many other major characters are devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The film’s screenwriter, Daniel D. Davis, and its director, Christopher N. Rowley, treat their characters’ faith as a given — as merely one characteristic among many. It’s the Mormon flip side of a typical Hollywood movie set in a world in which no one ever mentions God, prays or enters a house of worship. The movie’s no-fuss treatment of religion is as deft as it is unexpected.Good thing too, because the film has many tiresome elements — starting with Arvilla’s brittle antagonist, Francine (Christine Baranski), her dead husband Joe’s daughter by his first wife. Because Joe never amended his will, Francine, who always disliked her stepmother, is set to inherit the couple’s longtime home. She gives Arvilla an ultimatum: Deliver Joe’s ashes to Santa Barbara for burial next to his first wife, or pack and get out. Despite Ms. Baranski’s sharp performance and a few last-minute nuances, Francine remains a resentful killjoy.'"

Mr. Benepe, who recalled running on dismal public tracks with “swampy locker rooms” as a youth in the 1970s, said the new pool gave him goose bumps.“This is an international, competition-level pool,” he said. And one that can be used free by youths 18 and under. Adults under 55 will pay $75 annually. Anyone older will pay $10 a year.At the building’s heart is a 50-by-25-meter swimming pool, divisible by bulkheads into three swimming and diving areas, with a total of one million gallons of 80-degree water. A sweeping arched roof is held up by a bridgelike cable-stayed suspension system.

"'08-02-29,'0','BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge has tentatively barred Roche Holding from beginning sales in the United States of an anemia medication that a jury found violates patents held by Amgen.But Judge William G. Young of Federal District Court in Boston said on Thursday that he was open to allowing sales of the drug, called Mircera, if Roche agreed to certain conditions, including paying a higher royalty to Amgen of 22.5 percent of the drug’s American sales, instead of the 20 percent royalty Roche had proposed earlier this month.Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland, also would have to guarantee that it would not charge higher prices than those for Amgen’s two top-selling anemia treatments, Aranesp, introduced in 2001, and Epogen, introduced in 1989.Roche said it was disappointed by the order and would evaluate Judge Young’s request for another proposal. It is also considering filing an appeal.Judge Young’s ruling was tentative, and allows the sides to suggest modifications within 30 days. The judge also said he was still considering whether to expand his temporary order barring United States sales of Mircera by imposing a permanent injunction that would remain after the Amgen patents begin expiring in 2013.Dan Whelan, a spokesman for Amgen, which is based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said, “We are pleased the court is providing preliminary relief against a prover infringer. We do believe a permanent injunction is the appropriate remedy in this case, and look forward to the court’s decision on that matter.”'"
"'08-02-29,'0','PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Eight suspected Islamic militants, including four men of Middle Eastern origin and two from Central Asia, were killed early Thursday in a triple missile attack on a house used as a training facility in Pakistan’s tribal areas, a security official and residents said.The missiles appeared to have been launched from territory controlled by NATO forces across the border in Afghanistan, the second deadly aerial strike in a month. Residents said three other occupants of the house were wounded in the strike, in the village of Kalosha in South Waziristan, one of the most restive tribal regions.The security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the nature of his job, said the dead had belonged to a little-known group affiliated with Al Qaeda, working under the name Abu Hamza.Local residents said they had heard three loud explosions about 2 a.m. that destroyed the house. They said the three wounded occupants were from Turkmenistan.They also said the house had belonged to Shero Wazir, an Ahmadzai Wazir tribesman who had rented it to an unidentified man of Arab nationality.

"'08-02-29,'0','""I don’t want to be involved in politics any longer,"" Mr. Thaksin, a telecommunications billionaire, said at a news conference after his arrival. ""I want to live peacefully with my family and die in this motherland.""But already he has been active behind the scenes in the formation of the new government, and on Thursday a government minister said Mr. Thaksin would serve as an economic adviser.One of his opponents, a former Bangkok governor, Chamlong Srimuang, said Mr. Thaksin’s promise to stay out of politics was a “political game.”“Thaksin will plunge the country into a greater crisis that people will not be able to tolerate any longer,” he said.After Mr. Thaksin’s welcome at the airport, police officers escorted him directly to the Supreme Court, where he and his wife, Pojaman, face charges of corruption and conflict of interest in the purchase of land from a state agency while he was in office.He was released on bail of 8 million baht, or about $267,000, and a trial was set for March 12. Now that he is home again, the court has barred him from leaving the country without its permission.His wife returned to Thailand last month and is also free on bail.After leaving the court Mr. Thaksin was taken to the office of the attorney general, where he was freed on bail of one million baht, or about $33,000, on a separate charge of concealing his assets.""I believe in the Thai justice system, especially the court system,"" Mr. Thaksin said in Hong Kong before boarding his flight home. But at his news conference after posting bail he sounded less upbeat.“The day I left, I was prime minister,” he said, referring to his trip to New York in September 2006, during which he was ousted. “But today when I came back, I was accused and had to be fingerprinted like a criminal.”Mr. Thaksin took pains to present himself as a nonthreatening retired politician, bringing with him two players from the English soccer club Manchester City, which he bought while in exile.But in a front-page analysis Thursday morning, The Nation, an English-language newspaper in Bangkok, said, “The mood in the country will be one of confusion and divisiveness” in a political scene where “half of the country loves him, the other half hates him.”“Three years of political crisis, a military coup in September 2006 and more recently a general election have done little to resolve the deep discord in Thailand,” it said.Mr. Thaksin took office in 2001 and his party, Thai Rak Thai, enjoyed the first outright majority in Thai history. He won the allegiance of Thailand’s rural majority but alienated its urban elite with populist policies that upended the established political order.At the same time, he manipulated the country’s democratic institutions to centralize power in his own hands and used his office to enrich himself and his associates.After his ouster, during more than a year of military rule, a court disbanded his party and banned him and 110 other party executives from politics for five years.But Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej, who heads the pro-Thaksin People Power Party, campaigned for office as Mr. Thaksin’s proxy and said he would act to reverse the ban and clear Mr. Thaksin’s name.An anti-Thaksin group, the People’s Alliance for Democracy, has said it would protest any move by the government to interfere in the court cases against him.“We cannot stand aside and watch if Thaksin is given a whitewash,” said Sondhi Limthongkul, a newspaper publisher who was at the center of demonstrations against Mr. Thaksin that preceded the coup. “He must pay the price of his actions, or the protests will be huge.”Any such protests could face counter-protests by his supporters, with a prospect of violence that had seemed possible before the political confrontation was halted by the coup in 2006.Some of the people who welcomed Mr. Thaksin at the airport had traveled many miles and spent much of the night waiting to greet him.“It is the hope of all people to have him return as prime minister,” said a construction contractor, Prakayrat Benjatheerasant. “He’s the best prime minister Thailand has ever had.”The waiting crowd spent much of the night singing together. The lyrics of one song illustrated the devotion he has inspired among the country’s poor.“When there is drought we need rain, when it is dark we need light, when there is wind and strong waves we need a captain to bring us to port,” the people at the airport sang.“The name Thaksin spreads across the world. He is like a star in the sky that will bring Thailand forward, ahead of other countries.”'"
"'08-02-29,'0','Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, demanded to know how the animal abuse occurred when five inspectors were assigned to the plant. He called for continuous monitoring of live animals at slaughterhouses and suggested that the Department of Agriculture use video cameras.Mr. Kohl also demanded audits in the next month of every slaughterhouse in the country supplying meat for federal programs like school lunches. The Agriculture Department promised more random inspections of those slaughterhouses.Noting that the abuse was uncovered by a charity, rather than government inspectors, Mr. Kohl asked the agriculture secretary, Edward T. Schafer, “Why don’t you have a system that uncovers this inhumane treatment of animals?”Mr. Schafer said his agency was still investigating the incidents at Westland/Hallmark to determine how inspectors missed the abuse, and whether abuse was occurring at other plants. He said his agency was also considering using cameras to keep watch on cows held in pens for slaughter.For all the graphic images in the videotape, the secretary said there was no evidence that sick cows made it into the food supply. He said the cows had passed an inspection by a veterinarian trained to look for signs of illness.“We do not believe this is a food safety issue,” he said. But Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, repeatedly challenged the secretary’s assertion that the meat from Westland/Hallmark was safe.“We don’t know if these animals portrayed on this videotape were sick or not,” he said. “We can’t keep saying these things if we don’t really know.”When cows arrive at a slaughterhouse, they are inspected by a Department of Agriculture veterinarian to determine if they are healthy enough for slaughter. If the cows then go down between the time of the inspection and slaughter, the meat company is supposed to call the veterinarian back to reinspect the animal. Westland/Hallmark failed to take that step, prompting the recall.Westland/Hallmark slaughtered about 11,000 animals a month, and Department of Agriculture veterinarians turned away 35 to 40, said Kenneth E. Petersen, assistant administrator for the agency’s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Despite demands by the Humane Society and some members of Congress for a complete ban on downer cattle, Mr. Schafer maintained that current rules were adequate to protect the food supply.“They broke the rules,” he said, referring to Westland/Hallmark. “That doesn’t mean the rules are wrong.”In written testimony to the subcommittee, Temple Grandin, an expert on animal welfare and an animal science professor at Colorado State University, said inspectors needed more training.“One person is superstrict and unreasonable, another is just right and another is totally lax,” she wrote.'"

He said he was sorry; she said she loved him, and deemed the matter private, “between me, my husband and God.”But the specter of an affair was only the start of the troubles that have tumbled forth since.The text messages obtained by The Free Press contradict testimony that Mr. Kilpatrick and Ms. Beatty gave under oath last year during a civil trial in which several former police officers accused Mr. Kilpatrick of forcing them out of jobs, in part, because their investigations might have uncovered his romance.In court, Mr. Kilpatrick, who has a law degree, had scornfully denied a nonprofessional relationship with Ms. Beatty, saying the suggestion was demoralizing.“My mother is a congresswoman,” he testified. “There have always been strong women around me. My aunt is a state legislator. I think it’s absurd to assert that every woman that works with a man is a whore. I think it’s disrespectful, not just to Christine Beatty, but to women who do the professional job that they do every single day.”But the text messages between Mr. Kilpatrick and Ms. Beatty, loaded with exclamation points and “LOL’s,” allude to a romance with exchanges of banter, hotel room numbers, and worries about a security detail overhearing them. “And, did you miss me sexually?” she wrote in one message, according to The Free Press. “Hell yeah!” the mayor wrote back. “You couldn’t tell. I want some more. Don’t sleep!”The Wayne County prosecutor, Kym L. Worthy, is expected to complete an investigation in March of possible charges against the mayor, which could include perjury.The scandal comes at an awkward moment for Detroit, where the automobile industry is in retreat and poverty and foreclosure rates are among the nation’s worst, but where there also had been recent glimmers of light.“We really were starting to gain some momentum,” said Anthony F. Earley Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the DTE Energy Company, once a supporter of the mayor. “I think I’d be kidding you to say it doesn’t matter. It does set us back.”The messages have also sparked a separate, still-unfolding political crisis. At the insistence of The Free Press, joined by The Detroit News, a judge ordered the release of documents the mayor’s office had claimed as private.The documents, including some ordered released by the Michigan Supreme Court on Wednesday, show that city lawyers and the mayor, who had once vowed to fight a jury’s $6.5 million verdict in the former police officers’ lawsuit, settled the case (and a second, similar lawsuit) for $8.4 million. The settlement came hours after the city officials learned that the officers’ lawyer had copies of the text messages and intended to make them public, the documents say.Mr. Kilpatrick, who declined an interview, has said he settled the case for an entirely different reason: because business leaders and others were pushing him to get it over with and move on.Also damaging, some say, were the lengths to which Mr. Kilpatrick and his lawyers went to keep the public from knowing of the messages. They drew up an agreement, separate from the financial settlement, in which the officers promised not to speak of the messages and to stash them in a safe deposit box.Mr. Kilpatrick, 6-foot-4 and a former college football player, came from an intensely political family (his father, Bernard, was a county commissioner) and quickly impressed political circles with his ability to stir interest from a coveted but often indifferent bloc: young urban voters.In his 20s, he won a seat in the State House. In 2001, at 31, he beat an opponent twice his age for mayor, a job he once said he had dreamed of since he was a child visiting Manoogian Mansion, the mayoral residence, to meet Coleman A. Young, the city’s first black mayor.Mr. Kilpatrick was dubbed the hip-hop mayor, in part for his age, his flashy suits, the diamond stud in his ear. He swiftly drew controversy, including claims of a wild, secret party at Manoogian Mansion, accusations denied by Mr. Kilpatrick and later dismissed by Mike Cox, the attorney general who investigated, as “legend.”By 2005, after he came in second in a primary battle, Mr. Kilpatrick seemed to recognize that his career was at risk. He removed the earring, saying it had conveyed a “bad spirit of rebellion,” and ultimately won, helped by a statesmanlike speech at a memorial service for Rosa Parks, six days before the election.These days, people here seem deeply split.Mr. Kilpatrick’s supporters focus on what they say are his great strides — redevelopment of two historic hotel buildings, for instance, and what he says is a balanced $1.5 billion budget.Some blame The Free Press for singling out the mayor with a package its Web site calls “a mayor in crisis.”The mayor has accused the newspaper of obtaining the text messages illegally and being “in collusion with whomever to bring people down.”“When I’m on the front page of the paper, they sell more papers than at any other time,” he said in a radio interview.The Free Press has not explained how it obtained text of 14,000 messages on Ms. Beatty’s pager from parts of 2002 and 2003, but Paul Anger, the editor, denied any illegal act.“The Free Press has no agenda other than getting to the truth,” he wrote in an e-mail message.Meanwhile, Mr. Kilpatrick’s critics, including one who filed a mayoral recall drive, have marched outside his office with signs, “You Owe Us 9 Million,” and carried T- shirts with a picture of Mr. Kilpatrick and the words, “Just Quit.”“He needs to go,” said one critic, Kenneth Hilton, 24, as he ate lunch downtown on a recent afternoon. “It’s one thing to mess up your life on your own time, but now we are being forced to pay for his mess-ups, and the people I know, we’re sick and tired of it.”But the mayor’s mother, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said she believed that her son could withstand his troubles because of his significant work for Detroit.Ms. Kilpatrick said that she had talked to her son, prayed with him, and that she did not “condone” what had gone on. She said she hoped that his family would stay together. “That is the most important thing to me,” she said in a telephone interview.Higher office is still possible for him, Ms. Kilpatrick said.Again and again, Mr. Kilpatrick has said he will not resign. He told one radio station he was “on an assignment from God,” and suggested he might run for re-election to a third term next year.He said he had “an intention of being mayor, you know, until God tells me to do something else, until we pray, as my wife and I go in and say, O.K., this is now time for us to make a decision, and that hasn’t happened yet.”'"
"'08-02-29,'0','Here are recommendations to minimize your risk if your vacation home is in a region with wild animals:¶ Keep control of your pet, and do not let it stay outdoors at night.¶Store garbage indoors or use bear-resistant cans. Clean cans frequently with ammonia or bleach.¶ Clean barbecue grills; turn propane grills on high for a few minutes after use to burn up the grease.¶ If bears are prowling the area, leave outdoor lights on all night or set motion-sensitive lights to come on when there is activity near your house.¶ In places with alligators, keep pets and children away from stream banks and shores.¶ In areas with rattlesnakes, do not stick your hand into a cupboard if you can’t see what’s inside. Don’t step into a dark space. When hiking, step on logs and boulders rather than over them. Wear loose-fitting long pants and boots that cover the ankles. If you see a snake, move away from it quickly; don’t try to kill or pick up snakes.¶ If your house is isolated and unused for long periods, say, during the hottest months in Arizona, consider installing a snake-resistant fence around it.'"
