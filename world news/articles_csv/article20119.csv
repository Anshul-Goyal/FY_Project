"'11-09-01,'0','A Chinese court sentenced two more Tibetan monks to long prison terms on Tuesday, accusing them of “intentional homicide” in the death of another monk, who immolated himself last March, according to Xinhua. The court sentenced Tsering Tenzin and Tenchum of the Kirt Monastery in the Tibetan area of Sichuan Province to 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively. On Monday, the same court found a 46-year-old monk, Drongdru, guilty of “intentional homicide” in the death of the monk, a 16-year-old who was his nephew and disciple. Prosecutors said that after the teenager immolated himself, the three monks hid him and delayed emergency treatment. Human rights groups said the teenage monk was protesting government policies in Tibet.'"
"'11-09-01,'0','Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has repeatedly rejected the accusation of racial profiling and has said the racial breakdown of the stops correlates to the racial breakdown of crime suspects. Police officials say the street-stop tactic has helped reduce crime, remove guns from streets and save lives.But in raw numbers, the number of stops continues to rise, bringing the practice under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers, academics, the Center for Constitutional Rights and the New York Civil Liberties Union.As the judge’s order became public, Christopher T. Dunn, the associate legal director of the civil liberties organization, released statistics showing that the number of stops in the second quarter of 2011 totaled 178,824. The first quarter’s total, 183,326, was the highest for any quarter since 2002, when the numbers began being reliably tracked; in 2010, city officers made more street stops — 601,055 — than in any previous 12-month period.“We had 575,000 in 2009, just over 600,000 in 2010, and we’re now on pace for over 700,000 this year,” said Darius Charney, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, which filed the case in January 2008. “All this is in an era of either declining or flat crime rates, which begs the question: Is there really a need for this many stops?”The city plans to contest the reliability and methodology of the plaintiff’s statistical expert, upon whom the ruling relied heavily, said Heidi Grossman, deputy chief of the city Law Department’s special federal litigation division.“While the court has left it for the jury to determine whether the city has taken adequate action to ensure that stops of New Yorkers are handled appropriately, we are confident the jury will find in the city’s favor,” Ms. Grossman said. “Indeed, the court noted that the city does not have an express policy of stopping minorities based on race.”Ms. Grossman noted that the judge held that the lead plaintiff, David Floyd, was stopped in February 2008 under reasonable suspicion by the police, despite his challenge of the encounter. She said further procedural challenges could arise before trial, which the ruling also noted.At one point in her ruling, Judge Scheindlin provocatively termed some of the underlying evidence presented by the plaintiffs as a “smoking gun.” She was referring to audio recordings of station-house roll calls, in which officers received instructions on their arrest, summons and street-stops activity.“In sum,” she wrote, “I find that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether N.Y.P.D. supervisors have a custom or practice of imposing quotas on officer activity, and whether such quotas can be said to be the ‘moving force,’ behind widespread suspicionless stops.”'"
"'11-09-01,'0','Meet the members of what might be called Generation Limbo: highly educated 20-somethings, whose careers are stuck in neutral, coping with dead-end jobs and listless prospects.And so they wait: for the economy to turn, for good jobs to materialize, for their lucky break. Some do so bitterly, frustrated that their well-mapped careers have gone astray. Others do so anxiously, wondering how they are going to pay their rent, their school loans, their living expenses — sometimes resorting to once-unthinkable government handouts.“We did everything we were supposed to,” said Stephanie Morales, 23, who graduated from Dartmouth College in 2009 with hopes of working in the arts. Instead she ended up waiting tables at a Chart House restaurant in Weehawken, N.J., earning $2.17 an hour plus tips, to pay off her student loans. “What was the point of working so hard for 22 years if there was nothing out there?” said Ms. Morales, who is now a paralegal and plans on attending law school.Some of Ms. Morales’s classmates have found themselves on welfare. “You don’t expect someone who just spent four years in Ivy League schools to be on food stamps,” said Ms. Morales, who estimates that a half-dozen of her friends are on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. A few are even helping younger graduates figure out how to apply. “We are passing on these traditions on how to work in the adult world as working poor,” Ms. Morales said.But then there are people like Ms. Kelly and Ms. Klein, who are more laissez-faire. With the job market still bleak, their motto might as well be: “No career? No prospects? No worries!” (Well, at least for the time being.)After all, much of the situation is out of their control, as victims of bad timing. Ms. Klein contrasted her Harvard classmates with the ones of her older sister, who graduated from Harvard seven years earlier. Those graduates, she said, were career-obsessed and, helped along by a strong economy, aggressively pursued high-powered jobs right after graduation.By comparison, Ms. Klein said her classmates seemed resigned to waiting for the economic tides to turn. “Plenty of people work in bookstores and work in low-end administrative jobs, even though they have a Harvard degree,” she said. “They are thinking more in terms of creating their own kinds of life that interests them, rather than following a conventional idea of success and job security.”The numbers are not encouraging. About 14 percent of those who graduated from college between 2006 and 2010 are looking for full-time jobs, either because they are unemployed or have only part-time jobs, according to a survey of 571 recent college graduates released in May by the Heldrich Center at Rutgers.And then there is the slice of graduates effectively underemployed, using a college degree for positions that don’t require one or barely scraping by, working in call centers, bars or art-supply stores.“They are a postponed generation,” said Cliff Zukin, an author of the Heldrich Center study. He noted that recent graduates seemed to be living with parents longer and taking longer to become financially secure. The journey on the life path, for many, is essentially stalled.The Heldrich survey also found that the portion of graduates who described their first job as a “career” fell from 30 percent, if they graduated before the 2008 economic downturn (in 2006 and 2007), to 22 percent, if they graduated after the downturn (in 2009 and 2010).In an ominous sign, those figures didn’t change much for second jobs, Dr. Zukin added, suggesting that recent graduates were stumbling from field to field. Indeed, Till Marco von Wachter, an economics professor at Columbia University who has studied the impact of recessions on young workers, said the effect on earnings took about a decade to fade.MEANWHILE, modest jobs mean modest lives. Benjamin Shore, 23, graduated from the University of Maryland last year with a business degree and planned to go into consulting. Instead, he moved back into his parents’ house in Cherry Hill, N.J., and spent his days browsing for jobs online.But when his parents started charging him $500 a month for rent, he moved into a windowless room in a Baltimore row house and took a $12-an-hour job at a Baltimore call center, making calls for a university, encouraging prospects to go back to school. “There’s no point in being diplomatic: it is horrible,” Mr. Shore said.“I have a college education that I feel like I am wasting by being there,” he added. “I am supposed to do something interesting, something with my brain.” For a while, Mr. Shore ran LongevityDrugstore.com, an online drug retailer that he started, but it went nowhere. To stretch his pay check, he made beans and rice at home and drove slowly to save gas. Eventually he quit, got work as a dock hand and is now thinking of becoming a doctor.Perhaps not surprisingly, volunteering has become a popular outlet for a generation that seeks meaning in its work. Sarah Weinstein, 25, a 2008 graduate of Boston University, manages a bar in Austin because she couldn’t find an advertising job. In her spare time, she volunteers, doing media relations for Austin Pets Alive, an animal rescue shelter.“It’d be nice to make more money,” Ms. Weinstein said, but “I prefer it this way so that I have the extra time to spend volunteering and pursuing other things.” Volunteering, however, goes only so far. After three years without an advertising job, she is now applying to graduate school to freshen up her résumé.Meanwhile, people forced out of the rat race are re-evaluating their values and looking elsewhere for satisfaction. “They have to revise their ideas of what they are looking for,” said Kenneth Jedding, author of “Higher Education: On Life, Landing a Job, and Everything Else They Didn’t Teach You in College.”For Geo Wyeth, 27, who graduated from Yale in 2007, that means adopting a do-it-yourself approach to his career. After college, he worked at an Apple Store in New York as a salesclerk and trainer, while furthering his music career in an experimental rock band. He has observed, he said, a shift among his peers away from the corporate track and toward a more artistic mentality.“You have to make opportunities happen for yourself, and I think a lot of my classmates weren’t thinking in that way,” he said. “It’s the equivalent of setting up your own lemonade stand.”'"
"'11-09-01,'0','“In the first place, the concept was to build a house that was traditionally Khmer but with a modern interpretation,” Mr. Ros said. “In the second, I wanted to work as a team.”To execute this vision, the couple turned to the architecture and design firm ASMA, which is run by the couple’s children, Cyril and Lisa, and the French partner Ivan Tizianel, with offices in Paris and Siem Reap.They embarked on a yearlong design phase in April 2007 for a 4,680-square-foot, three-bedroom home on nearly two acres in Wat Atvear, a rural part of town where cattle graze along dusty russet-hued roads and banana trees hang low. The two-level house was constructed for $150,000, using nearly all local building materials like bamboo, stone and terrazzo. Mr. Ros and his 67-year-old wife, who had taught art history at École du Louvre in Paris, moved into their home in January 2010.In Cambodia, country homes are traditionally made of wood, shaded by peaked roofs, and raised on columns. The couple’s interpretation of the form skewed minimalist: a rectangular building made of bare concrete and slim slats of mahogany-hued wood raised more than 10 feet off the ground and covered with a flat concrete roof. Following local custom, the kitchen was set apart from the main building; it is contained in a rectangular, 118-square-foot concrete structure nestled into a manmade phnom, or hill.The result is a contemporary home in a pastoral setting, from the two fish- and lily-laden ponds that flank the home to the wall of bamboo trees that provide privacy and security.“We wanted to create an exchange between the two elements — the landscape is coming in and mixing with the house,” Lisa Ros said. “Many of the things we did were experiments. We couldn’t have made this house with any client other than our parents.”For example, the vegetation surrounding the house was left to grow wild so that the house has an unpredictable appearance at any given time. And other than in the bedrooms, the house has neither doors nor security fences.Visitors to the couple’s home first encounter a facade of 24 woven bamboo panels affixed to individual steel rods that allow the panels to playfully swivel with the wind. A small wooden footbridge flanked by a stone wall crosses a fish-stocked pool and leads to the open-air ground level. This 2,475-square-foot space is defined by 25-foot-tall concrete columns and an expanse of charcoal-gray floor tiles punctuated by sections of gleaming tropical hardwood. A floating terrazzo staircase off the main entrance, bolstered by a single steel beam, is hung with orchids and leads up to the bedrooms.Much of the couple’s daily life takes place on the ground level — dining, working, reading, entertaining — and, like the entire house, the décor is kept simple. A rectangular table of polished gray terrazzo serves as a daytime dining and work space, while an antique set of wooden chairs and daybed are used for lounging. A lighting fixture that outlines the ceiling was designed by the couple’s daughter, Lisa.Upstairs, where the bedrooms are found, there is also a television room and a roof topped with grass that has become a good place for star gazing. But in Cambodian culture, only family and close friends enter this area of the home, which is considered private.A master bedroom of 345 square feet and two guest rooms of 160 square feet each are hidden behind heavy wooden doors and a white wall hung with a single abstract painting by a local artist, Srey Bandol.In these rooms, the design is also minimalist: built-in bed frames made of white-washed bricks and inlaid with smooth, dark wood panels; rough, unfinished concrete ceilings; white walls and hardwood floors.“A big part of the décor is the materials themselves and the way they are presented,” Lisa Ros said.To offset the muted tones in the couple’s bedroom, tailor-made, scarlet-red cotton curtains hang on the 7-foot-tall windows and a small colorful piece of woven Laotian fabric is used as a rug. A platform bed is fitted with a white cotton duvet hand-embroidered with colorful circles in a geometric pattern.Walls of windows with louvered glass slats overlook the expansive backyard, and the natural light bathes the rooms in a wash of green from the soaring coconut palms, fragrant frangipani trees, and a small electric-green rice paddy.Even the baths, outfitted with custom-made ceramic tiles in pale shades and polished terrazzo vanities, have garden views.But nature also plays a starring role indoors. An opening in the roof allows rain to fall in the foyer and the open-air hallway facing the bedrooms, giving a symphonic quality to Cambodia’s riotous rainstorms. With the pattering rain, croaking frogs, crowing roosters and the whistling wind, Ms. Ros said, “ it’s like a concert.”'"

"'11-09-01,'0','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Factory activity in the Midwest slowed a bit in August and private employers continued to hire despite extreme financial market turmoil, easing fears the economy would fall back into recession.Other economic data on Wednesday showed a strong rebound in demand for manufactured goods in July as orders for motor vehicles posted their largest gain since 2003, another suggestion that a recession could be avoided despite some weak economic signals.“For those of us who don’t believe the economy is in a free fall, we have got some support,” said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International in New York.The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its business barometer fell to 56.5, the lowest since November 2009, from 58.8 in July. However, the reading was above economists’ expectations and indicated that activity had grown.A separate report from ADP, a payroll processing company, showed that private employers had added 91,000 new jobs this month after expanding by 114,000 in July.The ADP figures come ahead of the government’s much more comprehensive labor market report on Friday, which is expected to show a modest increase in employment, despite the damping effect of a strike at Verizon Communications.'"
"'11-09-01,'0','Until now, Exxon’s involvement in Russia has not been as extensive as BP’s. But that could change, based on the joint venture deal Exxon signed Tuesday with the state company to explore for oil in the Russian sector of the Arctic Ocean and in the Black Sea. Rosneft, in turn, is to gain access to Exxon operations, including oil fields in Texas and the Gulf of Mexico.Partner beware was the watchword Wednesday in a note to clients by the Eurasia Group, another risk analysis organization.“The politics of the Russian energy sector remain treacherous, as the 31st of August raid on BP’s Moscow office demonstrates,” the note said. Exxon, it said, “will now be deeply engaged in those politics for many years.”Wednesday’s BP raid stemmed from a lawsuit filed by minority shareholders of the company’s Russian joint venture . They contend BP damaged their stock’s value by entering into a deal earlier this year with Rosneft that unraveled after opposition by the main Russian partners in TNK-BP. That debacle was an embarrassment to Prime Minister Putin, who had originally blessed the BP-Rosneft deal.An arbitration court, a type of Russian civil court, in the Siberian city of Tyumen authorized Wednesday’s search of the Moscow offices, according to both BP and a lawyer for the minority shareholders. The target of the search was apparently documents subpoenaed in the lawsuit, which BP had balked at surrendering, according to Vladimir Buyanov, a BP spokesman.The agents who raided BP’s offices on the 17th and 18th floors of the Lotte Plaza, a high-rise on Moscow’s Garden Ring, wore commando-style uniforms with yellow shoulder patches saying according to BP employees.The agents were escorting two investigators from the Russian federal bailiff service, who were not armed. The police ushered employees out, and began rifling through papers.Despite the assault rifles, “there was no great panic,” one BP employee said. “I was able to come up and get my keys” even after the armed men arrived.The employee, who insisted on anonymity, described the armed police as polite and not overtly intimidating. “They were just a group of comrades with the badges of special forces, in black outfits, with assault rifles — nothing extraordinary.”One policeman “slightly” pushed an employee with the butt of a rifle, to encourage him to get out of his chair faster, according to two employees who were present.“We believe that these legal actions are without merit and appear to be part of a pressure campaign against BP’s business in Russia,” Jeremy Huck, the president of BP Russia, said in an interview.It is not the first time BP has been the star of a masky show.In 2008, the Federal Security Service, a successor agency to the , arrested an employee in the headquarters of the TNK-BP venture, just up Street from the BP offices, on charges of industrial espionage that were later dropped.That same year, labor and authorities stripped visas and work permits from BP’s expatriate executives — including , who was then the director of TNK-BP and is now BP’s chief executive. Mr. Dudley was compelled to leave Russia and run TNK-BP from an undisclosed location.Whatever the legal issues, and the relative merits, foreign businessmen in Moscow have for years implored the government to refrain from conducting such raids in white-collar cases. Their protests have had little effect.In February, masked and armed law enforcement agents raided ’s main office in Moscow, looking for documents related to a commercial .In November, masked police officers armed with automatic weapons raided a bank belonging to the billionaire , a part owner of the national airline Aeroflot.“It’s fine to do business there,” Mr. Lasov, the risk consultant, said in a telephone interview from . “But you should do business with those sorts of expectations.”'"
"'11-09-01,'0','Federal and state environmental teams on Wednesday investigated the extent of health risks related to damaged sewage and water treatment plants in more than a dozen towns where flash flooding has left thousands of people without electricity or potable water since Sunday.Engineers from the federal and the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation visited several areas that had been cut off to assess the hazards, officials said. The teams were trying to determine the extent of damage to sewage and water plants in at least 13 towns, including chemical and other hazardous material spills and leaks, said Justin Johnson, deputy commissioner of the environmental department.Three days after remnants of the tropical storm that began as spawned torrential downpours in areas rarely bothered by flooding, access in and around much of southern Vermont remained so difficult that officials were unsure how many facilities had been contaminated because they had been unable to send out inspectors until Wednesday.“We have 13 towns on ‘boil water’ notice, where we know there has been some level of damage, but we don’t have an exact count right now,” Mr. Johnson said, adding that he expected the number to grow.He said he was unaware of any illnesses from contaminated facilities.The Vermont National Guard continued to airlift supplies to residents in 13 towns stranded by washed out roadways, damaged bridges, fallen trees and mud. A helicopter from the National Guard joined the relief effort on Wednesday, helping distribute supplies, said Mark Bosma, a spokesman for Vermont Emergency Management.'"
"'11-09-01,'0','SYDNEY, Australia — Australia’s highest court ruled out the government’s plans to ship asylum seekers to Malaysia, including unaccompanied children, as part of a refugee swap deal, saying the program would violate both Australia’s laws and its international commitments.The government said it had hoped to set a very public example by relocating as many as 800 migrants arriving by boat over the next four years, saying that adding obstacles to their quest for legal status and protections as refugees would discourage human trafficking. But advocates denounced the plan as too punishing to the relocated refugees.The court, ruling 6-1, focused on the fact that Malaysia could not offer guarantees for the safety and well-being of asylum seekers as required by Australian law.The immigration minister, Chris Bowen, called the ruling “profoundly disappointing,” but he said the government had not ruled out the possibility of similar deals with other neighbors in the Pacific region that might be found acceptable to the court.The ruling follows an injunction issued last month that halted the agreement, which had been signed in July. Under the deal, migrants arriving by boat — who are mostly from Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq — would have their refugee claims processed by the United Nations in Malaysia. In return, Australia agreed to accept 4,000 United Nations-certified refugees from Malaysia over the same four-year period.'"

"'11-09-02,'0','“Well, you brought it on yourself,” Vanessa says, lighting a cigarette. “You should never have written that Awful Book about her.”I count the ways that Vanessa is wrong, “For the millionth time, it’s not awful and it wasn’t about her.”Vanessa blows smoke at the sky placidly, “That’s not what Mum says. Anyway, I wouldn’t know. I haven’t read it. I won’t. I can’t. I’m brain damaged. Ask Mum.”We’re sitting outside Vanessa’s rock house near the town of Kafue. Wisely, Vanessa has grown up to be an inscrutable artist—fabric, graphics and exuberant, tropical canvases all expressed with a kind of noncommittal chaos—so no one can really pin anything on her. And anyway, no matter what happens, Vanessa always behaves as if everything will resolve itself in time as long as no one panics. Her bathroom, for example, has a tree growing through the middle of its thatched roof—very romantic and picturesque but a pitiful defense against rain and reptiles. Vanessa says vaguely, “Oh, just keep your shoes on and have a good look before you sit anywhere and you should be all right.”The rest of the house, attached to the wildly impractical bathroom, has a total of three tiny rooms for Vanessa, her husband and their several children, but it is built on the summit of a kopje, so it has a sense of possibility, like a closet with cathedral ceilings. We sit outside where the air smells of miombo woodland and we smoke cigarettes and look at the comforting lights from the scores of cooking fires smoldering from the kitchens in the surrounding village. Occasionally we hear a dog barking from the taverns on the Kafue Road and soldiers in the nearby army camp shouting to one another or letting off the odd stray bullet. It’s all very peaceful.“Have another glass of wine,” Vanessa suggests by way of comforting me. “You never know, Mum might forgive you eventually.”In my defense, the Awful Book, whose full and proper title can never be mentioned in the company of my family, was not all my fault. I had felt more than a little encouraged to write it—directed, even—by Nicola Fuller of Central Africa herself. Having given up on my older sister as a potential writer on account of Vanessa’s stubborn refusal to learn how to read or write, Mum settled her literary ambitions on me. I was five when she abandoned the arithmetic section of our weekly Rhodesia Correspondence School packet. “Look Bobo,” she reasoned, “numbers are boring. Anyway, you can always pay someone to count for you, but you can never pay anyone to write for you. Now,” Mum paused and gave me one of her terrifying smiles. “What do you think you’re going to write about?” Then she took a long sip of tea, brushed a couple of dogs off her lap and began to live a life Worthy of Fabulous Literature.Twelve years later, Mum reviewed her life and matched it up against the kind of biography she hoped to inspire, something along the lines of West with the Night, The Flame Trees of Thika or Out of Africa. On the whole, she was satisfied. In fact, all things considered, she felt as if she even may have overdone it in some areas (tragedies, war and poverty, for example). However, there remained one glaring omission from her portfolio: there had been no airplanes, and airplanes had featured prominently in the lives of Mum’s literary role models.“And then, as if by magic,” Mum says, “My Dashing Little Sri Lankan appeared.”My Dashing Little Sri Lankan did not really belong to Mum — although there were whole moments in the course of her relationship with him when you could have been forgiven for thinking exactly that — and there was debate in the family, some of it quite vigorous, as to whether or not he was dashing, but we could all agree that the Sri Lankan was definitely little. His real name was Mr. Vaas and he said he had come to Zambia to escape all the pain and violence of his native land.“Then you should feel quite at home with us,” Dad said, which made Mr. Vaas look at him sharply. But my father said nothing more, returning his attention calmly to Farmers Weekly.On the whole, I took my father’s side. “As usual,” Mum said.“Didn’t the last pilot who stayed with us fly his plane into an electricity pole?” I asked, pouring myself another cup of tea.Without looking up from his magazine, my father said, “I’m afraid so.”“Don’t listen to them,” Mum said, steering Mr. Vaas firmly away from the veranda and tilting him across her garden—an encouraged tangle of bougainvillea and passion fruit vines, beds of lilies and strelitzia, rows of lilac bushes and caladiums looming over borders of impatiens. Mum’s current assortment of dogs gamboled at their heels. “My family bullies me terribly,” she said. Mr. Vaas patted her arm tactfully, for which thelittle man was rewarded with a voracious smile. “You and I,” Mum foretold, “will show them all what real courage looks like. We will be the Blixen and Finch Hatton of Zambia.”Mr. Vaas blinked an SOS back at me and Dad from the gloaming.Now faded Mr. Vaas, then Mum, into the home paddock, where the dairy cattle had come into the open to shelter from the evening mosquitoes. “Come fly with me,” I could hear Mum sing, “let’s fly, let’s fly away. If you can use some exotic booze, there’s a bar in far Bombay. Come fly with me, let’s fly, let’s fly away.”Dad is quite deaf as a result of hearing too many guns go off during the course of his life, not all of them fired by Mum, so he could not hear Nicola Fuller of Central Africa but I felt it was only fair to warn him that Sinatra had entered into the picture. Dad put down his magazine. “Well, good luck to the little Indian,” he said.“Come fly with me,” Mum serenaded — now her voice seemed to be drifting to us from the direction of the tobacco barns — “let’s float down to Peru.”So, encouraged by Mum’s almost aggressive enthusiasm, Mr. Vaas parked his elderly and very basic Cessna on the airstrip by the Mkushi Country Club (whose tennis courts had ruptured little trees and which housed bats in the bar) and declared himself open for business as a flight instructor. Because no one dies in this story, and death tends to sharpen the memory, I can’t now remember who else attended the flying course, but there must have been one or two other farmers and perhaps a couple of farmers’ wives. Anyway, as in almost any story that includes Mum, they are beside the point.Mum took to flying “like a bird to the wing,” she sang, although she had some difficulty with the paperwork required to ensure a reasonably uneventful journey. “Numbers,” she confided, darkly. “I suppose I should have paid more attention when those bloody nuns were trying to teach me how to count.” Navigation and fuel loads, for example, she found “very confusing.” Still, a minor detail like her complete inability to count further than the ten fingers on her two hands did nothing to dissuade either Mum or Mr. Vaas from pursuing her dream of taking to the air all through the smoky haze of that winter and into the first burning days of spring.The late October afternoon on which Mum scheduled her first attempts to take off and land coincided with a full moon. Mum and Mr. Vaas took the creaking Cessna down to the end of the airstrip, its wings juddering in the settling heat of the long day. She turned it into the wind and faced the rising hunter’s moon, blood red in a smoke-stained sky. Mr. Vaas talked Mum through a final instrument check and from the tiny, greasy cockpit window, she looked back at the little tin hut in which the other flying students waited and gave the world her final thumbs-up.The plane rattled down the runway, hopping old antbear holes and kicking up red dust. It gave one or two little jumps, and then it soared upward, tipping this way and that, before clearing the tops of the msasa trees, their new spring leaves paradoxically orange, red and yellow. Mr. Vaas looked over at Mum. “How are we doing, Mrs. Fuller?” For those other students listening in the little tin hut next to the runway, there was a crackly moment and then came the voice of Nicola Fuller of Central Africa, shaking a little with all the uncommon, crazy courage that enabled Mum to see adventure and possibility where others saw only disaster and tragedy. “Fly me to the moon,” came her voice, singing not very steady but clear enough, “let me play among the stars.”There was a pause. Mum looked over at Mr. Vaas and smiled alarmingly. His forehead had broken out in little beads of sweat. “And it takes quite a lot to make a Sri Lankan sweat,” she said afterward.Mum’s voice came over the radio again, stronger now, “Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars.”As the little plane climbed and climbed toward the dropping sun, a brave punctuation of dark purple in a vivid red sky, Mr. Vaas gesticulated wildly. “Go back to land, go back to land!”Mum wanted to fly over the aerial gun stationed on the Mkushi River Bridge. The Rhodesians had blown up this bridge during the Rhodesian Bush War, which seems excessive, even in hindsight, given that the bridge was at least a day or two’s drive from the Rhodesian front lines (roads being what they were). Then, in belated and approximate retaliation (the war having ended), the Zambian army had set up a permanent gunner on the north side of the bridge against the South African Defense Forces. In view of the fact that South Africa is a quarter of a continent away and the real fighting was taking place elsewhere as usual, the Zambian gunners didn’t have much to shoot at. Out of sheer boredom, they’d been known to take beer-fueled potshots at anything within reasonable range: crows, eucalyptus trees, chickens. There was no saying what they would do when faced with an actual unscheduled flight of an honest-to-goodness airplane.Mr. Vaas became very firm. “I don’t have clearance for the bridge. Take her back down to the ground.”Mr. Vaas glared at her. “We land. We take off. We land. We take off. Bump. Bump. Bump. Bump. No bridges and no singing, for God’s sake.”Mum looked at My Little Sri Lankan with sorrowful reproach. “We could go to Zaire,” she offered. “It’s just over those little hills.”Mr. Vaas glared more and more fiercely. “Time to return to earth,” he said.Mum’s eyes misted, but she nodded. “Roger,” she said. She knew then, she said afterward, that she’d never fly alone—as she had dreamed she might—across the high plateau of Zambia, down the escarpment and up the Luangwa River, elephants fanning out ahead of her, the light thinned by altitude and adrenaline into something approaching the perfect light of her childhood. “I took that little plane down and landed it and said good-bye to one more dream,” she said.In memoriam of her dashed dream, Mum put the three volumes of Trevor Thom’s The Air Pilot’s Manual on her bathroom shelf next to Charles Berlitz’s German Step-by-Step and Commander F. J. Hewett’s Sailing a Small Boat. “Well you can’t win them all,” she says. And with her characteristic, if uneven, gift for magnanimity, she forgave My Dashing Little Sri Lankan, even after it became apparent, at least to her, that he was a spectacularly indifferent flight instructor. “As far as I know, not a single one of us passed even the written portion of the exam,” Mum says. But her chin goes up. “In any case, I flew, didn’t I? I flew.”And it is true that no one can take away the day when she flew the plane up over the msasa trees, around the country club grounds and back down again onto the airstrip with a sunset at her tail, the bumpy landing into the face of the great, fiery hunter’s moon. The propeller spun to a halt. The cockpit door opened. Dust settled. For a moment the whole world stopped breathing. Then, while Mr. Vaas mopped his brow in the copilot’s seat, Beryl Markham and Karen Blixen had nothing on the way Mum emerged smiling from the cockpit, flashing a V for Victoria to her adoring fans, real and imaginary.'"

"'11-09-02,'0','NORTON, Mass. — The PGA Tour said Thursday that it had reached an agreement with CBS Sports and the NBC Sports Group that secured the tour’s network broadcast rights into the next decade.With an existing deal that runs through 2012, the new nine-year network agreements will run through the 2021 season. That is almost twice the length of previous network deals, and aligns all involved with the 15-year contract the tour signed with the Golf Channel in 2007.Although the tour declined to disclose the financial details of the contract extension, the PGA Tour commissioner, Tim Finchem, said it was an increase over the current five-year deal, which has been estimated at $3 billion by Bloomberg News.“I don’t like the expression ‘win-win-win,’ but I think in this case, for the tour and for CBS and for NBC is think it really is,” Sean McManus, the chairman of CBS Sports, said in a conference call announcing the deals. “And I think it’s going to prove to be probably an even better deal nine years from now than we think it is today.”The tour was able to pull off a blockbuster deal despite the on-again-off-again presence of Tiger Woods, the former No. 1-ranked golfer who — despite scandal, injury and a two-year winless streak — remains its No. 1 draw.'"
"'11-09-02,'0','That’s a lot of training-table steak for Big Ten member schools, not to mention a financial cushion and an invaluable recruiting tool for the nonrevenue sports that help fill BTN airtime. A swimmer or a softball player with the talent to compete in college is likely to jump at the chance to do so on television.Nebraska’s arrival for the 2011 football season was the fulfillment, for now, of Delany’s ambition. Twelve teams split seamlessly into two six-team divisions, the Legends and Leaders, whose winners will stage a lucrative conference championship game in December. By then, the aroma of scandal wafting over the start of the most anticipated season in the Big Ten’s 115-year football history may have faded.Jim Tressel, 106-22 in 10 years at mighty Ohio State, was forced out in May for failing to act on revelations that several players had violated N.C.A.A. rules by exchanging bowl-game memorabilia and other O.S.U. swag for money and tattoos from a shady character in Columbus.Five months earlier, Rich Rodriguez was ousted after three stormy seasons at Michigan, where he’d been a poor fit before his first practice. Rodriguez drew the N.C.A.A.’s ire for major violations of rules governing practice, which gave Michigan officials cover for dismissing him. A 15-22 record over three seasons, including a 6-18 Big Ten mark and an 0-3 showing against Ohio State, made the decision easier.The Big Ten likes to think of itself as above the shenanigans that routinely take place at, say, Southeastern Conference schools. But the storied legacy of Michigan’s Fab Five basketball team has been expunged from that university’s record books, and a Rose Bowl trip for Illinois occurred almost simultaneously with being placed on probation by the N.C.A.A. in the free-and-easy Mike White era.Illegal practices and freebie tattoos are misdemeanor jaywalking offenses compared with what is said to have gone on at the University of Miami. But Ohio State and Michigan have been the Big Ten’s centerpiece programs since forever, and having them linked to college football’s lawless summer irritated Delany no end.“Fourteen institutions have come under scrutiny the last two years, and two of them were from the Big Ten,” he said. “That’s two too many. It reflects poorly not only on them but on us.”But does anybody care? At the very time that college football has never seemed sleazier, it has never been more popular, especially if the metric is money. Only the N.F.L. commands more in television rights fees. There’s a reason the football coach is the highest-paid employee at any B.C.S.-level school with lofty aspirations. Before the Ohio State mess got irreparably ugly, the university’s president, E. Gordon Gee, scoffed at the idea of firing Tressel, saying he hoped the coach wouldn’t fire him. He was only half kidding.Delany summoned his 12 coaches to a meeting at Big Ten media day in July and laid down the law.  “I reminded them that they’re the C.E.O.’s of their programs, accountable for what happens,” he said.Nice. But getting tough on coaches won’t remove the stench of hypocrisy from the system. Commissioner Roger Goodell has suspended Terrelle Pryor for his first five N.F.L. games over his role in the Ohio State business, but Goodell took no action against former U.S.C. coach Pete Carroll, who split for the Seattle Seahawks just as the N.C.A.A. was about to whack the Trojans with huge penalties for infractions on Carroll’s watch.Nick Saban makes $4 million a year to coach at Alabama, but the Crimson Tide players, who do the heavy lifting on the field, face the loss of their eligibility if they accept anything more than money for tuition, room and board, and books.Don’t athletes deserve at least a tiny slice of the pie they’re responsible for whipping up? It’s a more sensible request than a free tattoo.'"
"'11-09-02,'0','Ross Ramsey, the managing editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.Austin Democrats are pretty unhappy with the Republican redistricting maps produced by the Legislature, and Representative. Lloyd Doggett is the poster child for their frustrations.Their anger might save him.Mr. Doggett’s 25th Congressional District was redrawn to elect a Republican. It reaches from Hays County, just south of Austin, all the way north to Tarrant County (Fort Worth), about 190 miles away.The demographics, from Mr. Doggett’s standpoint, are even worse. Only a quarter of his home county, Travis, is in the district. And while that section has more people than any of the other 12 counties in the mix, it’s just more than a third of the total population.If district residents weren’t busy voting against someone from the liberal state capital, they’d most likely be voting against the guy with the donkey on his shirt: The voters in the new district gave Rick Perry 54.8 percent of the vote in the 2010 election. In 2008, a Democratic year, John McCain, the Republican candidate for president, got 56 percent in the new territory.Mr. Doggett saw those numbers and started shopping for another place to run. He found it in the southeastern part of Travis County in one of the four new Congressional districts added to the Texas map this year because of the state’s extensive growth during the last decade.'"

"'11-09-02,'0','All of which has caused enough consternation among Gravenstein farmers and Gravenstein fans to set off a counteroffensive to “save the Gravenstein,” a motto seen on bumper stickers and handmade signs across the county.Leading the charge is a local chapter of the Slow Food movement, which promotes traditional and sustainably produced foods and which has enlisted dozens of restaurants to feature the apple in dishes and desserts, placed wooden boxes full of free Gravensteins all around Sebastopol and blanketed farmers’ markets with free samples of its juice.Paula Shatkin, the coordinator of the project to save the Gravenstein, says that its roots in Sonoma — it was widely planted here by homesick Russian immigrants in the 1800s — and its unique flavor make its survival crucial.“Some people think they’re the perfect apple,” Ms. Shatkin said. “They’re sweet, they’re tart, they’re juicy. They’re absolutely the best apple for pie, and they make great juice.”Like all classic heroes, however, the Gravenstein has a fatal flaw — or two. The apple ripens earlier than most, but does not travel or age well, unlike big-time brands like the Red Delicious, meaning that getting them to distant markets can be a challenge.All of which has lent the Gravenstein a certain niche in food circles, with special-occasion restaurants like Chez Panisse in Berkeley signing on to use Gravensteins, something that the apple’s fans hope will raise its profile — and price. But while premium grapes — and the wine they make — might be able to command top dollar, farm economists say that consumers will pay only so much for an apple.“If a Gravenstein apple could be sold for 10 times what a Red Delicious could, just as a Sonoma County grape can be sold for 10 times what a Fresno County grape is, you’d be set,” said Daniel Sumner, professor of agricultural economics at the University of California, Davis. “But we haven’t developed a culture where people are willing to.”Mr. Sumner says that the decline of the Gravenstein is part of an age-old cycle on the farm as certain crops go in and out of fashion, often as a result of larger market forces, changes in technology (including irrigation) and competition from other states and countries. And right now, he said, wine is king in Sonoma, where the number of apple-processing plants has shrunk to one.“You can say the culprit is wine grape growers, but I would say the culprit is wine drinkers,” Mr. Sumner said. “If my wino friends were to decide en masse that Sonoma County wine wasn’t as good as they thought it was, and the snobs went in the other direction, the Gravenstein would come back.”For their part, grape growers say they should not be demonized as land-devouring opportunists.“The reason apples’ acreage is declining is not because grapes are pushing them out of the way, it’s because apple growers can’t make any money,” said Nick Frey, president of the Sonoma County Winegrape Commission. “It’s just the economy at play.”Still, Mr. Frey said he sympathized with orchard owners. “There’s a lot of history and a lot of sentimental attachment, but I think if you’re losing money, you can only lose money for so long,” he said.None of which would have been apparent at the annual Gravenstein Apple Fair, in mid-August. Thousands of apple enthusiasts crowded in, taking in bluegrass music, hay rides and a cacophonic display of antique engines.Barbara Walker, whose family has been growing apples in Sonoma County for more than 100 years, said the response to her Gravensteins had been outstanding, with dozens of boxes sold. But at the same time, she understood that like the Gravenstein itself — here today, gone tomorrow — success could be short-lived.“If we don’t start promoting it, and recognizing it and saving it,” Ms. Walker said, “it’s going to die.”'"
"'11-09-02,'0','“We want a fair investigation to discover what exactly happened on June 29, 1996,” said Jamal Bashir al-Gorgi, whose brother Faraj was killed in the massacre. His family had thought his brother was alive for four years after the massacre. They only believed the rumors they heard about killings at the prison when at a Friday market they saw bags of food and clothing they delivered to the prison, each marked with Faraj’s name.The chain of events that led to the massacre began June 28, when the inmates, angered by conditions at the prison, took a guard hostage. Abdullah Senoussi, one of Colonel Qaddafi’s closest confidants and top security officials, was brought in to hear the prisoners’ demands. The inmates asked for better medical care, family visits and more time outside, according to Hussein al-Shafa’i, a witness interviewed by Human Rights Watch.Mr. Senoussi said he would accede to their demands. Instead, they were killed.Nabil Ben Othman remembers the night well. He was one of the lucky ones, a prisoner considered lower security and transferred to the prison’s military wing. On the night of the massacre, Mr. Ben Othman said he heard heavy gunfire and kept track of the time with his watch. It lasted two hours and five minutes, exactly, he said.Mohamed al-Rayes, who was 20 at the time, watched from his house. The guards were firing from the roof of the prison into the outdoor courtyards, he said. When it was over, Mr. Shafa’i calculated that at least 1,200 men had been killed. He worked in the prison kitchen and compared the number of meals he prepared before and after the killings.To this day, there is fevered speculation about what was done to the bodies. Some people said they saw trucks leaving the prison soon afterward, and heard that they had gone to local graveyards, to dispose of the bodies. Other people said the security forces buried them on the grounds, then moved them outside the walls, because of the smell. “It was like living behind a secret,” Mr. Rayes, the neighbor, said.Faraj al-Gorgi’s family heard rumors about the shooting from prison guards, but did not know his fate. To this day, they have never been told the truth. In 2002, security men delivered a death certificate that said Mr. Gorgi had died the year before. No cause of death was included, but a security officer told the family that Faraj had been ill. The family was not told where the body was, but was asked not to erect a large mourning tent, as is the custom. A government minister visited the family and asked them to take compensation and stop asking questions. Mr. Gorgi’s brother, Jamal, said they refused.In Benghazi, many refused, and a few years ago, the families there started holding protests on Saturdays. In February, after revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia had toppled their rulers, the Libyan authorities, nervous about any unrest, arrested Fathi Terbil, a lawyer who represented the Abu Salim families and who had three relatives killed in the massacre. His clients gathered outside the security building where he was being held, and refused to leave until he did, said Mr. Bensoud, whose brother, Abdullah, had been killed in the 1996 massacre.“We decided we had to make it burn,” he said.The protests began to draw people with many grievances. Demonstrators started calling for the downfall of the government. Security forces attacked, the crowds swelled, and one week later Benghazi became home to a revolution. The security forces withdrew.In decades past, Abu Salim was filled mostly with prisoners from eastern Libyan towns like Benghazi, the seat of the opposition, or Darnah, the country’s most pious city. Some were Islamist militants with experience fighting in Afghanistan, and some were picked up simply because they had long beards. The government referred to the men as “heretics.” Secular opponents were also held at the prison and tortured. Many of the men were held without trial and not allowed visits from their families.As the protests grew into an uprising, the cells were jammed with hundreds of men swept up by the security forces, including protesters or even others who happened to walk by a demonstration. Last week, after Colonel Qaddafi fled, the open cells at Abu Salim began to reveal their secrets. Histories were written in graffiti on the walls, or on the covers of boxes in which prison food was delivered.One prisoner had recorded each month of his captivity with a slash mark. The markings stretched for several feet. Another man, Salah Hussein, chose a simpler notation for more than two decades behind bars: He wrote “3/19/1990,” and then “2/15/2011.”They cells were littered with water bottles filled with sand that some prisoners used as weights. Blankets were shredded and fashioned into ladders, to reach a barred window for sunlight. Men left behind English computer books, poetry they wrote on food cartons and many Korans.“It’s changed,” said Mr. Othman, who returned after the liberation to walk through the cells where he had spent 11 years with little sunlight, reading the Koran and learning English from a man who knew a little. He was arrested in 1989, when he was 19, he said, because he used to attend a mosque. The guards hung him by his armpits, then put him in cell 13. All this he recalled as if in a trance, as he walked down the hallways where blindfolded prisoners had been led. Like the other Abu Salim prisoners and families, he was searching for answers and understanding.On Saturday, Mr. Bensoud, who now helps organize the families, was in Tripoli, hoping to make his first visit to Abu Salim prison. He was chasing leads about former security guards at the prison, who might have the answers about the massacre. And he was surprised to learn that important security files were left behind at the prison.“I am hoping to do something for the families,” he said. “There are a lot of stories. This is my brother’s blood. This is the reason why I am here.”'"

In 2009 and 2010 alone, Verizon invested $33.3 billion in infrastructure — sustaining jobs for Verizon union employees and creating jobs at other companies that rely on broadband communications.Given this — and the fact that our chief executive’s 2010 compensation target was about 140 times lower than our tax bill — it was regrettable to see Verizon featured in the article.Despite the opinions of the article’s source, the Institute for Policy Studies, identified as “a liberal-leaning research group,” Verizon fully complies with all tax laws and pays its fair share of taxes.'"
"'11-09-02,'0','There were 263 cancer cases in the exposed population, reflecting a cancer rate 19 percent higher than that of the group not exposed. The cancer rate of the exposed group was only 10 percent higher than that of American men over all. And the group of firefighters who were not exposed had a lower rate than the general population, which the researchers said may be a result of their overall physical fitness and low smoking rates.The research team said the findings should be interpreted cautiously because many cancers caused by exposure to substances found at the site, including asbestos and jet fuel, can take decades to manifest.It can be difficult to reach conclusions in studies like this one because it is hard for investigators to account for factors, other than exposure to toxic ground zero materials, that might contribute to the difference in cancer rates.The study established no link between exposure to the trade center site and particular cancers, though there were indications that certain cancers including melanoma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and thyroid and prostate cancer occurred more frequently among exposed firefighters than in the general population. Occurrences of lung cancer did not increase.“Is it a definitive study? No,” said Dr. James Melius, the administrator of the New York State Laborers’ Health and Safety Trust Fund and one of the peer reviewers of the study. “But it provides information that there may be a significant cancer risk for these people.”Dr. Melius said the study alone would probably not be enough to persuade federal officials to include cancer as one of the diseases covered under the Zadroga Act, because cancer is widespread in the general population. The study was limited to firefighters, who were present in large numbers at ground zero, especially in the first weeks after Sept. 11. He added that these results hinted at a correlation, but did not yet prove a direct link.Still, the study does provide a reassuring jumping-off point for further assessment, said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, who was the lead sponsor of the Zadroga Act in the House. “It’s a scientific study; it is building the case,” she said. “You have to get a consensus in the medical community that supports this. I believe we will.”Fred Blosser, a spokesman for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, said the institute was encouraged by the appearance of additional peer-reviewed studies. The second review will take place in early to mid-2012. “We look forward to giving this paper, plus any others that appear, serious consideration,” Mr. Blosser said.Trish Chelsen, whose husband, Roy, was a New York City firefighter, said she believed his death in January of multiple myeloma was caused by the chemicals at ground zero. “In time, research will prove that, but in medicine, everything is evidence-based,” she said. “He wouldn’t have died at 51, that’s for sure.”Before chemotherapy and two stem-cell transplants sapped his energy, Mr. Chelsen was strong and determined, his wife said, “like a typical Viking.” She said she hoped finding a link between cancer and toxic ground zero materials would save other families from financial difficulties.The Lancet also published other reports related to the Sept. 11 attacks on Thursday, including one by researchers at Mount Sinai Medical Center showing the persistence of respiratory, gastrointestinal and mental illness among rescue and recovery workers. Another report, by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, however, indicated a lower mortality rate among recovery and rescue workers compared to the general population of New York City. Its authors attributed the lower rate to the “healthy-worker effect” — those present at the site were more likely to be employed, a group typically healthier than the general population.Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, head of a Sept. 11 treatment, monitoring and research program at Mount Sinai Medical Center and the principal investigator of the Mount Sinai report, said he had no doubt that time would reveal a connection between certain cancers and exposure to the trade center site. “We know full well that the responders were exposed to a whole soup of carcinogens,” he said. “We’re all looking for a signal today, but we’re all anticipating that the signal will get stronger in the years ahead.”'"
"'11-09-02,'0','Taken at face value, the notion of mixing 18th-century English opera with striptease sounds like the set-up for an obvious wisecrack: It ain’t over till the — well, you figure it out. That being the case, perhaps the most remarkable thing about “The Judgment of Paris,” a scrappy but spirited pastiche presented by Morningside Opera at the East Village bar Jimmy’s No. 43 on Tuesday night, wasn’t its informal setting or libidinous character but its serious foundation in rigorous musicology.A bit of background: In 1700 a group of English nobles, intending to promote native-born opera, offered a prize to the best setting of a William Congreve libretto based on the mythic tale of the shepherd Paris, called on to judge the worthiest among the goddesses Athena, Juno and Venus.John Eccles, Gottfried Finger, Daniel Purcell and John Weldon took up the challenge, with a version by each composer staged in the spring of 1701. Eccles, well known and popular, was favored to win, but the audience crowned the unknown Weldon. Ultimately they all lost to an Italian-opera frenzy fueled by Handel’s arrival in 1710.But posterity has been kind to Eccles, whose version finally prevailed in a 1989 re-enactment during the BBC Proms in London. His music dominated the presentation by Morningside Opera, a young company formed by Columbia University graduate students in 2009, with a few choice arias by Weldon and Purcell inserted for variety and contrast. (The Finger version is lost.)Confined to a few feet of space on the floor directly in front of audience members at tables, the goddesses turned their wiles upon a Paris sung by Michael Shaw, a baritone. Brett Umlauf, a soprano, brought a pealing, focused sound to a sword-swinging Athena. Amber Youell, a mezzo-soprano, played Juno as a snarling, whip-cracking dominatrix; Brittany Palmer, a soprano, was a solicitous vixen as Venus.'"
"'11-09-02,'0','The bond exchange is a crucial component of the more than 200 billion euro ($286 billion) in rescue packages that Europe and the International Monetary Fund have put together to support the near-bankrupt Greek economy through 2014. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and others insisted that banks make such a contribution to give them some political cover at home.The part of the rescue announced in July is subject to the approval of Germany and the governments of the 16 other member nations of the euro union in coming weeks. If investors balk at the 21 percent write-down that is the price for getting a deal done, the whole package could collapse. European governments would be hard-pressed to come up with those extra funds themselves.But with the price of Greek debt trading in some cases at 50 cents on the dollar — even lower than when the bailout deal was announced in July — the 21 percent haircut seems to be quite a bargain.As a bonus, the new bonds would be governed by international law, rather than Greek law. That is a significant alteration of lending terms that would strengthen the negotiating hand of the bondholders if Greece eventually concluded it had no alternative but to default — even after this latest bailout.The International Institute for Finance, the advocacy group for global banks that is also the chief architect of the deal, says that 60 to 70 percent of the financial institutions holding Greek bonds have agreed to the swap so far. That comes close to the 90 percent threshold that the Greek government has stipulated, although it is too early to predict the final outcome because Greece will not formally make the swap offer until October.“This is an attractive offer,” said Hung Tran, a senior executive at the institute. “We are making the case that if this deal is implemented it will restore stability to Greece.”The question remains, however, whether the banks that financed the country’s debt by buying its bonds would get off too easy — and whether the Greek government should have pushed for a larger write-down to ease its debt load.Analysts also note Greece’s diminished bargaining power in any future debt negotiations with its bankers.In past debt negotiations involving countries like Argentina, Uruguay and Russia, the bulk of the debt was governed by either United States or British law. That gave the biggest bondholders the upper hand in negotiating terms; they could either hold out for a better deal or challenge the governments in foreign courts.In the case of Greece’s debt, more than 90 percent of it was issued and is governed under Greek law, as a holdover of the era preceding Greece’s entry into the European monetary union in 2001. That, legal experts say, currently gives the Athens government the flexibility, if it so chooses, to alter bond contracts and secure a more beneficial restructuring deal over the objections of its foreign creditors.For example, the Greek Parliament could pass a law allowing it to push through a restructuring deal with the support of a simple 51 percent majority of creditors — as opposed to the 75 percent level that most international contracts require. More drastically, it could simply refuse to pay and leave it to creditors to seek redress in Greek courts.Debt experts have long argued that this legal quirk gave a powerful bargaining advantage to Greece as it sought to pare down its debt.“No other debtor country in modern history has been in a position significantly to affect outcome of a sovereign debt restructuring by changing some feature of the law by which the vast majority of the instruments are governed,” wrote Lee C. Buchheit, a veteran debt lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, in a paper he co-wrote in 2010 about how Greece might restructure its debt.If the exchange goes through, though, the old bonds will be replaced by ones governed by international law. That would tilt the negotiating scales in favor of Greece’s international creditors.Mr. Buchheit is now advising the Greek government on its debt exchange offer. Neither he or the Greek government would comment on whether Greece would give up too much by losing the local law advantage.There is no doubt that as long as it wants to remain a member of a common currency zone, Greece, unlike Argentina or Russia before it, has limited ability to act in a more proactive manner or threaten to default outright. But there is no question Greece has lost a big bargaining chip.“This was a big concession, but because Greece was not willing to default it had little choice,” said Anna Gelpern, an expert in sovereign debt law at American University in Washington. “But if in another two years their debt stock is still unsustainable and they are willing to walk away from their debt and Europe, then they will be exposed to a higher threat of litigation.”With this latest injection of money, the bet is that Greece will not reach that point of no return.But late Wednesday, a Greek parliamentary committee issued a report saying that Greece’s debt dynamics were “out of control.” Given the depth of the recession — the economy is expected to shrink by more than 5 percent this year — Greece’s ratio of debt to gross domestic product for 2012 is likely to exceed the official forecast of 172 percent, the report said.The government disputed the committee’s findings, prompting the panel’s head researcher to resign on Thursday. But what cannot be disputed is that this year and next, Greece’s debt-to-G.D.P.-ratio will go up — not down.'"
"'11-09-02,'0','G.M. is adding overtime shifts to the Ohio plant that builds the Cruze, and Ford said it is stepping up overall production by 9 percent in the fourth quarter from what it was at the end of 2010. Sales of the Focus, which was redesigned for the 2012 model year, declined 8.9 percent in August despite increased demand for vehicles of its size.The auto industry continues to make big strides in recovery from the depths of the financial crisis. Sales of autos are on track to be well ahead of last year, when 11.6 million vehicles were sold in the United States. G.M. said it remains confident that industry sales will top 13 million vehicles this year, even though several analysts have recently chopped their projections. At G.M.’s projected rate, sales would be roughly back to their 2008 level, when 13.2 million were sold in the United States.“Consumers are being cautious, and appropriately so, but they are not retrenching,” said Don Johnson, G.M.’s vice president for United States sales operations, on a conference call. “All indications to us are that the industry is going to slowly grow for the rest of this year.”But Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, questioned whether G.M. is “playing chicken” with the economy by maintaining or increasing production even as consumer confidence levels slide. G.M. “could get caught out with large production cuts and/or price discounting should the underlying market not recover as G.M. appears to have anticipated,” Mr. Jonas wrote in a report Thursday afternoon.Ford officials said the company is not stockpiling extra inventory in preparation for a possible strike by the United Automobile Workers union, a typical practice for the Detroit carmakers during past negotiations. U.A.W. members have been overwhelmingly voting this week in favor of authorizing a strike against Ford if contract talks break down.Labor experts say a strike against Ford is unlikely, but union leaders have been urging workers to approve an authorization as a bargaining tool. At least 98 percent of workers have voted in favor of authorizing a strike at large U.A.W. locals in Chicago, Cleveland, Louisville and Kansas City, Mo. Voting is scheduled to finish Friday. Ford is the only Detroit carmaker whose workers can strike over wages and benefits. G.M. and Chrysler employees agreed to no-strike clauses as part of concessionary deals they approved before those companies’ bankruptcies in 2009.Chrysler said its August sales rose 30.6 percent, including a 58 percent increase for its Jeep brand of sport utility vehicles. It was the 17th consecutive month of year-over-year increases for Chrysler, which is gathering momentum after being written off by many critics. The company outsold Toyota by 636 vehicles, the third time this year that Chrysler has topped its larger, but injured, Japanese rival.Nissan, which was able to return to normal production levels much faster that Honda and Toyota, reported a 19.2 percent gain. Nissan ran ads last month juxtaposing the abundance of inventory at its dealerships with bare Honda showrooms.Sales rose 9.1 percent at Hyundai and 26.9 percent at Kia.Consumer confidence has slipped recently, and economic growth has been crimped by the persistent European debt crisis and the debate in Washington over how to cut spending by the federal government.As August began, markets swooned with uncertainty over whether Congress would lift the debt ceiling and with the subsequent cut in the nation’s credit rating. The month ended with much of the East Coast focused more on Hurricane Irene than on buying a new car. In addition, some shoppers probably stayed on the sidelines in the hopes of getting a good deal during the coming holiday weekend, said Jeff Schuster, executive director of global forecasting at J.D. Power and Associates.“We did see things get a little bit weaker as we got into the second half of the month,” Mr. Schuster said. “Many buyers are still conditioned to the strong Labor Day sales, so we could have seen some buyers pull back their purchase decisions waiting for some deals.”From January through July, industry sales rose 10.9 percent. Excluding the 7.1 percent decline at Toyota and 2.6 percent decline at Honda, the industry gain was 16.6 percent in the period.Nissan pulled further ahead of G.M. last month in the battle between the Leaf electric car and the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid. Leaf sales for the month were 1,362, more than quadruple the Volt’s 302. Since they were introduced late last year, the Leaf has outsold the Volt by two to one.G.M. halted production of the Volt this summer to retool in preparation for an large increase in production and said it is still working to build enough inventory to meet demand. It has promised significantly higher Volt sales in the months ahead.“Every unit that we ship right now is presold,” said Alan Batey, the head of Chevrolet sales in the United States. “It’s essentially a magnet for us. It’s doing a wonderful job for the brand.”'"
"'11-09-02,'0','NEW DELHI — Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged fire over the border that divides the disputed province of Kashmir late Wednesday night, military officials in both countries said Thursday.Each accused the other of starting the shooting. Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, the Pakistani Army spokesman, said that Indian soldiers had killed three Pakistani soldiers in a volley of gunfire that was “totally unprovoked.”But Col. J. S. Brar, a spokesman for the Indian Army in Kashmir, said that the shooting began over an infiltration attempt by Pakistani militants on Tuesday night and that Indian troops had fired across the contentious border only after incoming fire wounded one of their soldiers. An Indian officer was killed, he added.“The Indian Army has never violated the cease-fire,” Colonel Brar said.General Abbas said that Indian soldiers fired on three Pakistani paramilitary soldiers who were moving from one post to another in the Neelum Valley.“They were engaged by fire from across the Line of Control,” General Abbas said, referring to  the line that divides the disputed territory between the two estranged neighbors. “Subsequently, they lost their way, and later on their bodies were recovered yesterday.”Colonel Brar described the episode as an “infiltration attempt,” adding that if “anybody tries to infiltrate to our side, whether a soldier or a terrorist, we will try to stop it.”'"
"'11-09-02,'0','He added: “We require that our supplier provide safe working conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect, and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes wherever Apple products are made.”Apple’s products have grown hugely popular in China, which already has the world’s busiest Apple stores. But the company has also been dogged by challenges here, though Apple does not typically disclose its list of suppliers.Last year, one of Apple’s biggest suppliers was hit by a wave of worker suicides at several of its mainland Chinese facilities. And in May, an explosion and fire at a plant that made Apple products killed two people and injured more than a dozen in the city of Chengdu, in southwest China.Also earlier this year, Apple acknowledged that 137 workers at a Chinese factory near the city of Suzhou had been seriously injured by a toxic chemical used in making the signature slick glass screens of the iPhone.But Apple is hardly the only company facing criticism over its Chinese supply chain. In recent years, dozens of multinationals have been accused of using Chinese factories that employed child labor, violated the country’s labor laws and fouled its waterways.Supply chain experts say brand-name companies generally do a better job of monitoring and auditing their suppliers than smaller companies in China.But most experts agree that while conditions have improved at many work sites, labor violations and the discharge of toxic waste remain major problems.Apple said it carried out its own regular audits of supplier factories. It issues a report each year detailing problems it faced and explaining its monitoring practices and how it induces suppliers to correct violations within 90 days.In many cases, Apple says that its audits are the first conducted by any company on the facilities, and that many of those involve environmental audits.But Ma Jun, the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, said Thursday that Apple had a poor environmental record and that the company had been less responsive to the group’s investigations than other electronics makers.A similar report on Apple was issued by his group last January.“Apple has made this commitment that it’s a green company,” Mr. Ma said by telephone Thursday. “So how do you fulfill your commitment if you don’t consider you have responsibility in your suppliers’ pollution?”'"

Otto Mrugalski, who is directing search and rescue efforts, said no remains of the plane had been found around the islands, which lie about 420 miles off Chile’s coast.The mayor of the islands, Leopoldo Gonzalez, told state television that passengers’ belongings had been found in the ocean about a half-mile from the airport’s landing strip. A local radio station, Bio Bio, later cited Mr. Gonzalez as saying that a door of the plane had been found in the water.Felipe Paredes, who works in the control tower, said he saw the plane struggling to land and cited heavy winds and sporadic rain. “When the plane was blown off course by the wind, it managed to pull up again,” Mr. Paredes said. He said he then lost sight of the plane.TVN national television said five of its staff members were among the passengers, including an anchor, Felipe Camiroaga.'"
"'11-09-03,'0','Just installing the small number of IR-2 centrifuges, and a handful of more advanced models called the IR-4, was something of a victory for Iran in its cat-and-mouse game with the West. The United States and its allies went to extraordinary lengths to prevent Iran from obtaining crucial supplies, including blocking the export of a special form of steel needed to operate the equipment at high speed. Hundreds more machines would be needed before Iran had the capability to ramp up production significantly.The software worm known as Stuxnet, which hit Iran more than a year ago and slowed progress toward obtaining nuclear weapons training, was aimed at the first-generation centrifuges, which Iran called the IR-1 (for Iran-1). That equipment came from the Khan network of illicit suppliers. Yet the IR-1s were so notoriously unreliable that they broke down even when they were not the target of cyberattacks.“What we’ve needed to do with Iran from the start was to buy time,” one senior Obama administration official said recently. “The fact that it has taken them this long to evade sanctions and build these new centrifuges tells you they are operating pretty slowly.”The report also warned anew of what the I.A.E.A. called “possible military dimensions” of Iran’s program, including suspected work on a “nuclear payload for a missile, about which the agency continues to receive new information.” It did not specify what that information was, and the Iranians have claimed that all such information to the agency is fabricated. A diplomat in Vienna, speaking anonymously under the usual ground rules, said that the language in the report in which the agency says it is “increasingly concerned” over Iran’s refusal to answer questions about the evidence indicated an escalation in the agency’s rhetoric.“It’s not explosive,” the diplomat said, referring to the report. “But if you’re reading the tea leaves, it stands out.”The cranky IR-1 stands over six feet tall. Inside, a hollow rotor of aluminum spins uranium gas, slowly enriching the material in the rare isotope that can be turned into fuel for reactors and warheads. But the design is so antiquated and inefficient, that even Pakistan stopped using those centrifuges long ago. There are tales of catastrophic failures in the machines, which spin at supersonic speeds. The Stuxnet attack was designed to speed them up, and make them explode.In an April 2006 speech, Mr. Ahmadinejad boasted that the nation was embarking on a new generation of more advanced centrifuges that would quadruple Iran’s enrichment powers. Those centifuges were also based on a design obtained from Mr. Khan. Iran failed to obtain a very hard type of steel to make rotors for them. So, in secret, the Iranians developed their own, with the rotor made of carbon fibers.The West got its best look at the technology in April 2008, when Mr. Ahmadinejad toured the Natanz plant. Photographs showed him viewing a disassembled IR-2, its guts arrayed on a table.'"
"'11-09-03,'0','A spacecraft financed by Jeffrey P. Bezos, the billionaire chief executive of Amazon.com, crashed during a test flight in West Texas, Mr. Bezos said on Friday.No one was on board for the flight, and no one on the ground was injured when the spaceship went out of control on Aug. 24.After the crash was reported Friday afternoon on The Wall Street Journal’s Web site, Mr. Bezos acknowledged the failure on the Web site of his space company, Blue Origin. The vehicle reached an altitude of 45,000 feet and a speed of 1.2 times the speed of sound before a “flight instability” occurred.“Not the outcome any of us wanted,” Mr. Bezos wrote, “but we’re signed up for this to be hard, and the Blue Origin team is doing an outstanding job. We’re already working on our next development vehicle.”The company released a photograph of the stubby cylindrical rocket in flight before the malfunction.Blue Origin, based in Kent, Wash., is developing a suborbital spaceship called New Shepard, which is to take off and land vertically for carrying people to the near edge of space.The company did not announce plans for the latest flight test beforehand, but the Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary flight restriction for the morning of Aug. 24, telling aircraft to stay out of the air space around Van Horn, Tex., “due to rocket launch activity” by Blue Origin.When the time period passed, the notice disappeared from the F.A.A. Web site, with no comment from Blue Origin.Blue Origin is parsimonious in giving updates about its progress, even when it is successful.When it got a test vehicle off the ground in November 2006 — reaching a not-so-high altitude of 285 feet — Mr. Bezos waited a month and a half before letting anyone outside of Blue Origin know. That was the last update on the Web site for four and a half years, until Friday. In addition to the failure, Mr. Bezos said the company had conducted a successful “short hop” flight test three months ago.'"
"'11-09-03,'0','The proposal is part of a larger revision of the criminal procedural code that has in other respects won praise from some legal experts, because it would give many ordinary criminal suspects new legal protections and rein in the ability of the authorities to commit abuses.For example, the proposed text, which has just been published, appears to bar the use of evidence obtained by torture. It would give most criminal suspects an unqualified right to see a lawyer, and would extend requirements that witnesses actually appear at trials to give testimony.While these are basic tenets of criminal procedure elsewhere, they are potentially groundbreaking advances in China, where the court system is not an independent branch of government, but rather answers to the Communist Party, whose overriding concern is maintaining state power.It remains to be seen whether the revisions, if they are enacted, will be implemented as written. Some analysts have expressed skepticism that a ban on evidence obtained by torture could be effective, for example, because lawyers do not yet have the right to be present at interrogations, when most torture occurs.“The balance between using the law to protect society and using the law to protect individual rights is still heavily weighted on the side of protecting society,” said Joshua Rosenzweig, an independent human rights analyst based in Hong Kong and a leading expert on China’s criminal procedure. “And, one could more cynically say, on the side of protecting the party.”If the past is any indication, the proposed revisions concerning forced disappearances are likely to affect a relatively small number of people, mostly dissidents and other thorns in the state’s side. But their narrow impact does not reduce their significance, Mr. Rosenzweig argued.Enforced disappearances are widely regarded as human-rights abuses because they deny suspects legal protections, needlessly subject relatives of the disappeared to mental strain and generally increase the chances that unsupervised officials who hold captives in undisclosed locations will engage in torture. Liu Xiaoyuan, a prominent defense lawyer known for his involvement in controversial cases, called the proposed revision “just scary.”“It literally gives the police a ticket to free themselves from any form of supervision,” he said. “The criminal law should protect citizens’ rights and restrict the power of the authorities. The new revision does exactly the opposite.”Caixin, an intrepid investigative business magazine, called the provision a “grab-bag justification that would lead to investigative organs being able to decide as they please whether or not to inform family members, and to secret detentions running rampant.”The proposal has not been approved, and could still change, although most experts consider that highly unlikely. Already, it has been the object of vigorous public criticism on some of the nation’s major microblogs; one post charged that it had “pushed the Chinese people’s sense of insecurity to a new height.” Another post said, “The new criminal law should be called ‘special people-controlling regulations for chaotic times.’ ”Some analysts said they saw progress of a sort in the criticism. “Chinese citizens today no longer take it as a matter of course that the government has a God-given right to draw up any law it pleases,” said Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher for Human Rights Watch who is based in Hong Kong.In June, a United Nations working group on enforced disappearances expressed growing concern about the rise in such cases inside China, calling them “the continuation of a disturbing trend in the suppression of dissidents.”“There can never be an excuse to disappear people, especially when those persons are peacefully expressing their dissent with the government of their country,” the group said in a written statement.Two United Nations conventions, one enacted in 1976 and the other last December, commit member nations to refrain from making their citizens disappear in this way and to protect their legal rights. China has pledged to ratify both conventions, but has yet to do so. Nor has the United States ratified the 2010 convention, which explicitly prohibits enforced disappearances.Like Mr. Ai, many of China’s disappeared eventually resurface, some showing signs of having undergone arduous treatment while in captivity. Others have vanished without explanation for extended periods, including the Nobel Prize winning writer and dissident Liu Xiaobo, who vanished for six months in 2008 and 2009.And some do not return at all, like the prominent human-rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, who has not been heard from since he disappeared in April 2010.

"'11-09-03,'0','The trustee is suing the Mets for $1 billion in connection with the fraud, but the Mets, unlike the Dodgers, did not file for Chapter 11 protection in bankruptcy court and do not have to disclose their legal fees in the trustee case.In the case of the Dodgers, Dewey & LeBoeuf’s 171-page bill drones on with the work of 46 lawyers and staff members, including preparing memos, drafting motions, attending meetings, going to hearings, requesting discovery, devising strategy, speaking to the news media, exchanging e-mails and talking with McCourt.Each job is diced into 0.1 hourly fragments as if they were legal atoms.On July 1, Sidney Levinson billed $232.50 to answer media requests for 0.3 of an hour, or 18 minutes.Although the only mention of him that day, according to Nexis, showed that he declined to comment to The Los Angeles Times, he might have been stealthily speaking to reporters on background.Later that day, Levinson billed $310 for 24 minutes that he spent reviewing news media reports.A few days earlier, another partner, Joshua Mester, billed $507.50 to analyze the case’s coverage.The news media’s focus on the case is natural: a storied Los Angeles team files for Chapter 11 protection, which becomes the third ring in a circus along with McCourt’s battles against Commissioner Bud Selig and McCourt’s divorce from his wife, Jamie. On July 8, a Dewey & LeBoeuf paralegal billed $80 to find out the “date of decision for McCourt divorce.” Time to determine splitsville: 24 minutes.“I review clips because it’s part of my responsibility to respond to press inquiries,” said Bennett, whose first high-profile sports case is being covered by baseball reporters and the financial press. “I do my best to make sure what’s going on in the case is accurate.”On June 29, he booked nearly $1,500 in fees to discuss news media coverage with an executive of Kekst and Company, the Dodgers’ public relations firm.Dewey & LeBoeuf’s focus diverted, ever so slightly, from the Dodgers to another team on July 6. Christopher Lowden, a research librarian at the firm, billed $48 to find articles about David Einhorn’s now-rejected proposal to buy a one-third share of the Mets. Why scan the news for Einhorn? Perhaps it jibes with McCourt’s claims that Selig has been far nicer to the Mets in their financial doldrums than he has been to the Dodgers.Consider now, this leap from $48 in research to the $15,280 billed by one partner for one day’s work.Such was July 18 for Matthew Walsh, who makes $800 an hour. Two days before a critical hearing in bankruptcy court, Walsh performed nine discrete tasks over 19.1 hours, spending as little as 0.3 of an hour on a declaration by a Dodgers executive and as much as 4.5 hours at a deposition.On another July day, Ella Serrano, a $650-an-hour associate, billed $9,815 to do 19 things in 15.1 hours, including a review of the “needs further review” folder.July 20 was a big day for fees — a hearing in Wilmington, Del., where lawyers for the Dodgers and Major League Baseball argued over the $150 million loan. Three partners, Bennett, Levinson and Walsh, were in court. A fourth, Philip Abelson, listened by telephone. Together, they billed nearly $39,000 for 46 hours.And baseball won the right to make the loan, out of which the Dodgers will pay Dewey & LeBoeuf.With months left in the Dodgers’ bankruptcy, the fees will only swell, unlike the team’s attendance.“They will vary,” Bennett said. “August was a lot. The first one or two months are going to be on the high side; the other months are high or low depending on the activity in those months.”Kevin Gross, the bankruptcy court judge, will determine how much Dewey & LeBoeuf will receive.The firm has discounted its $1.7 million in billings to $1.37 million, plus $31,682 in expenses. On the lowest rung of costs, the law firm revealed that it is giving the Dodgers a deal. On photocopies. Usually, the firm charges clients 25 cents a page. For the struggling Dodgers? Ten cents apiece for $5,851.20 in copies.'"
"'11-09-03,'0','Judge Shira Scheindlin of Federal District Court in New York made the right call when she refused to dismiss a lawsuit against the , which alleged that officers use race as a basis for stopping and frisking citizens, rather than reasonable suspicion. The trial will provide an important opportunity to evaluate this increasingly troubling program, which resulted in 600,000 people being stopped on the streets last year alone.The stop-and-frisk tactic is as old as policing itself. But it has been a central law enforcement tool in New York since the 1990’s, when the police adopted the “broken windows” approach, clamping down on minor crime and emphasizing preventive measures against lawbreaking.New York has experienced a dramatic reduction in crime. But as Judge Scheindlin pointed out, there is no conclusive proof that widespread use of stop-and-frisk itself drove down crime. Crime fell in many cities, including those that did not adopt the approach.There is no dispute that minorities are disproportionately singled out. Blacks and Hispanics make up a little more than half of the city’s population but about 85 percent of the people stopped. Supporters of the program argue that minority men are disproportionately represented among offenders as well. But analyses dating back more than a decade have shown that it is not so simple.As Judge Scheindlin notes in her opinion, a report by the legal scholar Jeffrey Fagan found that blacks and Latinos were more likely to be stopped at police discretion, not just in high-crime, high-minority areas, but in districts where crime is minimal and populations are mixed.Police officials say that officers stop people when they have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. An analysis last year by The Times of street stops in one mainly black neighborhood found that officers listed vague reasons in half the stops, including “furtive movement,” a category that can be used to mask harassment.'"
"'11-09-03,'0','“In those days, you could easily ship out a million copies of a book,” said Beth de Guzman, the editor in chief of paperbacks for Grand Central Publishing, part of the Hachette Book Group. “Then shelf space started decreasing and decreasing for mass market, and it has especially declined in the last several years.”For decades, the mass-market paperback has stubbornly held on, despite the predictions of its death since the 1980s, when retail chains that edged out independent bookstores successfully introduced discounts on hardcover versions of the same books. The prices of print formats are typically separated by at least a few dollars. Michael Connelly, the best-selling mystery writer best known for “The Lincoln Lawyer,” said he worried that book buyers would not be able to discover new authors very easily if mass-market paperbacks continued to be phased out.“Growing up and reading primarily inexpensive mass-market novels, it allows you to explore,” he said. “I bought countless novels based on the cover or based on the title, not knowing what was inside.”The growth of the e-book has forced a conversation in the publishing industry about which print formats will survive in the long term. Publishers have begun releasing trade paperbacks sooner than the traditional one-year period after the release of the hardcover, leaving the mass-market paperback even further behind.Cost-conscious readers who used to wait for the heavily discounted paperback have now realized that the e-book edition, available on the first day the book is published, can be about the same price. For devoted readers of novels, people who sometimes voraciously consume several books in a single week, e-books are a natural fit.“It’s a question of, do you still want to wait for the book?” said Liate Stehlik, the publisher of William Morrow, Avon and Voyager, imprints of HarperCollins. “The people who used to wait to buy the mass-market paperback because of the price aren’t going to wait anymore.”That could be good news for authors who make up for a loss in mass-market sales with increases in e-book sales. Generally speaking, authors make more royalties on an e-book than on a paperback.E-book best-seller lists are packed with the genre novels that have traditionally dominated paperback best-seller lists.“In some ways, the e-book is yesterday’s mass market,” said Matthew Shear, the executive vice president and publisher of St. Martin’s Press, which currently has books by Janet Evanovich and Lora Leigh on the paperback best-seller list in The New York Times.Mass-market paperback sales have been sliding since giant bookstore chains and later Amazon.com started heavily discounting hardcovers in the 1980s and 1990s. The decline has deepened in the last two years, said Kelly Gallagher, the vice president of publishing services for Bowker, a research organization for the publishing industry.“You can’t list a single thing that has caused its demise,” he said. “But as e-books become more affordable and better aligned to the mass-market reader, I would have to say that I don’t think there are encouraging signs that print mass-market books will rise again. When all these things align against a certain format or category, it’s hard to recover.”Ms. de Guzman said that Barnes & Noble used to keep a large display solely for mass-market paperbacks in the front of its stores, but that has disappeared. Borders, once a strong seller of mass-market paperbacks, especially romance, is in the process of liquidating all of its stores.Several publishers said Wal-Mart, a major seller of mass-market paperbacks, has been quietly revamping its book selection to include fewer mass-market paperbacks and more trade paperbacks, which have higher production values: better-quality paper and larger covers.Even airport stores, traditionally a mainstay retailer of mass-market paperbacks, are shunning them more frequently in favor of hardcovers and trade paperbacks.Sara Hinckley, the vice president of book-buying and promotions for Hudson Booksellers, said that the stores had gradually decreased their selection in recent years, while increasing their array of hardcovers and trade paperbacks. Sales in trade paperbacks, she said, have continued to increase in recent years. Last fall, in 60 of its stores, Hudson cut the display space for mass-market paperbacks in half.“With less demand and less retail shelf space for the format, and higher retails on the trade papers, there simply isn’t as much publishing into the format, which in turn creates declining sales,” Ms. Hinckley said in an e-mail.Some publishers have responded by releasing books in trade paperback format before the mass-market edition. Grand Central Publishing plans to release trade paperback versions of “The Sixth Man” by David Baldacci and “Lethal” by Sandra Brown — the first time those authors’ thrillers have been published in trade paperback.After 20 years as a best-selling author, Mr. Connelly will experience a first this fall: his latest legal thriller, “The Fifth Witness,” will be released as a trade paperback by Grand Central.“From my standpoint, which is probably pure vanity, the trade paperback edition is often the way of publishing more literary novels,” Mr. Connelly said. “So for me, it’s a cool ego thing — I get to be in the trade edition. But beyond that, I’m hoping it works.”'"
"'11-09-03,'0','At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in a statement, “Turkey’s decision will significantly contribute to NATO’s capability to provide protection to its European territory, populations and forces against the growing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles.”Even Russia, which has expressed concern about the missile shield despite American assurances that Russia is not the perceived threat, appeared to have no objections to Turkey’s participation. “The deployment of a radar in Turkey is not a direct threat to Russia’s strategic nuclear forces,” the Russian representative to NATO, Dmitri O. Rogozin, was quoted as saying by Russia’s Interfax news agency.None of the official statements about Turkey’s announcement mentioned Iran, and there was no mention of the announcement in Iran’s state-run news media except a brief dispatch by Press TV, an Internet news site intended for foreign consumption.But American and NATO military officials have in the past gone out of their way to make clear that the missile shield plan was designed to deter Iran. They are not only concerned about Iran’s claimed advances in its own missile technology, but say they suspect that Iran may be working on weaponizing its uranium supply, including the development of nuclear warheads for missiles.Iran has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program is peaceful. In recent months, however, it has bragged not only about an increased ability to produce enriched uranium, but it has publicly reported advances in its missile technology. In June, Iran unveiled underground silos that would make its missiles less vulnerable to attack.Last year, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an arms analysis group in London, reported what it called “emerging evidence” of Iranian silos that could fire missiles at Iraq, Israel, Turkey and countries throughout the Persian Gulf. The institute said the most logical reason for such silo construction was “to prepare to field larger missiles.”Turkey’s decision to participate in the NATO missile shield plan was notable partly because Turkey, in a friendly gesture to Iran, had sought in the past year to help mediate the conflict between Iran and the West over Iran’s nuclear program. Turkey even hosted a diplomatic conference attended by them in January, which ended with no progress.Since then, frictions between Iran and Turkey have increased, in particular over the Syrian government’s harsh crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising. Turkey has become a vocal critic of the Syrian government because of the crackdown, while Iran is one of Syria’s few remaining defenders.The timing of Turkey’s announcement on Friday was also notable because it came the same day Turkey downgraded relations with Israel — a decision that distressed American officials. Turkey took the action after Israel refused to apologize for the deadly assault last year on a pro-Palestinian aid flotilla seeking to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza.Turkey’s increasingly chilly relationship with Israel had also been an element in the prelude to Turkey’s participation in the NATO missile shield. Some officials in Turkey had feared that information collected by the radar site might be shared with Israel. It was unclear from the announcement on Friday whether those fears had been addressed.'"
"'11-09-03,'0','LONDON — A 30-year-old man was arrested Friday as part of investigations into phone hacking, the police said in a statement. He became the 15th person held since a wide-ranging new inquiry into criminality at Rupert Murdoch’s News of the World newspaper began early this year.An official at News International, the parent company of the now-shuttered News of the World, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the man as Ross Hall, a former reporter with the newspaper. A spokeswoman for News International declined to comment.The police statement said that the man was arrested by appointment on Friday afternoon, “on suspicion of conspiracy to intercept voice mail messages” and obstructing justice, as part of Operation Weeting, the arm of the investigation focused particularly on phone hacking.The arrest came as the phone hacking scandal, bumped from the front pages here amid widespread riots last month, looks set to resume the steady pace of revelations that had struck the heart of the British media, politics and policing in recent months.On Tuesday, the day after members of Parliament return from their summer recess, the House of Commons will call several former senior executives from The News of the World and News International, including the former editor of the tabloid, Colin Myler, and the company’s former legal manager, Tom Crone, to give evidence.'"
"'11-09-03,'0','The pitfalls for widows are well-enough known that there are books for them, including “New Widow Financial Lifeline” and “Moving Forward on Your Own.” I also recommend a 20-page offering on the Web site of Timberchase Financial, a financial planning firm that works with many widows, called “What Do I Do Now?”But even a brief pamphlet may be too much for the grief-stricken to digest right away. In the meantime, widows can avoid many of the big financial pitfalls by keeping just four things in mind.THE RUSH Some financial tasks you must do within a month or two of a spouse’s death. Keep paying the bills, including any quarterly tax charges. Make sure you understand how your health insurance works, if it comes from your dead spouse’s employer. Collect on any life insurance policies, especially if cash is running low.Just about everything else can wait a little longer because you will probably not be in the clearest frame of mind. “I did not know my Social Security number one day when I was filling out a form,” said Kathleen Rehl, a financial planner in Land O’ Lakes, Fla., who is the author of “Moving Forward on Your Own.” “I had helped widows before. But when I became one, I really got it. I was stuck in shock phase.”Jennifer M. Murray, who is also both a widow and financial planner, has a rule for her own widowed clients, who make up 50 percent of her practice: no irreversible decisions soon after the death of a spouse.It can be hard to resist big, decisive moves, though, given that a lump sum insurance check may be landing and a widow may desperately want to march through every important decision and get on with her life. But hasty decisions about, say, paying off the mortgage can lead to a lot of regret if you need more liquidity years later.Then there are the bad actors who prey on the recently widowed. Many surviving spouses immediately crave secure investments offering regular income that never runs out. So you’ll no doubt hear from people selling all manner of annuities, which have the tendency to enrich the salesperson at your expense.Even if you’re certain that you want this sort of lifetime income stream, have an independent financial planner who is earning only fees from you look it all over. In fact, if you’re tempted to do anything quickly with a significant chunk of your net worth, pay three different professionals for another opinion, just to be sure that you know what you’re in for.THE HOME One problem with rushing to, say, pay off your mortgage is that it may not ultimately be wise to remain in a house.Even if the mortgage and real estate taxes seem manageable, there is the lawn, snow removal and the endless repairs that go along with homeownership. “All of these are expenses that most women don’t seem to anticipate until they happen,” Ms. Murray said.When her husband died in 2004, she was 43 years old and decided to stay put with her two children in Chatham, N.J. The house isn’t big, and neither is the mortgage; her son handles snow and the lawn.Ms. Rehl, who is 64, also stayed in her Florida home when her husband died in 2007, but she understands the instinct to put it on the market and flee. “That empty house can be terrifying,” she said.Often, adult children will urge their widowed mother to move in with them in a different city. Ms. Rehl suggests caution here. “The idea of living with your son and not being alone may sound wonderful,” she said. “Granted, that might be the right decision. But maybe think in terms of a long visit first, and then come back and think.”THE PURSE It isn’t just annuity salesmen who see widows as a source of income. People much closer to her may have the same outlook.Adult children may see an opportunity to request an advance on their inheritance. Cunning offspring will push all the emotional buttons. “How can you deny me this when we’re going through so much emotional pain already?” they may ask. Or they may trot out this gem: “Dad would have given me the down payment money if he was still here.”Saying no will not be easy. If you have a financial planner or accountant helping you, you can let that professional be the stingy one. And if you succumb to the advance-on-my-inheritance approach, put it in writing so that there’s no confusion later on why one sibling is getting a bigger share of any future estate than another.Then, there are the not-always-gentlemen callers. Wily widows of means are wary of men seeking “purses” (or nurses, for that matter). “They thought I would be a soft touch,” Ms. Rehl said of some of the men who turned up in recent years. “I tell my widowed clients that it is probably a good idea to investigate them. I have done my own criminal background searches and discovered that one person who I didn’t date that long had a lien on his property and had declared bankruptcy in the past.”The point here is not that all adult children are greedy and that all older men are gold-digging deadbeats. But with sadness comes vulnerability, and there is nothing selfish about saying no, a lot, in the first few years after you lose your husband.THE GHOST Once you’re a widow, your budget and long-term planning needs will almost certainly change. Oddly enough, however, many men try to dictate financial advice from the grave.People do this with the best of intentions, but it can be terribly misguided. Take the trust that Anthony J. Ogorek, a financial planner in Williamsville, N.Y., saw once. “He carved it in stone 30 years earlier that the money could only be in AT&T stock and AAA-rated bonds,” Mr. Ogorek said. Fast-forward to today: AT&T is hardly the monopoly it once was, and the United States government no longer has a pristine AAA rating.Mr. Ogorek refers to this as “fighting the ghost,” where stubborn dead men leave concentrated collections of Cooper Tire & Rubber or United Parcel Service stock along with instructions never to touch it. And their widows, either as a gesture of loyalty or because they genuinely believe that this is the last bit of protection that they have left from their late spouse, can’t bear to defy them.But it is rare that a concentrated position in any investment is good for a widow. “In the quest to protect her, he’s created a vulnerability,” Mr. Ogorek said.Solving for this emotional trap can be relatively simple, though. It is possible, after all, that your late husband was right at the time and that the stock has done well and paid dividends. So your desire to take fewer risks isn’t tantamount to declaring his investment plan a failure.But things change. And given that you’re in the middle of one of the most transformative ones of your life, you have every right to alter your investments a little bit, too.'"

"'11-09-04,'0','Beginning Tuesday, for the first time, owners of the 1.83 million real estate parcels in Cook County will be able to file online appeals of their tax bills.Previously, to appeal a tax assessment, property owners had to submit paperwork in person downtown, at the county’s satellite offices in the suburbs or at outreach sessions where county officials help prepare appeals cases.The new online filing system will be accessible at cookcountyboardofreview.com. The county’s Board of Review is the three-member panel that decides on appeals from taxpayers who challenge the county assessor’s valuations of their properties.Michael Cabonargi, one of the three board commissioners, said he expected the new online option to increase the number of appeals. The board staff reviewed more than 380,000 in 2010.Also for the first time this year, property owners who attend the outreach sessions can fill out a one-page form explaining why they deserve a tax break. Officials say the forms will allow many appellants to avoid traveling to the board’s downtown offices to argue their cases before a hearing officer.'"
"'11-09-04,'0','“The patient came back to the hospital; we got paid,” said Karen Rago, a nurse who is the executive director of U.C.S.F.’s service line administration.The center’s approach to reducing readmissions requires staff members to spend more time with patients. And it begins long before the patient is ready to leave the hospital.A nurse known as a heart failure program coordinator spends at least one hour explaining the patient’s condition to the patient and his or her family, and preparing them to manage it outside the hospital setting.“Really getting to know the person, before you treat the patient,” can make a big difference, said Eileen Brinker, one of the two program coordinators.Heart failure patients typically need to reduce the amount of salt in their diets. To help them do so, the nurses ask a lot of questions, including: What are your favorite foods? Who cooks for you? What foods are in your pantry?To ensure that the patients or their family members understand what they need to do, the nurses ask them to repeat the key concepts in their own words.It is a far cry from the harried exit instructions given during a typical hospital discharge. Through the program, Edith Lan, Ms. Li’s daughter, learned to monitor her mother’s weight and check for swelling each day for any early signs of decline in her condition. She also learned to manage the 12 medications her mother takes.Experts say that better monitoring of a patient’s condition and better management of the patient’s medications outside the hospital are crucial.“Major savings seem to be possible through an approach that also improves outcomes for patients,” said Dr. Stephen Jencks, a Baltimore-based consultant in health care safety and quality.The U.C.S.F. program does not end with the patient’s discharge. The health care providers who treat each heart failure patient — inside and outside the hospital — communicate via “virtual team” e-mails to coordinate care.The program also trains patients and their families to be stronger advocates for themselves, even giving them a script to use when they call a health care provider.“They don’t want to bother the doctor,” said Maureen Carroll, a heart failure program coordinator at the center. “The elderly are so polite sometimes.”Ms. Lan is still receiving follow-up calls about her mother’s condition from Ms. Carroll and Ms. Brinker.“I feel safe,” said Ms. Lan. “I have any questions, I can ask them.”The program began with a $575,000 grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and U.C.S.F. continued to support it after the grant money ran out.Avoiding hospitalization has an added benefit for the very elderly, helping them retain mobility, since they are more likely to get out of bed at home where they are not tethered to as many machines.“The hospital is not a friendly place for frail older adults,” said Dr. Helen Kao, the geriatrician who visits Ms. Li. Ms. Li, now living at her daughter’s home in the Ingleside Terrace neighborhood of San Francisco, is able to walk to the yard slowly and enjoy the garden.That kind of transition, says Ms. Rago, is the program’s ultimate goal. “If you look at what our patients really want from us, they don’t want to be here” at the hospital, she said. “They want to be at home.”'"

Dodge will be remembered by most Giants fans for the punt that went to Eagles returner DeSean Jackson — instead of out of bounds — in a Week 15 loss to Philadelphia. He will be replaced by the former Jets punter Steve Weatherford, who won a tight training camp competition.“I saw tremendous improvement on Matt’s part this year,” Coach Tom Coughlin said. “They both did an outstanding job and it was not an easy decision.”David Carr will be the backup quarterback; the Giants placed Sage Rosenfels (back) on injured reserve. Da’Rel Scott, who had touchdown runs of 97 yards and 65 yards during the preseason, will join Ahmad Bradshaw, Brandon Jacobs and D. J. Ware as the running backs (Andre Brown was cut). Mark Herzlich, a cancer survivor, is among the backup linebackers.“Herzlich didn’t bat an eye the whole camp,” Coughlin said. “He deserves it.” SAM BORDENBENSON OUT OF JAIL Bengals running back Cedric Benson has been released from a Texas jail after serving five days of a 20-day sentence for misdemeanor assault. Benson’s lawyer, Sam Bassett, said the 28-year-old Benson earned time off his sentence by mopping floors and helping on paint crews. He was arrested in 2010 for punching a bar employee and again in July for punching a former roommate.

"'11-09-04,'0','AMSTERDAM — The Dutch government said Saturday it could not guarantee the security of its own Web sites, days after the private company it uses to authenticate them acknowledged it had been hacked. An official also said the government was taking over the company’s operations.The announcement affects millions of people who use the Netherlands government’s online services and rely on the authenticator, DigiNotar, to confirm they are visiting the correct sites. To date, there have been no reports of stolen identities or other specific security breaches.Officials stopped short of telling people not to use government Web sites, but said they should heed warnings posted on the sites or from their browsers. Already, Google and other major Web browser providers have begun rejecting security certificates issued by DigiNotar.It is unclear who is behind the hacking, though Google said last week that those affected “were primarily located in Iran.” The hacking’s extent also is unclear, and investigators are trying to find out how many bogus certificates were issued, and what other sites — or countries — were affected.Piet Hein Donner, the Dutch interior minister, said that, for now, a user of government sites could not be certain “that he is on the site where he wanted to be.”Earlier in the week, DigiNotar acknowledged it had been hacked in July, though it did not disclose it at the time. It said as late as Tuesday that its certificates for government sites had not been compromised.'"
"'11-09-04,'0','This year, though, the market has shifted. Industrial-oriented stocks have fallen 17 percent, or about seven percentage points more than the broad emerging markets.Consumer-oriented companies, meanwhile, many of which are catering to the fast-growing middle class in places like China, have held up remarkably well. Shares of companies in emerging markets that make nonessential, or discretionary, consumer products are up around 3 percent this year.“An overarching theme that’s occurring across the emerging markets is that the consumer base is blossoming into an income level that allows them to spend money on things beyond the necessities,” said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.China, for example, is on track this year to overtake Japan in the number of vehicles it has on the road, putting it second behind the United States.Arjun Jayaraman, a portfolio manager for emerging markets at Causeway Capital Management, said it was not surprising that some consumer companies had held up better than industrial ones.“Let’s face it: this slowdown is based in the developed world,” Mr. Jayaraman said. While companies that make and export goods to Europe and the United States will be hurt by slowing demand in the West, he said, “a consumer company in India or China that’s more dependent on the local markets will be more insulated from the global slowdown.”To be sure, consumer companies aren’t a huge segment of the emerging markets. Combined, consumer discretionary stocks and shares of consumer staples companies — which make essential goods like food or toothpaste — make up just 16.5 percent of the Standard & Poor’s Emerging Broad Market index.But Alec Young, international equity strategist at S.& P. Equity Research, said that these consumer-oriented companies could serve “as a port in the storm for investors who want exposure to the emerging markets but want to achieve it in a more conservative way.”Investors must still be careful, though, with this group of stocks.“Stocks that are less sensitive to the global economy and that target local consumer demand have performed better, but as a result they’ve gotten more expensive,” said Jeffrey A. Urbina, co-portfolio manager of the William Blair Emerging Markets Growth fund.The average price-to-earnings ratio for consumer discretionary stocks in the MSCI Emerging Markets index, for instance, is 13.4, based on the last 12 months of earnings. By comparison, the ratio for the broad emerging markets stands at 10.9.As a result, many strategists say a cheaper — and less volatile — way to gain exposure to emerging-market consumers is through shares of large domestic and European multinational companies that generate a sizable portion of their revenue from those regions.As examples, Simon Hallett, chief investment officer at Harding Loevner, an asset management firm, points to McDonald’s, whose shares are up 19 percent this year, and Colgate-Palmolive, up 12 percent.These stocks have performed so well in this volatile market “not just because they’re defensive stocks,” he said. “It also has to do with their long-term growth opportunities in emerging economies.”'"
"'11-09-04,'0','Patrick got her first look at the course Thursday as fans were leaving a baseball game between the Orioles and the Toronto Blue Jays. Because construction was not yet complete, she ran into a few pedestrians at various crosswalks.Unfamiliarity with the course is the great equalizer. For those in position to make a move in the IndyCar points standings, it is imperative to learn as much as possible about the sharp turns, the bumps in the road, the manhole covers and the covered railroad tracks.“We do a lot of preparation before hitting the track, like simulations with the engineers, and we walked around the track,” said Ryan Briscoe, fifth in points behind Dario Franchitti, the leader. “Before we hit the track, we understand the corner speeds, the gears; you get a good idea where the bumps are. Street courses especially, there’s no room for error. You have to take full advantage of the practice sessions.”Like it or not, precious points are up for grabs on a strange course with tight pits that leave little room for exit.“Nobody knows the track, so it brings the older drivers and teams to the same level; that could be crucial,” said Helio Castroneves, who is ninth in the standings. “It will certainly be more challenging for everyone, and with the battle for the championship it will be really interesting.”Regarding the tight pit stops, Castroneves scratched his head and said: “I noticed that. I still didn’t quite understand it, to be honest, why we’re going to the right and to the left with a hairpin curve on each side. It is awkward, but I guess that’s the only way for them to put all the cars. That’s a good problem to have.”Twenty-eight cars are entered in the race.Team Penske is coming off its first 1-2-3 sweep in nearly 17 years after Will Power won last Sunday in California for his fifth victory of the year. Castroneves finished second, and Briscoe took third.A year from now, many of the drivers will know what to expect. This year, they are all in the dark.“Everyone knows the same so far, which is not much,” Vitor Meira said. “That’s a help because it equalizes the field more.”If Patrick, 12th in points, pulls off an upset win, she will not be back next year to defend the title. But she can take heart in knowing she took part in the first IndyCar race in Baltimore history.“I think any time we go to a new venue in a new city, I always feel like there’s a great crowd and a lot of excitement,” she said. “It’s our chance to capitalize on a new market, captivate them and entertain them and get them excited about coming back for the next time.”'"
"'11-09-04,'0','About 95 percent of music downloads in 2010 were unlicensed and illegal, with no money flowing back to artists, songwriters or record producers, according to Alex Jacob, a spokesman for the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. So riches could await a company that persuades some of these Internet scofflaws to change their ways.Illegal downloading does have drawbacks that go beyond the threat of prosecution, which is relatively rare among average listeners. For one, the sound quality can be poor. For another, the songs on illegal sites can harbor viruses.Qtrax says it offers free, high-quality and safe downloads, now on laptops and coming soon to mobile phones. Unlike streaming services, which need a strong Internet connection and often require subscription fees, Qtrax listeners can tune into their music where there is no Internet — on subways, say, or in that log cabin deep in the wilderness.But there’s a catch. The Qtrax music can be played only on a Qtrax software player, which is free but must be downloaded — ads included — from the company’s Web site.Mr. Klepfisz and Mr. Ford first introduced their baby in January 2008 in Cannes, France, with a multimillion-dollar splash at Midem, one of the music industry’s most prestigious trade shows. They rented suites at the Intercontinental Carlton hotel, in anticipation of a flood of press requests. They also sponsored lunches at the conference hall and hired LL Cool J, Don Henley and James Blunt to rock out at a private party, and the buzz was on.They boasted of big-name advertisers, including Ford Motor and Burger King, and said they had the blessing of the major record labels, along with some 25 million tracks available for download.But within days, one of the major labels announced that no licensing deal had been signed. Trade show attendees soon learned that formal licensing agreements had not been signed with any of the four major labels, that the depth of advertising support was exaggerated, and that the number of available tracks was highly questionable.The backlash broadsided Mr. Klepfisz. “We took a massive reputation hit,” he says.Mr. Klepfisz says he and Mr. Ford were simply naïve and did not intentionally mislead anyone. On the wall of their 28th-floor office in Midtown Manhattan is a sign that reads “naïve” in big block letters, given to Mr. Klepfisz by his former wife, Jennifer, as a commentary on Qtrax, he says. (She had to suffer through its first start, he notes.)He says that talks had been under way with the four labels, and that he was led to believe that they supported the venture even though formal agreements had not been hammered out.Mr. Klepfisz says he now has official, short-term licensing agreements with three of the four major labels — Sony, EMI and Universal. For confidentiality reasons, he declined to give details about the cost or the length of the licensing pacts. As for the claim about offering 25 million tracks, he acknowledges that he jumped the gun, saying that it was the number he estimated the company could eventually offer as the licensing agreements were rolled out.Sony and EMI confirmed that short-term agreements with Qtrax were now in place, but declined to comment further. Universal did not return calls, and negotiations are still under way to get a licensing deal with Warner, the fourth major label. Mr. Klepfisz says all of the licensing deals will need to be renewed this year, but adds that he’s confident they will be.He says 2.5 million tracks are now available for download, with plans to offer at least 5 million and possibly 10 million by year-end. (Most digital music subscription sites worth their salt these days have 10 million or more songs available in their libraries, says Aram Sinnreich, a media professor at Rutgers and a co-founder of Radar Research.)STILL, the false start and missteps raise credibility questions for prospective investors, says Michael H. Baniak, a partner at McDonnell Boehnen Hulbert & Berghoff, based in Chicago.And the issues don’t end with the over-the-top promises it made in 2008. The company has also been sued by at least four entities: Oracle, the software giant; Osher Capital, a private investment company; Millennium Information Technologies, a networking solutions company; and the Las Vegas Wall Street Group, an investment company based in Brooklyn. Some of the suits are related to technology licenses while others are associated with unpaid loans.Most of the suits have not yet been settled, and Mr. Klepfisz and Mr. Ford tried multiple times during an interview to steer the conversation away from the topic. When pressed, Mr. Klepfisz conceded that the “international humiliation” at Midem and the recent economic crisis took a financial toll. “We didn’t have the money” to settle the suits, though efforts are now under way to resolve them, he says.To shore up their financial position, he and Mr. Ford have been focusing on fund-raising. In 2008, when venture capital, private equity and hedge fund markets dried up during the economic crisis, they had to start looking elsewhere for cash — mostly in Asia. Mr. Klepfisz says the company has raised “tens of millions of dollars,” with about 20 percent of that coming since the restart.Still, Qtrax is relying primarily on the ads linked to the music player to finance licensing fees and to make the company profitable — a business model that many industry experts are skeptical can work. They point to previous hopefuls like Napster, which was sued by the record labels over copyright laws and is now a shadow of its former self (and now charges subscription fees for music) and to SpiralFrog and Ruckus, which had some backing from the major labels but collapsed after failing to raise enough cash to cover royalties to the record companies.Even Pandora is struggling to turn a profit, and it gets revenue from both ads and subscriptions, said Mark Harding, a digital media analyst at the Maxim Group. Pandora offers free Internet radio, but charges a subscription fee for those whose listening exceeds 40 hours a month. And Pandora’s licensing fees for streaming are far lower than those of companies that offer downloads.Qtrax uses banner ads on the player that downloads and plays the music. Ads are also found on pages on the site that provide information about the bands. Users see three ads a page when they download or play a song — but the ads do not delay or interfere with the ability to download or listen, Mr. Klepfisz says.“We are diametrically opposed to placing ads that precede listening to the music — that forces people to endure the ads before they can hear the song,” he says. “We think that if you do those sorts of things, people will go back to the illegal sites.”For now, the company is running network ads from Google, Yahoo and others, where banner ads are posted on Qtrax from a variety of companies, based on demographics. This form of advertising doesn’t generate as much cash as ad deals hammered out directly with major companies. But Mr. Ford says he’s waiting to approach the big brands until Qtrax has expanded its global footprint into 50 countries — it’s now in 11 — and has significantly more tracks, likely in 2012.Mr. Ford says plans are also in the works to creatively expand the ads, either through videos as the music plays or through joint marketing agreements with big-company brands, which could involve sponsored tours or contests to meet band members.Music has always been a passion of Mr. Ford, now 52, who was born in London and once fronted a rock band there called Bad Press. In 1980, he moved to New York, where he sang and played guitar on the street for cash while seeking a record deal. He gave up street performing in 1983 when he started selling ads for magazines — including Maxim and publications of Condé Nast — though he still writes songs today.When Mr. Ford started to see ad dollars trickling onto the Web, he joined MusicLoads, which was later renamed SpiralFrog and had a similar structure to Qtrax. After a falling-out with the owner in 2007, he left SpiralFrog (which later folded) to form Rebel Digital, an Internet advertising and marketing firm. It was through this company that he met Mr. Klepfisz at Qtrax.“He liked us so much he bought us,” Mr. Ford says, and the two formed a partnership.Mr. Klepfisz, 55, was born in Melbourne, Australia. Before starting Qtrax, he worked on several entrepreneurial ventures, including a loyalty shopping program, a restaurant and a company that bought Web site domain names. He came up with the idea for Qtrax while chatting with the Australian rocker Mike Rudd, who had been struggling to make ends meet after illegal digital downloading took off.Qtrax executives feel strongly that artists deserve to be paid for their work. “Every time something gets played, they deserve to be paid something,” Mr. Ford says. “They’re getting paid nothing now for most of their music. Zero.”He adds that Qtrax goes far beyond SpiralFrog in terms of licensing deals and content. And Qtrax is enhancing its site with band information, live performances and ticket sales. The site will get a cut from those sales, and from merchandise sold through site links, he says.It is also aggressively seeking partnerships like those it has with Baidu, the Chinese search engine, and with Lenco Media, which supplies Internet radio stations with technology and advertising. Under these agreements, people searching for a particular song through the Baidu search tool or listening to a song on an Internet radio station through Lenco’s platform will see a button that allows them to download the music from the Qtrax site.Still, some industry experts wonder whether Qtrax’s downloading model is viable anymore.“My gut instinct is they’re kind of betting against the future,” says Kevin Cogill, a music blogger and Web site developer in California.Much of the hype over the last six months has been around so-called cloud services. Google, Amazon and Apple have all announced plans to allow people to upload their music to the cloud, which will allow them to stream their music on cellphones, laptops, iPods, iPads, PlayStations and other gadgets.“No one wants to have to copy their music library to a million different devices,” Mr. Cogill says. “They want to be able to access it from the cloud.” Because Qtrax’s downloaded tracks can only be played on a Qtrax player, they cannot be uploaded to the cloud — and that could be a drawback.Mr. Cogill experienced the wrath of the record labels after he leaked nine tracks from an unreleased Guns N’ Roses album on his Antiquiet.com site. Five F.B.I. agents stormed into his Culver City, Calif., apartment early one morning in August 2008, dragged him out of bed and led him away in handcuffs as his neighbors looked on.Charged with felony copyright infringement on work prepared for commercial release, Mr. Cogill faced up to three years in prison and $250,000 in fines, but wound up pleading guilty to a lesser charge of misdemeanor copyright infringement and received probation.Mr. Klepfisz does not rule out offering a subscription service, streaming or even a cloud service at some point, but says he feels that offering free downloads is crucial to luring music fans away from illegal downloading sites.“For the moment,” he says, “we want to start with tackling the pirate industry.”QTRAX is hardly alone in its bid to ride the music Internet wave that has Wall Street swooning.Spotify has generated considerable hype in recent months, having built a successful subscription-based streaming and downloading site in Europe; it recently expanded to the United States. Another up-and-comer is Rdio, which offers streaming services and synching to mobile devices for a monthly charge. The Internet radio sites turntable.fm and iHeartRadio are also generating buzz on the Street.Qtrax wouldn’t mind taking a page from Pandora, the Internet darling that went public recently after years of struggle. Mr. Ford acknowledges that the idea of building enough scale to take Qtrax public is a sweet one — and in his view entirely plausible.“Pandora was near bankruptcy two years ago and look what they’ve done,” he says.'"

"'11-09-04,'0','The United States Open, which runs through Sept. 11, is the kind of sporting event that all but requires a guide. There is a lot of ground to cover at the tennis tournament, where several matches take place simultaneously across a sprawling complex in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens. For fans visiting the Open or following from elsewhere, the official smartphone app is worth downloading.This is the third year the app has been available, but there are several new features, including the ability to shop from the stands, then pick up the merchandise on the way out. There is also an Android version for the first time.The neatest feature is not new, though, and is available only for the iPhone. Called Around Me, it uses a technology known as augmented reality to provide a guide to the grounds. When Around Me is opened, the phone’s screen looks as though it is ready to take a photo — that is, you see whatever you are pointing the phone at. But the app overlays additional information about your location. If you point the phone toward Arthur Ashe Stadium, you see who is playing and what the score is. If you click the restroom icon, the app shows the location of the nearest one. The performance is slightly inconsistent, but even this seems like a minor miracle.The main problem with relying on the app at the Open is the connection quality there. Bad cellular service has been a perennial problem at the tournament. The Open does offer free WiFi networks, but on the night I was there, they were often nonfunctional.For those who are not at the Open, the app serves primarily as a way to get the latest scores and recaps; users can set the app to send updates even when it is not open.'"
"'11-09-04,'0','‘Straw Dogs,’ Then and NowA clip from the 1971 version of “Straw Dogs” (available on Blu-ray Sept. 6) and one from the 2011 remake (in theaters Sept. 16).'"
"'11-09-04,'0','Peckinpah’s film came out at a time when violence was on everyone’s mind and, increasingly, all over the screen as well. “Straw Dogs,” Stanley Kubrick’s vicious “Clockwork Orange” and Don Siegel’s inflammatory vigilante-cop thriller “Dirty Harry” opened within weeks of one another, and each, predictably, triggered a fair amount of debate in the press and among the audiences walking out of the theaters. (Sometimes before the movie was over. According to David Weddle’s superb 1994 Peckinpah biography, “If They Move ... Kill ‘Em!,” a good third of the viewers at the first preview of “Straw Dogs” were gone by the time the lights came up.)The high-running feelings were, of course, largely products of anger and anxiety about the major social issues of the day: the war in Vietnam, the turbulent progress of racial equality, the gathering militancy of feminism. People were arguing, about one thing or the other (or everything at once), pretty much 24/7; and in those years before cable news and the Internet — which now supply enough teapots for dozens of tiny tempests every day — the topics of debate were relatively limited, and remained more or less constant. Everyone talked in circles and didn’t agree on much, but there was, at least, some consensus on what we should be talking about.In the original “Straw Dogs” Peckinpah somehow stirred everything that seemed to matter in 1971 into one small, lethal concentrate. Even the war and race are present, by their conspicuous absence; fairly early in the film, Amy accuses David — who is American — of having buried himself in his work in sleepy Cornwall to avoid having to “take a stand” in his home country.Among the burning American questions that one was expected to take a stand on in that era: Was violence inevitable, necessary, or justified to defend oneself against, say, institutionalized bigotry, or the oppressive machinery of a belligerent state? For that matter, was the threat of Communism in Southeast Asia a good enough reason for Americans to be killing large numbers of Vietnamese? Peckinpah’s David doesn’t appear to be a pacifist; he’s just pacific, and hugely averse to confrontation. As Hoffman plays him he is fundamentally a coward, with an intellectual’s well-developed ability to rationalize inaction. And his wife knows it.Perhaps Mr. Lurie’s canniest alteration to “Straw Dogs” is the choice of his hero’s profession. Making David a screenwriter links him, almost subliminally, to the character played by Michel Piccoli in Jean-Luc Godard’s 1963 “Contempt,” another screenwriter who loses the respect of a beautiful wife, and for the same reason: he won’t, or can’t, protect her.As with “Contempt,” the disdain the woman directs at her husband is a source of intense discomfort, even pain, for men in the audience; no man can bear to be looked at that way by someone he loves. So viewers of the male persuasion may well feel a sense of profound relief when the weak, beleaguered hubby finally decides he’s had enough of the townsfolk’s bullying and blows a few of his tormentors away. At least he — and the rest of us guys — won’t have to see any more of those awful, accusatory looks.The climactic violence of Peckinpah’s “Straw Dogs” was the obvious reason so many early-’70s viewers took offense, but the most potent ingredient in this warlock’s brew is its raw, unlovely view of the relations between men and women. There are few more unnerving scenes in movies than the rape of Amy by her ex-boyfriend, Charlie (Del Henney), and what makes it so memorably terrifying is the awful ambivalence it engenders in both the victim and the viewer — of either sex. Appallingly, Amy, who resists strongly at first, begins to feel some stirrings of pleasure as her old lover does his worst.What’s maybe more unsettling, though, for any viewer who considers himself or herself reasonably civilized, is that you sort of understand why: her husband’s wishy-washiness (and persistent passive-aggression) has primed her for Charlie’s brutal decisiveness.Then one of Charlie’s mates takes a turn, and a scene that already seems agonizingly long returns, and then some, to its initial unambiguous tone of horror. (This second rape was shortened for the film’s first American release, to avoid an X rating.) But the damage to the audience’s sense of itself is done, and is never, for the rest of the film, fully restored. Although Peckinpah’s focus in the rape sequence is primarily on Amy’s shifting reactions — Ms. George’s performance, in these difficult conditions, is extraordinarily subtle and vivid — his characteristically inventive editing keeps us aware of her absent husband too.The film cuts periodically back to David, seen sitting forlornly in a field where he has been abandoned by Charlie and his buddies. The crosscutting naturally underlines David’s ineffectualness, an emphasis that seems, at that moment, in the coals-to-Newcastle category; we’ve had plenty of evidence. Before the picture is over, though, the meaning of those cuts seems, like everything else in this slippery movie, to change.In the violent and unbearably tense final sequences, when David repels a drunken gang — Charlie and other local luminaries — trying to invade his home, Amy stands by helplessly until the very end, looking about as useful as her husband did in that lonely field. And throughout the siege we can see David too beginning to enjoy something he really shouldn’t: the act of killing other human beings. This perverse parallelism operates in Mr. Lurie’s “Straw Dogs” too, but Peckinpah had a special genius for messing with his viewers’ heads. And he was working in the right time for that particular talent to flourish, because although everybody was debating everything, there were certain things we thought we knew about the fundamental natures of men and women: questions most of the audience thought of as settled.It was Sam Peckinpah’s nature to want to show his audience what it didn’t want to see, to make it feel what it didn’t think it could feel. When you watch his “Straw Dogs,” you come out knowing more about yourself. Or perhaps less. All you can tell for sure is that it hurts.'"
"'11-09-04,'0','Holland Cotter’s otherwise fair review of Hunter Drohojowska-Philp’s “Rebels in Paradise: The Los Angeles Art Scene and the 1960s” errs in a common way: it criticizes the author for not writing a book she did not intend to write (Aug. 21). She leaves out, Cotter says, African-American and Latino artists active, and underexposed, at the time. (She also more or less leaves out the women’s movement, but that doesn’t seem to bother Cotter.)But look again at the book’s title. Los Angeles was indeed “paradise” to the members of the boys’ club who lived and surfed in and around Venice, and to other artists ensconced in the canyons between the ocean and the valley. Those are the rebels to whom Drohojowska-Philp has chosen, as is a writer’s privilege, to confine herself. The African-American and Latino artists of the 1960s (who probably didn’t consider the city that much of a “paradise”) certainly should be included in a revisionist and more encyclopedic history of Los Angeles art, and deserve to have whole books written about them. But Drohojowska-Philp shouldn’t be taken to task for not writing one of them.In the thrall of Light and Space and Finish Fetish art (contrary to Cotter’s review, they’re two separate, but related, things), my 1974 book, “Sunshine Muse: Contemporary Art on the West Coast,” woefully neglected African-American, Latino and women’s movement artists. When the book was reissued 26 years later, as the period piece it had become, I confessed to this in a new introduction. Although I still hold the opinion that the best art made in Los Angeles in the 1960s was of the Light and Space and Finish Fetish variety, my overall history of the time was culpably incomplete. Drohojowska-Philp’s book is merely selective.'"
"'11-09-04,'0','Bendor’s — and Chanel’s — anti-­Semitism was vociferous and well documented; the pro-Nazi sensibilities of the Duke of Windsor and many in his circle have long been noted, too. All this, it appears, made the society of the British upper crust particularly appealing to Chanel. As Vaughan notes, after she was lured by a million-dollar fee to spend a few weeks in Hollywood in 1930 — Samuel Goldwyn, he writes, “did his best to keep Jews away from Chanel” — she found herself compelled to run straight back to England, so that she could wash away her brush with vulgarity in “a bath of nobility.”It wasn’t much of a stretch, then, for Chanel, during wartime, to find herself the mistress of the German intelligence officer Baron Hans Günther von Dincklage, a charming character who had spied on the French fleet in the late 1920s, and who found himself pleasingly single in occupied Paris, having presciently divorced his half-Jewish German wife just before the passage of the Nuremberg Laws. It wasn’t any particular betrayal of her values, or morals or ideals either, for Chanel to find herself traveling to Madrid and Berlin to engage in cloak-and-dagger machinations with her country’s occupier.The story of how Coco became Chanel has been told many times before over the past half-century, most recently (and, sad to say, much more engagingly) in last year’s “Coco Chanel: The Legend and the Life,” by the British fashion columnist Justine Picardie. The story of how Chanel metamorphosed from a mere “horizontal collaborator” — the mistress of a Nazi — into an actual German secret agent has been less well known, though earlier writers have reported that she had worked for the Germans. It’s here that Vaughan makes his freshest contribution, using a wealth of materials gleaned from wartime police files and intelligence archives, some of which were only recently declassified by French and German authorities, to flesh out precisely how and why she became an agent, and how she sought to profit from her German connections during the war.Vaughan ably charts Chanel’s clever opportunism as she works, first, to free her nephew André Palasse from a German prisoner-of-war camp, and later seeks to use the Nazis’ Aryanization of property laws to wrest control of her perfume empire away from the Jewish Wertheimer brothers. Yet his account of her one real mission for the Germans — a 1943 covert operation code-named Modellhut (“model hat”) in which she was meant to use her contacts to get a message to Winston Churchill from the SS stating that a number of leading Nazis wanted to break with Adolf Hitler and negotiate a separate peace with England — emerges neither clearly nor logically from his highly detailed telling. Too many diplomatic documents are reproduced at too much length. Contradictions are not clearly sorted out. Vaughan seems to have felt as though his rich source materials could speak for themselves, but they don’t — and he doesn’t succeed in lending authority to the accounts of contemporary witnesses who were, undoubtedly, unreliable.Despite her indisputable collaborationist activities, and after a brief period of uncertainty during which she was questioned by a French judge, Chanel eventually got off pretty much scot-free after the war, once again using her wiles to protect herself most expertly. She tipped off the poet and anti-Nazi partisan Pierre Reverdy, a longtime occasional lover, so that he could arrange the arrest of her wartime partner in collaboration, Baron Louis de Vaufreland Piscatory; she paid off the family of the former Nazi chief of SS intelligence Gen. Walter Schellenberg when she heard that he was preparing to publish his memoirs. (It was Schellenberg who had given her the “model hat” assignment.) Vaughan could have done better in providing the context to the seemingly incomprehensible ease of Chanel’s reintegration into French fashion and society, telling more, for example, of the widespread desire for forgetting and moving forward that held sway in Charles de Gaulle's postwar France.These weaknesses — of authorial voice and critical judgment — run through “Sleeping With the Enemy.” Vaughan, a retired diplomat who has made his home in Paris, has allowed his writing to become a bit too imbued with the reflexive verbal tics and general vive-la-séduction silliness of his adopted country. “Sometimes the kitten, sometimes the vamp, and often the vixen, . . . she must have melted Bendor’s knees” is how he captures Chanel in her 40s; “beautiful and sexy, her silhouette stunning,” he appraises her in her 50s. (Indeed, his English often sounds like French — the most cloying sort of breathy French — in translation.) Despite all he knows about Chanel, Vaughan often appears to be as beguiled, disarmed and charmed by Coco as were the men in her life — not to mention the countless women who have sought over the decades to cloak themselves in her image. And like them, he never gets beyond the self-protecting armor of her myth.'"

"'11-09-05,'0','The Cuban military runs real estate businesses, factories, supermarkets and even a large tour operator, Gaviota. Its companies, many of which generate much-needed hard currency, enjoy a reputation for efficiency in a country dogged by mismanagement and a bloated bureaucracy.When he announced General Casas’ promotion to defense minister in 2008, Raúl Castro praised his “brilliant” work and fiscal prudence.According to a transcript published on the Web site of Granma, the Cuban Communist Party newspaper, Mr. Castro said he could not “remember once saying anything critical of our friend Julio Casas, except that he is — as we Cubans say — stingy.”General Casas was the only person authorized to overrule President Castro on economic issues, and he often did, Mr. Castro added, rejecting pet projects that would absorb scarce state money.Julio Casas Regueiro was born in Mayarí Arriba, in eastern Cuba, on Feb. 16, 1936.He enrolled at a business school, and as a student he began collaborating with the rebels who were trying to overthrow the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista.Mr. Casas went on to work as an accountant at a bank in Santiago de Cuba, but in June 1957 he left the city to help the revolutionary forces, eventually joining their ranks and fighting under Raúl Castro.After the Castros swept to victory on Jan. 1, 1959, Mr. Casas joined the leadership of the National Revolutionary Police, with whom he fought against the Cuban exiles who took part in the United States-backed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961.He moved that year to the armed forces, where he rose through the ranks to become deputy defense minister and chief of the military’s economic activities, including its sprawling business interests, in the late 1980s.During a military career that was shaped by Fidel Castro’s cold war alliances and his interventions in Africa, he was trained at a Soviet military academy and served in Ethiopia in the late 1970s.In February 2008, General Casas became the only person to fill the top military post since the 1959 revolution other than Raúl Castro, who had held the job for nearly 50 years before giving it up to succeed his brother as president. During the Communist Party’s sixth congress in April, General Casas was also elected to the 15-member Politburo.He was cremated, according to his wishes, Granma said. The government declared three days of mourning, and his ashes will sit in state on Monday at the Defense Ministry on Havana’s vast Revolution Plaza.'"
"'11-09-05,'0','Refreshments were scant — canned soft drinks, a few sweets, a tray of baklava — but then most things are in short supply in Tripoli now, and most people were too busy grinning and chatting away to bother to eat. A young girl in a starched dress, with flowers in her hair and a bucket of single-stemmed roses, wandered among the guests, giving everyone a free rose and a smile.Mohammed al-Misrati raises Arabian racehorses, but he took time off from the business of rounding up escaped horses who had been frightened off by explosions to bring along his gaggle of six beaming children. “Wonderful, wonderful,” he said of the open house. He was soon animatedly discussing the writing of a new constitution and national elections.Othman Bisanti, a lawyer who once defended five Bulgarian nurses falsely blamed by the Qaddafi government for having deliberately contaminated hundreds of Libyan children with H.I.V., also turned out.“Of course we’re happy now,” Mr. Bisanti said. “We couldn’t get near here before. We’re practicing freedom now, without walls.”A hand-sewn rebel flag — an adaptation of the flag from the royalist era before the Qaddafi years — was hanging above the wainscoting in one room, but otherwise the building was virtually the same as it was before.It was spared the looting and destruction visited on many other symbols of the Qaddafi government, said an aeronautics engineer who lives nearby, because neighbors banded together to guard it once Qaddafi officials had fled. Their neighborhood had organized secretly and many residents were already armed when the uprising entered its last days, said the engineer, who requested anonymity because of fear of reprisal. One neighbor was killed, he said, trying to save the building.Most members of the Transitional National Council, the rebels’ civilian leadership, have not yet arrived in Tripoli from their seat in the eastern city of Benghazi, so the council’s deputy chairman, Ali Tarhouni, is the highest-ranking rebel official here. He is also finance and oil minister, and when he arrived at the open house, the crowd greeted him as a celebrity.Mr. Tarhouni fled Libya in 1972 and was put on a Qaddafi hit list. He trained as an economist and taught at the University of Washington in Seattle until he returned in March to join the rebels seeking to oust Colonel Qaddafi.He worked the crowded halls and rooms with a politician’s 100-watt smile. “This is the people’s house, and they never had a chance in 40 years to come here,” Mr. Tarhouni said, explaining the rebels’ motivation for organizing the open house.One of his bodyguards, Faisal Masmari, had his own particular take. “It’s freedom now because we are all heroes here — and because I am standing here, and he is not,” Mr. Masmari said, referring to Colonel Qaddafi.Addressing the crowd, Mr. Tarhouni promised that Libyans had not overthrown one dictatorship only to be stuck with another.“Whoever occupies this place, they will not be a permanent presence again,” he said.Ducking out for a cigarette, Mr. Tarhouni elaborated on what the event represented. “Look at these faces, they’re really happy,” he said. “The reason is that they’re free. It’s amazing what freedom does to people.“It’s a dream, it’s a fantasy,” Mr. Tarhouni added. “To see your people walking around, not afraid of anything any more. Even though Qaddafi’s still around, they’re not afraid of anyone.”'"
"'11-09-05,'0','He and the New York sales and editorial team decided to forgo the typical promotional campaign employed for special issues and gave advertisers who had already bought space in the magazine the option of bowing out.“It is something that touches people in all kinds of different personal ways,” Mr. Burstein said, “and I felt like it was a decision that the advertiser had to make.”There are few publications or television channels that are not tackling the issue. The Military Channel will explore why the Pentagon sustained far less damage than the Twin Towers. Animal Planet will run a special episode of the series “Saved,” about survivors of the attacks whose “unique bonds with their pets helped them deal with loss and cope through pain,” according to the show’s promotional materials.Showtime will broadcast “The Love We Make,” about Paul McCartney’s efforts to organize a benefit concert. CNN is planning four separate documentaries. Fox News is showing a documentary about the construction of the Freedom Tower.The National Geographic Channel, which is partly owned by the News Corporation, secured one of the biggest coups of the season — its exclusive interview with George W. Bush, the president when the attacks occurred. They wanted to get ahead of the avalanche of coverage and decided to show the interview on Aug. 28.The interview, heavily promoted on other News Corporation channels including Fox News, was secured with the help of a producer, Peter Schnall, who headed a number of behind-the-scenes programs about the White House while Mr. Bush was in office.By chance, the scheduled two-day interview began the day after American forces killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. Michael Cascio, the senior vice president for production at the National Geographic Channel, said Mr. Bush and his associates had placed no restrictions on the interview.Mr. Cascio has wondered whether the week of programming his network has planned is sufficient. “Given its magnitude — it is the singular event in our lifetime, in the last 50 years,” he said, “we decided a week almost isn’t enough.”The National Geographic Channel has scheduled a marathon of related coverage on Sept. 11.Other outlets also decided to try to get out ahead of the pack. Adam Moss, the editor of New York magazine, decided its issue — an A to Z compendium of Sept. 11-related vignettes — should be published well ahead of the 10th anniversary so it would reach readers before the onslaught of coverage began.“I’m sure, inevitably, people will feel it’s too much and shut down at some point,” he said. “We just hoped we could get what we feel is a pretty good issue out there before others did.”People magazine took a similar approach. Its commemorative issue, which features articles about 10 children whose fathers died in the attacks before they were born, appeared on newsstands last week.“I think by next week at a certain point, absorbing all of this is going be tough for anybody,” said Larry Hackett, People’s managing editor.Since newsmagazines tend to be keepsakes, both Time and Newsweek have printed additional copies for their anniversary issues this week, with Time adding 40,000 to its print run and Newsweek adding 30,000.There has also been debate about how the anniversary should be covered. Should it be left to great thinkers and elegant writers to define what the attacks have meant for the country? Or are Americans better served by the accounts of those who experienced the attacks first-hand?“Our take is through photos and the first-person stories of people who were directly affected by it,” said Richard Stengel, the managing editor of Time magazine. “That was the differentiator for us.”Tina Brown, Newsweek’s editor, said she realized as she planned the anniversary issue that the bar would be high for delivering distinctive writing. “My own thought was, ‘How am I going to be moved again?’ ” she said. “But I found that my ability to be moved by this still is profound.”There was little disagreement about delivering a comprehensive look back at the day the attacks occurred. “It’s an intense period of reflection among Americans, and we want to support that,"" said Mark Lukasiewicz, who oversees special productions for NBC News.But there is an evident tension about how much time to devote to the terrorist acts versus the decade of costs and consequences they provoked. Some news executives and journalists said the days leading up to the anniversary were opportunities to assess the many other meanings of the attacks: the emphasis on homeland security, the actions of the military, the restrictions on civil liberties, the effects on national politics.Newsweek will run articles by writers including Andrew Sullivan, who examines how fear defined American life in the aftermath of the attacks.Last week, MSNBC began to show a special three-hour documentary, “Day of Destruction, Decade of War.”Rachel Maddow, who is co-anchoring the documentary, said Sept. 11 “is such an important event on its own terms and for its implications,” adding, “I think there’s infinite room to talk about exactly what happened that day and the decisions made by the government, right or wrong.""And there is the question of exactly what to do with images of the burning towers, and the many horrific scenes from that day. Newsweek decided not to use the towers at all on its cover, opting instead for just blue sky and an airplane.Marc Burstein, the ABC News executive producer for special events, said the network had decided to use the images, noting that it had not done so since the first anniversary of the attacks.“We will use the video,” he said, “very sparingly and very judiciously.”'"
"'11-09-05,'0','“The wrong thing he did was to do nothing,” Mr. Gislason said. “He just did nothing.”If found guilty by a special court, Mr. Haarde, a stalwart of the conservative Independence Party who served as prime minister from June 2006 until February 2009, faces a maximum sentence of two years in prison.In some ways, the case was meant to serve as a way for Iceland to hold its leaders to account and then move on. But if anything, even as Iceland’s economy is starting to show signs of recovery, Mr. Haarde’s indictment has made a cynical population even more suspicious. Recent polls show that trust in Parliament is at an all-time low.“There’s been a change in atmosphere,” said Kristrun Heimisdottir, an adviser to the minister of economic affairs. “There was so much anger and so much thirst to see someone hang, but now people are saying, ‘Is this really fair? Is this really all Geir’s fault?’ ”The problem, said Robert R. Spano, a professor and dean of the law faculty at the University of Iceland, is that questions of law and politics have gotten mixed up.“When you have a situation with lots of anger, decisions that should be taken objectively and carefully tend to be contaminated by politics and emotion,” he said in an interview.At a hearing on Monday, Mr. Haarde’s lawyers will argue that the case should be dismissed on numerous procedural grounds, including that the charges have never been properly investigated and that the indictment is too vague to meet legal standards. If their motion fails and Mr. Haarde exhausts his pretrial appeals, the case would be heard early next year by a never-before-convened court for cases involving government malfeasance.Mr. Haarde, 60, said he had committed no crime, that the events that led to the crash were far too complicated to be distilled to a crude political prosecution of a single person, and that he was certain that he would be vindicated.“With hindsight, it’s hard to disagree that we could have done some things differently,” he said in an interview. “But this is a political trial cloaked as a criminal prosecution. My political enemies are trying to go after and punish me and my party.”Even some legislators who voted to indict Mr. Haarde say they are troubled by the way the case has unfolded. Last fall, a special parliamentary commission investigating the crash dusted off an old law and identified four people, Mr. Haarde and three of his ministers, who could be held criminally responsible.But after a series of political maneuvers that left normally collegial lawmakers shouting furiously at one another on the floor of Parliament, the lawmakers voted 33-30 to indict only Mr. Haarde.“This is Parliament deciding that we’re going to punish one person who happens to be former head of the conservatives — we’re not going to prosecute our people,” said Jon Danielsson, an expert on Iceland at the London School of Economics. “So it becomes a political prosecution. I think it’s a major mistake. Either do all of them, or none.”“He was one of the architects of the collapse in Iceland; there’s no doubt about that,” said Arnar Thorisson, a 42-year-old cinematographer who was strolling through downtown Reykjavik the other day. “The party he came from ruined Iceland. But I would want to see more people prosecuted, not just him.”If any politician is more culpable than others, many people believe it is David Oddsson, Mr. Haarde’s old friend and mentor, who was prime minister from 1991 to 2004. During his tenure, Iceland privatized its banks and liberalized the banking laws, paving the way for a brief period of prosperity and the banks’ risky and ultimately self-destructive behavior.After Mr. Oddsson left politics, he became chairman of the Icelandic Central Bank, in charge of overseeing the system he had helped create. He was forced out of that job in 2009 and is now editor in chief of Morgunbladid, one of Iceland’s largest newspapers and a champion of the Independence Party.“He is the king, and we are sort of hanging the prince,” said Eirikur Bergmann, director of the Center for European Studies at Bifrost University in Iceland. “This is also why people have ill feelings about this, because in many ways this is the wrong guy before this court.”But regardless of the outcome, a trial may do little to assuage Iceland’s anger.“We’re still far away from coming to terms with the events in a balanced manner,” said Gunnar Helgi Kristinsson, a political science professor at the University of Iceland. “However it ends, I’m sure it will be a bad thing. If he’s not guilty, people will consider it typical of a system where nobody is held accountable. On the other hand, if he is guilty, he’ll be standing there almost as if he’s the only one who’s responsible. And everyone knows that’s unfair.”'"
"'11-09-05,'0','With power out in many places, some dairy farmers could not operate the machines they use to milk their cows. Smaller farms relied on volunteers to milk them the old-fashioned way. Others got their hands on generators to run their machines. The cows needed to be milked, but with dairy pickups halted in many parts of the state because the roads were inaccessible, some farmers were forced to dump thousands of dollars worth of milk.Then there was the emotional toll of losing animals.Buddy Severance, 17, recalled how his father took him across their rapidly submerging field on a tractor, depositing him safely at the farmhouse before turning back and getting marooned on it by swirling waters. They were both stranded, helpless as the rising waters rushed across the pastures and poured into the barn. They were eventually saved by a rescue boat, reluctantly leaving behind cows and calves hitched in the barn and in the field.All but two of the cows in the barn survived, somehow.“That one right there on the end, he had a twin,” Buddy said, pointing to a brown-and-white calf. “I was going to raise them for oxen. They were standing right side by side, and his twin ended up drowning.”It was while the rescue boat was ferrying the Severances to safety that they saw some of the cows from the pasture floating down the White River.Some made it alive a few miles down the river, Buddy said.“People were calling — they said they heard cows in the river bawling, just going down through,” he said. “We know that they made it at least that far alive. I would have rather seen them, at least the ones that did go down the river, I would have rather watched them drown than have them go that far and suffer.”Of the farm’s 65 cows, about two dozen are still missing.Mr. Perley had only come back to the farm the night before with his nieces after a long trip to New Jersey, where he had visited relatives and had a pacemaker installed. “We didn’t expect that we’d be coming out in a boat, but we did,” he said in a telephone interview from New Jersey, where he returned after the flood.The outpouring of help has moved Mr. Perley and the Severance family. Some heard about them through word of mouth. Others read about their plight in The Valley News. Others offered assistance after the farm asked for help on Vermont Public Radio and on a Web site called #VTResponse, which was created after the storm as a sort of Twitter-age version of the venerable Swopper’s Column in Yankee Magazine, connecting volunteers and supplies with the flood victims who needed them.“We are in desperate need of 16% pellets for cows whose food will run out tonight,” read one post on the Web site. The next day, people arrived with feed for the cows.As the Severances continued the cleanup on Friday, Tamara Burke, a sheep farmer from Mansfield, Vt., pulled up in her pickup truck (license plate: EWEHAUL) with wood shavings, new wire fencing and a gate.“I know that there’s a tremendous amount of need,” said Ms. Burke, who had visited several farms. “Because people hadn’t brought their second-cut hay in, even if your barn escaped, your hay was on the ground. So we don’t have a whole lot of hay, and unfortunately we need hay.”The days have been long for the Severances. “We’ve been working until about midnight every night here trying to do stuff and go home, and we’re up by 5 o’clock in the morning — and that’s late for us, because my husband, sometimes he’s down here at 3 o’clock in the morning on a normal day — and we start all over again,” Ms. Severance said.“It’s been amazing, the support from the community we’ve gotten,” she said. “It really is. People are like, ‘What are you going to do?’ And I say, ‘What are we supposed to do, just throw our hands up and say the heck with it?’ This is our life. Of course we’ve got to keep farming.”'"
"'11-09-05,'0','“Counterstrike” only briefly covers the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, so issues like torture and Abu Ghraib, the focus of many books on American counterterrorism in the past decade, receive just brief mention. The book really kicks in later, around 2006. Driven partly by the spread of suicide bombings, improvised explosive devices and other deadly setbacks in Iraq, officials developed new techniques for using information gained in raids on terrorist and insurgent hideouts. As Iraq slid from bad to worse, officials belatedly recognized that Al Qaeda had recovered in Pakistan, as that nation’s government, America’s supposed ally, dithered at best and aided terrorists at worst. The United States would have to change course if it was to avoid further disaster.As they relate this new direction, Mr. Schmitt and Mr. Shanker put flesh on approaches and operations that in the past were largely in the realm of specialists. The book is sprinkled with small, vivid anecdotes that bring day-to-day counterterrorism work to life. Take the Horse Blanket, a “graduating series of contingencies that each federal agency could take in response to a potential or actual terrorist attack” beginning in 2007.Much like a playbook, the Horse Blanket (whose intriguing name goes unexplained here) detailed the cost of each option, its level of disruption and its impact on foreign policy. A report of terrorist efforts to cross from Canada might lead to an increase in border security. Should intelligence agencies gather credible reports of the ultimate nightmare, a nuclear weapon being moved to attack an American city, the border would be shut. Policy makers can now ratchet counterterrorism up or down to match the perceived threat.Technology has made a revolutionary difference. The authors explain how the contents of cellphones belonging to captured terrorists are cloned in seconds, with computers scanning the numbers to match those of other known terrorists. Such information can tie a suspect to an enemy network and its locations, which in turn helps interrogators ask smarter questions and enables them to direct military forces better. More bad guys die or are taken off the streets, and fewer innocents suffer.Other efforts are aimed at the hearts and minds of those who have not yet taken sides. To discredit Al Qaeda with the Muslim public, officials sought “to create a constant drumbeat of anti-Al Qaeda information that was factual, directly quoted and heavily sourced,” as one White House official described it. So when the Taliban kill a schoolteacher or terrorists blind schoolgirls in an acid attack, the horrors are trumpeted in local and international media, countering Al Qaeda’s narrative that its fearless warriors fight only heavily armed United States soldiers.Today, the authors write, American counterterrorism policy embraces “the new deterrence.” By imposing costs on terrorists’ reputations, chances for success, material assets — whatever they hold dear — you “alter the behavior and thinking of your adversary.” In contrast to deterrence strategies during the cold war, deterrence today does not involve a state actor, like the Soviet Union, with nuclear-tipped missiles but rather more nebulous networks that include not only fanatic suicide bombers but also more rational financiers, recruiters, arms runners and others who can be dissuaded by the threat of death or arrest. The new deterrence involves “kinetic” instruments, to use the military parlance for killing people, but also innovative information operations that might discredit a cause and scare away providers of funds.In outlining this new approach the book would benefit from a more detailed treatment of Al Qaeda’s own point of view. To know if deterrence works you need to know how your policies affect the enemy’s thinking. We don’t glean much here about whether Al Qaeda members are learning the lessons America is trying to teach them. Similarly one could come away from “Counterstrike” thinking that the United States does all the counterterrorism work, when in reality much if not most of the day-to-day operations are handled by the intelligence agencies, police officers and military forces of allies.For the most part “Counterstrike” is a good-news story, and with good reason. However, Mr. Schmitt and Mr. Shanker’s emphasis on positive change misses the darker part of the picture. Al Qaeda’s affiliate groups receive short shrift: only the Yemeni branch gets any real attention. Fighters from affiliates number in the thousands, however, and one of bin Laden’s biggest successes was turning groups in Somalia, Algeria and elsewhere, who began their fight focusing on local causes, into anti-American movements.Similarly, tactics used in Iraq and Afghanistan are discussed, but if these interventions fail to produce stable governments, the United States may be worse off in the end despite the hard work of clever operators. Finally, 10 years after Sept. 11, America still has not come up with a coherent policy toward Al Qaeda detainees. The embarrassing result is that the United States neither ensures that militants are taken off the street and interrogated nor gains the moral high ground that might accrue from closing the hated Guantánamo prison.Successful deterrence, the theme of “Counterstrike,” depends partly on success in all these disparate areas. The book’s missing pieces, however, should not obscure its strong portrayal of the many unheralded United States victories.With the death of bin Laden and the transformation of Egypt, Libya and other countries during the Arab Spring, Al Qaeda is at a crossroads. While it is too early to declare Al Qaeda defeated, Americans should take comfort in this book’s reminder that their government can adapt to meet threats as they change, keeping them safer — if not necessarily safe — from terrorism.'"

"'11-09-06,'0','During the months of public argument about how to deal with Saddam Hussein, I christened an imaginary association of pundits the I-Can’t-Believe-I’m-a-Hawk Club, made up of liberals for whom 9/11 had stirred a fresh willingness to employ American might. It was a large and estimable group of writers and affiliations, including, among others, Thomas Friedman of The Times; Fareed Zakaria, of Newsweek; George Packer and Jeffrey Goldberg of The New Yorker; Richard Cohen of The Washington Post; the blogger Andrew Sullivan; Paul Berman of Dissent; Christopher Hitchens of just about everywhere; and Kenneth Pollack, the former C.I.A. analyst whose book, “The Threatening Storm,” became the liberal manual on the Iraqi threat. (Yes, it is surely relevant that this is exclusively a boys’ club.)In several columns I laid out justifications for overthrowing Saddam Hussein. There were caveats — most significantly, that there was no reason to rush, that we should hold off to see whether Iraq’s behavior could be sufficiently contained by sanctions and inspections. Like many liberal hawks, I was ambivalent; Pollack said he was 55 to 45 for war, which feels about right.But when the troops went in, they went with my blessing. Of course I don’t think President Bush was awaiting permission from The New York Times’s Op-Ed page — or, for that matter, from my friends in the Times newsroom, who during the prewar debate published some notoriously credulous stories about Iraqi weapons. The administration, however, was clearly pleased to cite the liberal hawks as evidence that invading Iraq was not just the impetuous act of cowboy neocons. Thus did Tony Judt in 2006 coin another, unkinder name for our club: “Bush’s Useful Idiots.”In 2004, a year after the invasion, and again in 2008, Jacob Weisberg, editor of the online magazine Slate and a charter member of my I-Can’t-Believe club, invited liberal hawks to second-guess their support for the war. The responses ranged from remorse to self-vindication, with lots of tortured doubt and defensiveness in between. But I held my tongue. By that time I had moved from the Op-Ed page into a job — executive editor — in which I was obliged to keep my opinions to myself lest they be mistaken for the newspaper’s agenda or influence our coverage. I’m pretty sure the reporters who have covered Iraq with such distinction in the ensuing years could not tell you whether I still believed the war was just or necessary. I’m not sure I knew myself at that point. It is the job of news to recount, clear-eyed, what is, and questions of what should be are an occupational distraction. In any case, I declined to participate in Slate’s collective examination of conscience.But I have now returned to the opinion business, at a time when America’s role in the world — and in Iraq — is still unsettled. So, let me be the last of the club to retrace my steps, and see if there is any wisdom to be salvaged there.The question is really two questions: Knowing what we know now, with the glorious advantage of hindsight, was it a mistake to invade and occupy Iraq? And knowing what we knew then, were we wrong to support the war?Broadly speaking, there were three arguments for invading Iraq: the humanitarian case that Saddam Hussein was a monster whose cruelties were intolerable to civilized nations; the opportunity case — that we might plant the seeds of democracy and freedom in a region desperately in need of them; and the strategic case that Hussein posed an important threat, not only because of his unaccounted-for weapons stockpiles but also because of his habit of smashing through borders and the hospitality he offered to terrorists of various kinds.For many of us, the monster argument was potent, even if it was not sufficient. Hussein’s genocidal persecution of the Kurds, the Grand Guignol of his prisons and the memory of his savage assault on Kuwait all confirmed him as the beastliest of despots. Those like Christopher Hitchens who had made friends among Iraq’s Kurdish minority felt an acute sympathy and a sense of obligation, because the United States had abandoned the Kurds to Hussein’s butchery after the first gulf war. Others brought to this moment the lessons of Bosnia, where an American-led alliance had stopped the murderous Serbs and somewhat erased the residue of American impotence left by Ho Chi Minh and “Black Hawk Down.” We were, as Andrew Sullivan put it, “enamored of [our] own morality.”But there are plenty of monstrous regimes that we do not go to the trouble of overthrowing. It should perhaps have caught our attention that Samantha Power, who literally wrote the book on humanitarian intervention (the Pulitzer-winning “A Problem From Hell: America and the Age of Genocide”) and who had endorsed armed intervention in Bosnia and Rwanda, and at an earlier time in Iraq, did not support the invasion of Iraq in 2003.“My criterion for military intervention — with a strong preference for multilateral intervention — is an immediate threat of large-scale loss of life,” explained Power, who now advises President Obama on multilateral affairs and human rights. “That’s a standard that would have been met in Iraq in 1988 but wasn’t in 2003.”The idea that America could install democracy in Iraq always seemed to me the most wishful of the rationales for war, although some people who knew the region far better than I made that case. It is true that we had played midwife to new democracies in Germany and Japan after World War II. But those were war-weary societies, with stabilizing institutions, industrialized economies and coherent national cultures, and even so the rebuilding was colossally expensive. The exiled Iraqi academic Kanan Makiya — a proponent of invasion who later repented — observed that Iraq’s population was so traumatized by decades of abuse that they were unwilling to take initiative or responsibility: “A regime was removed and a people liberated overnight, but it was a people that did not understand what had happened to it or why.”And if we were paying closer attention, as we should have been, we would have been more alarmed by the fact that the authors of the invasion had shown open contempt for the kind of “nation building” that went into the Marshall Plan. They seemed to have in mind a hit-and-run democracy project for Iraq, which was folly.Beyond Iraq, the idea that a country democratized under American occupation would become a beacon to the region, an antidote to the poisonous doctrine of extremism, was highly questionable given the region’s bitter history of occupation and the popular resentment of America for, among other things, its generous support of so many Arab autocrats.It turns out, though nobody imagined it eight years ago, that the model for aspiring democrats in the Arab world would be Tunisia, followed in short order by Egypt and Yemen. Do these examples suggest that if we had waited long enough, the Iraqis would have rid themselves of Hussein without American intervention? I doubt it; surely Hussein would have followed the Iranian and Syrian examples of sheer brutality rather than surrender to the streets. Or is it fair to argue that the ouster of Saddam Hussein cleared the way for, even inspired, the recent uprisings around the Mediterranean? Probably not. Friends who have covered the Arab awakening on the ground say there is a powerful pride in its indigenous quality, and specifically a pride that they are not sponsored by Washington. Moreover, America’s occupation of Iraq, and the resulting sectarian upheavals, have been propaganda points for other dictators trying to hold onto power.The main selling point for war in Iraq, at least for the American public, was that Hussein represented a threat to American security. But what kind of threat, exactly?Iraq was not, as Afghanistan had been, the host country and operational base of the new strain of Islamic fascism represented by Al Qaeda. It is true that Hussein hosted some nasty characters, but so did many other dictators hostile to America. At the time, Iraq was one of seven countries designated as sponsors of terrorism by the State Department, and in the other six cases we settled for sanctions as recourse enough. And his conventional military — what was left of it after it was laid waste in the deserts of Kuwait and Iraq in 1991 — was under close supervision.That leaves the elusive weapons of mass destruction. We forget how broad the consensus was that Hussein was hiding the kind of weapons that could rain holocaust on a neighbor or be delivered to America by proxy. He had recently possessed chemical weapons (he used them against the Kurds), and it was only a few years since we had discovered he had an active ambition to acquire nuclear weapons. Inspectors who combed the country after the first gulf war discovered a nuclear program far more advanced than our intelligence agencies had believed; so it is understandable that the next time around the analysts erred on the side of believing the worst.We now know that the consensus was wrong, and that it was built in part on intelligence that our analysts had good reason to believe was cooked. Should we — those of us without security clearances — have known it in 2003? Certainly we should have been more suspicious of the administration’s assurances. Kenneth Pollack, the former C.I.A. analyst who is now at the Brookings Institution, concedes that he should have drilled deeper into the claims of the intelligence crunchers; he was misled, he says, by the fact that they had seriously underestimated Hussein in the past. A few journalists — notably Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel of Knight Ridder newspapers — emphasized conflicting intelligence that questioned Hussein’s capabilities. But assuming we couldn’t know for sure, what would have been acceptable odds? If there was only a 50-50 chance that Hussein was close to possessing a nuclear weapon, could we live with that? One in five? One in 10?Colin Powell, who oversaw the campaign that drove Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait in 1991 and who was the most cautious member of President Bush’s war cabinet, was reluctantly convinced (duped, he would later say) that the W.M.D. risk merited military action. His word carried great weight. The journalist and author Fred Kaplan was one of many, I suspect, who joined the hawk club on the strength of Powell’s speech to the United Nations Security Council six weeks before the invasion.“I was particularly struck by the tape-recording of an intelligence intercept that Powell played — a phone conversation in which one Iraqi Republican Guard officer tells another to clean out a site before the inspectors get there,” Kaplan recalled. We learned much later that the Iraqi officers wanted to erase traces of chemical weapons that had been stored before the first gulf war. Kaplan dropped out of the hawk club within a month when he concluded that, whether or not an invasion was morally justified, he doubted the Bush administration was up to the task. The rest of us were still a little drugged by testosterone. And maybe a little too pleased with ourselves for standing up to evil and defying the caricature of liberals as, to borrow a phrase from those days, brie-eating surrender monkeys.In 1992, after driving the Iraqi army out of Kuwait, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney mused on the calculus of war. Why, he asked an audience in Seattle, had the United States not pursued Hussein’s forces all the way to Baghdad and removed him from power? Because, Cheney said, that would have committed the U.S. to an unacceptable long-term occupation, and it would have meant more American casualties. “The question in my mind is, how many additional American casualties is Saddam worth?” Cheney asked at the time. “And the answer is, not that damned many.”Of course, Cheney wasn’t so cautious the second time around. Along with the arguments that he and many others made after 9/11 came some insufficiently considered assumptions: that we were competent to invade and occupy Iraq without making an awful mess of it and that we could do it at a cost — in lives and money — that we could live with. In the end, the costs were greater than anyone anticipated because of calamitous mistakes in execution. Some critics would put at the top of their list of blunders the abrupt dismantling of the Iraqi Army and the purge of Hussein’s Baath Party from government ministries, moves that simultaneously deprived the unsettled country of stabilizing institutions and created an angry and battle-ready cadre of insurgents. Others will say the stupidest mistake was failing to have a credible plan for what came after the conquest. Others will point to the folly of installing power-hungry exiles in key jobs — handing the Oil Ministry to the great con artist Ahmed Chalabi, for example. All in all, Fred Kaplan, who predicted they would screw it up, looked like Nostradamus.Just consider the numbers. In the short-lived first gulf war, 148 Americans died in battle. In the current war, the toll so far is nearly 4,500 American dead and 32,000 wounded. At least 100,000 Iraqis, most of them noncombatants, have been killed. A war and occupation estimated to cost $100 billion over two years has already cost eight times that amount. And the meter is still running.For that price, we have purchased an Iraq where the fear of the tyrant has given way to the fear of random death. Baghdad remains a maze of blast walls and checkpoints, less menacing than during the spasmodic sectarian slaughter of 2006-2007, but still a very dangerous place to live. There is a querulous elected Parliament, but few of the other fundamentals of civil society like an adversarial press and trustworthy courts. The economy still depends overwhelmingly on oil and state jobs. It is one of the most corrupt countries on earth. And there is little confidence that things will not get worse. Many Iraqis fear the American occupation (as they still call it) is the only thing preventing a revival of sectarian killing and an even more authoritarian government.Our occupation of Iraq has also distracted us from Afghanistan, furnished a propaganda point for Al Qaeda recruiters and limited the credibility of our support for independence movements elsewhere. It is worth mentioning, too, that our moral standing as champions of civil society has been compromised by the abuses of Abu Ghraib and rendition and torture, byproducts of the war that will long remain a blot on our reputation.Where does this leave me? The world is well rid of Saddam Hussein. But knowing as we now do the exaggeration of Hussein’s threat, the cost in Iraqi and American lives and the fact that none of this great splurge has bought us confidence in Iraq’s future or advanced the cause of freedom elsewhere — I think Operation Iraqi Freedom was a monumental blunder.Whether it was wrong to support the invasion at the time is a harder call. I could not foresee that we would mishandle the war so badly, but I could see that there was no clear plan for — and at the highest levels, a shameful smugness about — what came after the invasion. I could not have known how bad the intelligence was, but I could see that the White House and the Pentagon were so eager to go that they were probably indifferent to any evidence that didn’t fit their scenario. I could see that they had embraced Chalabi, the exile cheerleader for war, despite considerable suspicion within the State Department and elsewhere that he was a charlatan. I could have seen, had I looked hard enough, that even by the more dire appraisals of Hussein’s capabilities he did not amount to what Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. called in a very different context “a clear and present danger.” But I wanted to be on the side of doing something, and standing by was not enough.As a candidate for president, George W. Bush famously argued that to command respect in the world, we needed to demonstrate not only strength but also humility. In office, though, the humility gave way to hubris. President Bush got it wrong. And so did I.The remedy for bad journalism is more and better journalism. Reporters at The Times made amends for the credulous prewar stories with investigations of the bad intelligence and with brave, relentless and illuminating coverage of the war and occupation. But what The Times writes casts a long shadow. For years, our early stories hyping Iraq’s menace (and to a lesser extent what people like me wrote on the opinion pages) fed a suspicion, especially on the left, that we were not to be trusted.John F. Burns, a correspondent who chronicled the tyranny of Hussein while the man was still in power and stayed on to cover the invasion and aftermath, recalls the reflexive hostility he encountered as a Times reporter on trips home. “We were all liars, warmongers, lapdogs of Bush and Cheney and so forth,” he told me.“Whatever we wrote — no matter what it was, and no matter how well documented — was dismissed as Bush propaganda,” added Dexter Filkins, who covered the battlefields and politics of Afghanistan and Iraq for The Times before moving last January to The New Yorker. “That was probably going to happen anyway, but the paper’s real failings gave those criticisms more credibility — and longer legs — than they deserved. Remember that the right-wingers (and a lot of the military) hated us at the time, too, since the war had started to go badly from the get-go, and we were reporting that.”The last big story to break on my watch as executive editor was the upheaval in Libya. The contours weren’t exactly the same, but they involved another entrenched, grotesque strongman; another oil economy; another fractured Arab society; another cloud of misinformation. This time we all — president, public and press — picked our way more carefully through the mess, weighing the urge to support freedom against the cost of becoming part of a drama we don’t fully understand. That is the caution of a country feeling more threatened these days by our own economics than by foreign enemies. But for some of us it is also the costly wisdom of Iraq.'"

"'11-09-06,'0','COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — Nick Ferrara kicked a 32-yard field goal with 1 minute 39 seconds left, Danny O’Brien threw for 348 yards and a touchdown, and Maryland beat short-handed Miami, 32-24, on Monday night in Coach Randy Edsall’s first game with the Terrapins.Miami, rocked by a continuing N.C.A.A. investigation into players’ involvement with a booster, was playing its initial game under Al Golden without eight suspended players, including quarterback Jacory Harris, linebacker Sean Spence and defensive linemen Marcus Forston and Adewale Ojomo.The sophomore Stephen Morris capably filled in for Harris, going 19 for 28 for 195 yards and running for a touchdown. But on a fourth-and-4, Morris threw an interception that Cameron Chism returned 54 yards for a score with 39 seconds left. It was the second touchdown by the Maryland defense. Chism forced a fumble that helped give the Terrapins a 20-14 halftime lead. Maryland had 311 yards and 19 first downs in the first half and finished with 499 yards, including 92 yards on 21 carries by Davin Meggett.The Terrapins wore new white uniforms patterned after the state flag. They included helmets splashed with red and white on the left side and black and yellow on the right, and the pattern continued to the shoulders. As decreed by Edsall, there were no names on the back. Edsall took over for Ralph Friedgen, who was fired in December.'"
"'11-09-06,'0','By last year, Justice Breyer’s position seemed to be softening. “Well, at some point I guess I have to accept Apprendi, because it’s the law and has been for some time,” he said at an argument.On Sept. 26, the justices will decide which of the thousands of appeals that have piled up over the summer are worth their time. Among them is yet another case on the issue Justice Breyer was discussing.It involves Jennifer Lynn Krieger, who pleaded guilty to giving a pain-medicine skin patch to a friend. The friend, Jennifer Ann Curry of West Frankfort, Ill., died after chewing the patch and taking an assortment of other drugs.The average sentence for a first-time offender who admits to distributing drugs like the one in the patch is seven months. The mandatory minimum sentence when “death results,” though, is 20 years.Ms. Krieger was not charged with causing her friend’s death. She denied doing so, and no jury ever addressed that question. But Judge J. Phil Gilbert of the Federal District Court in Benton, Ill., looked at the evidence on this point in connection with sentencing Ms. Krieger and found it more likely than not that Ms. Curry’s death had been caused by the patch.Judge Gilbert went on to say that he would have ruled differently had the government been required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the patch had caused Ms. Curry’s death. Reasonable doubt is, of course, the standard that juries are instructed to use in criminal trials.Judge Gilbert did not seem happy about where all of this left him. He said he was required to impose the 20-year sentence even though it was “unduly harsh.”“One cannot escape the conclusion that Krieger, while convicted of distribution” of drugs, he wrote, “is being sentenced for homicide.”An appeals court upheld the decision even as it noted that the law in this area hangs by a “precariously thin” thread, partly because “Justice Breyer’s dedication to his position” in the 2002 case “may be waning.”For now, though, Justice Breyer is following an approach that some scholars call “perpetual dissent.” Such dissents can be problematic, Allison Orr Larsen wrote in 2008 in The George Mason Law Review.It is one thing, she wrote, to cast a vote when a new issue reaches the court. There the justice’s job is to reach the correct result. It is another thing when the issue arises a second time. Now the question becomes whether there is a good enough reason to violate the doctrine of stare decisis, which says that precedents should be overturned only for a very good reason.Dissenting a second time because you dissented the first time, Professor Larsen wrote, is not such a reason. “To factor in one’s individual track record on an issue,” she wrote, is “an example of political behavior.”Perhaps it is only a coincidence, but Professor Larsen, who teaches law at William & Mary, served as a law clerk to Justice Souter and published her article a year before he issued his striking concurrence. Justice Souter announced his retirement a few weeks later.In her study, Professor Larsen found that every member of the court led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist from 1986 to 2005 had issued perpetual dissents. But she was unable to find a pattern in what she called a rampant but inconsistent practice.The intensity of a justice’s commitment to a position did not seem to explain the issuance of such dissents. Nor did the freshness of the precedent at issue, or how closely divided the justices were.The dissents were, instead, often simply an attempt to remain internally consistent.Seth Stern and Stephen Wermiel described this tendency in their recent biography of Justice William J. Brennan Jr., who died in 1997. In the justice’s later years, “his enormous body of opinions guided his clerks except in the rare instances when a new issue arose,” they wrote. “The guiding principle was not to contradict his prior opinions.”That is a principle. But, as Justice Souter’s concurrence two years ago suggested, it is not always a legitimate one.'"
"'11-09-06,'0','Mr. Leeder’s fall is still under investigation, according to park officials, but foul play is not suspected. The death came on the heels of another one at Half Dome in which Hayley LaFlamme, 26, slipped in wet conditions. She fell 600 feet and was pronounced dead at the scene.Such gruesome, headline-grabbing deaths have not been limited to Yosemite, of course. In late August, the body of a 59-year-old man was discovered in Yellowstone National Park, having been mauled and killed by a grizzly bear.For all that, national parks officials say that the parks are not more or less dangerous than years past, and that many of the deaths are from more commonplace causes, like car accidents, heart attacks and suicides. Jeffrey Olson, a spokesman for the Park Service, said there had actually been fewer deaths at national parks so far this year — 113 through last week — than in the same period last year. And that is out of some 280 million annual visitors to the national parks.“It’s a really, really small percentage of people who don’t make it home,” Mr. Olson said, adding that he thought the public was doing a good job of being safe. “We wish they did a little bit better job, of course. But you can trip on the curb at a park in Manhattan.” (True, though falling off a cliff is certainly less likely.)Michael P. Ghiglieri, the co-author of “Off the Wall: Death at Yosemite,” with Charles R. Farabee Jr., said Yosemite was probably the deadliest park in the country, with about 900 traumatic deaths — those not attributable to a previous medical condition — since its establishment in 1890. It is a record that Mr. Ghiglieri attributes in part to the park’s unique geography, with fast-moving water, glacier-carved canyons and towering waterfalls.“These are humongous, gigantic, scare-your-pants-off kinds of waterfalls,” he said.And often it is the actions of those who go to gawk at such marvels that are to blame, including, Mr. Ghiglieri said, the eternal quest for the perfect snapshot.“In Yosemite, there is an attraction of having your picture taken right there in those waterfalls, especially now with Facebook and Twitter,” he said. “But even with old cameras the attraction was the same.”Then, too, there are those who simply insist on pushing the limits — or pushing past clearly marked signs. It was just such a decision that turned fatal on July 19, when three 20-something visitors from an Assyrian church in nearby Ceres, Calif., fell into the Merced River, just above Vernal Fall, a 317-foot drop-off onto boulders below. The river was roaring, a result of the runoff from ample snows in the Sierra Nevada this winter, something that has made many of Yosemite’s waterways extra treacherous.Witnesses to the deaths said that at least one of the victims had jumped the fence, slipped and fallen in, and that the other two died trying a rescue.Jake Bibee, who saw the accident, told The Fresno Bee that the group was “taking pictures and being stupid” before tragedy struck.“We had to watch the fear on their faces as they knew they were plunging to their death,” Mr. Bibee said. “It was awful.”There is also the danger of bravado. Half Dome, in particular, which is reachable only by a hike up an unrelentingly steep trail, is referred to by some aficionados as “our Mount Everest.”And while that may be hyperbole, many who reach the final push toward the top of Half Dome — a 400-foot segment of cable at a 45-degree angle, often crowded with people — can make questionable decisions, like rushing or pushing ahead in bad weather.“They call it ‘summit fever,’ ” said David Buchanan, 50, a regular visitor to Yosemite who has climbed Half Dome. “They’ve gone so far, not to make it to the top isn’t an option.”This year, park officials have tried to limit the number of people who try to climb Half Dome by requiring permits. But the permit does not take applicants’ physical condition into account, Ms. Cobb said.None of the bad news has seemed to hurt the park’s popularity. Yosemite had its busiest July ever this summer, with about 730,000 visitors. On Friday, a steady stream of cars plowed toward the park, while inside the gates, hundreds made the mile-and-a-half trek to the top of Vernal Fall.The river’s flow was less violent than in July, but still rapid. Nevertheless, several visitors climbed onto rocks and fallen limbs just beyond the edge of a small fence to pose for photos or dip their feet in the icy water despite a sign saying swimming and wading was prohibited.Such rule-bending leads to eye-rolling by Yosemite visitors like Randy Crawford, 45, who was sitting with his wife and three children near a shallow section of the river known as the Silver Apron, about 500 feet from the top of the falls. Mr. Crawford said he was strict with his children: no running, no jumping, no touching the water.“They don’t go near it, and they don’t go near the wet rock,” he said. “This is not Disneyland.”'"
"'11-09-06,'0','Mr. Vann Nath’s death came as long-delayed trials of former Khmer Rouge leaders were under way. He was the first survivor to testify, in 2009, against the Tuol Sleng commandant, Kaing Guek Eav, or Duch, who is now appealing a sentence that the judges reduced to 19 years from 35.“I could not sleep last night,” he said at the courthouse as the trial began. “I was waiting for the sunrise so that I could see Duch in the dock.”On the witness stand he said that prisoners were so starved that they ate insects that fell from the ceiling, and that he even dreamed of eating human flesh. “Even though I’ve tried my best to forget, it still haunts me,” he told the court.Testimony in a second trial of four senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge is expected to start soon.Mr. Vann Nath was born into a poor farming family in Battambang Province in 1946 and became a painter of signs and billboards. He said he was arrested for reasons he did not know while working in a rice field and was spared only when his jailers discovered that he could paint.“Every brush stroke,” he said in an interview, “you were just hoping that they would like it and would let you live.”From his workshop he said he could hear the screams of prisoners under torture and of children seized from their parents to be killed.“When the screams got really bad, we just turned and looked at each other as if we had made an appointment,” he said. “We were talking to each other with our eyes. We wanted to say, ‘Is this what will happen to us, too?’ ”He was liberated in January 1979 when a Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge from power and his jailers fled.In the years since then, supported partly by his paintings and by ownership of a restaurant, he had become a living representative of the victims of Tuol Sleng, often interviewed by journalists, calmly retelling his story.Information on survivors was not available.'"
"'11-09-06,'0','The Open is the last Grand Slam event of the year for the players and, for New Yorkers, the last grand social event of the summer. It is a place to be seen. And for many, to be heard.The match marred by the suite talk did not seem to surprise Sharapova. “Drinking early,” she said, deadpan.“This is not like a baseball game or a soccer game where you just talk and yell and scream and don’t even watch half the game,” she said. “It’s quite different.”Tennis players are like theater performers. Both require silence so they can hear their cues; in the players’ case, that would be the sound of the ball coming off their opponents’ rackets. And on each stage, longstanding etiquette calls for no flash photography, ringing cellphones, audience chatter or crowd movement, any of which can distract the performers and throw them off.The prolonged cries of a baby in the stands pierced the envelope of David Ferrer’s tolerance in a match this year in Miami, and he smacked a ball in the direction of the shrieking child.Actors have been known to lash out at unruly spectators, too. Alec Baldwin, who attended the first night of the Open, was starring on Broadway in a 1992 production of “A Streetcar Named Desire” when, in a pivotal scene, an audience member in the front row pulled out a camera and snapped a flash photograph.In the next scene, Baldwin, much in character as Stanley Kowalski, took a bottle of beer and poured it over the woman’s head.“It was an impulse that I had,” he said, adding, “The audience burst into applause.”In tennis, as in the theater, Baldwin lamented, “Some of the worst behavior is from people in the most expensive seats.”Melissa Errico, a Broadway singer and actress and the wife of the tennis player turned commentator Patrick McEnroe, said the problem was that many audience members bring the same viewing habits to events they attend as ones they watch on television.“People talk to their TVs, they walk away from them, they talk while they’re watching television,” Errico said. “I think people go to entertainment now carelessly. You can’t go carelessly. You have to go with care and attention. You have a job, too, as an audience member. Everybody has a role.”Errico had been McEnroe’s girlfriend for only a few events when she accompanied him to the 1997 Australian Open. McEnroe played Carlos Moyá, a future world No. 1 but an unknown then. In front of a crowd of 3,000, he lost, 3-6, 6-0, 6-3, 6-1.As Moyá yanked the match from McEnroe’s grasp, Errico’s cries of support grew ever more exuberant.“In one point, in front of everybody,” she said, “he looked me straight in the eye and said, ‘Shuussh!’ He shushed me as loud as a shush could be. Unwittingly, I was a really big distraction at the time.”Ringing cellphones are the bane of every entertainer’s existence. In tennis, there is also the voice that chirps when everyone else is quiet. On an outer court at the Open last year, fans were shouting between serves, a breach of etiquette in tennis that is on par with interrupting someone while he is talking.Daniel E. Doyle Jr., who was there, said the offenders detracted from his enjoyment of the match. Doyle, the executive director of the Institute for International Sport at the University of Rhode Island, was not alone. Another fan approached the offenders and told them to be quiet, Doyle said. An usher intervened, and peace was restored.“It was as if they were oblivious to the protocol,” Doyle said. “They were more important than the athletes that were on the court competing.”For Doyle, it was a case of his research bleeding into his recreation. He has made sportsmanship his life’s study. Describing the disintegration of fan etiquette as “the biggest threat to sportsmanship,” Doyle said, “You have people who, emboldened by the cover of the crowd, are able to say anything and do anything without consequences.”There can be a price to be paid for misbehaving, examples of which fill an entire page of a United States Tennis Association security manual. From their seats, chair umpires can phone the control center to report offenders, who will be visited by security officers bearing their version of a soccer yellow card. There is also a number that fans can text to report disruptive behavior, and there are security officers who patrol all the courts.Three fans were arrested after scuffling in the upper deck of Arthur Ashe Stadium last year during a match featuring the eventual men’s runner-up, Novak Djokovic. For several seconds, the entertainer became the audience as Djokovic stopped to watch the unfolding drama.“A hockey game broke out at a tennis match,” said Michael J. Rodriguez, the U.S.T.A.’s director of security. He said the incident was an example of a fan’s feeling as if, for the cost of a ticket, he earned the right to say whatever he pleased, however profane.“Look, you travel around the world and you meet different kind of people,” Djokovic said. “New York crowd, especially in the night matches, is very special. They really get involved. They have a lot of fun. They’re very loud. A lot of music in the changeovers. It’s different from other Grand Slams.”The behavior that has come to be accepted at the Open is spreading to other tennis stadiums in the United States, in places like Stanford, Calif., and Mason, Ohio.“Unfortunately, it’s at a few tournaments,” the veteran player James Blake said. “It’s going to happen, especially when you have corporate suites. They’re great for us, they bring in a lot of money, but sometimes they bring in fans who are just there to have food and drinks and not watch the tennis.”Not everybody is complaining. Andy Roddick, who routinely plays at night at Ashe Stadium, said: “At the end of the day we are entertainment. We are a business. The reason that we play a game for stupid amounts of money is because of the guy yelling who has had too many beers.”'"
"'11-09-06,'0','Google’s rivals, like Bing and , have versions of Places — called Bing Local and Yahoo Local — and these let users report a business as closed. But neither has anything close to Google’s traffic, which means they are the scene of far less mischief.When Google created Places it had an eminently sensible type of crowd-sourcing in mind. The site contains millions of listings, and when owners close without updating their profile, the job falls to customers to keep information current. But like any open system, this one can be abused. Search engine consultants say that “closing” a business on Google has become an increasingly common tactic among unscrupulous competitors.“I’d say that it was in June that we started to see a big uptick in complaints about this in online forums,” said Linda Buquet of Catalyst eMarketing in San Marcos, Calif. “It might be that a number of consultants are now offering services like ‘nuke your competitor’ in Google Places. But it could just be a competitor, acting alone.”Nobody is quite sure how prevalent these sham closings have become. In Google Forums, where users can pose questions about Google’s features, there are dozens of exasperated postings like this one, written in July: “Help! My business is listed ‘PERMANENTLY CLOSED’ on Google Maps even though it has always been open! Help!”But this most likely represents a fraction of viable businesses that have been cyberpadlocked. Many owners, search consultants say, have no idea that they’ve been shuttered online, and many others fix the problem without asking anyone how to solve it.A Google spokesman, Gabriel Stricker, declined to comment on whether the company kept a running tally of fraudulent closings. But he said Google was aware of the issue and was already working on changes, which will be adopted in coming days, to prevent what he called “malicious or incorrect labeling.”“We know that accurate listings on Google Maps are an important tool for many business owners,” he wrote in an e-mail. “We take reports of spam and abuse very seriously and do our best to ensure the accuracy of a listing before updating it.”If there is a historical antecedent to “closing” a company on Google, it is a dirty trick that was fairly common in 19th-century politics, wherein supporters of a candidate would spread rumors that his opponent was dead. This didn’t always work — prevailed in the election of 1800, despite reports of his demise — but the Internet corollary can have terrible consequences.“For weeks, our bookings for September have been far lower than normal and we were wondering why,” said Charlene Cowan, who owns and operates Macadamia Meadows Farm, a bed-and-breakfast in Naalehu, , which has been tagged as “permanently closed” for weeks.  “I can’t imagine a customer is behind this — if someone doesn’t like their visit here, they’d complain on TripAdvisor. I can’t prove it, but this seems like something a competitor did.”The owner of a closed business, and customers who know better, can click on a button marked “not true,” which appears by all “reportedly closed” and “permanently closed” listings. In some instances, owners say, a business will “open” shortly thereafter. But other owners, like Ms. Cowan, say that the button doesn’t work, or that it takes a week to have any effect. Still others say that immediately after clicking the “not true” button, their business is immediately “closed” again.“In the last four days, I’ve hit that ‘not true’ button every six to eight hours,” said Daniel Navejas of RBI Divorce Lawyers of . “It’s getting old.”In mid-August, a search consultant and blogger named Mike Blumenthal was so rankled by what he considered Google’s cavalier attitude to closings on Google that he committed an act of online disobedience: He “closed” Google’s offices in Mountain View, Calif. For a brief period, Google itself was “reportedly closed,” according to Places. “I did it to point out how annoying this is when it happens,” he said.On Aug. 15, Mr. Blumenthal posted a screen shot of Google’s Places page “reportedly closed,” noting that it took just two people — him and a friend — to pull off this stunt. It seemed to get the company’s attention. At least one change to closings on Places has already been made. Since late August, a business that is newly tagged “permanently closed,” receives an alert via e-mail from Google, informing the business owner of the change.Mr. Blumenthal describes this as a good start, but hardly enough. “The company really ought to give a heads-up when a business is tagged ‘reportedly closed,’ ” because those words alone are often enough to put off customers, he said. “Google doesn’t understand how much fear and discomfort businesses have about this. One company gets to decide if you’re open or closed in the online world.”Although they allow users to report a business as closed, Bing Local and Yahoo Local don’t yet seem to have as many problems.Case in point: Macadamia Meadows Farm, that bed-and-breakfast in Hawaii, is open for business, according to both Bing Local and Yahoo Local. But after weeks of e-mails and even a call or two to Mountain View, its owner, Ms. Cowan, can’t scrub the “permanently closed” label from Google Places.“A few days ago, I put on our Places page that we’re running a special,” she said. “I just hope people read that and think ‘Well, they must actually be open.’ ”'"
"'11-09-06,'0','Iranian officials warned Monday that “counterrevolutionaries” from abroad were behind the flash mobs of young people who have been holding boisterous water gun fights in public parks across the country. Gen. Ahmad Radan, the acting Iranian police commander, was quoted in newspapers on Monday as saying that a number of people were arrested at an Tehran park on Friday, and he vowed that police would act to prevent future water fights. Hard-liners see the water fights as unseemly and immoral, breaking taboos against the social mixing of men and women, and they worry that the gatherings could weaken adherence to Iran’s cleric-led Islamic rule or even build into outright protests against the ruling system.'"
"'11-09-06,'0','Netflix introduced its movie and TV streaming service in Brazil on Monday as part of a push into Latin America. The move is seen as crucial to the company’s growth after recent setbacks in the United States. Netflix says it plans to expand into 43 countries throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Netflix will add service to Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay on Wednesday, then will expand to Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean within a week. The move brings challenges not seen in Netflix’s core markets. Broadband Internet reaches a far smaller percentage of homes in Latin America than in the United States, and speeds are slower. Piracy of movies is widespread, meaning many consumers can pick up a DVD or CD of the latest films for less than a dollar. Also, Netflix has little brand recognition in the region, and in the case of Brazil it already faces a homegrown competitor.'"
"'11-09-06,'0','AMSTERDAM (AP) — Attackers who hacked into a Dutch Web security firm have issued hundreds of fraudulent security certificates for intelligence agency Web sites, including the C.I.A., as well as for Internet giants like Google, Microsoft and Twitter, the Dutch government said on Monday.Experts say they suspect the hacker — or hackers — operated with the cooperation of the Iranian government, perhaps in attempts to spy on dissidents.The latest versions of browsers including Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, Google’s Chrome and Mozilla’s Firefox are now rejecting certificates issued by the firm that was hacked, DigiNotar.But in a statement on Monday, the Dutch Justice Ministry published a list of the fraudulent certificates that greatly expands the scope of the July hacking attack that DigiNotar acknowledged only last week. The list also includes certificates that were sent to sites operated by Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft, Skype, AOL, the Tor Project, WordPress, and by intelligence agencies like Israel’s Mossad and Britain’s MI6.DigiNotar is one of many companies that sell the security certificates widely used to authenticate Web sites and guarantee that communications between a user’s browser and a site are secure.'"
"'11-09-06,'0','Populations on the run during disasters can be tracked by cellphone signals, which could help guide life-saving aid to the right places, a new study has concluded.For the study, which appeared last week in the journal PLoS Medicine, researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and Columbia University formulated their idea after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, and then tried it out in practice during the cholera epidemic that began there 10 months later.Refugees can put their lives at risk if they flee beyond the reach of food, water and medical care. Relief agencies guessing where to set up tents must rely on sometimes flawed reports from witnesses, traffic monitors, reporters and satellite and aerial photos.The researchers collected data on the transmitting towers relaying signals from 1.9 million cellphones. They concluded that 20 percent of the population of the capital, Port-au-Prince, fled after the quake, with most people going to Les Cayes, Leogane and Saint-Marc.That roughly matched the results of an expensive United Nations survey of 2,500 households.In the cholera outbreak, which began near Saint-Marc, the researchers tracked cellphone use in real time. Within 12 hours they were able to tell relief agencies where people had gone, which suggested where new outbreaks could start, said Dr. Linus Bengtsson, the study’s lead author.In that case, only about 3 percent of people fled, many for Port-au-Prince; others moved inland.Dr. Bengtsson’s group is now creating a nonprofit organization to track cellphone use in future disasters.'"
"'11-09-06,'0','The existing rule, which disqualifies any sprinter immediately after a false start, is unlikely to change even after it came under attack in Daegu, where athletes and commentators clamored for more mercy or a return to the previous rule, which allowed one false start for the field.“I didn’t realize how much I loved that rule until I saw this one,” said Ato Boldon, the sprinter turned commentator.Lamine Diack, president of track’s governing body, said Sunday that the International Association of Athletics Federations would not revise the rule for London.Frankie Fredericks, the former world champion sprinter from Namibia who was elected to the I.A.A.F. council here, sounded more open to dialogue.“I think it’s good for us that the youngsters realize that we are serious with the rules, that even if a Bolt false-starts and gets thrown out, nobody can mess with the rules,” Fredericks said. ”I think, in that sense, it’s good. But whether it’s good for us to lose one of our marquee sprinters at the final is a different issue. I think it’s one we need to study. What will be fair?”If fairness is truly the issue, there really are only two solutions. Either every sprinter is allowed one false start, as was the case before 2003, or nobody is allowed a false start, as is the case now.But no matter how diverting it may seem, the false-start debate is hardly the major issue facing global track, which needs to find a way to appeal to the young.Sebastian Coe, the former middle-distance star who is now an I.A.A.F. vice president and head of the organizing committee for the London Games, wants to see a more extensive, creative analysis of youth culture worldwide.“For me, the one thing we’ve got to make much more of an effort with is just to try to understand the landscape that kids are living in,” Coe said. “I don’t think you can, in isolation, rejigger track and field.”Doping scandals have repeatedly wounded the sport, beginning in earnest with the Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson’s positive test and disqualification at the Seoul Olympics and peaking again with the Balco investigation that led to the American star Marion Jones’s disgrace and eventual imprisonment.To speak with athletes of this generation, particularly American athletes, is to realize how much psychological damage has been done. Dwight Phillips won his fourth world title in the men’s long jump here and has also won an Olympic gold medal, but he believes his low profile in the United States is largely linked to the scandals.“A lot of times my titles have been overshadowed by the negativity of doping,” Phillips said. “This is my fourth world championship, this is my seventh global title, but people don’t even know about it. They don’t even highlight me most of the times because of negative doping outcomes. So I have to constantly, every year, prove myself.”But Phillips and others are encouraged by recent efforts, including the I.A.A.F.’s decision to follow professional cycling’s lead and collect blood samples from every athlete who participated in these championships with the goal of creating a so-called biological passport that can be used to monitor parameters and detect significant changes over time.“Everybody always talked about the testers being one step behind, so hopefully they’re catching up and they’re on level par at least now,” Dai Greene, the British hurdler who won the 400 hurdles.There were no positive tests announced during the championships in Daegu, but the anecdotal evidence is encouraging in that mind-blowing performances are becoming increasingly rare. Greene’s time of 48.26 in the 400 hurdles was the slowest winning time in world championship history, as was the American Jenny Simpson’s time of 4 minutes 5.4 seconds in the women’s 1,500.Only two athletes in individual events threatened uncharted territory. Mariya Abakumova of Russia had to produce the second-best throw ever — 71.99 meters (236 feet 2 ¼ inches) — to win the women’s javelin over Barbora Spotakova, who holds the record of 72.28 meters. In the 100 hurdles, the Australian Sally Pearson’s winning time of 12.28 seconds was seven-hundredths of a second off the world record.The next site for world championship thrills will be Moscow in 2013, followed by a return to the Bird’s Nest stadium in Beijing in 2015. London and Doha, Qatar, are the only bidders for the 2017 championships.For now, though, London is guaranteed only one global track championships.That will come next August during the 2012 Games. Unlike South Korea, Britain is a track and field nation, and based on the routinely tight finishes in Daegu, on the emergence of new champions like Simpson and Grenada’s Kirani James and, above all, on Bolt, it should be quite a meet.'"

"'11-09-07,'1','Turmoil in Europe could quickly spread across the Atlantic because of the intertwined nature of the global financial system. In addition, it could further damage the already struggling economies elsewhere.“This crisis has the potential to be a lot worse than Lehman Brothers,” said , the hedge fund investor, citing the lack of an authoritative pan-European body to handle a banking crisis of this severity. “That is why the problem is so serious. You need a crisis to create the political will for Europe to create such an authority, but there is still no understanding as to what the authority will do.”The growing nervousness was reflected in financial markets Tuesday, with in the and Europe falling 1 percent and European bank stocks falling 5 percent or more after steep drops in recent weeks.European bank shares are now at their lowest point since March 2009, when the global banking system was still shaky following Lehman’s collapse.Investors also continued to seek the safety of bonds, as yields on 10-year bonds briefly touched 1.90 percent, the lowest ever, before closing at 1.98 percent.Adding to the anxiety, several immediate challenges face European officials as they try to calm markets worried about the debt crisis spreading.In the coming weeks, the 17 countries of currency zone each could agree to a July deal brokered to bail out again and possibly the region’s ailing banks. Along with getting unanimity, more immediate obstacles could trip up the agreement.On Wednesday, ’s top court upheld the legality of Berlin’s rescue packages, but said any future bailouts for debt-stricken euro zone countries must be approved by a parliamentary panel. On Thursday, officials in are to express their conditions for approving the deal, and other countries may follow with their own demands to ensure their loans will be paid back.Though they have not succeeded in calming the markets, European leaders have taken a series of steps to avert a Lehman-like failure. New lines have been opened by the for institutions that need funds, while the proposed Greek bailout would provide loans to countries that need to recapitalize their banks. In addition, the central bank has been buying up bonds from and , among other countries, to keep interest rates from spiking. Many of these have been bought from European banks, effectively allowing them to shed troubled assets for cash.While the problems in smaller countries like Greece and are not new, in recent weeks the concerns have spread to banking giants in countries like Germany and that are crucial to the functioning of the global financial system and are closely linked with their American counterparts. What is more, worries have surfaced about the outlook for Italy, whose debt dwarfs that of other smaller troubled borrowers like Greece.“It seems like the banking sector globally is being hurt on multiple fronts,” said Philip Finch, a bank strategist with in . “It’s definitely getting worse.”In Europe, the worry is that government bonds owned by European banks could fall sharply in value if economically distressed countries cannot pay back their loans. That would saddle the most exposed banks with huge losses.As a result, banks are reluctant to lend money to one another and are hoarding cash. “If sentiment continues to deteriorate, ultimately we’ll see a deposit run,” Mr. Finch said. “I’m extremely worried about that.”Mr. Finch said European banks needed to raise at least 150 billion euros in new capital, even if they do not experience large losses on sovereign debt. With stock prices so low, though, that is difficult to do, and any new offerings of company stock would dilute the value of existing shares.American money market funds, long a reliable financing source for capital starved European banks, have sharply cut back on their exposure — starting in Spain and Italy but now also France — making it harder for European banks to loan dollars.The 10 biggest money market funds in the United States cut their exposure to European banks by a further 9 percent in July, or $30 billion, after a reduction of 20 percent in June, the Institute of International Finance said in a report issued Monday.“U.S. investors remain very sensitive to the headlines out of Europe,” said Alex Roever, who tracks short-term credit markets for . “The sell-off that we’ve seen in European bank stocks is going to reinforce that and investors are likely to stay hyper-cautious. European banks are not borrowing as much, and they’re not borrowing for as long as they could three months ago.”Nevertheless, American institutions remain vulnerable to problems their French counterparts might encounter. At the end of the second quarter, JPMorgan Chase reported total cross-border exposure of $49 billion to France, while had $44 billion and had $20 billion.French banks, which have huge holdings of sovereign debt from countries across Europe, have been among the hardest hit, despite the French government’s efforts to protect them. The authorities imposed a temporary ban on short-selling last month after shares in , a bank considered too big to fail, tumbled on rumors it may be insolvent.But shares of Société Générale are still sliding amid concern that it, like and other major French banks, is having trouble raising dollars to finance its American and other dollar-based operations.Société Générale officials say that the market’s fears are unfounded. The bank’s chief executive, Frédéric Oudéa, has described rumors that Société Générale was having trouble raising money as “fantasy.” The shares closed down 6 percent Tuesday at 18.93 euros. Three months ago the shares were at 40.What is more, French banks, like other European banks, are able to obtain financing from the European Central Bank if necessary.Meanwhile, problems in Spain were highlighted on Tuesday when one of Spain’s largest savings banks, Caja de Ahorros del Mediterráneo, reported a startling increase in bad loans to 19 percent of overall lending from 9 percent at the end of last year.Still, the huge stockpile of euros that banks have stashed away at the European Central Bank  at rock-bottom interest rates —  last night it hit a recent high of 166 billion euros  — suggests that no bank is close to a Lehman-like failure.The risk now is that Europe’s resistance to recapitalizing its banks could turn into a broader crisis.Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies in ,  had a blunt explanation of why European governments have so far refused to recapitalize their banks.“They don’t have the money and they are in the pockets of their bankers,” Mr. Gros said.Policy makers in the United States and , where compulsory infusions of new capital played a crucial role in calming the markets in 2008, have long urged Europe to do the same.'"

He was 90.His death was announced by his family.In the decade after World War II, the British government began promoting research into flight at speeds approaching and exceeding the speed of sound as a precursor to a new generation of military and perhaps commercial aircraft.On the morning of March 10, 1956, Mr. Twiss, a test pilot for Britain’s Fairey Aviation, climbed into the cockpit of the delta-winged Fairey Delta 2, a research plane powered by a single turbojet engine, and took off from an experimental aircraft station near England’s south coast.He flew to 38,000 feet and then made two runs of 9.4 miles each in opposite directions over West Sussex.As he ended his first run, Mr. Twiss became something of a sightseer.“A wide sweep out to sea, with the Thames Estuary away to one side and the French coast on the other,” he wrote in a first-person account for The New York Times Magazine a few weeks later. “I noticed stubble fields being burned off in Normandy and how the smoke was blowing across the Channel toward the white cliffs of England.

"'11-09-07,'1','UNITED NATIONS — The global economy faces a decade-long stagnation because governments are pursuing deficit cuts and other austerity measures rather than providing the needed stimulus packages, said a United Nations economic report released Tuesday.Instead of new regulation of the financial system to address the problems that helped bring on the recession in 2007-8, governments in the United States and Europe are trying to woo the very speculators who helped cause the problem, said the report by the Geneva-based United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which is known by its acronym, Unctad.“Those who support fiscal tightening argue that it is indispensable for restoring the confidence of financial markets, which is perceived as key to economic recovery,” the report said.“This is despite the almost universal recognition that the crisis was the result of financial market failure in the first place.”The report criticized the austerity measures as producing results exactly opposite their intended effect.'"
"'11-09-07,'1','The Open declined to make available the director of officials, the tournament referee or any top umpires. But Chris Widmaier, the managing director of communications for the United States Tennis Association, said: “We’re very comfortable with the quality of officials. There doesn’t seem to be any controversy except the controversy that one disgruntled official has stirred up.”One gold badge umpire detailed complaints, including pay, to The Times, a London newspaper, earlier this week. But Chryst said the issue went beyond one official, as shown by the umpires who are not working the Open. They include some of the most respected in the sport, like Lars Graff, Mohamed Lahyani, Cedric Mourier and Steve Ullrich, the chair umpire for last year’s men’s singles final.Widmaier said the Open generally hired 15 or 16 gold badge umpires. He said that two declined this year to spend less time on the road, and another ran into visa issues. Asked if all 26 gold badge umpires would be ideal at the Open, he said that many would not be necessary.“We look at every aspect of this tournament every year,” he said. “If we feel improvements need to be made, we make them.”A spreadsheet obtained by The New York Times showed that Wimbledon paid gold badge umpires £189, or about $306 daily. The French Open paid 190 euros (about $270), even for the tournament’s qualifying rounds, while the United States Open pays $185 a day for its qualifying rounds.At the Australian Open, gold badge umpires earn about $383 for each main draw day, and they make overtime if they work more than 10 hours, a perk none of the other Grand Slam tournaments provide.The differences extend beyond pay scale. Gold badge umpires receive their own hotel rooms at the United States and French Opens, share two-bedroom apartments in Australia and must book their own accommodations at Wimbledon, where they get about $121.50 a day for expenses.All tournaments provide on-site meal vouchers, with none higher than the French Open (about $37). All also pay a portion of the umpires’ travel expenses, with the United States Open, at $500 for travel both domestic and international, again the lowest of the majors.Chryst said the problems with the United States Open went beyond pay, extending to more complaints like too many hours and not enough days off. Chryst said the absences were heavier on the men’s side, with more ATP gold badge umpires absent. “They’re the ones who see the players every week,” he said.Told that officials believed the tournament had not suffered in quality, Chryst noted that several gold badge umpires did not work the entire United States Open in 2004 because they were involved in a credential scandal at the Athens Olympics.An umpire officiating an Open match that year between Serena Williams and Jennifer Capriati made one particularly erroneous call, an instance often credited as the impetus behind the implementation of the Hawk-Eye instant replay system. The umpire, Chryst said, was rated a silver badge.“Was Hawk-Eye ultimately fortunate for all umpires?” he asked. “I think so. It’s a good thing. But that’s what can happen when the best aren’t there.”Players appear more aware of individual umpires than their respective ratings. Told of the lack of top-level umpires at this year’s Open, Roger Federer said: “I don’t know about that. It’s a tough job being an umpire. I wish that all the best umpires would be here, but it is who it is, and I hope that they can resolve the issue.”Chryst said, “There’s nothing the umpires can do except not come.”'"

"'11-09-07,'1','IN the 25 years since Maguy Le Coze and her brother, the chef Gilbert Le Coze, opened the Midtown Manhattan version of Le Bernardin, their high-end Parisian seafood restaurant, the menu has changed more than the dining room. Flavors from Asia and Spain were added, along with new techniques and new ingredients, particularly after Eric Ripert took charge of the kitchen and became a partner after the death of Mr. Le Coze, in 1994.Over the years, the restaurant’s look became lighter and less formal as upholstery and window treatments were redone, the color scheme shifted from blue to honey, and art on the walls was shuffled. But it was all cosmetic. Ms. Le Coze said that many customers never noticed anything different.Now she and Mr. Ripert have transformed the restaurant, from the walls, to the seating, to the layout of the bar, creating a much more contemporary atmosphere.“Eric and I were no longer comfortable in this setting,” Ms. Le Coze said. “We now have a younger clientele and we have to keep up.”When the restaurant reopens on Friday after more than a month of gutting and renovation, the dining room, designed by Bentel & Bentel, the architects for Gramercy Tavern and the Modern, will retain almost nothing of the original except the elaborate coffered wood ceiling. What was conservative is now sleek.'"
"'11-09-07,'1','WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) — Solyndra, a solar panel maker that received $535 million in federal loan guarantees, filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday.Solyndra, which also received more than $700 million in venture capital financing, said it would try to find a buyer quickly to avoid a fire sale liquidation.The solar industry has been in turmoil this year as a glut of panels has sent prices plummeting 25 percent. Manufacturing capacity expanded just as government austerity measures in Europe eliminated subsidies and undercut demand.Solyndra cut prices to try to compete but said in court papers that it had been unable to match the extended payment terms offered by foreign competitors.The company, based in Fremont, Calif., said last week it had suspended operations and laid off 1,100 workers.Solyndra’s bankruptcy filing followed similar filings by Evergreen Solar and SpectraWatt, a private company that was backed by the Intel Corporation.'"
"'11-09-07,'1','People with tickets for the canceled sessions can exchange them for equivalent tickets to a later session at this year’s Open, if available, or for next year’s tournament.Each year that rain scrambles the Open schedule it becomes more notable as the Grand Slam most likely to stretch longer than scheduled.The United States Tennis Association has backed away from putting a roof over cavernous Ashe stadium, particularly after receiving an estimate of $150 million to $200 million to do so in 2009. The organization said it was difficult to spend that much on a stadium that is used only several weeks a year instead of investing it in its core mission: promoting grass-roots tennis programs.But last November, the U.S.T.A. did discuss plans for a renovation of the tennis center that would cost upwards of $300 million. Reportedly, it would involve the demolition of Louis Armstrong Stadium and the Grandstand Court, replacing them with separate stadiums, the new Armstrong being “roof-ready.”The U.S.T.A. spokesman Chris Widmaier said, however, that the organization had not committed to a plan.“We have discussed a lot of ideas, but I can’t say that is the actual plan,” he said. “Whatever happens, we will be coordinating it with the city of New York, which is our landlord.”The Open remains one of two Grand Slam events with no protection from the weather. The retractable roof over Centre Court at Wimbledon made its debut in 2009. The Australian Open’s Rod Laver Arena has had a retractable roof since it was renovated in 2000 and its secondary court, Hisense Arena, also has a retractable roof. They are used as much to shield players and fans from extreme heat as to allow play to continue during rain.Roland Garros, home of the French Open, remains open to the elements, but the weather is less troublesome in Paris in late May and early June and the tournament is less frequently interrupted by rain. Still, the French Tennis Association’s latest plans to renovate Roland Garros by 2016 include a retractable roof for Philippe Chatrier Court.The National Tennis Center renovation plans do not stem from the desire to avoid weather delays. The plans the U.S.T.A. revealed in November included expanding Armstrong’s capacity to 14,000, from 10,180. The Grandstand Court, long a favorite of fans for its intimate atmosphere, could grow to 7,000, from 6,100.Ashe Stadium, which opened in 1997, is the largest of the major tennis stadiums not just in capacity (it seats 22,547) but in sheer size. That makes the roof question more difficult, in addition to being more expensive. The top of the stadium is so high and wide that architecturally, a retractable roof would make it even larger and more obtrusive.But putting a roof over a new Armstrong Stadium does not address how sessions scheduled for the much-larger Ashe could be moved into a smaller stadium. The premium ticket holders and suite occupants would suddenly have their tickets devalued if important rounds of the tournament were moved to a smaller stadium with no suites.'"
"'11-09-07,'1','The Dutch government said Tuesday that it was widening its investigation into an Internet security breach in an effort to learn whether the private data of Dutch citizens, many of whom file income tax returns online, had been compromised.The Dutch data protection agency has asked the government security contractor at the center of the controversy, DigiNotar, to report whether the integrity of special digital certificates that guarantee the authenticity of interactions with government computers had been breached.“We are hoping to receive an answer from DigiNotar within a few days,” said Harriet Garvelink, a spokeswoman for the agency in The Hague, who said the request was made Friday.The hacking scandal in the Netherlands, one of the most digitally advanced countries in Europe, erupted last week when DigiNotar disclosed that hackers had broken into its systems in July and issued fraudulent digital certificates, which are used to verify the authenticity of Web sites. An independent report released Monday traced the origin of the breach to Iran.“DigiNotar found evidence on July 28th that rogue certificates were verified by Internet addresses originating from Iran,” said the report prepared by Fox-IT, a company hired by the government to investigate the breaches.'"
"'11-09-07,'1','The meeting in 2008 has emerged as a turning point in the saga that has embroiled Britain’s news media, politicians and the police. Months of disclosures have damaged Prime Minister , who hired a former News of the World editor as his communications chief, only to see him resign and undergo questioning as one of 15 editors, reporters and private investigators arrested in the case. The scandal prompted the resignation of the commander who was Britain’s top police officer, after disclosures about his ties to the Murdoch hierarchy; and forced Rupert Murdoch to shut down The News of the World after 168 years of publication.For Rupert Murdoch, 81, who presides over one of the world’s most powerful news organizations, the scandal has posed a more personal threat. James Murdoch, 38, has been fighting for his corporate survival, in the face of deep unease among powerful News Corporation investors. Whether James Murdoch, long considered his father’s corporate heir, can survive may depend on what the parliamentary and police inquiries reveal in the months ahead about his stewardship of the British papers as the phone hacking scandal grew.The dimensions of the affair were captured in a closing exchange at the parliamentary hearing, when one of the lawmakers quoted from an e-mail he said had been sent anonymously to committee members by somebody who had once worked at a senior level in News International in which the writer spoke of the possibility that “a global empire could be blown apart” by the scandal. As matters stand, whether James Murdoch can withstand the mounting pressures appears to hinge, more than anything, on the differing accounts of the 2008 meeting, and what it reveals of his willingness to confront the scope of the illegal practices.The conflicting accounts of the meeting center on two issues: whether Mr. Murdoch was shown an e-mail in which a junior reporter quoted from transcripts of three hacked voice mail messages, indicating a broader pattern of illegal intercepts; and whether Mr. Murdoch’s approval of the record $1.4 million settlement with Gordon Taylor, chief of an organization representing Britain’s professional soccer players, was motivated by a desire to save millions in legal costs for News International, the Murdoch newspaper subsidiary, or was, as several members of Parliament suggested, an effort to buy Mr. Taylor’s silence and prevent the scandal from spreading.Mr. Crone and Mr. Myler testified that the meeting had centered on the e-mail, which they said they had cited in support of their argument that a settlement should be made with Mr. Taylor. Mr. Crone said he was “absolutely certain” he had shown the e-mail to Mr. Murdoch, and had pushed to settle the case because there were four other targets of News of the World phone-hacking who were “waiting in the wings” to begin civil damages lawsuits of their own that would draw heavily on evidence in the Taylor case if it were not ended by a financial settlement with a binding confidentiality clause.Mr. Myler testified that all three men at the meeting “perfectly understood the seriousness and significance of what we were discussing,” in terms of more civil suits if the Taylor case was not settled and the e-mail was introduced in evidence. James Murdoch said in his statement, however, that his testimony in July was “an accurate account of events” and that Mr. Crone and Mr. Myler “did not show me the e-mail.”“As I said in my testimony, there was nothing discussed in the meeting that led me to believe that a further investigation was necessary,” he said.But the testimony of Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone, as well as two other News International executives who testified on Tuesday, presented a version of the payouts that dovetailed with James Murdoch’s. In July, Mr. Murdoch testified that he had approved the payment to Mr. Taylor not to buy his silence but to limit News International’s legal costs if the case went to trial. On Tuesday, Mr. Crone said that defending the Taylor suit, and others that might have followed, could have cost more than $3 million each in legal fees.But Tom Watson, the committee’s most outspoken member, spoke of the settlement — more than 10 times the previous record for an award in an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit — as a “cover-up” and a move intended to buy Mr. Taylor’s silence. “You were desperate to see that nobody knew that phone hacking was standard practice at The News of the World,” Mr. Watson said.'"
"'11-09-07,'1','The central bank’s move underscores the particular challenges facing Switzerland amid global economic uncertainty. The bank’s chairman, Philipp M. Hildebrand, has been roundly criticized at home for the strength of the franc, though it is mainly a reflection of problems elsewhere.Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, described the Swiss National Bank as “probably the best-run central bank in the Western world.” But with a “grossly overvalued currency,” Switzerland risks falling into a deflationary trap as imports become relatively cheaper, he wrote in a note.Deflation, a generalized decline in prices, increases the burden on debtors and tends to paralyze an economy as consumers guard their money in anticipation of lower prices.With doubts about the United States economy and as investors fear that European assets could lose much of their value if the euro currency union were to fail, Switzerland has been the unenthusiastic recipient of billions of dollars in investment inflows.On Aug. 9, the euro traded as low as 1.00749 francs — near parity — and the dollar fell as low as 0.7071 franc.Another traditional haven — gold — reached a record of $1,923.70 an ounce in trading Tuesday of contracts for December delivery, before retreating below $1,900. But the price of oil has fallen because of the global slowdown, eliminating another place where investors might be tempted to put cash.The market mayhem has also bolstered the yen, now trading near a record against the dollar, as Japanese investors unwind risky investments overseas.Florian Esterer, a fund manager at Swisscanto Asset Management in Zurich, said Switzerland’s attraction resulted in part from its reputation for political stability and sound policy.“The stable economic performance is a result of the institutional setup,” Mr. Esterer said.One thing that is clear is what is good for investors is not necessarily good for Swiss business.“At parity the franc is overvalued by 35 percent or more,” Rudolf Minsch, chief economist of Economiesuisse, a federation of Swiss business organizations, said. “It no longer has anything to do with fundamentals at that level.”Mr. Minsch said the pain among his members was particularly severe in the tourism, textiles, machinery, metals and paper industries.Switzerland’s biggest trading partner is the European Union, but the overvalued franc is also affecting business in the United States and the developing world, he said.“In places like China, German companies have a cost advantage of as much as 30 percent,” he said.This is not the first time the Swiss central bank has resorted to such a strategy to contain the franc. It used a similar operation in the late 1970s to weaken the currency against the Deutsche mark. The central bank’s new target commits it to buying euros and selling francs any time the euro falls below 1.20 francs. That amounts to setting a floor for the euro or a ceiling for the franc.The authorities had considered adopting a currency peg, in which the franc would be defended at a specific rate. In reality, considering the downward pressure on the euro, the 1.20 franc level will probably prove a de facto peg for now.Currency market intervention, when it is not coordinated among the major central banks, has not had a lasting effect in recent years, as the Bank of Japan learned recently. Last year, the Swiss bank’s unsuccessful efforts to check the franc’s rise with market intervention led it to a foreign exchange loss of 32.8 billion francs, or $41.6 billion at current exchange rates, and an overall loss for the year of 20.8 billion francs, or $26.4 billion.Steven Saywell, head of global currency strategy in London for BNP Paribas, said he thought it “very unlikely” that the Swiss National Bank’s counterparts at the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank would be eager to follow suit in strengthening their currencies against the franc, even though a meeting Friday and Saturday of Group of 7 finance and central bank officials in Marseille, France, would give them a chance to coordinate policy.“The G-7 has far greater issues to deal with,” Mr. Saywell said, “like preventing the U.S. economy from sliding into recession and supporting the ongoing political discussions about addressing Europe’s debt problems.”In fact, the European Central Bank appeared to distance itself from the Swiss move, saying in a two-sentence statement that the Swiss central bank had decided to hold down the value of the franc “under its own responsibility.”Mr. Saywell said investors were certain to test Switzerland’s resolve, as the authorities there were trying to buck a strong tide.“In an environment of strong growth and economic stability, the franc might weaken,” he said. “But in this climate, we expect the market to challenge the S.N.B. over the next few days.”Last month, as part of a continuing effort to weaken the franc, the Swiss National Bank cut its main interest rate target to zero from 0.25 percent and said it would significantly increase the supply of liquidity to the Swiss franc money market. It moved twice during the month to increase banks’ sight deposits through which banks can withdraw money, to 200 billion francs from 80 billion francs. It also said it would conduct foreign exchange swap transactions to create liquidity in Swiss francs.Even at a rate of 1.20 francs per euro, the central bank said Tuesday, “the Swiss franc is still high and should continue to weaken over time.” It said that “If the economic outlook and deflationary risks so require, the S.N.B. will take further measures.”'"
"'11-09-07,'1','The equity losses were reminiscent of those on Friday, when the Labor Department reported zero job growth in the United States economy in August. In addition, the market reacted to reports of impending legal action by federal regulators against 17 financial institutions that sold and nearly $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that later soured. Investors fled financial shares, and on Tuesday the sector continued to be hit hard, closing 1.7 percent lower.and each declined more than 3 percent. Bank of America fell to $6.99 and Chase to $33.44. fell 2.5 percent to $27.70. was down nearly 4 percent at $15.33Bank stocks, which are particularly sensitive to prospects for lending and housing, are seen as being at additional risk because of regulatory and legal issues after the lawsuits were filed on Friday. “There really has not been particularly good news in the financial space for a while,” Mr. Arnold said. “It is just waning optimism for financials.”But most of the focus in the markets has been on the lack of progress in solving persistent euro zone debt problems, which “is creating a pocket of selling with no buyers,” said Alan B. Lancz, the president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates. In addition, investors are concerned about the impact on global growth of weak economic data.The market turmoil of recent weeks showed no signs of letting up. On Tuesday, gold rose to another nominal high, and Swiss authorities took action to weaken the franc, which has soared because of its role as a haven.In the United States, economic data was scrutinized for any sign of strength in the country’s recovery. The said Tuesday that the services sector of the economy expanded in August, the 21st consecutive month it has done so, as reflected in the 53.3 reading of the I.S.M. nonmanufacturing index, although expansion in some sectors, like business activity, was slowing down.The survey exceeded forecasts assembled by Bloomberg News that pointed to a reading of 51. A reading of 50 is meant to be the dividing line between an expanding economy and a contracting one.Debt concerns related to the euro zone, particularly over and ; the bank lawsuits in the United States; and worries about economic growth were the biggest factors damping prices, Michael A. Mullaney, vice president of the Fiduciary Trust Company, and other analysts said.“Friday set the tone with the employment report,” Mr. Mullaney said. “We are basically hard struck to find out where the growth engines are going to come from.”The conditions were worryingly similar to those of the sell-off that followed the collapse of in 2008, ’s chief executive, , said Monday.In , the Swiss National Bank said it was setting a minimum value of 1.20 francs per euro and was prepared to spend an “unlimited” amount to defend it. The central bank was acting to help the country’s exporters, who fear being priced out of foreign markets by the strong franc.Asian and European markets were lower. Gold futures eased slightly to $1,869.90 an ounce after rising more than 1 percent to more than $1,900 an ounce in Comex trading.'"

"'11-09-08,'0','For as much as it occupies the news, Afghanistan is still a far-off and mysterious place to most Americans. Relatively few civilians have seen firsthand what came out of our commitments in the region — harried diplomats, journalists and aid workers risking life and limb. As a senior editor at this newspaper, in Washington and then in New York since shortly after the United States invasion of Iraq, I have helped lead coverage of our military and counterterrorism operations over the last decade. But that was from afar. This summer, accompanied by colleagues in the field and sometimes unwanted official escorts, I visited Afghanistan and Pakistan. The journey made visceral the fact that the United States has not achieved the ending envisioned a decade ago.Senior American civilian and military officials interviewed in the region, as well as representatives of NATO allies, often described their outlook with the same two words: “cautiously optimistic.” They cited real progress to justify the optimism: the killing of Bin Laden; the ousting of the Taliban from power in Afghanistan and the establishment of a civilian government; the degrading of Al Qaeda, including the recent, successful drone attacks on its leaders; the building of schools and the inclusion of female students; and the military successes of the surge. All praised the dogged patriotism of American troops in accomplishing this progress.The officials have equal cause for caution. The Taliban have regained a foothold and, in some places more than that. Deadly attacks by insurgents continue to make life in Afghanistan and Pakistan deeply unstable. Endemic corruption inside the governments of both countries make them inconstant allies, and both the drone program and the attack in Abbottabad have greatly heightened tensions with Pakistan and increased uncertainty over its nuclear weapons. Attacks on schools and women are still part of life here. Domestic support for the war has waned, while there is exhaustion among troops who have been deployed many times. In this region, no one predicted there would be anything close to a “mission accomplished” moment.As he prepared to leave Afghanistan after nearly a decade there as a NATO official and United States ambassador, Lt. Gen. Karl W. Eikenberry said that his biggest regret was not being around to see how “the big things are going to turn out.” Despite the killing of Bin Laden in May, 9/11 has no denouement — for the United States and its troops or for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Here are scenes from an unfinished history.The welcome sign at the base in Paktika, a province in violent eastern Afghanistan, still telegraphs American military bravado: “Ass Kicking Able Guts and Glory.”But on a Black Hawk helicopter tour of Paktika and Ghazni and Bagram Air Base, Lt. Gen. David M. Rodriguez, the No. 2 commanding general in Afghanistan, seemed more reflective than swaggering. Like his boss, David H. Petraeus, General Rodriguez, too, was making his exit. The five-hour tour gave him time for final military intelligence briefings, emotional goodbyes from his soldiers and a last chance to view Afghanistan’s ancient contours from the sky.To be heard above the roar inside the Black Hawk, the general talked into a microphone as we listened on headphones. “We have to figure out how to build durability,” he said, a task he viewed as doable.In Paktika, the general inspected a checkpoint being built to disrupt a major Taliban supply route. Construction, supervised by the United States military, was moving rapidly. But one Army officer worried that when the checkpoint was finished and turned over to the Afghan soldiers, “I don’t think they are going to stay here and man it 24 hours a day. They miss their families, their children, their religion.”By 2014, President Obama says, Afghans should be ready to protect their own country. That leaves little time for building durability.Muhammad Mohaqeq is a powerful man in Kabul, a member of Parliament and former warlord representing a number of the 2.5-million-strong Hazara minority in Afghanistan. A bearded, fierce warrior who began fighting the Soviets in 1979, he became a leading fighter against the Taliban in northern Afghanistan.He lives in a spacious, well-fortified house, guarded by a substantial security force. If anyone should feel safe in Kabul these days, one might assume it would be this warlord. But a visit to Mr. Mohaqeq involved a veritable labyrinth of security measures. Journalists were patted down and their equipment was searched. A bottle of allergy pills in a colleague’s purse was sniffed to make sure the pills did not contain explosives.Mr. Mohaqeq is nervous about many things, especially talk of a United States withdrawal and the weakness of President Hamid Karzai, both of which he believes could let the Taliban return to power. In 2010, Mr. Mohaqeq broke with Mr. Karzai over his policy of appeasement toward the Taliban.“The Taliban are coming back,” Mr. Mohaqeq warned, voicing a pessimism shared by other Afghan leaders. “They have deeply infiltrated the Afghan forces, the police and the army. Security is getting worse as the Taliban are getting stronger. If the international community goes away and the Taliban returns, our country will face another civil war and crisis. In the last 10 years, the international community has spent billions, but we did not see the progress we hoped for.”The sound of their voices was unforgettable — the soft, high voices of girls — and yet some were surrounded by children of their own, and the stories of their journeys to this secret place were chilling.We were at a women’s shelter in Kabul, about 30 women and two Western journalists. As they told of being forced to marry men much older, of being beaten and raped, then finally, of their escape, some wiped back tears. They were asked their ages, and the most common replies were “15” or “16.”A major success of the last decade has been the gains in girls’ education and more people around the world embracing the cause of Afghan women generally. Around 5,000 Afghan girls were enrolled in school in 2001. Now there are 2.4 million. Women for Afghan Women, which operates the Kabul shelter and others in Afghanistan, is one of many nonprofits that have attracted considerable financial support from the West. Billions of dollars have been donated to rebuild the education system. But even in recent years, schoolgirls have been targeted by antigovernment forces and extremists, prompting teachers to quit and parents to keep their children out of the classroom.There is worry that the West is losing interest in the plight of Afghan women, as the focus shifts to troop drawdowns. “I am very concerned that our centers will be closed if the U.S. leaves,” said Manizha Naderi, the executive director of Women for Afghan Women.The Kabul shelter where we met once housed Bibi Aisha, the young woman whose nose had been cut off and who appeared on the cover of Time magazine last year under the headline “What Happens if We Leave Afghanistan.” On this visit, a young woman lifted her scarf to show a bald spot where she said her mother-in-law had repeatedly beaten her with a wooden mallet. Another told of running away from a much older brother-in-law who insisted she marry him when she turned 14. “He bothered me for more than four months,” she said in a quivering voice. Every woman who runs away in Afghanistan risks arrest for adultery and harsh penalties, even death.Ms. Naderi, herself six months pregnant, hoped to open two more shelters this year. A 10th-anniversary celebration of her organization in New York might also attract fresh financing. But generating fresh passion for her cause has become harder. Meanwhile, the women in her shelter continue to dream the dreams that are common to girls around the world. When asked what they hoped to become after they left the shelter, “teacher” and “doctor” were among the more popular answers.Our hotel in Karachi, Pakistan, stood across from the Village Restaurant, where Daniel Pearl, my friend and Wall Street Journal colleague, was kidnapped in 2002. Mr. Pearl’s murder was one of the first terrorism-related deaths of a journalist. The looming exterior of the Village, the fact that our hotel had five security checks before the main entrance, and the constant lobby presence of snoops from the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence made our time in Karachi seem nefarious.For in the wake of the raid on the Bin Laden compound in Abbottabad, relations between the United States and Pakistan have reached a nadir, with American officials openly questioning whether the Pakistanis have ever been, or can ever be trusted to be, real allies against terrorism. The 2011 Pew Global Attitudes Project found that 12 percent of Pakistanis surveyed had a favorable view of Americans, a low for the decade. Just about everywhere we went in Karachi, and sometimes in the rest of Pakistan, I.S.I. spies followed us. One Pakistani assured us that this was for our protection, but given that intelligence service’s recent focus on journalists, it didn’t feel that way.At a dinner in Islamabad hosted by Pakistan’s ministry of information, several Pakistani journalists accused their visitors from The Times of being mouthpieces and even spies for the United States government.Distrust was not always so prevalent. Jamal Yusuf, one of two Pakistani investigators in the Pearl case I met with in Karachi, remembers “there was a lot of sympathy and awareness” at the time of the murder, so soon after 9/11.But since then, Mr. Yusuf, and his associate, Dost Ali Khan, said they have suffered setbacks for their efforts to exact justice in the case. Because he had worked closely with the F.B.I. on the Pearl case, Mr. Yusuf came under suspicion within the Pakistani police and intelligence service, and in 2003 he was abruptly dismissed from his post in charge of the Citizen-Police Liaison Committee. Mr. Dost, too, saw his career ruined.Both men mused about how many strands of the case remain unresolved. Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a British national of Pakistani origin, plotted the kidnapping and was sentenced to death in 2002. But both Mr. Yusuf and Mr. Dost believe he will walk out a free man, in still another piece of unfinished 9/11 business.“Omar is the most safe person in the world,” Mr. Yusuf said.Practicing journalism has become very dangerous in Pakistan, for foreigners but more so for independent-minded Pakistani reporters. Umar Cheema, an investigative reporter for The News in Islamabad, has questioned the conduct and performance of the army and the intelligence services and detailed accusations of corruption against President Asif Ali Zardari. He had been a Daniel Pearl fellow at The New York Times for several months, and I was excited to see him in his own country.Arranging this was not easy. Last year, men in black commando garb stopped Mr. Cheema’s car, blindfolded him and drove him out of town, where he was beaten and videotaped in humiliating positions. Six hours later, he was dumped on a road 100 miles from Islamabad.Mr. Cheema believes the I.S.I. was behind his abduction, in part because the intelligence service had warned him about his coverage shortly before it happened. We were able to meet at a colleague’s guest house in Islamabad, but Mr. Cheema needed to leave long before dark, as he did not want to risk another ominous roadside episode. He told me he knows he’s taken chances by speaking in public about his ordeal, but continues to report.Just how outraged some Pakistanis are by the killing of Bin Laden in their territory came through in snatches of conversation. Some people used the same tone when they referred to “the 2 of May” as Americans did when they said “9/11.”Driving the three hours to Abbottabad from Islamabad can be risky now, as outside visitors are no longer allowed near the compound where Bin Laden lived and died. Journalists had been detained on their way there in recent days. But we wanted to see the compound with our own eyes, believing it to be an important symbol of the past 10 years of struggle.From the roadside a few hundred feet away, the compound looked rather unremarkable. It is simply a concrete building with a wall sitting in the middle of a dusty cabbage field. It was not that much larger than other houses in the area and certainly did not look like the multimillion-dollar “mansion” that some American journalists breathlessly described. It did not look like a powerful symbol of 9/11 finality.Our driver made an upsetting, but possibly true, observation. “The dangerous trend in Pakistan,” he said, “is that there is far more hate for America now than there was ever love of Osama.”'"

"'11-09-08,'0','Stoudemire, who wanted to be a teacher before he started playing organized basketball at 14, spoke of making learning fun and teachers that rewarded students for achievement.The reward theme was pervasive, as Stoudemire told the students that the boy and girl with the best grades heading into winter break would win Niketown shopping sprees. Each student at the Community Center received a black backpack with the words “knowledge is power” inscribed below Stoudemire’s signature.The event ties with one of Stoudemire’s new business interests; he is working with Scholastic on a children’s book series.After taking a group picture with the kids, Stoudemire spoke with reporters for 10 minutes.He said he had been in consistent contact with his teammate Roger Mason, vice president of the players association, and remained optimistic that the lockout would end sooner than later.“That’s a positive for us,” he said. “Other than that, I’m not sure what the deal is.""He confirmed reports that if the lockout was prolonged the Knicks would train together at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla., in lieu of a regular camp with coaches and team staff. He also said that if training camp was to start on time in early October, he would be ready to practice.This summer Stoudemire has felt some of the soreness in his back that plagued him in a first-round loss to the Celtics. He said he was “never nervous, never concerned,” about the injury, but he did need to learn how to properly rehab it.He praised the hiring of Mike Woodson as a defensive assistant. “With the help of Mike, it’s going to be a positive for us,” he said. “But it’s up to us as players to take that commitment and implement it ourselves defensively.”No time like the present; schools, now in session all around the country, have chalkboards.'"
"'11-09-08,'0','The state, which released its draft document in July, is proposing to ban hydrofracking in watersheds and aquifers supplying drinking water to most New Yorkers and in other sensitive areas. But it would allow tens of thousands of wells in more than a dozen counties that sit on the rich natural gas field known as the Marcellus Shale.By releasing the complete draft environmental document on Wednesday, the conservation department started the clock on the public comment period on fracking, which will run until Dec. 12. The agency will schedule four public hearings in November, including one in New York City.But the department seemed to be fast-tracking hydrofracking by saying on Wednesday that it would also issue proposed rules based on its draft environmental study by October, so that those rules can undergo public comment as well.Some environmental groups said those rules would normally undergo a separate review, after the agency’s final environmental impact statement was issued.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has said he supports drilling in the Marcellus Shale if it is “environmentally sensitive and safe.”“The proposed environmental mitigation measures and the regulations that codify those measures go hand in hand,” Joseph Martens, the environmental conservation commissioner, said in a written statement. “It makes sense to move forward with them together and hold simultaneous public comment periods and hearings.”But New Yorkers are deeply divided over whether the state should allow hydrofracking, and the new report on impacts is likely to intensify the debate.Those who fear a profound change in the state’s landscapes and the character of rural areas say the tradeoffs are not worth the benefits.“Our economy depends on tourism, agriculture and education,” said Ken Zeserson, the Planning Board chairman for the town of Ulysses, in Tompkins County. “We can’t do what we do if we have poisoned water and an industrialized network of pipelines.”The state’s draft environmental document proposes measures to mitigate the risk of water contamination and other adverse impacts. One is to limit simultaneous construction of well pads and wells near one another to reduce noise and traffic, department officials said.The Ecology and Environment portion of the report said the size of future natural gas production in New York was largely unknown and would depend in part on market fluctuations. But it identified the region bordering Pennsylvania, which is already exploiting the Marcellus, and Broome, Chemung and Tioga Counties as the epicenter of the expected hydrofracking activity over the next 30 years.The number of wells developed per year could range from 413 to 2,462, the report said, and could generate from 4,408 to 26,316 full-time construction jobs. The report predicts another 1,790 to 10,673 new jobs in production, along with added employment in retail and other economic areas.Thomas Santulli, the Chemung County executive, said communities could prepare for drilling-related activity so that it did not “overwhelm” them. “Everything has positives and negatives and you try to make the best out of it,” Mr. Santulli said.He said he supported hydrofracking largely because “upstate New York has been starving for jobs for years.”'"
"'11-09-08,'0','“Vietnam Embraces an Old Enemy” (news article, Aug. 29) reports that the relationship between the United States and Vietnam has evolved positively and will likely continue to do so as economic and military ties deepen.But the article glosses over significant human rights concerns, specifically in the area of religious freedom. As the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom reports, the Vietnamese government “continues to sanction violence against religious communities.”This state-sanctioned violence has included beatings with batons, forcible detentions and the sexual assault of priests.Nonapproved religious groups like the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, the Hoa Hao Buddhists and Montagnard Christians are monitored by a special “religious police” unit and are considered “extremists.” Supreme Patriarch Thich Quang Do and Friar Phan Van Loi of the Unified Buddhists have been held under house arrest.

"'11-09-08,'0','A double dip would present obvious political problems for , whose approval ratings have already fallen below 50 percent and who is scheduled to give a speech to Congress on Thursday outlining a new jobs plan. A weak economy also could threaten incumbents of both parties in Congress, whose approval rating has hovered around 15 percent in recent polls.More immediately, the main significance of the recent slowdown is that the economy may not merely be going through a weak phase that will soon pass, as many policy makers hope. Instead, history seems to suggest that the situation will probably get worse before it gets better.In a recent research paper, Jeremy J. Nalewaik, a Federal Reserve economist, described this concept as “stall speed”: once the economy slows markedly, it often continues to do so. (He did not make a forecast.) In the other two severe downturns of the last 80 years — in the 1930s and the early 1980s — the economy suffered just such a stall and fell into a second recession not long after the first.Today, ’s troubles continue to weigh on and financial markets. Consumers remain indebted, and the housing market remains depressed. State and local governments continue to cut jobs, aggravating the problems in the private sector. Congress is unlikely to pass a major jobs bill.The economy could, of course, defy history and turn around soon. Eventually, consumers will begin spending more on houses, cars, appliances and services, and employers will begin hiring in large numbers. A further decline in gas prices, which have generally been falling, would particularly help households.But the latest indicators suggest that even if the economy does not continue to worsen, it appears to be too weak to add enough jobs each month — roughly 125,000 — even to keep pace with population growth. Anything less, and the share of the population that is employed will continue to fall.Over the last four months, job creation has slowed to an average of just 40,000 jobs, or 0.1 percent, according to the Labor Department’s survey of employers. The last time such a meager increase did not coincide with a recession came in the 1950s.The department’s survey of households presents a somewhat sunnier picture, but it is a smaller and noisier survey. And even it shows an unemployment rate of 9.1 percent last month, up from 8.8 percent in March. In the past, an increase of three-tenths of a percentage point has typically coincided with a recession.D. Hamilton, an economist at the , who has studied forecasting, said he believed the most likely case was still that the economy would avoid a double-dip recession. He also noted that the recent job growth numbers were estimates still subject to revision, although the unemployment rate is not.“It’s extremely hard to predict recessions,” Mr. Hamilton said. The more important point, he added, was that the economy remained very weak, and weaker than people had expected.Perhaps the best sign of how difficult it is to know the economy’s direction is that, as a group, the nation’s professional forecasters have failed to predict all the recessions since the 1970s, according to data kept by the Fed. In the last 30 years, the average probability they put on the economy lapsing into recession has never risen above 50 percent — until the economy was already in a recession.The forecasters, on Wall Street and elsewhere, are not blind to economic change; they just tend to underestimate its severity. When the economy is on the verge of recession, the average recession odds from forecasters tend to rise to about 30 percent. There has been only one occasion, in 1988, when the chances rose above 30 percent and a recession did not follow.And what do many forecasters say are the prospects of a double-dip recession now? Somewhere between 25 and 40 percent.'"

"'11-09-08,'0','“Real-world experience trumps all calculations,” said Roger Hannah, a spokesman for the commission. “It provides an opportunity to have real empirical data you can put into the equation, rather than something that’s a computer model.”The agency has assigned a special team to study the quake’s effects on North Anna, and in the next two years it must determine whether a score of nuclear plants in the eastern are earthquake-safe.Emerging from a drab concrete feed-water structure at the plant on Tuesday afternoon, Jennifer Pollard, a Dominion engineer, expressed some optimism. Tracing her work with a yellow highlighter on a map, she had inspected every inch of every pipe, connection, valve and motor in the building, which would provide cooling water if the reactor shut down.“I have not found anything significant so far,” Ms. Pollard said, “and as far as I know, no one else has either.”Engineers did find a shallow crack in the concrete wall in one of the feed-water buildings, but a careful examination revealed that it was full of dust, indicating that it predated the earthquake, they said. They call the process “interrogating” the cracks: engineers carry little loops of wire in thicknesses from one thirty-second of an inch to one-third of an inch to measure the cracks’ width and depth.Dominion is following an inspection procedure laid out by the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit utility consortium that has inspected dozens of industrial plants hit by earthquakes around the world.Nuclear plants are designed to specifications based on potential ground motion, not a quake’s magnitude, because the concern is how strong the quake would be at the reactor, not at the quake’s center. (The Aug. 23 quake, which was felt as far north as in , had a magnitude of 5.8.)The North Anna plant uses boxes holding diamond-tipped styluses that are suspended above steel plates; when an earthquake hits, the styluses scratch the plates. A laboratory analysis of the plates indicated that the horizontal ground acceleration was greater than had been anticipated in the plant’s design, the company told the commission last week, although the analysis is not complete and Dominion released no numbers to the public.In sniffing out quake damage, the company relies on a surprisingly simple technique. If components have bent or moved too far, the first sign of damage will be the paint. For example, sand-colored cement shows through gaps in the paint on one of four small blocks supporting the legs of a 20-foot-tall water tank in the plant’s turbine hall on the top floor.“Obviously, this moved,” said Stewart Morris, an engineering supervisor. He played his flashlight over some spots. “This tank wobbled a little bit,” he said, making a hand motion like a restrained wave from a pope.Plant engineers said the damage was in a predictable spot because ground motion from the quake would be magnified on the upper floors, and the tank is relatively top-heavy.It is North Anna’s second serious brush with quake issues. The first was in 1973, when the company was digging a hole for the foundation of a third reactor that was later abandoned. A visiting geology professor told an executive of the plant operator, then called the Virginia Electric & Power Company, that there was a geologic fault.The executive let the comment drop, and Electric told the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that there was no evidence of faults. Eventually it paid a fine of $32,000 for failing to alert regulators promptly; the five-member commission also reprimanded its own staff for moving slowly to bring the information to the attention of the administrative law judges hearing the company’s application for an operating license. The commission ultimately decided that the reactor would be safe.The Aug. 23 quake surprised employees. Jorge Bermudez, a control room supervisor, watched the fluorescent lights briefly go out and saw dust fall from the ceiling.That the walls, pipes and tanks survived with little or no sign of damage should not be surprising, however, experts say.John H. Bickel, a nuclear engineer and consultant, said that an analysis of plants hit by earthquakes had shown that the most vulnerable components were ceramic insulators on high-voltage lines that supply the plants with power and electrical relays, which resemble industrial-strength circuit-breakers and switches.Even if the relays are not damaged, they might be shaken so that they change positions, cutting off the flow of electricity or allowing it to flow without any command from an operator.But the risk of a big pipe or vessel cracking open is far lower, Mr. Bickel said, because structural engineers routinely follow industry codes that specify very strong and broad parts.Another expert, Neil Wilmshurst of the Electric Power Research Institute, the nonprofit utility consortium, agreed. “There’s an awful lot of fat in the design codes,” he said. In many cases, they are double, triple or quadruple as strong as they need to be, he said.But small changes are likely, and Dominion has already made one: it has wired the plant’s electronic earthquake sensors to a battery. On Aug. 23, they all failed when North Anna lost power.'"
"'11-09-08,'0','“A chief executive who was thinking first about the long-term interests of her company would not have done this,” Ms. Chatman said, adding that there are problems of perception in this case as well: “She’s one of a handful of top female business leaders. It would be easy to attach this to a stereotype of women leaders as not in control of their emotions.”Whatever the effect on Yahoo, unvarnished comments like Ms. Bartz’s are likely to become more common. Chief executives are increasingly conscious of their personal brand and how it can diverge from the corporate brand.“I would say this is going to become much more of a trend,” said Homa Bahrami, a senior lecturer at Berkeley and an adviser to several Silicon Valley start-ups. “I see it already in private companies when there is a change in management. The chief executive picks up the phone and tells the investors exactly what happened. The younger generation appreciates this honesty. You’re authentic and you’re vulnerable.”Authenticity, though, can backfire, and vulnerability is not always something to be desired. Executives who are not on their way out are learning that broadcasting their feelings can have unintended consequences.Andrew Mason, chief executive of Groupon, may have thought he was only trying to buck up the troops when he sent a long e-mail describing how the daily deals site was being misperceived in the press as it awaited its public offering. Mr. Mason may have even been secretly pleased when the e-mail showed up in the press. Regulators cast a dim eye on such promotion during the so-called quiet period for companies waiting to go public, however, and Groupon’s offering is now at risk of being delayed or even pulled.In the technology industry as in no other, failure is trumpeted as paving the way to glory. Executives here love to boast about the number of times their company was denied funding or how no one wanted to hire them or how they learned so much when the whole ship went down. But such tales are always told from the vantage point of ultimate success. In the midst of failure, people are as reluctant to admit it in Silicon Valley as anywhere.In 2005, when Carly Fiorina was pushed out of Hewlett-Packard, she merely spoke about her regret that she and the board had differing strategies, and said she respected its decision. In 2010, when Mark V. Hurd was pushed out of H.P. he said he would “move aside.”If Ms. Bartz’s directness was so unusual, it was also in character. She has long been inclined to honesty, often in salty language. In one of her more printable comments, she listened to a shareholder suggesting she resign at Yahoo’s annual meeting in June. “That was certainly a downer,” she replied.“Usually it’s in the interests of both the executive and the board to sugarcoat these things, but Carol just lays it out there,” said J. Hallam Dawson, chairman of IDI Associates and a former colleague of Ms. Bartz’s.Ms. Bartz was on vacation on the East Coast, flying from Maine to New York, when she got the call from Yahoo’s chairman, Roy Bostock, relieving her of her duties. It was not a surprise. After being in charge for nearly three years, the company seemed more unable than ever to meet the challenge of Facebook and Google.“I am very sad to tell you that I’ve just been fired over the phone by Yahoo’s chairman of the board,” she wrote. She went on to say she had enjoyed her tenure at the company and wished the employees the best.Management experts said the dismissal of chief executives is usually a more stately process, involving lawyers on all sides. It requires negotiation and press releases. And so the crudeness of Ms. Bartz’s firing might have helped spark her response. She did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.At about the same time on Tuesday as Ms. Bartz was getting the news, Bank of America was making some top management changes. In this case the traditional approach was followed, which meant the tone was upbeat. First the bank explained that it was simply “de-layering.”Then the chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, saluted the departed, including Sallie Krawcheck, president of the bank’s global wealth and investment management division. Ms. Krawcheck responded that it had been “an honor” to work at the troubled bank. If this was an ouster, it came across as more of a retirement.'"
"'11-09-08,'0','The Chinese leaders I met with know their country must shift from an economy driven by exports, investment and heavy industry to one driven more by consumption and services. This includes continued steps to revalue their currency and to provide fair access to their markets. As Americans save more and Chinese buy more, this transition will accelerate, opening opportunities for us.Even as the United States and China cooperate, we also compete. I strongly believe that the United States can and will flourish from this competition.First, we need to keep China’s rising economic power in perspective. According to the International Monetary Fund, America’s gross domestic product, almost $15 trillion, is still more than twice as large as China’s; our per-capita G.D.P., above $47,000, is 11 times China’s.And while there is a lot of talk about China’s “owning” America’s debt, the truth is that Americans own America’s debt. China holds just 8 percent of outstanding Treasury securities. By comparison, Americans hold nearly 70 percent. Our unshakable commitment to honoring our financial obligations is for the sake of Americans, as well as for those overseas. It is why the United States has never defaulted on its obligations and never will.Maybe more important, the nature of 21st-century competition favors the United States. In the 20th century, we measured a nation’s wealth primarily by its natural resources, its land mass, its population and its army. In the 21st century, the true wealth of a nation is found in the creative minds of its people and their ability to innovate.As I told students in Chengdu, the United States is hard-wired for innovation. Competition is in the very fabric of our society. It has enabled each generation of Americans to give life to world-changing ideas — from the cotton gin to the airplane, the microchip, the Internet.We owe our strength to our political and economic system and to the way we educate our children — not merely to accept established orthodoxy but to challenge and improve it. We not only tolerate but celebrate free expression and vigorous debate. The rule of law protects private property, lends predictability to investments, and ensures accountability for poor and wealthy alike. Our universities remain the ultimate destination for the world’s students and scholars. And we welcome immigrants with skill, ambition and the desire to better their lives.America’s strengths are, for now, China’s weaknesses. In China, I argued that for it to make the transition to an innovation economy, it will have to open its system, not least to human rights. Fundamental rights are universal, and China’s people aspire to them. Liberty unlocks a people’s full potential, while its absence breeds unrest. Open and free societies are best at promoting long-term growth, stability, prosperity and innovation.We have our own work to do. We need to ensure that any American willing to work can find a good job. We need to keep attracting the world’s top talent. We must continue to invest in the fundamental sources of our strength: education, infrastructure and innovation. But our future is in our own hands. If we take bold steps, there is no reason America won’t emerge stronger than ever.As vice president, I’ve traveled half a million miles around the world. I always come home feeling the same confidence in our future. Some may warn of America’s demise, but I’m not among them. And let me reassure you: based on my time in China, neither are the Chinese.'"
"'11-09-08,'0','The newspaper The Guardian said Wednesday that one of its reporters, Amelia Hill, was questioned in recent days by police officers investigating leaks from the phone hacking inquiry that has enveloped Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper group in Britain. That followed the arrest last month of a Scotland Yard detective assigned to the phone hacking investigation, a step that British news reports linked to Guardian reports on the scandal. In a statement confirming that Ms. Hill had been questioned in connection with “alleged leaks,” The Guardian raised concerns about the implications for reporters’ relations with their sources. “Journalists would no doubt be concerned if the police sought to criminalize conversations between off-record sources and reporters,” the newspaper said.Also on Wednesday, a former reporter at The London Evening Standard, was arrested in the phone hacking case.

"'11-09-08,'0','But Mr. Sessions faces an uphill battle because Senate leaders want their colleagues to pass the House version of the bill, which contains that provision, without any amendments, saying any changes could jeopardize the entire legislation.David E. Redlick, co-chairman of the life sciences practice at WilmerHale, said other companies, including Bayer and AstraZeneca, might also now benefit from patent extensions.“The repeated assertion that this is a single company bill is just not so,” Mr. Redlick said. He said the existing law had unclear wording. The new provision “will resolve that uncertainty on a permanent basis, which one would hope would be a key purpose of patent reform.”He also said that a federal judge ruled last year that the Medicines Company had filed its application on time. So the patent extension is expected to be granted, and WilmerHale would never have to make the malpractice payment, even without the legislation, he said. The legislation provides insurance in case the court ruling is reversed, he said.Applications for patent extensions must be made within 60 days of a drug’s approval by the Food and Drug Administration.The United States Patent and Trademark Office ruled that the Medicines Company, which filed its application in 2001, had missed the deadline by a day or two.As a result, Angiomax could have been vulnerable to generic competition as early as September 2010, instead of June 2015. Sales of Angiomax accounted for virtually all of the Medicines Company’s $437.6 million in revenue last year.The company, based in Parsippany, N.J., sued the Patent Office, arguing that since it had received F.D.A. approval for Angiomax after the customary close of business on a Friday, the 60-day clock should not have started ticking until the next Monday.In August 2010, a federal judge agreed and the government did not appeal. The Patent Office, which granted interim patent extensions during the lawsuit, is working on the final extension.But APP Pharmaceuticals, a drug company that wants to sell a generic version of Angiomax, is trying to have the judge’s decision overturned.The amendment would change the patent law to agree with the judge’s interpretation of the deadline calculations.The Medicines Company has been pressing for years for a legislative solution, spending more than $17 million since 2005 on prominent lobbyists, including former House majority leaders Richard Gephardt, a Democrat, and Dick Armey, a Republican.The company has been assisted in its effort by WilmerHale, known formally as Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr.The firm has a huge Washington office, and a few dozen of its members went to work for the Obama administration. The firm is also a powerhouse in Boston, and some of the most active supporters of the provision in Congress are from Massachusetts, like Representative Ed Markey, a Democrat.In February, WilmerHale agreed to pay $18 million to the Medicines Company to compensate it for its legal and lobbying costs. It also agreed to pay as much as $214 million more if a generic version of Angiomax reached the market before June 15, 2015, because the extension application was deemed late. Part of the payment would be covered by the firm’s insurer.WilmerHale reported revenue of $962 million in 2010, with profit of $1.33 million per partner.The Medicines Company, according to its regulatory filings, is also talking about compensation from Ropes & Gray, another law firm that was involved in the filing for the patent extension.APP Pharmaceuticals, the Generic Pharmaceutical Association and Citizens Against Government Waste are trying to derail the provision.The Medicines Company has argued that longer patent protection will allow it to test Angiomax, also known as bivalirudin, for more uses. It also argues that the drug saves money for the health care system over all compared with alternatives.In late June, the House of Representatives narrowly approved adding the provision to the patent reform bill. Initially, the vote was 209 to 208 against the amendment, but some Democrats pushed for a revote, saying not all members had had time to vote. On the revote, the amendment passed 223 to 198. Democrats voted 155 to 31 in favor and Republicans 167 to 68 against.John Conyers Jr., a Democrat from Michigan who sponsored the amendment, called it a “technical revision.” He added, “By eliminating confusion regarding the deadline for patent term extension applications, this amendment provides the certainty necessary to encourage costly investments in life-saving medical research.”Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, opposed the amendment.“As a practical matter, this is a special fix for one company,” he said. He said that it should have been handled under rules for private relief bills and that it would also interfere with the litigation.'"
"'11-09-08,'0','Goldman Sachs often helps chief executives increase the stock prices of their companies by carving them up. The bank, run by Lloyd Blankfein, is currently advising Kraft Foods on how it should split its operations and is counseling McGraw-Hill on whether it should do the same.So it’s logical that some inside Goldman have run the numbers on their employer. The results are compelling. Should the firm’s stock linger below its book value — its assets minus liabilities — of about $130 a share for much longer, a breakup could be hard for the firm’s board to resist.There’s no suggestion Goldman is considering such a significant move. Most of its peers are also trading at lower than book value, implying a sectorwide issue rather than something Goldman can easily tackle individually. And the firm has a long-held view that the individual pieces — an industry-leading investment bank, an extensive securities trading operation and an asset management arm — function best together.Yet based on current market measures, Goldman’s parts are potentially worth a lot more than the whole. Many of the justifications it has given in the past for maintaining its structure look out of step with the changing global regulatory framework.The starkest illustration of this mismatch comes in asset management. The Volcker Rule provision of the Dodd-Frank Act stipulates a bank’s own money cannot be used for more than 3 percent of a private equity fund it manages. At present, Goldman’s own capital accounts for a third of the $20 billion fund overseen by GS Capital Partners. Once the rule becomes effective, the benefit of investing Goldman’s money alongside clients’ cash will be much diminished.It could, however, be the simple dollars and cents that eventually talk loudest. Valuing each of the firm’s pieces is as much art as science, partly because the published financial statements don’t show detailed profitability of each segment. But the available information does support a rough sum-of-the-parts analysis.'"
"'11-09-08,'0','Axor, a division of the German kitchen and bath company Hansgrohe, has made a name for itself by commissioning high-profile designers like Philippe Starck and Patricia Urquiola to design fixtures.

"'11-09-08,'0','Matthew Schroeder, who researches heat-seeking antiaircraft missiles and their proliferation for the Federation of American Scientists in Washington, said the discovery of yet another looted arms depot in Libya was cause for concern, especially depots that contained what security specialists call Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems, or Manpads.Western governments and nongovernment organizations have repeatedly asked and prodded the rebel government, the Transitional National Council, to take steps to secure the vast stockpiles of arms that it has inherited, apparently to little avail.“Claims that depots holding Manpads and other dangerous weapons are still not being properly secured are very worrisome and should be thoroughly investigated,” Mr. Schroeder said. “In cases where stockpile security is found to be lacking, immediate steps should be taken to correct any deficiencies.”In Washington, President Obama’s top counterterrorism official, John O. Brennan, said that the spread of shoulder-fired missiles and other weapons from Libya’s arsenal posed “a lot of concerns,” and that the United States had pressed the rebel government to secure weapons stockpiles. “Obviously, there are a lot of parts of that country right now that are ungoverned,” he said at a security conference.A senior American military officer who follows Libya closely said it was puzzling that there had been so few documented instances in which Libyan loyalist troops launched shoulder-fired missiles at NATO aircraft.   “I’m not sure what that means,” the officer said.  “Fewer systems than we thought? Systems are inoperable? Few in Libya know how to operate them?”The officer said it was also unclear whether Al Qaeda or other extremist groups had acquired the missiles, though he said intelligence analysts were assuming they had.   “But if they do, why haven’t they used or threatened to use?” the officer said.  “It’s all very murky right now.”On Wednesday, a reporter for The New York Times, as well as a researcher for Human Rights Watch and other reporters who visited the scene, found 10 crates that had held two missiles each lying opened and empty. The crates were clearly labeled as coming from Russia.“Other countries know these weapons are on the loose, and they will be trying to get their hands on them,” said a researcher for Human Rights Watch, Peter Bouckaert.He was particularly concerned with one crate, labeled “9M342,” the Russian designation for the SA-24 heat-seeking missile.“These were some of the most advanced weaponry the Russians made,” Mr. Bouckaert said. Referring to the rebels who have taken control of Tripoli and to the international community, he added, “They need to get people here to secure some of this.”The SA-24 can be mounted on vehicle-based launchers or fired from a person’s shoulder via a much smaller launcher known as a grip stock. The latter configuration, of the same class of weapon as the American-made Stinger, is considered the gravest potential danger to civilian aircraft because the weapon is readily portable and relatively simple to conceal and use.No grip stocks for SA-24s have yet been found in Libya, and the Russian manufacturer of the SA-24 has previously said that it did not sell any grip stocks to Colonel Qaddafi’s military. The SA-24s, it said, were sold only with vehicle-mounted launchers.The SA-7, however, is a shoulder-fired missile. A Soviet-era weapon dating to the 1960s that remains in wide use and circulation, it has been implicated in several attacks on airliners over the years, including a failed attack on an Israeli charter plane.Former Eastern bloc nations call it a Strela, for the Russian word for arrow. Nine of the freshly emptied crates found Wednesday were marked with the Eastern bloc designation for the Strela: 9M32M.Libyan rebels have occasionally been spotted carrying SA-7s, though the weapon has no evident practical use to them, given that the Qaddafi air force was grounded by NATO months ago and that the only military aircraft confirmed in the Libyan skies have been the NATO planes supporting the rebels’ advances.Although only nine crates holding two SA-7s each were found in the schoolbook warehouse, those crates were a part of what evidently were nine different consignments.In all, those consignments added up to a total of 2,445 crates delivered from Russia to Tripoli, containing 4,890 missiles, according to markings on the crates. But there was no way to ascertain whether the other crates in those consignments had previously been in this warehouse, or in some other part of the country. Many of the other missiles may have been issued to the Qaddafi forces in the field, which for months had a need to defend against aerial attack.The Times has previously documented that 5,270 SA-7b missiles had been delivered to Libya. Some of those shipments were part of the same consignments found Wednesday. But according to the stenciled markings on the newly found crates, at least 2,322 of the missiles appear to be from previously undiscovered consignments, meaning that at least 7,592 of the missiles had been sent to Libya. Estimates of the true total run as high as 20,000 such missiles.A spokesman for the Libyan rebel military, Abdulrahman Busin, said the rebel authorities were aware of the schoolbook warehouse, which is only about a quarter-mile from the headquarters of the Khamis Brigade, an elite loyalist military unit headed by a son of Colonel Qaddafi. Mr. Busin said the rebel “military police” had probably removed the missiles.“The military police were aware of this and they took charge of it; they’re the ones who secured it,” Mr. Busin said.But if that was the case, he was unable to explain why the facility remained unguarded on Wednesday. And efforts were unsuccessful in contacting the head of the military police to confirm if his forces indeed had the missing missiles.'"
"'11-09-08,'0','Stem’s camera, the iZon, is much smaller, prettier and less intrusive than its rivals. It’s a tiny white cylinder, about three inches long. It could pass for a roll of sushi designed by Jonathan Ive.It attaches magnetically to a shiny white dome of a base, so that you can slide, turn and tilt it to different angles.The iZon doesn’t require a computer, which is a huge advantage. All it needs is a power outlet and a wireless network. Its rivals, meanwhile, require a computer to set up and, in some cases, even to operate.There’s a price advantage, too; the iZon costs $130, much less than most of its competitors.So if there’s no computer involved, how do you set up and view the iZon? Using a free app on an , Touch or . You can even install multiple iZons all over your house, and switch among video feeds with one tap. (As the brochure puts it, “We recommend no more than 200 iZons on a single wireless network.” They wish.)The concept is solid. Whenever your i-gadget has a signal, either Wi-Fi or cellular, you can watch your home video signal for up to five minutes at a time.The quality of picture and sound is surprisingly good, even in low light. It’s as though your living room has become the world’s most boring cable channel.You can record all that pulse-pounding excitement, too; 35 seconds gets recorded with one tap on a little Record button. Ingeniously, the iZon posts these clips to your account, privately or publicly. That way, the storage is free, unlimited, permanent and available from any computer or phone.The motion and sound sensors work very well. When the iZon sees something moving in its field of view, when it hears something, or both, it auto-posts a 35-second clip to your YouTube account. It sends your phone an alert message letting you know. You can watch those videos on a computer or right in the iZon app.When you’re home, you can tweak this feature. For example, if passing cars or moving branches outside the window keep setting off unwanted YouTube clips, you can draw a box on the video preview with your finger, limiting motion detection to a certain part of the scene. Sensitivity sliders let you screen out audio and video false alarms even more.The Stem people got a lot right with the iZon. The design is terrific, especially at the price. The features are all there; the thing really works. The picture and, especially, the sound quality are impressive. And the whole concept _ — peeking in on your home world, miles away — is creepy and powerful and reassuring.Unfortunately, Stem’s software is a swing and a miss.Stem makes two products — the iZon camera and a smart alarm clock. Why on earth did they stuff the controls for both unrelated products into the same iPhone app? It really makes no sense; most people won’t buy both.And since there are only four primary icons at the bottom of the screen, why can’t you tap the one you want? That’s how it works in all the other iPhone apps. Instead, you have to slide your finger until the icon you want is visible through a sort of keyhole. Dudes, you’ve reinvented a wheel that didn’t need inventing.There are bugs aplenty, too. How’s this for a doozy? When you’re entering your YouTube account information, the Stem app automatically changes the @ sign in your e-mail address into “%40.” In other words, if you’re bob@gmail.com, the app insists that you’re bob% . Therefore, the app can’t log into YouTube, so you miss out on some of the best iZon features, like the motion detection and the one-tap recording.It’s possible to dig into YouTube settings and change your user name to one that doesn’t contain an @ sign, like “skibunny23.” But YouTube is the heart of the entire product. Why couldn’t Stem bag a bug this big?The iPad app is especially problematic. It’s slow, it freezes, it crashes, it doesn’t rotate when you turn the tablet in your hands. Instead of taking advantage of the big screen, the app plays the iZon video feed in a small area, surrounded by an ocean of black margin.For the longest time, I couldn’t get the motion detection to work at all on the iPad. After about an hour on the phone, a company rep figured out the problem. Remember how you can draw a box on the scene to indicate which area you want the camera to monitor for motion? Well, on the iPad, the factory setting is — ready for this? — none of it. The camera comes set to ignore the entire image. A burglar could ransack your safe, put on a ballerina costume and do the macarena right in front of the camera; the iZon would keep its iZoff.The iZon prefers a fast, low-traffic Wi-Fi network, too; it likes the 802.11n variety of wireless routers. If the network is busy — during backups, for example — the video feed may freeze for awhile.The company realizes it has some work to do. For example, when you tune in “live,” you’re actually seeing a scene that’s 20 seconds old. The company says it plans to tighten up that lag time in a software update. An update will improve the quality of the captured video, too. Eventually, the company plans to sell more features and services for a monthly fee; for example, you’ll be able to watch live for more than five minutes at a time.Other cameras offer more features, but harbor their own disappointments, too. For example, you can rotate the Astak Mole ($205) up, down, left or right by remote control, but only if you’re using Internet Explorer. The camera has to be plugged directly into your network router, which greatly limits its freedom of placement. And it’s awfully big and obvious; it looks like a Magic Eight Ball with a power cord.The Alert 700i offers hi-def video and also comes in an outdoor version, with infrared night vision. You can watch its feed on iPhone, Android or BlackBerry. But it costs $230. You need a Windows PC to set it up and control it and you have to pay $80 a year to watch your motion-triggered recordings remotely; only the live feed is free.So the iZon walks into a competitive landscape filled with expensive, complex, PC-based rivals. But by releasing the initial version with so many bugs, the company is gutting its own primary sales point: effortless simplicity. Next time, maybe somebody should do a little Stem-sell research.'"
"'11-09-08,'0','“This is a political and not a financial thing now,” said Simon Gleeson, a partner at the law firm Clifford Chance. “What everybody hoped was that by the time we got to reforming banking regulation we’d have a more stable economy. But we don’t and that’s the biggest challenge.”The British economy grew just 0.2 percent in the second quarter, and the Bank of England has cut its growth forecast for this year to 1.5 percent from 1.9 percent.The British proposal would make it considerably more expensive to raise capital for investment banking and would be much more painful for Britain’s banks than the so-called Volcker Rule in the United States.Under the United States approach, originally advocated in a stronger form by Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who served as an adviser to President Obama, banks’ freedom to trade with their own capital and manage hedge funds would be limited. But they would still be able to borrow money economically because their balance sheets would remain unified.British banking executives, nervous that the new rules would increase their financing costs and threaten their credit ratings, have stepped up lobbying efforts in recent weeks.Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland would be the most affected by the new rules because they have large investment banking businesses and could see profit drop by a third, according to a research note by JPMorgan Chase.The chief executive of Barclays, Robert E. Diamond Jr., and his counterpart at R.B.S., Stephen Hester, have held lengthy discussions with the government, arguing in favor of the universal banking model, that is, leaving consumer and investment banking linked. They claimed this had helped their banks to withstand risks, according to a Treasury official who declined to be identified because the talks were private.In a preliminary report in April, the Independent Commission on Banking suggested limiting the use of consumer deposits to finance the investment banking operation by setting up a so-called ring fence around the consumer operations. On Monday, the commission is expected to give more detail on exactly which businesses should be “ring-fenced” and how strict the separation should be. As an example, banks could be restricted to using deposits only for personal loans and the purchase of government bonds.Angela Knight, the head of the British Bankers Association, an industry group, said the commission’s proposals would weaken rather than strengthen the financial sector. “Ring-fencing becomes unattractive to investors of all types as it reduces the benefits of diversification, gives borrowers a worse deal, and is inefficient from a capital, funding and operational perspective,” she said.Among the biggest fears for banking executives is that the new rules would increase the financing costs of investment banking by implying the business would be allowed to fail. Interbank lenders, the executives argue, would demand higher rates in return for the higher risk. The banks’ total financing costs could rise by about £2 billion a year, according to a report by Citigroup analysts.Credit rating agencies are watching the moves closely. Moody’s Investors Service said last month that the ratings of the biggest British banks were on review for a downgrade pending the commission’s proposals.Markets, too, have taken notice. British banking stocks have lagged behind European rivals this year because of uncertainty about regulatory issues. Leigh Goodwin, an analyst at Citigroup, estimated that much of the £20 billion to £25 billion, or about $32 billion to $40 billion, in lost market value of the three largest banks over the past year was due to “perceived regulatory risk.”The British financial services industry accounts for about 10 percent of Britain’s economic activity and 4 percent of total employment, according to Ernst & Young. The relative importance of the sector adds a pointed political dimension to the debate over banking regulation.The issue has already caused tensions within Britain’s coalition government, pitting Mr. Cameron, who is willing to postpone or water down any new rules, against his business secretary, Vince Cable, who favors immediate changes.A member of the Liberal Democrats, the junior coalition partner, Mr. Cable last month accused banks of being “disingenuous in the extreme to use the current context to argue against reform.”“Banks are in a way trying to create a panic around something which they know has got to happen,” he added.But Mr. Cameron appears concerned that introducing stricter regulation now would only further threaten jobs and recovery, according to the officials.These concerns are backed by an Ernst & Young report that estimated that tougher bank regulation could indirectly reduce economic growth by 0.3 percent, as higher financing costs for banks could limit their desire to lend.“There’s definitely been a change of tone from the Treasury that they need to balance growth and financial stability,” said Jon Pain, a partner at KPMG and a former managing director of the Financial Services Authority, Britain’s financial regulator. “In that sense you would not want to do something really radical and you’re unlikely to do something rapidly.”But Mr. Pain added that “politically it would be unacceptable to do nothing.”George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, has already said that he supports the banking commission’s interim proposals in principle, but that questions remain on how and when the government would carry out the recommendations.“It appears that Cameron decided that this will be kicked into the long grass,” said Andrew Hilton, director of the Center for the Study of Financial Innovation.The prime minister would “postpone it until the next election and that would give everyone a lot of time to change the proposals,” he said.'"
"'11-09-08,'0','Italy also took steps on Wednesday to reassure markets, as the Senate approved the government’s multibillion-euro package of budget cuts and increases. That eased fears that Prime Minister would backtrack on promised budget measures to manage Italy’s towering debt.Mrs. Merkel struck a confident note in speaking before , saying the ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court had “absolutely confirmed” her government’s “transparent” handling of in close consultation with Parliament. “That is exactly the path we have followed,” she said.Had the court declared the bailouts unconstitutional, the repercussions for the euro and the fragile European banking system would almost certainly have been devastating. “If the euro collapses, so does Europe,” Mrs. Merkel said, adding that “Germany’s future is inseparable from Europe’s future.”The court rejected three appeals against the legality of earlier bailouts, which have stirred a furious political debate among Germans. The suits had been brought by a coalition of German lawmakers, economists and business executives who argued that Germany’s participation in and support funds for Greece undermined Parliament and infringed on provisions underpinning the country’s democracy.The court’s president, Andreas Vosskuhle, warned that the ruling did not represent a “constitutional blank check for additional rescue packages.” The court required the government to seek the approval of Parliament’s budget committee before making money available for future bailouts of European countries struggling under mounting debt.That requirement could still hamper Mrs. Merkel’s ability to take quick measures, but it represented much less of a political hurdle than if the court had required approval by the full Parliament for each decision, which many analysts had predicted.For now the chancellor seems more concerned with winning passage of the deal reached between European leaders in July to expand the bailout funds. Mrs. Merkel is hoping that the approval of the court, with its high public standing in the eyes of Germans, helps her put down a rebellion in her own coalition over the measure. The vote is expected on Sept. 29, and numerous legislators from her party have threatened not to support the increase, which would raise Germany’s share to about $297 billion.The constitutional court, despite its distance from the capital, or perhaps because of it, is consistently found to be the most respected player in German government. Analysts say that Germans have a deep respect for judges and the judiciary, and the court has not been shy in wielding its power. It declared in a 2009 ruling on the Treaty that it had jurisdiction to overturn European policies, rules and decisions it found unconstitutional.“In Europe, there is no constitutional court stronger or more visible in the public sphere and political landscape than the German constitutional court,” said Matthias Herdegen, director of the Institute for Public Law at the University of . “Even those opposed to certain steps feel it is an organ that responds to their concerns and that’s an enormous contribution to the legitimacy of the German political process.”Yet the very fact that the fate of the euro rested on the shoulders of eight judges in red robes in this southwestern German city served as a stark reminder of the splintered nature of decision-making within Europe that has allowed the crisis to fester and spread — and therefore why strong leadership is so desperately needed. Although decision-making is often viewed as a simple matter of coordination between and , agreements can be derailed by even the smallest states.Finland has thrown the Greek bailout into confusion by demanding collateral from in exchange for new aid, forcing a flurry of negotiations. The speaker of Parliament in Slovakia has said that he would not bring the European bailout fund to a vote this month as planned, raising questions in the process over why a small, poor country like his should pay for the free-spending ways of the better-off Greeks.At the same time the ability, and indeed the willingness of states like Greece and even Italy to rein in spending and get their deficits under control has been viewed with increased skepticism. That in turn reduces the appetite of rich states to guarantee more of their debts, even if the refusal jeopardizes the euro.While the court may have signed off on the constitutional questions, other political hurdles remain in Germany. Voters in Europe’s largest economy do not want to pay to haul other countries out of their deficit woes.“The court ruling removes a substantive obstacle, but there’s no doubt that the situation still looks pretty grave,” said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform in . The underlying problems of heavily indebted states and weak, undercapitalized still have to be addressed to find a long-term solution, Mr. Tilford said.In Parliament, Mrs. Merkel renewed her opposition to the idea of jointly issuing debt in the form of “euro ” as a means of solving the debt crisis. “Euro bonds are the way to a union of debtors,” she said, calling the idea “the wrong answer.”“That is why we will not go down this route,” she added.Jessica Koch, an analyst at the Center for European Policy in Freiburg, Germany, said the decision was consistent with previous court rulings, requiring that “certain decisions on revenue and expenditure must remain in the hands of Parliament.”“That is fundamental for the democratic state,” Ms. Koch said. “You can transfer competencies to a certain extent. You can’t transfer them completely.”'"
"'11-09-08,'0','“It is a bit of a relief rally,” said Paul Zemsky, the chief officer of multi-asset strategies for Investment Management.Given the volatility in the markets recently, he and other analysts were cautious about the prospects for the broad gains to stick.There was “a favorable outcome” to the German court ruling and the market was responding, Mr. Zemsky said, “but we need to see follow-through.”In addition to the German court ruling, the Italian Senate approved austerity measures — after the markets closed — intended to fend off the country’s .“The Italian Senate passing the austerity bill is a boost and besides that I think it is going to help relieve some of the sovereign debt concerns, especially those that were intensifying in the past week or so regarding and ,” said Peter Cardillo, the chief market economist for Rockwell Global Capital.At the same time, some analysts said that the banking sector might have hit its lows.In a research report, analysts from noted that bank stocks have declined by 24 percent since July 21, the date to which the most recent sell-off period is often traced, while the broader market as measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down by 13 percent.“While numerous macro concerns remain, we believe the sell-off is overdone” if gross domestic product growth is more than 1 percent, the analysts said about bank stocks over all.Of the 10 most actively traded bank stocks on Wednesday, was up the most, more than 12 percent, at $4.37. The Deutsche Bank analysts upgraded the stock, which shed the most during the sell-off, as a buy after noting its management was cutting costs and for its outlook on the economy.rose more than 7 percent to $7.48. The bank shook up its top management team on Tuesday as it contended with a flagging share price and mounting legal liabilities. was up 4.6 percent at $28.98.Economists have been recalculating their outlook for the economy in the light of softer economic data and, to some extent, recent stock market volatility has increased the uncertainty for businesses. On Wednesday, a survey of its 12 districts reported that many businesses in the United States had downgraded or become more cautious about their near-term outlooks.Mr. Cardillo said the Fed’s description in the survey, known as the beige book, that economic activity continued to expand at a modest pace in some districts also helped trading.“I think this rally probably will extend itself,” he said.But the markets in the United States are also intertwined with global economies, and Mr. Zemsky noted that new data from Germany provided some support on Wednesday; the country’s industrial production was reported to have surged 4 percent in July, above expectations and reversing a decline in June, despite slack demand.“It looks like the economies around the world are slowing, not stopping,” Mr. Zemsky said.The technology sector rose solidly, led by , which was up more than 5 percent at $13.61. The company’s chief executive, Carol A. Bartz, was fired Tuesday, ending a rocky two-year tenure in which she tried to revitalize the online media company.The ’s benchmark 10-year note fell 17/32 to 100 24/32 and the yield rose to 2.04 percent from 1.98 percent late Tuesday.'"

"'11-09-09,'0','CAMP SWIFT, Tex. — Camp Swift, a training area for Texas soldiers, lies several miles north of the area charred this week by the most destructive wildfire in Texas history. But 1,500 acres of the camp burned in a different fire last month, after a soldier used a grenade simulator in an unauthorized place.“This stuff went up like a Roman candle,” said Col. Robert Crow, the commander of the training centers for the Texas Army National Guard, as he gestured toward dead pine trees.As the worst one-year drought in Texas history wears on, officials at Camp Swift and other military installations around the state are figuring out how to keep training while reducing fire risks.Some large blazes have begun this year on firing ranges, including a 3,700-acre one that started last week and is now mostly contained at Fort Hood (in total about 14,000 acres have burned on the base’s range since June, officials say). At Camp Bowie, a Texas Army National Guard training site roughly 150 miles northwest of Austin, tracer fire sparked a 4,000-acre blaze this spring.Billy Rhoads, the fire chief at Fort Hood, estimated that more than 50 fires had occurred since the drought began, “and I may be low on that,” he added.'"

"'11-09-09,'0','“You want to go to any sporting event, any basketball game, any courtside seating, you need this apparel,” he said.Of the logo — a heart and a basketball intertwined— designed by a graffiti artist but chosen by Stoudemire, Roy said, “The basketball is him and the heart is me, but actually his name means love.”Roy and Stoudemire spoke about their respect for the other’s work ethic as the primary reason for their collaboration.“He works hours above and beyond what some of his co-workers do,” Roy said. “And it’s the same way in fashion. It becomes a lifestyle. I don’t stop at 12 o’clock; I don’t stop at 1 o’clock. I breathe it and I think it and I love it and it’s me. And he just loves fashion, beyond that.”Stoudemire said of women’s fashion, “I think the most intriguing fact is that it’s not easy.”Roy said Stoudemire had input in the design process, often choosing the different pieces. “This reflects him, this does not reflect him,” she said, describing his vetting process. “And that’s with fabrics and colors.”“He has a very strong point of view,” Roy said of Stoudemire’s fashion sense.Stoudemire’s fashion sense is not new. Shortly after the N.B.A. instituted a dress code in 2005, he missed all but three games that season because of knee troubles. This left Stoudemire as an unofficial sartorial spokesman on the sideline, wearing clothes that looked as if they belonged in trendier parts of Brooklyn or in Mos Def’s closet, not in the oversized, baggy meccas that N.B.A. locker rooms had been only a season before.“Amar’e’s good,” the former Knicks star Walt Frazier, renowned for his own fashion sense, told GQ in February. “He’s more of a GQ guy, with the tight Italian style.”Stoudemire has also teamed with Big Lead Sports on a Web-based initiative involving lifestyle and basketball content, as well a fantasy basketball platform and an educational program for children that combines math with fantasy basketball. And he has a deal with Scholastic to begin a series of children’s books starting next year.The fashion line features the words style and power prominently on T-shirts, a message that was not lost on Roy.“Well, he is a power forward, right?” she said. “And I am style. But more than anything, it’s about how those two things merge.”Roy said she knew very little about basketball before working with Stoudemire but is now a Knicks fan.“Madison Square Garden has an energy that fashion has,” she said. “And what I mean by that is that there’s a very palpable feeling when you’re in Madison Square Garden. There is a very palpable feeling when you’re at a fashion show, when you get that garment that looks so amazing on you, and you feel so good in. It’s energizing.”'"
"'11-09-09,'0','Juventus opened a 40,200-seat stadium outside Turin with a 1-1 draw in a friendly against Notts County, the English club that provided its first white-and-black jerseys in 1903. The $168 million stadium was built on the site of the former Stadio delle Alpi.It is the first modern soccer stadium in Italy, featuring 84 luxury boxes. Juventus will play its first official match there on Sunday against Parma to open Serie A.'"
"'11-09-09,'0','“It’s not like a baseball game, where you just schedule a make-up game,” said Robert A. Boland, who teaches at the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University. “As you move off the regular calendar, people don’t go, and when you’re not bringing people in, it dramatically decreases how much people eat, drink and spend.”The decision to play on or adjust is significant because the tournament generates about $217 million, or almost 80 percent of the U.S.T.A.’s revenue. Sponsorships and television rights fees make up about two-thirds of the Open’s revenue, with tickets, suite sales, food and merchandise making up most of the remainder.That’s why when the weather disrupts the tournament’s taut timetable, the organizers must consider the needs of the networks. For CBS, which broadcasts the top matches, finishing on the weekend is critical. Many fans may watch the men’s final on Monday, but they are very likely to do so in offices, bars or online, places that are not included in Nielsen’s television rating.Indeed, the rating last year fell 22 percent for the men’s final, which was delayed a day by rain.Because many ads are sold based on how many viewers are watching, advertisers are often compensated when matches are pushed to other times. The most common way to reimburse them is to show their ads at times when similar viewers are watching.That is relatively easy on Tennis Channel, which is devoted to the sport. On ESPN, advertisers might see their ads on pre- or post-event shows, while CBS could show commercials originally scheduled for the Open during, say, football games, said Brad Adgate, senior vice president of research at Horizon Media, a media services company.In the worst case, networks will refund any money paid for ads not shown. But “cash-backs is a dirty word, a last resort if the advertisers and the networks don’t come to some agreement,” Adgate said.In the television rights deal that begins next year, there is a formula for CBS to get some money back if a semifinal or final is pushed back.Jim Curley, the tournament director, said in a statement: “We revised the schedule for the remainder of the U.S. Open in an effort to be fair to the players and our ticket holders. This is the result of a collaborative effort with the players, CBS Sports and tournament officials to address the issues that arose from the inclement weather earlier this week.”Scheduling headaches are not new in sports. Baseball games have rain delays and go into extra innings, while football, basketball and hockey games have overtime. But for premier events like the United States Open, advertisers prefer the certainty of reaching their potential customers during peak viewing times.“There’s an impetus from a dollar perspective to get these matches played on schedule,” Adgate said. “I don’t think anyone is happy with extending it out to next week. It’s a lose-lose situation.”In many cases, fans are losers, too. Michael and Marianne Stober had tickets to the evening session on Wednesday that was rained out. They could exchange their tickets, which cost about $130 each, for another session later in the tournament, or accept replacements for the 2012 Open. They were told that no tickets remained for this year’s events, so they have no choice but to attend next year, or to sell their tickets.“The general feeling is that the fans are being dissed,” said Marianne Stober, who lives in New Jersey.Emily Coxe, who traveled with her husband to New York from Beaumont, Tex., hoped that rain would not delay the men’s semifinal matches on Saturday. They spent $2,300 for those tickets and others, and they have a return flight to Texas on Sunday.“It would be tough to stay an extra day because my husband works full time,” she said. “We really haven’t decided on a Plan B” if it rains.'"
"'11-09-09,'0','When China reports this week that the consumer price index rose at an annualized rate of about 6 percent in August, economists may say inflation has peaked. They said the same last year, when the C.P.I. was running half as fast. The problem isn’t bad forecasting: China’s headline inflation measure is flawed.Headline inflation is easily bent by volatile prices. Take pork, which rose 57 percent year on year in July. Vegetable prices are increasing more than 5 percent a week, and the effect is magnified because food composes a third of the C.P.I. basket. Conversely, some prices are artificially low, like energy and transport. A ticket on Beijing’s subway has cost a flat 2 renminbi for three years.China’s size creates another problem. While Shanghai urbanites lament the price of their lattes, farmers in the hinterland have different concerns. Perhaps it would be better to have one C.P.I. for the city and one for the country. New tailored bank rules for low-income Xinjiang Province make that not so far-fetched.Finding the genuine inflation number isn’t easy. One insight comes with the difference between nominal and real reported gross domestic product, the so-called G.D.P. deflator. By that measure, 2010’s inflation was around twice the C.P.I.’s reported 3.3 percent rise. If that’s a guide, today’s inflation could be in double digits.Savers, who are robbed by rising prices, are giving a strong signal. They have flocked to real estate and high-yielding wealth products to beat the measly 3.5 percent mandated one-year deposit rate. That makes inflation harder to fight, since money pushed into informal lending channels isn’t affected by monetary policy tools like bank credit quotas. Allowing deposits to be set by the market would draw more back into the banks. But the fear of eroding banks’ margins seems to stand in the way of what would be a potent inflation-fighting tool.'"

"'11-09-09,'0','Mr. Perry appears eager to run a campaign aimed squarely at the Republican base. His oratory is clearly meant to fire up evangelicals, the Tea Party, social conservatives and the Republican Party’s most committed voters — its traditional base — as a path to victory.To that end, Mr. Perry did not back down Wednesday night from his assertion that Social Security was a failure, even in the face of direct criticism by Mr. Romney. Mr. Perry insisted that climate change science was “not settled.” And he got one of the biggest cheers of the night from the crowd by vowing that killers in Texas would “face the ultimate justice.”Throughout, the governor’s tone was not apologetic or defensive. He seemed to care little about how he might be perceived by moderate Republicans or independents, even suggesting at one point that Mr. Obama might be an “abject liar.”Mr. Romney took a different approach altogether, highlighting policies that he suggested would give Republicans the chance to beat Mr. Obama and offering a toned-down brand of conservatism that could be found acceptable by the widest possible audience.He rejected Mr. Perry’s characterization of Social Security, saying that the program needed to be fixed, not dismantled. And he seemed eager to present a more unified Republican front in the battle against Mr. Obama, saying, “We have some differences between us, but we agree that this president’s got to go.”Still, Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, did not back away from some of his more conservative proposals, including his vow to issue an executive order to end the carrying out of Mr. Obama’s health care plan.The strategies on display Wednesday night were driven in part by necessity, and in part by history.Mr. Romney is hamstrung by his past as the governor of a liberal state and the more moderate positions he took as governor and as a candidate for the Senate. Trying to challenge Mr. Perry for the ideological soul of the conservative movement would seem inauthentic for Mr. Romney.“If the Tea Party is for keeping government small and spending down, and helping us create jobs, then, hey, I’m for the Tea Party,” Mr. Romney said in a roundabout answer to the question of whether he is a member of the conservative political movement.Mr. Perry, by contrast, has built a career in Texas that is anything but subtle. In two recent books, he laid out a starkly conservative agenda that would be difficult to back away from without being accused of crass political opportunism.Both men used their records as governors to argue their cases to be president, especially when it came to the question of who would be better at creating jobs for Americans. But the Texas versus Massachusetts undercurrent was even more striking than the specifics of their accomplishments.For the next several months, the Republican contest may shape up as a fundamental question for Republican voters as they seek a candidate to challenge Mr. Obama for the right to occupy the Oval Office: whether they want a Texas Republican or a Massachusetts one.'"
"'11-09-09,'0','Nadal was back Thursday, in bright sunlight that seemed to have been flown in from the beach in his home island of Majorca. Tennis was back, as if it had never been away. Well, except for the backlog of matches, after two days of monsoons.The United States Tennis Association has backed itself into a corner between short-sightedness and avarice. It opted for a huge stadium rather than a smaller stadium with a roof, and yet it continues to back-end the men’s semifinals for Saturday and the men’s final for Sunday, as no other major tournament does.On Thursday, Roddick was sent from the confines of the familiar Arthur Ashe Stadium to Louis Armstrong Stadium, where the court surface was marred by traces of Flushing Bay, apparently just inches below. Roddick pitched a fit, and the match was moved to the modest Court 13 in the outback, and then Roddick beat David Ferrer of Spain, who had beaten him only a few weeks ago in Davis Cup play.Later, Roddick was asked if the mark of a champion is accepting what’s there and not worrying about the little things and just playing the game.“That’s what I hear,” he said, drawing laughter.Nadal was once again the warm-up act in Ashe. And he was already down a break, 3-0, to Gilles Müller of Luxembourg after Wednesday’s brief action.“It’s best of five,” Nadal said later, in his always-improving English. “Playing against Müller, he has fantastic serve, so I know I can go on court and lose the first set. That’s the normal thing, no? But I go on court, try my best in every moment and trying to produce any opportunity to take the break back.”Nadal has been noticeable in this Open, talking about his current book, “Rafa,” with his thoughts about life on the tour and family relationships. On Sunday, Nadal sustained cramps during a postmatch interview and had to slide to the floor for eight minutes until they abated. On Thursday, he was trying to avoid feeling like a victim of schedules and greed.“Unbelievable,” Nadal said after losing a point to the fickle bounce of a let. At the interlude at 4-1, the public address system played the old Johnny Nash song that begins, “I can see clearly now, the rain has gone.” Rafa still looked out of sorts, taking a few tentative steps toward the net to challenge a call, and then shuffling back. After a forehand winner he muttered, “Vamos.” Somebody in the stands shouted “Allez, Gilles.”At the start of the seventh game, however, Nadal started jogging in place awaiting Müller’s serve.“I try my best in every return,” he said later, with a smile. “I don’t feel more active in that game than other games. I felt that if I don’t have the break there, going to be very difficult to have the break later, because with the 4-2, I have to go back to the other side against the wind with new balls, 5-2.”He willed himself to break Müller, and then romped, 7-6 (1), 6-1, 6-2, loosening up, chasing balls down, forcing Müller to hit forehands into the net.Then, in the postmatch interview, Nadal made a rational critique of the schedule of this otherwise great tournament.“Having the semifinals on Saturday, you know, is something crazy for the players,” he said. He said the problem was lack of representation of players in the power struggle with management, and gave evidence of learning and growing and staying in the game, with no thoughts of evening flights to Madrid or Barcelona.'"
"'11-09-09,'0','I have a mistake to admit. Four years ago I reviewed Lucette Lagnado’s book “The Man in the White Sharkskin Suit” and called it, as her publisher did, a memoir. But after reading what is being billed as its sequel, I’ve come to realize that her earlier book was, in fact, a biography.“Sharkskin Suit” was animated by Ms. Lagnado’s father, Leon, a suave boulevardier of Cairo and charming rake of its Jewish community, until the anti-Semitism of Nasser’s Egypt heaved him and his young family from their beloved city. Through the story of Leon’s attachments and resentments, his failings and his gifts, his daughter traced the tragic dissolution of an entire family, indeed, in some ways, of the whole universe of Levantine Jews.In contrast, that work’s newly published bookend, “The Arrogant Years: One Girl’s Search for Her Lost Youth, From Cairo to Brooklyn,” is more properly a memoir. Animated by the quieter, less colorful, yet in many ways more powerful story of her mother’s life, this second book is the one in which Ms. Lagnado, an investigative reporter for The Wall Street Journal, finally reveals the unexpected and heartbreaking arc of her own life. After reading the story, you will understand why it took her so long to tell it.The book opens with a prologue of sorts: a portrait of the women’s section of the Bensonhurst synagogue that Ms. Lagnado and her mother joined after immigrating. The place was a haven, a sanctuary for Middle Eastern refugees in the vast sea of Eastern European Jewish Brooklyn, but it would also be the site of Ms. Lagnado’s first rebellion.The effort doesn’t end well, but at least Ms. Lagnado had the opportunity to undertake it, a right never accorded to her mother, Edith. As a young woman of few means in Cairo, Edith — lovely, brilliant and bookish, her claim to fame that she had read all of Proust by the age of 15 — became the unlikely protégée of the wife of the pasha who presided over Cairo’s Jews. She gave Edith a job teaching at the Jewish private school and, even more incredibly, the authority to manage its library. Edith had “never felt so empowered as when she ordered more books.” That sense of independence ended abruptly when, at 20, Edith was all but forcibly betrothed to Leon, a playboy 22 years her senior, and, in preparation for marriage, was compelled to quit her coveted job and return the key to her beloved library. For Edith, this brought to an end those “great arrogant years in the life of a pretty girl” — a line from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “Tender Is the Night,” borrowed here for the book’s title.It also inaugurated a lifetime so filled with calamities of all sizes — “rabies, broken bones, typhoid fever, the loss of a king, the death of an infant” — that Edith began to believe her family cursed. Ms. Lagnado resketches the story of their last years in Egypt, but that era in the family’s history, directed as it was by Leon, is drawn far more vividly in the first book. “The Arrogant Years,” instead, finds its center in 1960s America, where a broken Leon fades mutely into the background, and Edith emerges, a wounded bird painfully trying to finagle some tiny measure of success or happiness for her blighted loved ones.'"
"'11-09-09,'0','Concert halls continue to open around North America, and each one is a big deal for classical music lovers and performers, even if orchestras are increasingly falling into serious financial trouble. The inaugural concert program has become a ritual, almost as codified as haiku.There is usually the Big Statement piece, something that can show off an orchestra’s color and the hall’s stellar (one hopes) acoustics. There is often a new work to show commitment to contemporary music. The program frequently includes pieces that have a local connection. And then there is the celebrity soloist to say: See, we really are important.Often openings offer free concerts, a moment of willful blindness to high ticket prices to come. The public is given tours behind doors that will then sometimes remain closed to them. Meanwhile expensive public relations companies hired by the hall or arts center beat the drums of civic boosterism.Montreal’s new hall, the Maison Symphonique, checked off many of the boxes when the Montreal Symphony Orchestra took to its new stage on Wednesday. Kent Nagano, the music director, led Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony and new works by local composers in a burst of Québecois pride.Next weekend, in Missouri, Kansas City will put on the big arts center version of the opening, the populist extravaganza. The $326 million Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts there will have a three-day smorgasbord of ballet, opera, jazz, Broadway show music, band shows and star appearances by Plácido Domingo and Itzhak Perlman.But the weekend after, the Kansas City Symphony will present a classic of the concert hall opening program in its first subscription concert in Helzberg Hall, the center’s concert auditorium. The program consists of Stravinsky’s “Fireworks,” Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 5 with Emanuel Ax as soloist, the premiere of Chen Yi’s “Fountains of Kansas City” and Respighi’s “Pines of Rome.”'"
"'11-09-09,'0','In one of the more curious moments in the Republican debate on Wednesday night, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas invoked 17th-century science in discussing his doubts about climate change. He cited the astronomer and mathematician Galileo Galilei — often called the father of modern science — in suggesting that the current thinking that climate change is a result of human activity could be overturned. “Galileo got outvoted for a spell,” he said.On the surface, though, his example seemed to illustrate the opposite of the point that Mr. Perry might have been trying to make. Galileo, whose astronomical observations confirmed the Copernican theory that the Earth revolved around the Sun, was basing his assertions on empirical knowledge and faced opposition from the Roman Catholic Church, which supported the Ptolemaic view of an Earth-centered universe.Mr. Perry, by contrast, has said repeatedly that he does not believe the empirical evidence compiled by scientists in support of climate change, but that he does adhere to faith-based principles.Was Mr. Perry trying to depict Galileo as a maverick among scientific thinkers of his time? If so, the governor was wrong, says one historian who has studied the trial of Galileo.“If Perry means to say that at some point some body of scientists said Galileo was wrong, that didn’t happen,” said the historian, Thomas F. Mayer, who teaches at Augustana College in Rock Island, Ill.Galileo and Copernicus were long ago proved right, but even in Galileo’s day there were scientists who supported him, Dr. Mayer said. “His notions about science were not that far out there,” he said. “There were a lot of other scientists, especially in Rome, who more or less agreed with his scientific observations.”'"
"'11-09-09,'0',', the British fashion designer whose career imploded after a videotaped anti-Semitic rant, was found guilty and given a suspended fine of 6,000 euros on Thursday by a French tribunal in connection with two separate bar clashes in Paris with people who accused him of hate crimes.Mr. Galliano, 50, who faced the judges in a one-day trial in June, did not appear in court in the Palais de Justice for the verdict, writing to the judges that he wanted to avoid the news media.The tribunal issued a fine and then suspended it, less than the fine of 10,000 euros ($13,900) sought by the prosecutor, Anne de Fontette. Mr. Galliano was charged with public insults for reasons of religion, race or ethnicity, a charge that carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison and a 22,500 euro fine.Mr. Galliano, who was fired six months ago as the creative director of the fashion house Dior, had told the French court that he remembered nothing about the incidents and at the time was debilitated by job stress and addiction to Valium and alcohol. He condemned racism and anti-Semitism and apologized to the victims, saying he had experienced discrimination himself because of his homosexuality. But the prosecutor had accused him of indulging in an ugly variety of “racism and anti-Semitism of the parking lot and the supermarket.”Mr. Galliano’s apology and humility, expressed during his trial in a low voice and a British accent that sometimes baffled a court translator, resonated with the judges, who convicted him of the hate crime but reduced his sentence.'"
"'11-09-09,'0','Most investors and businessmen are reluctant to return in the absence of diplomatic representation, and many companies owned or run by foreign entities remain closed.Mr. Jibril said it was premature to talk about business returning to normal in Tripoli, because the war was still not over and would not be until Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and his remaining holdouts were defeated. He said many people were misled by the growing appearance of normalcy in most of the country; only four widely scattered towns or cities remain under control of Qaddafi loyalists.“The battle of liberation is not finished yet,” he said. “Some thought that the old regime has collapsed completely and Libya is completely liberated and we have regained all our frozen money and we are in the process of reconstruction, but that is not so.”He also criticized some Libyans who he said were prematurely beginning to practice politics, when a constitution has yet to be drafted that would set the terms for political activity. It was unclear to whom he was referring.As a result of commitments made by the transitional government, Libya has 240 days from the time it declares itself liberated from Colonel Qaddafi’s rule to elect an interim council, which will lead to drafting a constitution and forming a government. A Western diplomat speculated that if the members of the transitional council came to Tripoli, there would be pressure on them to declare victory and the clock would start ticking on what is likely to be a difficult and contentious process.Still, the diplomat said, “it looks bad and it limits our ability to help them on the ground.” He spoke on the condition of anonymity because the matter is politically delicate.Mr. Jibril said it was not surprising that the interim government may take three weeks or more to move to Tripoli, a city that fell in three days once the rebels advanced. “There is really no secret to this, the reason behind this is primarily logistical,” he said. “We are making sure there are good people on the ground, communications and security and so on.”Mr. Jibril also said that regime holdouts in the besieged town of Bani Walid had taken advantage of an extension until Saturday in the deadline for them to surrender, and had used the extra time to arm themselves. He ruled out any additional extension of the deadline. “We had hoped we could avoid any further loss of life,” he said.Elsewhere in the capital, four community leaders from Bani Walid called on the transitional government to extend the deadline, even though their own efforts to negotiate peace terms failed in dramatic fashion on Tuesday.The four met with rebel leaders 35 miles from Bani Walid and agreed to peace terms, which included an agreement that only fighters from Bani Walid would enter the town after it surrendered. When they returned to Bani Walid to convey those terms, however, they were stopped at gunpoint by angry Qaddafi loyalists who would not allow them back into the town.“We all hope the transitional government will give them some more time,” said Abdulgader Ganiya, a university lecturer and engineer, and one of the four negotiators. “We are trying very hard to end this without a fight,” said another of them, Younis al-Robus, a history lecturer.In other developments on Thursday, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague asked Interpol to circulate a notice requesting the arrest of Colonel Qaddafi, as well as one of his sons, Seif al-Islam Qaddafi and his former intelligence chief, Abdulla al-Senussi. The court has accused them of crimes against humanity.And an audio recording said to be from Colonel Qaddafi surfaced, in which he dismissed reports that he had fled and vowed to continue to fight.The authenticity of the message, broadcast on Arrai TV, could not be independently confirmed. It was the third message said to be from Colonel Qaddafi to be broadcast on Arrai TV, based in Syria, since rebel forces ended his 42-year rule last month.“We will not leave our ancestral land,” Colonel Qaddafi said in the message, according to a translation by Reuters.'"

"'11-09-10,'0','But beyond next year, the costs of running the museum and maintaining and protecting the memorial plaza, with its pair of deep, granite-lined pools and grove of swamp white oak trees, will be at least $55 million annually, Mr. Daniels said. He has been lobbying in Washington for federal financing to cover part, if not most, of those expenses.Mr. Daniels and members of the foundation’s board, which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg leads, were making a “very serious effort to have Congress hopefully make a decision that preserving the memory of 9/11 is a national priority,” Mr. Daniels said.“I fully believe that the feds need to make a contribution,” he continued.The rest of the costs, though, will have to be covered through fund-raising and admission fees. The foundation’s board has not yet decided whether to set a flat price or to suggest that visitors donate a certain amount, as some art museums do.As a model, Mr. Daniels cited the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, where tickets cost $10.“If it could be free for everybody, that would certainly be nice, but at the moment we need to operate this facility for a couple of years to see how popular it really is,” said Dan Tishman, co-chairman of the foundation’s building committee.But, he added, “We will likely have to charge a nominal fee.”Some museums, like the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, do not charge admission. But that museum cost about one-fourth as much to build as the Sept. 11 memorial and it receives a stream of federal funding. The 9/11 museum is “definitely not at this moment a federal facility,” Mr. Tishman said.The pools could be a revenue stream of their own, but Mr. Daniels said they did not want people throwing coins or anything into the voids because that could “gum up the works.”“These are not wishing wells,"" he said.Patricia Harris, the deputy mayor who has overseen construction of the memorial and museum for Mr. Bloomberg, said the museum could follow the lead of other cultural institutions in seeking sponsors for free-admission periods and offering discounts for students.“A lot of institutions have a lot of creative ways of extending their arms to the public,” Ms. Harris said.An informal survey of New Yorkers and tourists on the streets around the memorial this week revealed a mix of feelings about attending the museum and what a fair price would be. Several said they would not hesitate to pay as much as $20 to enter. But some insisted they should be able to walk right in.“It should be free,” said Tom McGovern, 50, who has worked in the financial district for 30 years. “Charging people to see something that fundamentally changed our country doesn’t seem right. We don’t charge people to see the Lincoln Memorial or the Washington Monument.For Mr. Daniels, a more pressing matter may be smoothing over the feelings of his fellow residents of Lower Manhattan, some of whom have complained about being excluded from the dedication on Sunday. Their request to be able to visit the memorial on Monday, before it was opened to the general public, was rejected because, Mr. Daniels said, “we’re not in the business of picking and choosing among stakeholders — other than the families.”He added that “the Lower Manhattan community is an important constituency; it’s not the most important constituency.”Instead, Mr. Daniels said, the foundation decided to reserve a few hours on the first Sunday of every month for downtown residents to visit. But the first of those will come in October, which was not soon enough to satisfy some of the neighbors.“We spent 10 years rebuilding our community,” said Julie Menin, a longtime member of the foundation board and the chairwoman of Community Board 1. “We did not want to let the 10-year anniversary go by without a proper commemoration.”So, Ms. Menin organized “Hand in Hand, Remembering 9/11,” a chain of people linking hands along the downtown waterfront on Saturday morning. Ms. Menin said she wanted to help downtown residents redirect their disappointment into a gathering that might satisfy some of their yearning to be included.Mr. Daniels said he did not see Ms. Menin’s plan as a slap at the memorial’s managers and added that they had worked hard to satisfy the community’s biggest concern: the impending influx of tour buses to the neighborhood. He said the foundation had agreed not to distribute memorial passes to tour operators for the morning and evening rush hours.“We’re trying to do something for everybody,” Mr. Daniels said.'"
"'11-09-10,'0','And with more people working from home, daytime neighborhood sounds that may once have gone unnoticed can now create enormous tension.After conducting a completely informal survey, I found that barking dogs top the list of complaints, at least in suburban neighborhoods.Craig Mixon said he was so bothered by the barking dogs in his Northern California neighborhood that he started a Web site, barkingdogs.net, to offer resources for people similarly plagued.“I did everything possible,” he said. “I talked to the neighbors. I’m a master dog trainer, so I offered to train the dogs. I gathered data for months on end. Nothing worked.”Regulations about barking dogs or other noise from neighbors vary according to town. In some cases, they are covered by noise laws, in others by nuisance laws.A friend of mine, who asked that I use her middle name, Ruth, because she still lives next to the offending neighbor, found a once-friendly relationship torn apart by noisy dogs.The dogs were put outside, sometimes all day, in a lawn surrounded by an invisible fence. Ruth and her husband tried complaining to the neighbors very gently, but to no avail.One early morning — the barking often started at 6 a.m. — they called the neighbors to beg them to bring the dogs in, but the neighbors refused. When they were once again awakened by barking, Ruth’s husband walked over to the house next door and let the dogs in.“He went ballistic,” she said. “But it wasn’t the right thing to do and we apologized.”Apology not accepted. For five years, the neighbors refused to speak to my friend or her family. There’s been a recent thaw, but relations are still strained.Like many people, my friend did call her town to see what could be done, but was told that noise laws applied from dusk to dawn, which may work in the winter, but not so well in the summer when days are long and nights are short. And she didn’t feel comfortable complaining because the town would take complaints only from people who gave their names.“Towns need to have better dog laws,” she said.Out of curiosity, I checked with our town of Mamaroneck, N.Y., to learn the laws on these issues. Animal control, it turns out, does not address neighbor’s disputes over barking dogs. The ordinance covers only licensing, what kind of animals you have (no swine allowed), leash requirements and the like.While power tools and machinery are allowed on weekdays between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. and on weekends and holidays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. — emergencies excepted — barking dogs would fall under the unnecessary noise regulation, said Stephen Altieri, the town administrator.That regulation states that all noises that menace the health or disturb the peace and quiet of the town are prohibited any time of the day or night.“We go by the doctrine of reasonableness,” he said.And there’s the rub. Reasonableness is in the ear of the beholder. Take the situation of my friend Amy, who, at 4 a.m. last winter in the middle of a snowstorm, received a phone call from a neighbor saying Amy’s snowplow service was too loud.“I was flabbergasted,” Amy said. “Having grown up in Rochester, where the winters were severe, it was standard practice for snow plows to work throughout the night. If they wait too long, the snow gets too heavy to easily remove.”Amy apologized, but the neighbor kept calling, so Amy asked her snow plow service to begin at 6 a.m. She e-mailed her neighbor, thinking she would receive a hearty thanks. Instead, the neighbor wanted her to wait until 9 a.m., which Amy thought was unfair.“I have a sense of dread that she will be calling me in the middle of the night when we have our first snowstorm,” Amy said.As the first step in any neighborly problem, Ms. Doskow suggests either nicely speaking to the neighbor or, if you don’t want to discuss it directly, leaving a pleasant note.That may seem obvious, but “too many people escalate right away,” she said. “Try to give the neighbor the benefit of the doubt, even if it seems ridiculous. Try and assume everyone wants to be as good as you are.”The second step would be a note or call saying, “I’d really like to work this out,” she said. “I wouldn’t get too heavy-handed, such as I’m going to call the police or animal control.”Suggesting mediation is also an option, Ms. Doskow said. Community mediators are available in most towns, she said, and often the police know how to contact them.Finally, if you still get no response, you may need to warn the neighbor that you will go to small claims court or seek redress elsewhere. The trouble is, even if you do report the problem, it’s often not easy to either prove it or get the authorities to resolve it.“Some noise laws are distance-based and some are decibel-based,” said Les Blomberg, director of the nonprofit group Noise Pollution Clearinghouse. “Ideally, noise regulations should set a clear line for neighbors — this is allowed, this isn’t.” But often that isn’t the case.And noise is not the only neighbor problem Ms. Doskow has seen. Parking is a big one.“People think they own the curb in front of their house, and they get really mad if someone parks there,” she said. “In fact, there was a case where someone shot someone who parked in his spot one too many times.”Even something as seemingly innocuous as trees can cause tension. If a branch from my tree is hanging over my neighbors’ lawn (and come to think of it, it is), they can cut it back to the property line. If your tree falls on a neighbor’s property, it’s an act of God and not your responsibility, unless you knew it was a sick tree and failed to do anything about it.Of course, sometimes there are problems no one can foresee. Take the case of the Idaho man whose neighbors were concerned because he walked around in a black bunny costume — sometimes with a tutu.The police spoke to the man, according to a recent news report. He was reasonable — he said he enjoyed wearing the bunny suit, but understood his neighbors’ concerns. No update on how the situation was resolved.'"
"'11-09-10,'0','Administration officials said Friday that they were examining a range of issues and hoped to complete new guidelines in the next few weeks.Economists, including the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, see the poor housing market as a crucial reason the economy is not growing faster. Business interests and consumer advocates have pressed the White House for grand plans, arguing that the economy will not fully recover as long as the housing market is depressed.But some of the president’s key advisers worry that efforts to aid struggling homeowners will infuriate people who do not need help, and the memory remains fresh in Washington that the Tea Party movement began as an angry response to a mortgage aid program.The modest proposal this week to expand the refinancing program emerged from months of deliberations. Just two sentences about it were included in the speech after an internal debate, and Mr. Obama was careful to say that the plan was aimed at “responsible homeowners.”He also proposed investing $15 billion to rehabilitate vacant and foreclosed properties, creating construction jobs and helping to refresh blighted neighborhoods.While most of Mr. Obama’s stimulus plan requires the consent of Congressional Republicans, expanding the refinancing program must instead be negotiated with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the independent guardian of Fannie and Freddie.The agency is charged with limiting losses at the two companies, which fall to taxpayers, and it has resisted some ideas that could increase those losses.But Edward J. DeMarco, the agency’s acting director, said Friday in a statement that he shared the administration’s desire to expand the program because broadening eligibility might benefit both homeowners and the companies, by limiting defaults.“The final outcome of this review remains uncertain, but F.H.F.A. believes this undertaking is worthwhile and consistent without our conservator responsibilities,” Mr. DeMarco said.The financial implications depend on the particulars. In a recent paper, however, the Congressional Budget Office said Fannie and Freddie could refinance an additional 2.9 million loans without significantly increasing taxpayers’ liability.The office calculated that such a program would save homeowners about $7.4 billion in the first year and help about 111,000 of those homeowners avoid default. It said the cost to the government would be about $600 million, because the loss of revenues from future interest payments on the refinanced loans would exceed the savings from reducing defaults.'"
"'11-09-10,'0','The male players were already steamed about the rain-altered schedule that, at one point, had them down to play four matches in four days.In fact, the ad hoc grievance committee of men’s tennis held a chapter meeting in public Friday. With labor firebrands Andy Murray, Rafael Nadal and Andy Roddick in action on the same afternoon, John Isner did not have much to add about the way the Open usually makes the men play the semifinals on Saturday and the final on Sunday.“I don’t know,” Isner said after being knocked out in the quarterfinals by Andy Murray, 7-5, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (2). “I haven’t thought about it. I’ve never been in a semifinal, so ... ”Isner, a 6-foot-9 flame-thrower, does not have the experience of Nadal, who dispatched Roddick, 6-2, 6-1, 6-3, on Friday.Form has totally held, in that second-seeded Nadal will play fourth-seeded Murray of Scotland on Saturday afternoon while first-seeded Novak Djokovic will play third-seeded Roger Federer. But at least they will get a day off Sunday as the women play the final on the Ashe court, unless it, too, springs a leak.Isner, best known for his historically long 70-68 fifth set against Nicholas Mahut of France in the 2010 Wimbledon, is having the best summer of his career. He had a 17-4 record in tie breakers on the hard courts of the Open, going into Friday. But then he botched an easy volley at 2-4 in the tie breaker and was soon done.Afterward, Isner acknowledged he had been a bit nervous going into the match. He also declined to complain about conditions at this Open.“No, the rain delay wasn’t an issue for me,” he said. “It is what it is, you know. It’s the same for all of the players, especially guys on the bottom half of the draw. We all had to deal with it.”The players who have been here before, who expect to be here, are not being so nice.Federer, after winning his quarterfinal Thursday night, said he was tired of the Open putting the men in the semifinals on Saturday and the two winners back on Sunday.The Open has long genuflected to its masters from the television networks and made the men play Saturday and Sunday. But this year, Nadal, Roddick and Murray all took their shots at the mentality that send them out on slippery courts on Wednesday, albeit for a brief quarter hour.Murray, not known as a radical in tennis politics, said Thursday that the real problem is that the Association of Tennis Professionals does not wield power in the major tournaments.“I think after the tournament is done, probably a good time for a lot of the players to kind of sit down and have a big discussion about just the tour in general, because right now we’re looking for a new C.E.O.”The American crowd was not thinking about labor issues as Nadal and Roddick took the court in a pairing between two appealing players. Roddick had been serving well and even moving nimbly, for him, in recent matches, but he looked sluggish. At one point he had treatment on his left leg, but he managed to finish the three sets.“Yeah, you know, it’s tough playing a lot of matches regularly, but I had zero reserves,” Roddick said. He noted that he had played four sets Thursday and added, “I felt like I played six sets.” He said it was a matter of honor to finish the match and not default.“So, therefore, you play till the end, in my mind,” he said.The players know that the 11-month tour is a demolition derby. But the slow pace of the first week of the Open leads to trouble in the second week, when rain and fatigue and network greed and Open capitulation all work on the players. Still three days to go for it to get weirder.'"
"'11-09-10,'0','The House on Friday passed a bill spelling out policy for the nation’s intelligence agencies for the next year. The 384-to-14 vote came after Senate Intelligence Committee leaders dropped provisions that had drawn a veto threat from President Obama, including a requirement that the director of national intelligence provide the committee with cables, memorandums and other information on detainees held at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and that the Senate confirm nominees for director of the National Security Agency. The bill still requires Senate approval.'"

"'11-09-10,'0','Most people don’t get another shot at making things right this quickly. In recent weeks, I’ve written about physicians and their financial sins and the mistakes that widows make.While most of us will never sign a seven-figure deal to play ball of any sort, the financial plight of the professional athlete offers three lessons that almost anyone can put to work, whether you are a new college graduate getting a four-figure paycheck for the first time or you have suddenly inherited, earned or won a pile of money.SLOW Steve Young has done pretty well for himself. He laid the groundwork for fiscal sanity by majoring in finance at Brigham Young University, won the most valuable player award after leading the San Francisco 49ers to victory in Super Bowl XXIX and is now a managing director at Huntsman Gay Global Capital, a private equity firm.So how well did he do with his money when he started his professional career? “I wasn’t ready to deal with it,” he said. “Just take the driving analogy. Very few people would be able to handle going zero to 100. Good luck. It’s a lot, and it’s very fast.”His advice for rookies is to deliberately slow down, way down, something echoed by the National Football League’s Players Association, their union. “ ‘Give yourself a time out’ is what I tell them,” said Dana Hammonds, the director of player services and development for the association. “Focus on football, and after you go through the season, you’ll have time to figure it all out. There is absolutely no need to get involved in any kind of investments. The only thing they need to do is figure out cash flow in their first couple of years.”That turns out to be tough advice for many players to follow. By the time Mr. Vick had to lay his affairs bare before the bankruptcy judge, he was up to his ears in all sorts of expensive investments. There was the Payless rental car franchise, not one but two janitorial services operations, a horse farm, a restaurant, something called Airport MD and those poor pit bulls.This laundry list typifies the questionable schemes that self-appointed experts pitch to people who have suddenly become wealthy. “Don’t think there is some secret society out there that has the investment knowledge, and you’re not in the know,” said Mr. Young, chuckling as he recalled the Mexican cat farm that someone once presented to him with a straight face. “There is nothing that is that unique.”Instead, he made a plea for the dull. “Triple-A bonds,” he said. “A simple ladder. Go find someone who can help you do that.”SMALL Eventually, athletes and people similar to them may want (or need) a higher rate of return than bonds can provide. Others will want to put down roots and take care of family members who helped them along the way.Former professional athletes and those who advise the players don’t necessarily have any problem with this. But psychologists have a field day with the professionals’ tendency toward outsize financial gestures, attributing it to an odd sort of mind-set that develops when they are suddenly in a different financial world than longtime friends and family.“Your animal brain goes into a panic, because you’ve just gotten thrown out of the tribe,” said Brad Klontz, co-author of the book, “Mind Over Money“ (Crown Business, 2009) and a clinical psychologist. “And your brother who has been there for you wants to borrow money to start a business. So athletes have a tendency to give away money. When you no longer have money, you aren’t put into that situation anymore.”It doesn’t make much rational sense, but here we have Mr. Vick’s bankruptcy filing, complete with his somewhat vague recollection of spending between $120,000 and $150,000 on jewelry for his brother.As to houses, Reggie Wilkes, a Merrill Lynch financial adviser who played linebacker for the Eagles in the late 1970s and part of the 1980s, would just as soon have his clients in a starter home, not a trophy one. “Get yourself a townhouse,” he said. “Or maybe even rent. Learn what it means to live in an independent building away from college or your parents.”Rookies in particular, in their enthusiasm for their new team and city, may not foresee that they will soon be cut or traded. Susan Bradley, the founder of the Sudden Money Institute who has done work with both the N.F.L. and the players’ association, notes that some teams don’t even offer direct deposit of player paychecks, even though staff members may have access to it.SCRUTINY Anyone with salaries like the ones athletes earn should probably have professional financial help. But imagine being in their shoes, with all sorts of people coming out of the woodwork precisely because you have money. And yet these strangers all say they want to protect you because of your money.The temptation is to lean on someone you know, say a teammate or family member, to find advisers or even serve as one. This approach got Mr. Vick into a world of hurt, alas.A teammate sent Mr. Vick to one helper. When Mr. Vick found that she was in trouble with the New York Stock Exchange, his brother turned him onto another adviser, who claimed Dom DeLuise as a client. This adviser, too, turned out to be in trouble with securities regulators.The players’ association does keep a list of prescreened advisers, and about 50 percent of players have used one of them over the years. The union requires the advisers on the list to have five years of experience, plus a college degree and no disciplinary record with regulators. That’s no guarantee that they won’t turn out to be bad actors anyhow, but neither is membership in well-regarded organizations like the Financial Planning Association or the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors.If I were running the union’s adviser program, I’d make all the advisers agree to work in the best interests of their clients (the so-called fiduciary standard), earn money based only on fees and not commissions, and cap the percentage of a players’ assets or salary that they can take. Ms. Hammonds of the players’ association said that the union would be in for its own regulatory headache with the Securities and Exchange Commission if it had such narrow requirements. Still, any athletes or anyone else who suddenly comes into money can hold their advisers to these additional standards.Mr. Wilkes, the former Eagle, said he was inspired to get into the business because at least 80 percent of his former teammates had horror stories about their investments. He suggested an additional layer of protection.“There should be separation of services,” he said, in part so that the professionals can look over one another’s shoulders. “I am not going to sit here and tell you who you should have as your accountant or your agent. I will give you three or four names, but you must interview them.”As for Mr. Vick, Mr. Wilkes seemed more disappointed by the people he called Mr. Vick’s “enablers” than he was in the quarterback himself. “You have to have advisers who are willing to stand up and say: ‘You listen to me. And if you don’t, I’m willing to give up the relationship.’ “'"
"'11-09-10,'0','But Israeli diplomats and experts here and abroad said that while they were not overly concerned about a flotilla to Gaza materializing soon, the naval threat regarding the gas fields could prove more dangerous.“Israel and Cyprus reached agreement dividing the water between the two of them for gas drilling,” Alon Liel, a former ambassador to Turkey said. “Turkey said the division was illegal. Israel is also clashing with Lebanon on demarcation and drilling rights. Turkey will also support Lebanon and things could escalate.”Mr. Liel said that Israel hoped to export its gas via Cyprus in a few years, and that would require the digging of a large port there — something that he imagined that Turkey would try to prevent. That could mean possible clashes between Israel and Turkey like those Turkey has had with Greece over drilling and demarcation.Israel’s foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, has ordered studies on how to defend Israelis from being prosecuted by the Turks over the flotilla attack last year — including urging Israelis associated with the military to avoid flying there — and get back at Turkey for its growing anti-Israel stand. Officials who spoke of the studies said they were still in the realm of brainstorming and were far from being accepted as policy. They included getting closer to Armenia, Turkey’s historic rival, and the minority Kurds in eastern Turkey, who along with Kurds in neighboring countries hope for an independent state.Some analysts said Turkey’s rejection of the United Nations report showed hypocrisy. Before the commission issued its account, Turkey’s foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, asserted on Turkish television that the report would “reaffirm the supremacy of international law.” After it was issued, Turkish officials declared the report null and void.Mr. Erdogan’s comments come before a planned trip to Egypt and a meeting with President Obama the week after. Henri Barkey, a professor of international relations at Lehigh University, said Mr. Erdogan was trying to force the United States into the uncomfortable position of choosing between its ally Israel and Turkey, a NATO-member nation.Turkey announced last week that it would host a NATO missile defense shield to protect against a potential strike from Iran. If tensions between Israel and Turkey increase, that could put NATO in a delicate spot.“This is very high-stakes poker,” Professor Barkey said. “It’s very, very dangerous.”Sinan Ulgen, director of EDAM, a center for economics and foreign policy studies in Istanbul, said he, too, was worried. “The latest threat is not only diplomatically difficult, but may even require direct U.S. involvement if Israel and Turkey come to face each other in the Eastern Mediterranean,” he said. “And the only one capable of coming between them is the United States, and the U.S. Sixth Fleet.”'"
"'11-09-10,'0','But concern over the euro zone debt crisis, along with uncertainty related to global economic growth, has been a touchy factor affecting the markets for months.The DAX in Germany fell 4 percent. The FTSE 100 in closed down 2.4 percent, and the CAC 40 index in was down 3.6 percent.Stocks in the followed markets in Europe. The Standard & Poor’s index of 500 closed down 31.67 points, or 2.7 percent, at 1,154.23. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 303.68 points, or 2.7 percent, to 10,992.13, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 61.15 points, or 2.4 percent, to 2,467.99.The S.& P. and the Dow were each down more than 4 percent in the week, and the Nasdaq was just over 3 percent lower.A speech on jobs by did little to lift the because of uncertainty over whether the program would pass and help the recovery, analysts said.Paul Ballew, a former economist and now chief economist at Nationwide, said short-term interest rates in Greece reflected uncertainty in Europe as well as speculation over whether there would be adequate restructuring in that nation’s economy to address its problems.Yields on Germany’s 10-year bonds declined. In the United States, the ’s benchmark 10-year note rose to 101 27/32, and the yield fell to 1.92 percent from 1.98 percent late Thursday, after touching a low of 1.89 percent during the day.“Issue No. 2 is the continued anxiety in the United States that the recovery continues to stall and that we will not be getting growth as strong as we would need in terms of corporate profits,” said Mr. Ballew.“Even yesterday’s speech raises questions of whether there will be support for fiscal policy,” he said about the president’s jobs address.Mr. Obama’s plan focused on generating jobs and included a number of cuts and spending proposals, like an extension and expansion of the cut in payroll taxes and a tax holiday for small businesses for hiring new employees.Mr. Ballew said that questions persisted about how much of the proposal would pass.In addition, investors are awaiting a Federal Reserve policy meeting later this month. Stocks were sharply lower on Thursday after the chairman of the Federal Reserve, , gave no sign that there would be fresh stimulus measures.“If you are in the market right now, you’ve got uncertainty on top of uncertainty on top of uncertainty,” Mr. Ballew said. “You have got a pretty toxic mix.”Volatility, as measured by the Vix, was just over 40, its highest level since Aug. 22, when it was 42.44.Energy, financials and materials stocks lost the most on Friday, or more than 3 percent each.Clark Yingst, the chief market analyst at Joseph Gunnar, said that the fall of the euro against on Friday, resulting in a six-month low, suggested that the S.& P. 500 had not yet completed its recent correction.“The market just doesn’t believe that it is going to be passed by that Republican house,” Mr. Yingst said of Mr. Obama’s speech.He noted that the United States bond’s 10-year price recently touched record highs, with the yield lower than where it was in the midst of the global financial collapse, 2.055 percent in December 2008.“It is an indication that bond investors clearly see a significant slowdown in the U.S. economy,” he said.'"

"'11-09-11,'0','Privatization of the lab’s management was supposed to lead to greater efficiency and increased employment, but instead it led to cutbacks that have left the lab with around 6,800 permanent employees, down from some 9,400 in 2005.Some scientists at the lab contend that the quality of scientific research has suffered, as evidenced by a sharp drop in the number of peer-reviewed research papers produced by lab employees.Security risks, which had helped prompt the Energy Department to overhaul lab management, have remained a problem. And Livermore’s biggest project, the National Ignition Facility, a giant array of lasers designed to fuse hydrogen atoms, has been plagued by delays, cost overruns, and heath and safety concerns.“Everybody thought that with privatization we could save money and get more transparency,” said Peter Stockton, a senior investigator at the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight who has studied the national laboratories since the 1970s. “It’s done pretty much the opposite.”Bechtel officials blame inflation, increased tax obligations and a $100 million decline in federal appropriations between 2007 and 2008 for the abrupt decision to replace hiring plans with firing plans. The promised greater efficiency, they say, is still in the works.Lawyers for the management company declined to comment on the lawsuit.Few argue that the nation’s network of federal government research laboratories — and especially Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, the two flagship nuclear weapons labs — were not in need of change after the cold war ended.Livermore was founded in 1952 by the University of California to provide competition for the nuclear bomb builders at Los Alamos, which the university also managed. The lab cultivated a quasi-academic atmosphere in which basic research and the esoteric engineering needed to build nuclear weapons were considered worthy ends in themselves. Budgets were rarely an issue.But without an arms race, Livermore and Los Alamos were institutions without a mission. The federal government was still interested in the basic science, but pressure mounted for the labs to prove themselves worthy of billions in taxpayer funds.Meanwhile, university officials who oversaw the laboratories’ management contracts drew criticism for a laissez-faire approach to operational issues.“The management of the labs was, well, my God, they just had one travesty after another,” Mr. Stockton said. “The arrogance oozed from them.”Even liberal critics of Livermore’s management — including the peace activists who operate its neighborhood watchdog, Tri-Valley CAREs, one of the groups hoping to see the weapons laboratory reinvented as a civilian science center — agreed that opening up the management contract to competition was a good idea.In 2006, the Department of Energy solicited bids from contractors interested in running Livermore. It received three bids, rejected one of them, and eventually awarded the contract to Lawrence Livermore National Security L.L.C., a partnership led by Bechtel and the University of California that also includes the URS Corporation, an engineering design firm, and the Babcock & Wilcox Company, an energy and services products provider. The same group was awarded the Los Alamos management contract.Warning flags were raised at the time about the bidding process. David Hobson, an Ohio Republican who was chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, told the Energy Department in a 2006 letter that many potential competitors had declined to bid because they believed the fix was in.“Unfortunately, the Department of Energy’s national laboratories are not viewed as a competitive marketplace but as a playground for political patronage,” Mr. Hobson wrote.The department declined to comment. The new management company took over Livermore in October 2007, with the promise that it would improve efficiency, bolster security and increase the lab’s work force from 9,411 full-time employees in 2005 to as many as 11,500.But by 2009, the number of permanent full-time workers at Livermore had fallen to 6,900.Meanwhile, problems that were supposed to have been addressed by the privatization effort persisted. A 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said, for instance, that security flaws lingered at the laboratory.Bechtel’s spokesman, Jason Bohne, acknowledged that problems persisted at Livermore, but he said the management company was reducing operating costs and improving accountability through new purchasing processes, consolidation of business functions and other measures common to businesses.“Making changes to these large, complex laboratories with firmly entrenched cultures was expected to be difficult, as change often is,” Mr. Bohne said. “Some of the change is still in progress.”Since 2008, federal funds appropriated for laboratory operations have crept back up almost to the 2007 level of more than $1.2 billion, but the Livermore head count remains drastically below what it was four years ago. Lynda Seaver, a lab spokeswoman, said spending on staff and operations had fallen because of a substantial increase in management fees.Since 2008, the companies and the Department of Energy have not disclosed details of the fees paid to the management company.A union representing Livermore workers says the scientists who remain are fearful and are prevented from discussing problems with their research publicly. Under the terms of the management contract, such problems could limit performance bonuses payable to the management company.“Scientists raising any issues that would put the performance bonus at risk is strongly frowned upon,” said Jeff Colvin, a computational physicist and union representative at the laboratory.Ms. Seaver said that was not the case. “Scientists have never been restricted in what they can say,” she said. “Academic freedom is why many of them choose to work here.”Mr. Colvin told a National Academy of Sciences working group investigating the impacts of privatization on the national laboratories that the number of peer-reviewed articles published by laboratory scientists, which he says is a measure of productivity among scientists, fell from approximately 1,400 in 2005 to about 800 in 2010. The academy plans to publish a report to Congress in November.As for the laid-off employees, they lament what once had been. “It was a great place to work until the contract changed,” Mrs. Barraza said, weeping during a recent interview in her lawyers’ Oakland office as she recalled her surprise layoff. “It’s not the same place that it used to be.”'"
"'11-09-11,'0','First base was open when Chicago Cubs third baseman Aramis Ramirez, a .300 hitter, walked to the plate with runners at second and third and two outs in the ninth inning Saturday. The Mets were hanging on to a one-run lead in a game that turned from a snooze to a thriller in an instant.Mets Manager Terry Collins could have told his scattershot closer, Bobby Parnell, to walk Ramirez intentionally to face a rookie outfielder, Tony Campana. But Collins did not want to risk Parnell walking Campana to force in a run. So Parnell threw to Ramirez, and the Mets lost, 5-4.“At this level, you’ve got to trust your guys,” said Collins, who took responsibility for the loss.Ramirez punched a fastball from Parnell through the right side of the infield, driving in two runs. Parnell finished with his third blown save opportunity this month and his fifth this season, and his record fell to 3-6 after the Mets failed to score in the bottom of the ninth.Parnell sat stonily at his locker after the game, tilted back in his chair. Manny Acosta had blown a save opportunity in the ninth inning Friday against the Cubs, but the Mets came back and won, 5-4. So Collins went back to Parnell, who got Ramirez to do what he wanted, kind of.“I got a ground ball out of it,” Parnell said. “Unfortunately, it was in the hole.”He spoke about the challenge of becoming a closer. “I didn’t expect it to be easy,” he said. “I’m going to keep fighting. I’m not going to roll over, and I’m not going to give in.”'"
"'11-09-11,'0','Steven Kurutz is a reporter for The New York Times.I RECENTLY received a text message from my friend Chris. “Dude,” he wrote, “I’m texting you from Memorial Park.” Memorial Park is in Renovo, the central Pennsylvania town where we both grew up; we swam and fished there as children. Considering its origin, the text carried for us the landmark significance of the first trans-Atlantic phone call.Saying I grew up in a small town has never seemed adequate to describe Renovo’s splendid isolation. It’s set deep in a river valley, surrounded by the Allegheny Mountains and vast state forest preserves. It’s a 40-minute drive to the nearest movie theater. Renovo’s unusual geographic remoteness, amid the densely populated East Coast, was confirmed last year in the book “The Last Empty Places,” a travelogue of America’s hinterlands, which devoted several pages to the area.There were many wonderful things about growing up there, but communication with the wider world, even in the passive sense, wasn’t one of them. FM radio signals were blunted by the mountains. The Internet as we know it didn’t exist when I lived there in the 1980s and early ’90s. Visitors to the town were infrequent and vaguely unwelcome; the men who drove in from the Eastern cities each winter to hunt were “flatlanders,” in the local parlance.The kind of rural community I’m describing has difficulty retaining its young people, and Chris and I were no exception. We both moved to New York City, each working in the media, and became iPhone-wielding urbanites leading plugged-in lives.Meanwhile, our hometown remained off the grid. Whenever I visited my parents there, I felt as if I’d checked into a super-relaxing nature retreat. There was clean mountain air and a clear night sky, but, of equal significance, no one yammering on a cellphone or obsessively checking a mobile device. Myself included. Over the last decade, a small pleasure has been to drive back for a long weekend, telling friends and employers, “I’ll be unreachable on my cell.” I’m often met with a dubious look, as if “unreachable” were a word from a dead language.'"

"'11-09-11,'0','But that hotel charges a $15-a-night “resort fee.” To everybody. Now, if that fee is unavoidable, why is the Trump International considered by Priceline to be a hotel that charges $110 a night? It’s like walking into a grocery store and seeing an item priced at $20, which you can’t actually buy unless you hand over $25.Or maybe it’s worse, because at least at a grocery you can return that item to the shelves once you discover what it really costs. With Priceline, you find out about the added fees when you check in, and by then it’s too late. Priceline has already charged your credit card for your stay; the resort fee is charged by the hotel when you check out.What is going on here? Is it beyond the technology of Priceline and the hotel it lists to include mandated fees? And is it acceptable — or legal — for Priceline to require a nonrefundable payment from customers before they know the actual price they will pay for the hotel?A. It turns out that Mr. Youngerman is far from the first person to complain about a resort fee surprise after booking through Priceline. The issue was even fodder for a class-action lawsuit, filed in California in 2006 and alleging fraudulent inducement, breach of contract and an assortment of other no-no’s.So none of the questions posed by Mr. Youngerman are new to Priceline. Which might be why a spokesman for the company, Brian Ek, needed only a few hours to e-mail the Haggler a response:“We encourage hotels to include all mandatory fees (resort, safe, etc.) as part of their base rate,” Mr. Ek wrote. “To date, some do, and some don’t. Those that do charge these fees will charge them regardless of whether the room is being booked through an online travel agency like Priceline, or directly through the hotel.”Mr. Ek also noted that Priceline alerts travelers to the possibility of fees — resort and otherwise — during the “name your own price” buying process. Which is true. In a heads-up that appears before you type in your credit card data, customers are alerted about “additional hotel specific service fees or incidental charges or fees that may be charged by the hotel to the customer at checkout.”Clearly, Mr. Youngerman and many others don’t notice this warning. But it’s there, and in that previously mentioned class-action case, a judge determined that the alert was prominent enough to pass legal muster. Dismissing the lawsuit in 2010, Judge Carolyn B. Kuhl of the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles. described Priceline’s fee disclosure as “appropriately clear and conspicuous.”Fair enough. But given that some resort fees are inevitable, why is it up to a hotel to decide whether to include them in the price listed by Priceline? A system like that seems to reward hotels that essentially disguise a portion of their price by labeling it a fee and punish those that don’t.Shouldn’t Priceline just stipulate to hotels: “If you want to show up on our ‘name your price’ list, you need to give us your actual price. The whole thing. All in?”“Most of the hotels charging resort fees have told us that, operationally, they can’t bundle the resort fee into the base rate and then guarantee us that their front desk personnel won’t go ahead and charge it again at the front desk,” he wrote in a follow-up.Weird, isn’t it? The world has made some amazing advances in recent years — new vaccines, Wi-Fi, the Slanket. But a resort fee that neither takes a traveler by surprise nor is charged twice — this dream eludes us. Why? The Haggler will pose this and other questions to some resort-fee-charging hotels in our next episode.'"
"'11-09-11,'0','DURING the last week, the nation has witnessed much partisan wrangling over the economy. So it might be worth stepping back and assessing what we know and what we don’t. Let’s start with five propositions about which there is little doubt: The economy is in bad shape. Technically, the recession ended in June 2009, and since then the economy has been recovering. But it doesn’t feel that way to many Americans. Things have stopped getting worse, but they have not gotten much better. The recovery has been so meager that unemployment lingers at historically high levels. The disappointing news about job creation is closely linked to lackluster growth in G.D.P. Economists call the relationship between growth and unemployment “Okun’s Law,” after Arthur Okun, who studied it in the 1960s. In essence, Okun’s Law says that to reduce the unemployment rate, we need for gross domestic product to grow by more than its long-run average rate of about 3 percent. So far in 2011, the growth rate has been less than 1 percent. The most volatile component of G.D.P. over the business cycle is spending on investment goods. This spending category includes equipment, software, inventory accumulation, and residential and nonresidential construction. And the recent economic downturn offers this case in point about the problem: From the economy’s peak in the fourth quarter of 2007 to the recession’s official end, G.D.P. fell by only 5.1 percent, while investment spending fell by a whopping 34 percent. The subpar recovery has coincided with a historically weak investment recovery. Compare our recent experience with that of the early 1980s, when the nation last experienced a deep economic downturn in which unemployment topped 10 percent. That recession ended in the fourth quarter of 1982. In the subsequent two years, investment spending grew by a total of 54 percent. By contrast, in the first two years of this recovery, it grew by half that amount. While the sluggish housing market can explain the slow pace of residential investment, it is not the whole story. Business investment has also been weak. Over the last two years, nonresidential fixed investment has grown by only 12 percent, whereas during the two years after the 1982 recession, it grew by 27 percent. Similarly, the narrow category of spending on business equipment and software fell more than twice as much in this recession as it did in the 1982 recession, and it has been slower to recover.'"

Without corrective action the continued flow of aid may be at risk.“The recession is exceeding all projections, even the troika’s forecast,” the finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, said, referring to the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. “The projection in May was that recession would be at 3.8 percent, now we are exceeding 5 percent.”The Greek economy shrank at an annual 7.3 percent clip in the second quarter, after an 8.1 percent contraction in the first three months of 2011.Austerity measures, including higher indirect taxes and cuts in public sector pay and pensions, have hurt economic activity.'"

"'11-09-11,'0','AMONG all the luxuriant details to emerge from Kate Moss’s English wedding this summer, with its abundance of Edwardian lace and wicker, perhaps the most compelling, culturally speaking, were the children’s tepees.As it happens, the recreational tepee is nothing new to British epicures desiring a bit of eco-chic. But its budding popularity at high-end American social events signifies an intriguing if perplexing cultural moment: Long a proud symbol of the American Great Plains and its native, nomadic heritage, the tepee is reappearing as a luxury British import.“It’s been popular for about seven years now over in the U.K., where you see a lot of celebrities doing this kind of thing for very earthy-style lounges,” said Lawson Roberts, an event producer based in New York and Charleston, S.C., who has planned numerous celebrity weddings. A few months ago, Mr. Rogers received his first two American tepee requests.Perhaps, as with African-American blues music, appropriating the traditional American Indian dwelling required the historical, moral and geographical distance afforded the British. Jade Jagger set an early example with guest-room tepees at her compound in Ibiza, Spain, several years ago. Ms. Moss was said to be taken with them and in 2008 erected two on her Oxfordshire estate — to the annoyance of neighbors who complained that the tents obstructed their view of the Cotswolds hills.In June, the singer Lily Allen celebrated her honeymoon in a luxury tepee at the Glastonbury music festival (above), where tepees have a long tradition and V.I.P.’s pay about $1,500 to rent one. Hearthworks, in Glastonbury, has made tepees and the more domelike, Asian-inspired yurts for rock royalty from Roger Waters to Radiohead since 1999.Now the tepee is catching on among fashionable Americans. Julie Pryor, a Los Angeles-based event coordinator, said she constructed several custom-made tepees — with chandeliers — for a Malibu wedding after-party in June. “It’s a fun addition to the décor,” she said.'"
"'11-09-11,'0','The Detroit show’s stature was unavoidably damaged by the bankruptcies of Chrysler and General Motors, of course. Ford and G.M. had already scaled back operations, shedding their international brands — Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover, Saab and Volvo — and domestic nameplates like Hummer, Mercury, Pontiac and Saturn also disappeared.As the number of new models introduced in Detroit dwindled to a few dozen, 80 to 100 debutantes seemed to become the norm at shows in Geneva, Paris and Frankfurt. The China auto show, which alternates between Beijing and Shanghai, is also increasing in size and significance.The Americans, with the possible exception of Ford, would appear to have less to show the motoring world.While Ford has an important design study, the Evos, to introduce, Chrysler has only a high-horsepower Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 to promote in Frankfurt. G.M. will show a European version of the Chevrolet Malibu, and its German subsidiary, Opel, will offer an electric design study.That is in stark contrast to European automakers, particularly the Germans, who have so much to show this year that they outgrew the sprawling Messe Frankfurt convention center and its 3.6 million square feet of exhibition space.Audi felt compelled to build a new exhibition area — complete with its own oblong test track — in an open area outside the existing halls. The company, which is on a sales-record streak, is introducing seven new models at Frankfurt, including electrics like the A2 hatchback and city runabouts called the ""urban concept"" and ""urban concept spyder.""Audi is but one of the Volkswagen Group brands — including Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, SEAT and Skoda — that will be introducing new models or showing concepts at Frankfurt. VW itself is hoping to reclaim the magic of the original Beetle by introducing a new family of small cars called Up. VW will also suggest new directions in personal mobility with the NILS concept, a single-seat, outboard-wheel city E.V.BMW is giving an coming-out party for an entire new i-line of premium electric mobility solutions. These include the i3 compact and i8 sports cars, both previewed at press functions in July.Mercedes-Benz, which has done well with its high-powered AMG models, is planning to introduce more of them in Frankfurt: a roadster version of the hot-selling SLS and an SLK55. Also promised is a fuel-cell concept and a new B-Class compact.If it seems as though German manufacturers are on the leading edge of new, gas-free urban transportation solutions, it is due in no small part to the European Union’s strict pollution controls.“Today, all the innovation in the auto industry is coming from the German manufacturers,” said Vianney Rabhi, head of strategy for MCE-5, a French engine development company. “A little from Japan. None from the U.S.”A look at what the automakers of other countries are presenting — or not presenting — in Frankfurt is instructive.Japanese automakers seem to be in a bit of a retreat in Europe, and to some degree, they may be holding back vehicles for the Tokyo auto show in December. Nissan, Mitsubishi and Suzuki are not officially introducing vehicles here, though a souped-up Suzuki Swift Sport will be on display. Toyota is presenting new Prius variations, Lexus a new GS hybrid and F Sport model, and Mazda its new CX-5 compact crossover.The Koreans, on the other hand, are ascendant. Kia is showing a four-door coupe concept, expected to be named the Veredus; Hyundai will take the wraps off the new i30, roughly equivalent to the Elantra, and two other models.China is represented only by Chang-an, which hopes to spark European interest in a small sedan called the C201. Europe has proved to be an especially resistant market for the Chinese.Volvo, the Swedish automaker that is now Chinese-owned, is bringing a luxury sedan, the Concept Universe, that was — take note here — first shown in China last April. Sweden’s other carmaker, Saab, withdrew from the Frankfurt show in recent weeks and seems to be headed for bankruptcy.Italy is well represented by the Fiat Group, which is introducing new models from several of its brands. Among French automakers, Citroën will display the Tubik design for a vanlike creation, Renault has the Frendzy futuristic family mover and Peugeot will have its HX1 concept.Britain-based carmakers will have a surprisingly strong showing in Frankfurt with the new Aston Martin V12 Zagato, Bentley GTC, Jaguar C-X16, Land Rover Defender concept, Lotus Elise, Mini Coupe and other new models.The show opens to the public on Saturday and runs through Sunday, Sept. 25.'"
"'11-09-11,'0','A REAL estate agent recommends two mortgage brokers whom she describes as experienced in closing loans. You go to the first one, and don’t bother shopping around on rates or fees.That may or may not be a good choice. Either way, you have a right to be informed of any business relationship between the real estate agent and the mortgage broker.A federal law passed in 1974, and updated with new rules in January 2010, prohibits referral fees, sharing fees (known as “fee splitting”), or giving anything of value, in any mortgage that could end up being sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or being underwritten or guaranteed by other federal agencies. Called the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or Respa, the law also requires disclosures of affiliated or shared ownership businesses and a good-faith estimate on closing costs.“If that real estate agent refers to me, it’s a violation of Respa for me to even take that real estate agent out to lunch,” said Irene Amato, the president of the A.S.A.P. Mortgage Corporation, a mortgage broker in Cortland Manor, N.Y.When you receive a recommendation for mortgage bankers or brokers, you still need to do your homework, Ms. Amato said.

"'11-09-11,'0','IN a game of Six Degrees of Ernest Hemingway it might take a while to get to David Lee Roth, the founding frontman for the rock band Van Halen. But Papa Hemingway and Diamond Dave are united in virility at the New York Theater Workshop, where Mr. Roth’s arena-size yelps are among the atmospheric audio effects in “The Select (The Sun Also Rises),” a show based on Hemingway’s 1926 novel.“The Select,” a production of the Elevator Repair Service, closely follows Hemingway’s story of a doomed romantic triangle, set in Spain and France, involving the Americans Robert Cohn and Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley, an Englishwoman. In what has become a trademark for this literary-minded theater troupe, the cast recites parts of the book verbatim while also drolly enacting dance, drama and mayhem onstage. Named for the bar where the protagonists gather, “The Select” is part of a trilogy of theatrical adaptations of American classics that includes “The Great Gatsby” and “The Sound and the Fury.”While words matter enormously in an Elevator Repair Service production (the “Gatsby” play, “Gatz,” featured every word of the novel and ran nearly eight hours with a dinner break), so does sound — and not just voices, either. The motley assortment of sounds for “The Select” is the work of Ben Williams and Matt Tierney, members of the troupe who run audio cues from the stage while they play parts in the show. Mr. Tierney portrays Cohn; Mr. Williams plays several roles.This was an artistic choice, not a technical one; audio cues are typically run from the sound booth, well out of the audience’s line of vision. But in “The Select” the actors cue the sounds from controls concealed, behind a bar and inside a desk, on the set. Taped on the keyboards are sound labels like “pour,” “cork,” “type” and “ding”; there are also keys that signal crowd noises from a bullfight, a major motif in Hemingway’s book and in the play.Mr. Williams and Mr. Tierney cite American minimalism and contemporary classical music as inspirations. There’s a lot of drinking in “The Select,” and many a glass and bottle are dropped, but in every case the same sound of shattering is played. “For us,” Mr. Williams said, “what’s perfect is something that could be completely ridiculous or cartoonish.”Following are the unusual sound recipes from the show.WHAT YOU SEE Cohn fights Jake and their friend Mike at a bar in Pamplona.'"

"'11-09-12,'1','The campaign also includes a public relations effort, the distribution of samples in stores, cents-off coupons content on the Knorr Web site and a presence in social media like Facebook and Twitter .Knorr is Unilever’s largest single global brand and sells numerous products in the United States, among them side dishes, pasta sauces, gravies, dips, sauces and bouillon.Yet there is no huge, category-dominating product under the Knorr umbrella that contributes to making the brand a big deal among American shoppers. Unilever is hoping that Knorr Homestyle Stock, along with another new Knorr product, Knorr Roasters, a seasoning blend for chicken, will raise the brand’s profile.Knorr is a brand “that has a lot of legs, that goes across a lot of categories,” says Donna Barker, senior director of marketing for Knorr at Unilever United States in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.But “we’re not as well known as we could be in the United States,” she adds.That makes the introduction of Knorr Homestyle Stock “a very important launch for us,” Ms. Barker says. “It is the start of what we want to do with Knorr in the United States.”The campaign will be the “biggest food launch” for Unilever in this country this year, she adds, and “one of the biggest launches for Unilever” over all.Executives are optimistic about how Knorr Homestyle Stock will be received, Ms. Barker says.“It’s doing very well” in the countries in which it is already being sold, she adds. “Penetration has been good, and repeat has been better.” (By “repeat,” she means repeat purchases.)Another good sign for the new product in the United States, Ms. Barker says, is that “the response we have gotten from retailers” being asked to stock it “has been quite positive.”“We’re hoping it will bring fresh new energy to the category” of stocks and broths, she adds.Knorr first developed Homestyle Stock “because research told us consumers are looking for value and convenience in putting meals on the table,” Ms. Barker says, particularly as the economy means they are eating out less and at home more.Using the new product rather than making a stock from scratch is less time-consuming, she adds, and “results in a meal that’s tasty.”“There’s value, flexibility, convenience and ease, wrapped up in this beautiful little tub,” she adds.Mr. White was chosen for the campaign because he has been a Knorr “brand ambassador” since 2006, Ms. Barker says, and “tested exceptionally well with consumers.”The initial commercial in the campaign, which is appearing on cable channels like Bravo, Food Network and TLC, is based on a commercial that has been used in other countries to introduce the product.It has been “adapted to the United States,” Ms. Barker says, by featuring “dishes that would work” among consumers in this country who use the new stock, which comes in chicken and beef flavors. Among those dishes is one called lemon chicken primavera.The commercial begins with Mr. White in a kitchen, chopping vegetables. In a voice-over, he says: “I cook for people with the most discerning tastes. It’s high pressure.”“In my kitchen, the heart of a great dish is a great-tasting stock,” he continues. “New Knorr Homestyle Stock tastes like stock made from scratch.”“It’s concentrated,” Mr. White says, “and like a good stock has just the right ingredients, simmered to perfection.”After Mr. White makes the spiel in the commercial, he pauses and says, “The food critics are still pretty tough, though.”At that moment, he places the chicken dish he has been preparing in front of three people seated at a table in the kitchen: two boys and a girl. The boy tastes a bite, then nods his head.The spot ends with an announcer declaring: “New Knorr Homestyle Stock. Tastes like stock made from scratch.”The commercial was originally created in 2008 by the London office of JWT, part of WPP. A year later, Knorr left JWT for Lowe & Partners Worldwide, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, which has helped introduce the product to other markets.Last year, Lowe Roche, the Lowe agency in Canada, adapted the commercial for the Canadian market. This year, Lowe Roche has adapted the spot for the United States.“We’ve continued with the approach” developed by JWT, says Rebecca Morgan, managing partner for strategy at the London office of Lowe, known as DLKW Lowe.Mr. White “fits the bill because of his authenticity,” she adds, but even where he “isn’t known as a chef, he’s incredibly powerful on camera.”Mr. White appears in most new markets, although in some Knorr is using local chefs. For instance, in Spain, Jordi Cruz is the endorser.The idea is to bring to the brand a quality “we talk about” as “chefmanship,” Ms. Morgan says, “all in service of the home cook.”“It takes Knorr’s understanding of the home cook, the time-pressured cook, and brings chefmanship to bear, tips they give you for making things easy,” she adds.The final segment of the commercial is meant to duplicate what Ms. Morgan calls “the acid test, that moment when” a meal is “dished up and the kids taste it, the husband tastes it.”Knorr Homestyle Stock is about making it “more guaranteed” that their verdict will be positive, she adds.Showing Mr. White awaiting the opinion of the children tells viewers that, “yes, he’s this chef and food expert,” Ms. Morgan says, “but he’s this normal guy who knows about cooking for a family.”“At the end of the day, it’s focused on who’s using it in the kitchen,” she adds.The British version of the commercial has a slightly different ending from the American version.Instead of the announcer repeating Mr. White’s line about how Knorr Homestyle Stock replicates stock made from scratch, Mr. White’s voice is heard, praising Knorr Stock Pot as “the best thing to happen to cooking since me.”That ending was appropriate for British audiences, Ms. Morgan says, because Mr. White is well known to them for his “wry sense of humor.”But to consumers who are less familiar with him, the joke can seem “arrogant,” she adds, so it was edited out.“Horses for courses,” Ms. Morgan says, using the British expression that means what is suitable in one situation may not be in another.The agencies working on the campaign include, in addition to Lowe, Mindshare, part of WPP, for media buying; Ogilvy Public Relations, part of the Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide unit of WPP, for public relations; the Ryan Partnership, for integrated promotional and digital marketing; Story Worldwide, for digital efforts; and Integrated Marketing Services, for shopper marketing.The budget for Knorr Homestyle Stock represents “fresh new money” to advertise Knorr in the United States, Ms. Barker says, meaning the money is not being diverted from other Knorr or Unilever products.The budget will be increased in 2012, she adds, although she declines to provide totals for either this year or next.Unilever plans to spend 55 percent more to advertise all Knorr products in the United States this year than it did last year, Ms. Barker says, and “add another 25 percent” to the budget in 2012.According to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, Unilever spent $4.9 million last year to buy ads for Knorr food products in major media.The brand’s ad budget had yo-yoed in the years before that, Kantar Media reports, going from $8.1 million in 2007 to $1.1 million in 2008 and then $7.1 million in 2009.In the first quarter of this year, ad spending for Knorr was negligible, according to Kantar Media, totaling only $133,000, compared with $1.2 million in the same period of 2010.If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that runs Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times print edition and on nytimes.com.

"'11-09-12,'1','The employers said these sudden increases would be crippling and would expose them to unwinnable competition from foreign imports and from other businesses that hire illegal immigrants. The suit was joined by other Louisiana businesses that use the guest-worker program, including forestry companies, hotel and amusement park owners and sugar growers.The dispute is a microcosm of the nation’s larger debate over job creation, which has made his priority. Louisiana employers say their businesses, which give work to thousands of Americans as well as foreign migrants, are being hamstrung by proliferating federal regulations. Administration officials argue that stronger rules are needed to protect Americans’ jobs and wages in a time of high unemployment.The Louisiana lawsuit puts the Labor Department back in the middle of a running feud between employers and labor advocates over one of the few programs that bring Mexican and other foreign low-wage workers legally to the .Under the H-2B program, employers can bring in up to 66,000 nonagricultural foreign workers each year for temporary stints, after they have shown that American workers are not available and that Americans’ wages will not be adversely affected.After years of complaints from employers that the program was inefficient and cumbersome, the administration of President sought to streamline the application process, putting new regulations into effect in January 2009. Farmworker organizations sued the Labor Department to reverse them.In August 2010, a federal court in hearing one of those lawsuits ordered department officials to issue new rules on how employers should determine wages for H-2B workers. The new wage rules were issued in January, but department officials, acting under court order, announced only last month that they would go into effect Sept. 30.In a parallel effort, the Obama administration’s labor secretary, , has undertaken a wider critical review of the Bush administration rules. In March, the department published a 77-page proposal.The Labor Department has not yet issued the final broader rule.Jane Oates, an assistant secretary of labor, said the department’s proposals were intended to improve recruitment of American workers for jobs, while reinforcing protections for foreign migrants. “More of these jobs could be filled by U.S. workers if they were aware of the opportunity and paid prevailing wages,” Ms. Oates said.All the proposed changes have drawn alarmed criticism from employers but were generally praised by labor organizations. The National Guestworker Alliance, a group based in , said, “Too often employers shopping for the most exploitable work force manipulate the program,” leading to “involuntary servitude” of foreign workers.Here in Eunice, home of the Cajun Hall of Fame, Mr. Guillory said he was baffled by the department’s efforts to fix an program he never knew was broken. Persistent high unemployment in other parts of the country has not made it easier for him to find local Americans to take his jobs, which ebb and flow with the seasons.Mr. Guillory needs labor because demand for alligator meat for restaurant tables has been bolstered by a program on the History Channel, called “Swamp People,” whose heroes catch alligators in Louisiana bayous. Mr. Guillory actually gets his alligators less arduously, from nearby farms. He also peels crawfish, another seasonal crop.in 2005 had a lasting effect on the labor force in this region, he and other employers said, with many thousands of people leaving New Orleans for good. Once reconstruction started, workers headed to the city for well-paying jobs. The generous wages of the Louisiana also draw local workers away from Eunice.Many here cannot afford to lose year-round government benefits if they take seasonal, piece-rate jobs with Mr. Guillory, he and several of his full-time American employees said.But Mexican workers in the plant said they liked the work and the boss and were content with the rhythm of working for six months or so and then returning to Mexico.“Mr. Dexter gets them through the immigration, and they’re good workers,” said Elizabeth Guillory, 72, a Eunice resident (no relation to her employer) who is the floor supervisor in the plant. “I’ve been poor all my life, and I know what it is to have work.” Between Mexicans and Americans in the plant, she said, “We have good relationships.”Ms. Aguilar said she and her family were grateful to be working legally in the United States. “It feels good because not everybody has this chance,” she said.Mr. Guillory says he cannot understand why the Labor Department does not recognize his record as a fair employer. If he cannot hire guest workers, he said, the chain of lost jobs and income for local people would run back to the alligator and crawfish farmers whose crops he would not process and forward to the restaurants that serve his products.That sequence is what Louisiana employers said they hope to avert with the lawsuit.“This is a showstopper,” said Frank Randol, who runs a crawfish business and a Cajun restaurant in and represents the Crawfish Processors Alliance, one group in the suit. “In 40 years I’ve been in this business, we’ve faced just about everything,” he said, “but now we are facing our own government trying to shut us down.”'"
"'11-09-12,'1','Mr. Moynihan is also expected to note that the streamlining, which could cost 30,000 to 40,000 jobs in the next three years, would affect the executive suite, too. Last week, the company said the reshuffling did not leave room for the positions held by two well-known top executives, Sallie Krawcheck and Joe Price.Bank of America officials declined to comment on the contents of the speech on Monday. Two other top executives who are at the heart of Mr. Moynihan’s team, Bruce R. Thompson, the chief financial officer, and Mike Lyons, head of corporate strategy and planning, played critical roles in putting together the presentation.Mr. Moynihan is likely to emphasize that Bank of America is sticking with the diet he imposed on it after taking over in late 2010, while cleaning up after the acquisition binge begun by his predecessor as chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis. Mr. Moynihan is expected to detail the bank’s current capital structure, reiterating his desire to strengthen the company’s balance sheet further without having to resort to selling more stock, a major worry among Bank of America shareholders.He is also likely to emphasize that the asset sales in the third quarter have replenished capital that was consumed by the cost of settling mortgage-related litigation in the second quarter.An Aug. 10 conference call with Mr. Moynihan and investors, hosted by a Florida hedge fund manager, Bruce Berkowitz, drew a collective thumbs-down from Wall Street. Analysts say that Mr. Moynihan needs to deliver something stronger and more detailed this time to halt the slide in Bank of America’s stock price.“I’m still scratching my head over that conference call with investors in August that didn’t add a lot of value,” said Michael Mayo, an analyst with Crédit Agricole. “The C.E.O. has his back up against the wall more than it’s been in the past. Investors do want something radical to confront many radical circumstances.”Mr. Mayo says the challenge for Mr. Moynihan is that more radical solutions that might lift the stock in the short-term could prove risky in terms of the future of the company and its long-term performance. For example, spinning off its highly profitable Merrill Lynch unit might give the stock a short-term bounce but deprive the bank, the country’s largest, of a major source of profits even as margins in more traditional areas of banking like commercial lending are squeezed.And when it comes to the biggest problem facing the bank, how much it will cost to atone for the excesses associated with the housing bubble, the options are even less appetizing.Angry investors are trying to force Bank of America, and other large banks, to buy back billions of dollars worth of mortgages that have defaulted, arguing that the home loans did not conform to the original underwriting standards or were originated with little evidence of adequate assets on the part of borrowers.In other cases, investors including the federal government and the insurance giant A.I.G. want to recover tens of billions of dollars from the big banks for losses on securities they assembled from now-troubled subprime mortgages.For Bank of America, the bulk of those losses stem from the 2008 acquisition of Countrywide Financial, the subprime giant. While Mr. Moynihan has not ruled out putting the Countrywide unit into bankruptcy, such a step would make it harder for healthy divisions of the company to borrow, Mr. Kotowski of Oppenheimer warned.To make matters worse, Mr. Kotowski said, the cost of the mortgage mess has mushroomed, undermining confidence more broadly in how the bank has handled the issue.At an investor conference last November, Mr. Moynihan vowed “hand-to-hand combat” to fight these claims, but the settlements by Bank of America in January and June were a shift away from that strategy in an effort to put the litigation behind the company and resolve the resulting uncertainty.The legal onslaught has only intensified, however, with more lawsuits filed on Sept. 2 by the federal agency that oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the fears about how much the mortgage implosion will eventually cost Bank of America loom as large as ever.“The mortgage risk is everything for Bank of America,” said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura. “They can take several billion dollars out in costs, but if they lose the big numbers people are talking about in terms of mortgages, the cost cuts won’t make enough of an impact.”But Mr. Schorr said that cost cuts also signal that Bank of America could address what is within its reach to influence. “They can’t control Europe imploding or this enormous mortgage risk,” he said. “But they can try to control their operating performance.”'"
"'11-09-12,'1','Mr. Soufan recounts how he began a promising interrogation of a knowledgeable Qaeda member, Abdullah Tabarak, at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, only to be told by the military authorities that he could no longer speak to the prisoner. He later learned the prisoner was sent to Morocco and subsequently released.On another occasion, he questioned a Yemeni Qaeda operative known as al-Batar who had once carried money for Bin Laden as a dowry for the terrorist leader to marry a young Yemeni woman. The prisoner gave him some information, but said he would tell the rest of his story only if he was allowed to make a phone call to his family — a request the Pentagon denied. The interrogation was cut off, losing what Mr. Soufan regarded as a possible lead on the whereabouts of Bin Laden.After a C.I.A. officer disobeyed her bosses’ instructions and gave Mr. Soufan 45 minutes to question Ramzi Binalshibh, one of the 9/11 conspirators, and another unidentified prisoner, Mr. Soufan and his colleagues learned of a plot to bomb an oil tanker off the Yemeni port of Al Mukalla. But their memo was ignored, and a few weeks later the French tanker Limburg was attacked, killing one crew member and wounding 12 others.Mr. Soufan writes that the most consequential mistake of all was the C.I.A.’s embrace of brutal tactics for interrogation, which Mr. Soufan says were directed from the Bush White House and opposed by some C.I.A. officers. The book calls the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, the first important prisoner questioned by the C.I.A., as a fateful wrong turn toward torture and away from what he considered more effective traditional interrogation methods.A C.I.A. spokesman, Preston Golson, said the agency had ordered redactions to the book only to protect classified information, not to strike back at the author. Still, he said, “With all due respect to Mr. Soufan, the Central Intelligence Agency has a very different assessment, as you might expect, on these events.”He called “baseless” the assertion that the agency “purposely refused to share critical lead information on the 9/11 plots.” And without addressing the agency’s harsh interrogations, which were banned by President Obama in 2009, he said the C.I.A. “has significantly degraded Al Qaeda” and has produced intelligence that allowed the United States and others “countless times to save lives and disrupt plots.”Mr. Golson said the accusations contained in the book “diminish the hard work and dedication of countless C.I.A. officers who have worked tirelessly against Al Qaeda both before and after 9/11 — hard work that culminated in the operation that found Bin Laden.”Mr. Soufan said in an interview that he had the highest respect for many of the C.I.A. officers he worked with in the field. “Unfortunately, there were people in Washington making decisions out of fear,” he said. While the C.I.A.’s interrogation program produced a great deal of valuable information, he said, it did so despite the use of brutality, not because of it.“There are some politicians and bureaucrats who live in an alternate universe, who are invested in that small part of the program and defend it regardless of facts,” he said.The use of coercion prompted the F.B.I. director to ban his agents from C.I.A. interrogations, Mr. Soufan noted, meaning that some of the government’s most knowledgeable experts were unable to speak with the most important terrorists.“Professional interrogators, intelligence operatives and investigators were marginalized, and instead of tried and tested methods being used, faith was placed in E.I.T.’s,” or “enhanced interrogation techniques,” the government’s euphemism for waterboarding and other harsh methods, he writes.Mr. Soufan, who was born in Lebanon and is a native Arabic speaker, recounts interrogations that he conducted without physical abuse, building a rapport with terrorist suspects who gave extensive information about Al Qaeda. By his account, he disarmed prisoners by addressing them in their native language, using their family nicknames, surprising them with details they did not expect him to know and bringing them their favorite foods. He sparred with them over their interpretation of the Koran. He tricked them into talking by persuading them that their associates had already talked. He showed one prisoner a doctored photograph and persuaded another that a colleague was a “human polygraph” who could tell when the prisoner was lying.The book also gives an account, gathered from Qaeda operatives whom Mr. Soufan questioned at Guantánamo Bay, of Bin Laden’s conduct at his camp in Afghanistan as the 9/11 plot was carried out. The Qaeda aides described Bin Laden as “especially excitable” that day, and only a few people in his entourage knew why.As the hijacked airliners neared their targets, he asked an aide to get a Western news channel on the satellite television in his van. But the aide, Ali al-Bahlul, could not get a signal. So they turned to the radio, Mr. Soufan was told, switching between Voice of America and the BBC, and then cheering and firing their guns in the air at the first bulletin announcing that a plane had hit the World Trade Center.'"
"'11-09-12,'1','Powell, a former secretary of state, lost the toss, calling tails, but the Giants pretty much got their tails kicked after that.With Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, also in the house, it was apparent that the league had long been preparing for a difficult day around the country and especially in the cities represented by these teams.John Mara, the Giants co-owner and president, never asked the question, but he had the feeling that the schedule-makers deliberately sent his team here to link New York and Washington, the cities that were attacked a decade ago.“I just assumed it, to be honest,” he said after a week of recalling the carnage that temporarily put the unusual rash of preseason injuries sustained by his team into a healthier perspective.The pregame ceremony was tastefully done, and it was a moving sight to see the players lined up during the national anthem that was sung by the recording artist Ne-Yo, while 150 family members who lost someone in the attacks on the Pentagon and first responders in Arlington County, Va., stood by them.“I think the entire day from the time you woke up, you felt different, watching everything on television,” said Mathias Kiwanuka, a Giants linebacker, who wasn’t at all pleased with his performance or his team’s. But he said he could live with it after experiencing the pregame ceremony, which he described as worse than sad.“Heart-wrenching,” he said of seeing all the weeping victims.Kiwanuka was 18 a decade ago, a long way from the New Jersey Meadowlands. The Giants of 2001 had to look across the river at the smoking remains of the World Trade Center every day from their practice site, and Mara said he was haunted by a lasting vision of a plane parked at the gate next door early that morning after the team landed in Newark following a Monday night game in Denver.The Giants had chartered with United, and their airline representative later told Mara that he had been looking through sleepy eyes at Flight 93, which within hours would be hijacked and crash in Shanksville, Pa.More fondly, Mara remembered that his players did not have to be asked to get on boats or buses to cross the Hudson to visit hospitals or with the first responders. There was never any argument that New York-area sports teams and athletes weren’t present and accounted for as the city huddled up and tried to heal.But it must also be said that in the years after Sept. 11, the noble objective of bringing people together, of honoring civil servants and other hard-working folks, was largely forgotten.New sports facilities were constructed in the New York metropolitan area with much greater alacrity than replacements for the towers. The Giants and the Jets enacted seat-sales policies that sent people making first-responder wages scurrying for the exits. The Yankees continued to fill seventh-inning stretches with recordings of “God Bless America” but still can’t pack the overpriced seats in the lower stands of their three-year-old stadium.That, too, is part of the record, an inconvenient truth on the day the N.F.L. and the sports world at large paused to look back.Going forward, Coughlin and the Giants will view the tape of their opener and won’t like what they see. Grossman threw for 305 yards against their defense, especially picking on cornerback Aaron Ross. The Giants rushed for only 75 yards, leaving running back Ahmad Bradshaw in a silent snit.There was too much pressure on Eli Manning, who wore that unsettling glazed look after his early third-quarter pass to Hakeem Nicks was tipped, caught and returned 9 yards for a touchdown by Redskins linebacker Ryan Kerrigan. The Redskins then led by only 21-14, but the play made all the forecasts of a long and painful Giants season already seem prophetic.“Listen, it’s Week 1, not Week 16 or 17,” said Kareem McKenzie, the 32-year-old offensive tackle. “And considering what week this was and what went on before the game, that should put things in perspective even more. We missed an opportunity, but it’s hard to be demoralized about it, you know?”McKenzie parroted Coughlin, said the Giants would reconvene in North Jersey for a Week 1 film-fest and go from there. They will survive. Football games are lost. Life goes on, especially on a day that was about remembering so many lost lives.'"
"'11-09-12,'1','MEXICO CITY — Guatemalans streamed to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president, Parliament and local leaders in an election defined by rising concerns about gangs and drug cartels. Voters waiting to cast ballots from the countryside to the capital said they were motivated mostly by the fear of violent crime, and demands for a stronger government response.“There are innocent people dying in the streets, in the neighborhoods, all over the country,” said Domingo Cabinal Rodríguez, 23, an agronomist in Cotzal, a mountain town north of Guatemala City. “What we most urgently need is security.”Mr. Cabinal said he was voting for Otto Pérez Molina, a former general who was seen as the front-runner before Election Day. Mr. Pérez Molina was one of 10 presidential candidates, and it was not clear whether he would attract enough votes — 50 percent plus one vote — to win outright.Experts said that a runoff was more likely, with Mr. Pérez Molina facing either Manuel Baldizón, 41, a wealthy businessman from northern Guatemala who is running as a populist, or Eduardo Suger, 72, an academic who built a network of private universities.Each of the three candidates has pledged to strengthen security, partly by expanding and better equipping the Guatemalan military. Mr. Pérez Molina, whose campaign symbol is an iron fist, said in a recent interview that at least 400 communities had sent formal requests to the Defense Department for soldiers — a sign, he said, of how desperate Guatemalans had become.Indeed, in a country where 200,000 people were killed in a long civil war — mostly by state security forces claiming to attack Communists, according to a United Nations commission — the widely supported plans for an expanded domestic role for the military is a stunning reversal of public opinion. As recently as 2007, when Mr. Pérez Molina lost his first presidential campaign, the public was still wary of strengthening the security forces. But after a year that has included several gruesome massacres attributed to Mexican drug cartels, those views seem to be changing.'"
"'11-09-12,'1','Still, when asked if the missing players could be seen as a reasonable excuse for the team’s performance, Coach Tom Coughlin shook his head.“That’s not acceptable at all,” he said.Coughlin pointed to the Giants’ struggles on third down as a glaring deficiency, particularly in the second half. The loss of Beckum hurt because he is frequently used in third-down passing situations, but that cannot be the only explanation for the Giants’ converting 1 of 10 third-down situations.They also were stopped on a fourth-down try, with Ahmad Bradshaw being tackled for a loss on fourth-and-1 in the third quarter.“Our third downs were atrocious,” Coughlin said. He added: “I did not like the end of our game offensively at all. We didn’t move, we looked disorganized, we took a delay-of-game again. That was totally unacceptable there.”The Giants’ offense was not alone in its struggles. The defense allowed Tim Hightower to rush for 72 yards and a touchdown, and the secondary, in particular, was victimized as Rex Grossman completed 21 of 34 passes for 305 yards and 2 touchdowns. The Redskins had six receptions of 20 yards or more.“We’ve got a lot of work to do,” safety Antrel Rolle said. “No one said it was going to be easy.”Special teams had their moments for the Giants, too. After Pierre-Paul sacked Grossman and forced a fumble early in the fourth quarter, the Giants’ offense stalled and Lawrence Tynes came on to attempt a 38-yard field goal that would have cut into Washington’s 21-14 lead.Tynes’s low kick was blocked, however, by Brian Orakpo, and the Redskins promptly went on their final scoring drive, Grossman capping the game with a 4-yard touchdown pass to Jabar Gaffney. On the sideline, Coughlin waved his arm in disgust. His face was red.The game had begun with emotion of a different kind. Moments before kickoff, the teams held opposite sides of a giant American flag that stretched the length of the field during “The Star-Spangled Banner.” A video presentation commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks was played and Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state, participated in the coin toss as the Redskins’ honorary captain.Powell called tails and when the coin came up heads, the Giants deferred, putting their patchwork defense on the field for the first series of the season. The Giants’ defense held firm, at least early, forcing three-and-outs on the first two Redskins drives. They were helped, of course, by an inconsistent Washington offense led, for now, by Grossman.Coach Mike Shanahan named Grossman the starter last week after a training camp battle with John Beck, but Grossman has always struggled to inspire public confidence. Despite leading the Chicago Bears to the Super Bowl in 2006, The Chicago Sun-Times ran an editorial the next season calling for him to be benched.Criticism of Manning has never reached that level, but after throwing a league-high 25 interceptions last season, his performance is under even greater scrutiny.On Sunday, Manning was inconsistent. In the first quarter, he threw a 68-yard completion to Hakeem Nicks, who streaked down the right sideline. With the ball at the 2-yard line, Manning ran it in himself on a bootleg. It was only his fourth career rushing touchdown and his first since 2008.Manning’s day would only get worse, though, and the low point came on the first possession of the third quarter. With the score tied at 14-14, Manning dropped back from the Giants’ 18-yard line and tried to throw a screen to Nicks, who was out wide right.The ball never got there. Kerrigan, who had trampled over Giants tackle Kareem McKenzie, leaped up to tip the pass, then snatched it out of the air and returned it for a touchdown to give the Redskins a lead they would not relinquish.“I am very disappointed,” guard Chris Snee said. “This is going to sit with me tomorrow and after I watch the film, I am going to move on because I have to. There are 15 more games. There is no time to panic.”'"
"'11-09-12,'1','I ADMIT I was wary when I was approached, late in 2008, about working on a movie with the director Steven Soderbergh about a flulike pandemic. It seemed that every few years a filmmaker imagined a world in which a virus transformed humans into flesh-eating zombies, or scientists discovered and delivered the cure for a lethal infectious disease in an impossibly short period of time.Moviegoers might find fantasies like these entertaining, but for a microbe hunter like me, who spends his days trying to identify the viruses that cause dangerous diseases, the truth about the potential of global outbreaks is gripping enough.Then I discovered that Mr. Soderbergh and the screenwriter on the project, Scott Z. Burns, agreed with me. They were determined to make a movie — “Contagion,” which opened this weekend — that didn’t distort reality but did convey the risks that we all face from emerging infectious diseases.Those risks are very real — and are increasing drastically. More than three-quarters of all emerging infectious diseases originate when microbes jump from wildlife to humans. Our vulnerability to such diseases has been heightened by the growth in international travel and the globalization of food production. In addition, deforestation and urbanization continue to displace wildlife, increasing the probability that wild creatures will come in contact with domesticated animals and humans.When I was a kid, the launching of Sputnik made us aware that the United States was falling behind the Soviet Union in the race for space. Now all of us are in a battle that is potentially devastating, only it is not against another country, but against microbes. Could a movie like “Contagion” be an effective vehicle for sounding the alarm?In the hope that it would, I signed on as a paid technical consultant on the film. The first order of business was a casting call for the virus itself. Together with my team at the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, I devised the imaginary virus that wreaks havoc in the film. We used as our inspiration the Nipah virus, which in Malaysia in the late 1990s jumped from bats to pigs to humans, causing respiratory disease and encephalitis and resulting in more than 100 deaths before it was contained by quarantine.'"

"'11-09-12,'1','For decades, American fans were used to waves of fresh-faced stars, many of them teenagers: Jimmy Connors and Chris Evert in the 1970s; John McEnroe in the ’80s; Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Jim Courier, Michael Chang and Jennifer Capriati in the ’90s; Andy Roddick and the Williams sisters in the 2000s. Most were taught by private coaches.But that approach no longer seems to be working, especially now that other nations have developed comprehensive programs.“Without a system, you’re at the mercy of prodigies and private programs,” Blackman said. “The expense of developing a world-class player from age 10 to 20 is astronomical — training, traveling, equipment.”Some question the U.S.T.A.’s results. Three years into the program, only four American men and three women are ranked among the world’s top 50, and none are younger than 25.“American tennis is in the sorriest state it has ever been,” said Tim Mayotte, a former top-10 player.Mayotte resigned as the head of a program in Flushing over what he called “very openly spoken reservations” about the U.S.T.A.’s approach. In a recent interview, he criticized “antiquated coaching methods” that emphasize long hours swatting balls rather than learning technique and movement.Mayotte also said the U.S.T.A. was too insular, opportunistically luring talented players and putting them under the tutelage of inexperienced staff. He favors the approach of the French tennis federation, which identifies and supports independent coaches who do good work.The U.S.T.A. will earn an estimated $200 million from the Open this year, and a good deal of it will go into player development, as it has since 2008.“I can’t tell you the overall figure,” Blackman said. “Our regional training centers receive anywhere from $8,000 to $100,000 a year depending on the program and players. I don’t know how that compares to programs overseas.”For the juniors, first-round play began Sept. 4 on the outer courts at the National Tennis Center. A handful of spectators were sprinkled in the bleachers, including coaches, parents and other players. Yet the excitement was palpable. A good showing could lead to an invitation to a summer camp or a training session or even result in a wild-card spot in the qualifying tournament for next year’s main draw.Jack Sock, 18, who won last year’s junior Open and the national junior tournament in July in Kalamazoo, Mich., earned a wild card to this year’s Open draw. He reached the second round, losing to Andy Roddick, and won the mixed doubles title with another American teenager, 19-year-old Melanie Oudin.Another American, Bjorn Fratangelo, 18, won the junior French Open in May, the first American to capture the title since John McEnroe in 1977. Fratangelo also played in the qualifying tournament for the United States Open’s main draw but was dismissed in the first round by a brawny journeyman, Fritz Wolmarans of South Africa.“There was no way he had a chance against that guy,” said Mario Fratangelo, Bjorn’s father, who named him for his idol Bjorn Borg. “He was 6-3, big shoulders, just too strong.”That match, played on the outer courts at the National Tennis Center, possibly fed Fratangelo’s doubts about turning professional.“I’ll take the next year to turn to think it over,” he said.Yet Fratangelo receives considerable money and encouragement from the U.S.T.A. With his father as his main coach, he trains intermittently in Boca Raton.“I like playing the kids there,” said Fratangelo, who added that the coaches “put me in practices and drills.”He also does “whatever they think I should do: running, sprinting, not a lot of weights. “Fratangelo may need to rethink weight training. A shade under 6 feet, with a wiry build, he could have trouble holding his own in an increasingly physical game.On the men’s circuit, players like the 6-9 John Isner and the 6-7 Kevin Anderson are no longer exceptions, and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, at 6-2 and 200 pounds, covers the court with catlike grace. Even the women are taller. Compared with the 6-2 Maria Sharapova, Caroline Wozniacki, at 5-10, seems merely average .“Being tall is one big component,” said Mark Kovacs, a sports scientist in charge of fitness at the Boca Raton facility. “Also being extremely fast.”This makes it hard to assess players ages 11 to 14, Kovacs said, when their bodies are still forming. Clues can be found in a player’s lineage — the height of parents, grandparents, even uncles and aunts. Then the monitoring begins.“Monthly height measurements are important,” Kovacs said. “Seated-height measurements are important.”Players who enter the U.S.T.A. program are also screened for muscle imbalances and weaknesses that could hamper their progress. High-tech rackets and strings enable players to hit the ball harder and with more spin while keeping it in play.“Tennis is now all about defense,” Kovacs said. “It’s about lateral movement. And this in turn requires foot speed, along with power in the hips and core.”The dominant players of the moment are not creative shot makers like McEnroe and Roger Federer, who end points quickly, but counterpunchers like Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, highly athletic versions of the “grinders” from the past. They hit with power from all angles and wear down opponents through superior strength and speed.These attributes mattered less when Boris Becker and Chang won Grand Slam titles at 17. Today, success at such an early age is unheard of. Players peak later, sometimes in their mid-20s.This means longer, and costlier, apprenticeships. And if they top off physically, they can go the way of Oudin, a sensation at 17 at the 2009 Open who has since attained middling results in singles, or Donald Young, a prodigy at 15 who lacks the size of many other pros. Young, now 22, finally made a strong run at the United States Open, reaching the fourth round.In perhaps the most exciting first-round junior match, Alexios Halebian, a 17-year-old from Glendale, Calif., pulled out a three-set victory over fourth-seeded Thiago Moura Monteiro of Brazil.Halebian’s mother, Asmik, and his brother Edmund were among the small gathering in the bleachers, quietly applauding.“We give him all the support we can,” Asmik Halebian said. “Many years, many thousands of dollars. More than I can count.”She is a cake designer, and her husband is a baker. The couple emigrated from Armenia more than 20 years ago. She enrolled her sons in tennis lessons. Alexios’s talent soon emerged.“The teacher said one day he will be playing here,” she said, gesturing toward the court. When Alexios was 13, the Halebians entrusted him to the U.S.T.A.Now 17, he has been living at the Boca Raton center for four years, executing on-court drills, building strength through the fitness regimens devised by Kovacs and playing tournaments. He also attends school there.“We see him sometimes,”Asmik Halebian said. “At Thanksgiving and Christmas. All the time he travels. The U.S.T.A. covers his expenses. We cover ours,” including airfare to the Open.Jay Berger, the U.S.T.A.’s head men’s coach, who watched the third set, assessed Halebian’s tools.“Good serve, moves well, good intangibles,” he said. “He needs to solidify the rest of his game — his ground strokes.”A college scholarship could someday come, but Halebian chose another route: the lower rungs of the pro tour.It was clear he had developed the demeanor of a pro. After defeating Monteiro, Halebian peeled off his sweaty shirt, autographed tennis balls for a couple of fans and accepted the good-natured teasing from some star-struck teenage boys.'"
"'11-09-12,'1','“That will never change,” Brian Schottenheimer, the Jets’ offensive coordinator, said Thursday. “I don’t think we would ever want that to change.”Matt Slauson, the Jets’ left guard, says nothing demoralizes an opponent like an unstoppable running game. He pictures a vanquished opponent, battered and bruised, watching film the next day, still overwhelmed by an offense that included no trickery.“There’s a point in the game where you can just see the spark in a defensive lineman’s eye go out,” Slauson said.This is where Greene comes in. The Jets traded up 11 spots to select him out of Iowa in the third round of the 2009 N.F.L. draft. He spent his first two seasons learning from the veterans Thomas Jones and LaDainian Tomlinson, averaging 5 yards a carry in 2009, the best ever among Jets who have carried the ball at least 40 times.Ryan said entering this season that Greene, who rushed for a total of 198 yards in the Jets’ three playoff games last season, would replace Tomlinson as the Jets’ featured back, leaving Tomlinson to catch passes out of the backfield. Greene carried the ball 307 times in his last year in college.“I don’t think for one minute he’s not up to that challenge,” Ryan said Thursday.Greene said he knew what to expect. With more experience, he feels more comfortable. His fullback, John Conner, said the Jets’ defense had a hard time tackling him in live drills at practice, and Greene amassed 74 yards on 16 carries in the preseason.“Just look at him,” Conner said. “His body type is really perfect.”Conner said Greene also had the mentality to trample tacklers. Greene says he has been ready whenever the Jets have called on him, and he said he especially liked running the ball in cold weather, when defensive backs did not like colliding with him as much.“Shonn has done a great job of being patient and making great plays whenever he’s called upon,” Tomlinson said.Four years after he worked for $8 an hour in the warehouse of a furniture store in Coralville, Iowa, Greene will have his chance to carry most of the load for the Jets.Greene said he had not approached this season any differently from his first two seasons — he always prepared as if he were a starter — and he thought Tomlinson’s presence would lighten expectations on him.“More carries for me, but we still got L. T.,” Greene said.Schottenheimer said: “I think L. T. will get his touches, for sure, but again, we have complete confidence in Shonn. Here’s a guy that we made the move a couple of years ago to get. He’s had a great training camp. He’s just such a matchup problem. When he gets through the hole and he gets into the second level, he’s so big and powerful. He’s a guy that you’ll see us feed the ball a lot to.”'"
"'11-09-12,'1','On Sunday, French government officials braced for possible ratings downgrades by of ’s three largest banks, , and Crédit Agricole, whose shares were among the biggest losers last week. The biggest banks in Europe, especially in France, hold billions of euros’ worth of Greek bonds, and investors fear even a partial default by Greece would sharply diminish the value of those assets, eroding already weak capital positions.American financial institutions, typically heavy lenders to their French counterparts, have begun to pull back on these , but United States banks’ exposure to France remains substantial.Still, if the French banks are indeed downgraded, it would underscore how European officials have been unable to contain the effect of the financial crisis in Greece, despite two bailout packages totaling more than 200 billion euros ($272 billion).Frustration elsewhere in Europe has been mounting over whether Greece is sticking with the austerity goals it agreed to follow in order to qualify for the aid, and German voters in particular are wary of more handouts.Despite repeated pledges by Chancellor to keep Europe together, the cacophony of dissent within Germany has been rising. That is creating fresh doubt — justified or not — about the nation’s commitment to the euro.“The German electorate is not in the mind-set to undertake actions it sees as subsidizing less worthy nations,” said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. “As a result, the government is moving in a very isolationist way to try to establish a fortress Germany that’s economically secure despite the risks in its partners.”On Friday, a stalwart German member of the , Jürgen Stark, abruptly resigned — news that would have barely merited more than a few lines in the financial pages just a few years ago. Today, it is considered a sign of frustration within Germany about the extraordinary measures being pursued to maintain stability in the euro zone, adding to the volatility in global financial markets.“Mr. Stark’s departure could be seen by financial markets as another indication of growing disenchantment in Germany towards the euro,” Julian Callow, chief European economist at , wrote in a note to clients.Last week, Mrs. Merkel’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, warned that Greece’s European Union partners would withhold new financial aid that is needed to help pay its bills through Christmas unless the Greek government fulfilled the conditions of its first bailout.All this has generated severe discomfort in , which has watched the fallout from the with growing alarm.Secretary has been in regular contact with his European counterparts, repeatedly advising them to speak with a single voice to help reduce confusion in financial markets. After a series of discussions on Friday at a meeting of the finance ministers in , he declared that “European officials fully understand the gravity of the situation there.”Athens is expecting to receive the next allotment of 8 billion euros of aid from the 110 billion euro rescue package that Greece was awarded last year. That aid is to be supplemented by a second bailout of 109 billion euros that European leaders agreed to in July. But the second package is threatened by demands from a handful of euro zone countries, including and the , that Greece provide collateral to secure further loans.Mr. Venizelos said the government would do everything needed to close the budget shortfall. “If we can prove wrong those who are betting on Greece to fail, we will see the crisis recede,” he said.Among the measures Mr. Venizelos announced on Sunday was a temporary property tax, ranging from 50 cents to 10 euros a square meter, depending on the value of the property, which would be collected for two years. The levy will be added to electricity bills to thwart tax evasion.Mr. Venizelos also warned that the government would make further cuts to public spending. In a largely symbolic move, the government said it would withhold a month’s pay from all elected officials.“This is a battle for the country’s survival,” Prime Minister told a news conference in the northern port city of Salonika on Sunday. “These measures are the supplies we need to fight.”'"

"'11-09-13,'1','For the last few days, the runways have been awash in sporty anoraks and bright flower prints, leading you to imagine either a giant stockpile of orange mesh or those designers meeting a lot for coffee this summer. In any event, regular women might think there was no reason to watch.But on Sunday, the New York spring shows were released from their sports-mania grip — or, as the industry’s top maven, Diane Von Furstenberg, preferred to put it in her press notes, “Dawn has broken.”Ms. Von Furstenberg, who distributed little American flags to the audience at Lincoln Center as she and her creative director Yvan Mispelaere strolled down the runway, turns out to have an unsentimental view of the runway’s purpose. It isn’t art, and isn’t all blunt commerce, either. By contrast, Tommy Hilfiger’s show, also on Sunday, was an expedient romp through American prep with Pop overtones: pink and green checked separates, varsity striped sweaters, stacked-heel penny loafers that, while cheerful, were a merchandised view of the ’60s.Although normally successful designers like Ms. Von Furstenberg tend to produce a loss of perspective in writers (hence phrases like “the iconic DVF wrap dress”), her spring collection expressed the opposite assumption: the clothes were superbly grounded. She may have Mr. Mispelaere to thank for this, but it was a pleasure to see a specific palette — mainly, cool aqua and pale blue mixed with stone gray and black with a splash of marigold yellow.Another difference was a long, relaxed silhouette, with chemises or dresses with a slightly dropped waist. The appeal of such looks — for example, a sleeveless dress with a top of pale gray and a skirt in aqua-topped black — isn’t simply that they are flattering and easy to wear. Rather, it is that they’re not beholden to a trend or formula.Derek Lam also dropped hemlines and seemed to have more outfits that at least partly covered the arms. Was that an empathetic response to older customers who love his sportswear or part of a conservative shift that has maneuvered women of all ages into long-sleeve dresses and buttoned-up blouses? This collection, in any case, felt a bit too strategic, with stiff results like a hemp-colored cotton jacket (zipped to the neck again) with a peppermint skirt embroidered in a diamond pattern, or a cream lattice-stitch sweater worn with navy shantung trousers, the last five inches weirdly in white — I guess so everybody will look at your feet.The collection’s strong elements were its texture — a beautiful dress in white jersey with a white tile-embroidered bib, light crochet-knit pieces — and a new take on paisley. But, though Mr. Lam is usually good at his kind of nostalgia, this time his references to Neutra modernism and Rat Pack crooners put everything under a strange weight.Thakoon Panichgul said that a starting point for gold-striped denim pants and a turquoise poplin shirtdress overlaid with black lace was the spaghetti western, and I have no reason to doubt him.

"'11-09-13,'1','“As a Turk,” he added, “I didn’t want to be watching this situation from afar as if I was watching a football game.”He also arrived in Cairo just days after a mob’s invasion of the Israeli Embassy brought relations between Egypt and Israel to a level of tension not seen in the three decades since the Camp David accords. And his trip also comes at a moment when leaders of the Palestinian Authority are in Cairo consulting with Arab states and European diplomats in preparation for a bid to seek United Nations recognition as a state.Mr. Erdogan seemed to present himself as a spokesman for the backlash against Israel unleashed by the revolts across the region.“Israel is the West’s spoiled child,” he said, “to this day it has never executed a decision by the international community.”Asked about Turkey’s downgrade of diplomatic relations with Israel, he vowed that his nation would not back down until Israel apologized for its forces killing eight Turkish citizens and an American of Turkish decent aboard an aid flotilla seized in international waters on its way to the blockaded Gaza Strip. “Israel cannot play with our dignity,” he said.He faulted the United States, as well, for failing to demand a similar apology for the killing of its citizen in the commando raid. “One of the victims was an American from Turkish origin, but America did not protect the right of its citizen after that,” he said.Mr. Erdogan also sought to sign on to the attempts, in anticipation of a statehood bid, to broker a reconciliation between the secular Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank and the Islamist militant faction Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. Some reports had suggested that Mr. Erdogan planned to visit Gaza on his tour in a symbolic snub to the Israelis and a boost for Hamas. But in the television interview Mr. Erdogan said he preferred to visit together with Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, and his Hamas counterpart, Ismail Haniya.“I told Abbas to come with me so that we can all go together, Mahmoud Abbas, Erdogan and Ismail Haniya,” Mr. Erdogan said. “You know what he said? He said, yes I will come with you. I have hope and I am waiting for this visit.”Mr. Abbas is expected to announce soon how the Palestinian Authority will stake its claim at the United Nations, whether seeking partial membership through the General Assembly or full membership through the Security Council. If the Palestinians go to the Security Council, the United States is expected to veto the move, further straining relations with the Arab world.Mr. Erdogan, for his part, used his television appearance to promote the merits of the Turkish model of Islamist-led democratic capitalism. “Management of people, management of science and management of money,” he said, sticking to slogans rather than details. “If you do those three, you will accomplish your goal.”'"
"'11-09-13,'1','Mr. Vassilenko’s next court date is scheduled for Tuesday, and the case is expected to be postponed further.While legal minds agree that the timeline on this case is long, some lawyers, including Mr. Vassilenko’s current criminal defense lawyer, say his rights are not being violated. Rather, the delay seems to be the product of a complex case with multiple defendants and complicated issues that judges have been asked to resolve.“A small, small percentage of cases ever last this long, especially when a defendant is incarcerated and especially when we’re dealing with white-collar cases,” said Rick J. Pasacreta, who is at least the fourth lawyer to represent Mr. Vassilenko in the criminal proceeding. “It doesn’t mean that it’s not proper.”The central obstacle in Mr. Vassilenko’s case has been legal wrangling over the most serious charge he faces, enterprise corruption, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison.Prosecutors allege that Mr. Vassilenko, along with his wife and a third person, ran a money-laundering group, Western Express International, that allowed people to secretly traffic the proceeds from stolen credit card numbers and personal information. They used digital currency and an illegal check-cashing business to launder more than $35 million of ill-gotten gains, prosecutors said.Earlier in the proceedings, Mr. Vassilenko, who was also charged with scheming to defraud, conspiracy and money laundering, asked the judge to dismiss the charges against him, and on July 23, 2008, Justice Bruce Allen of State Supreme Court in Manhattan threw out the enterprise corruption charge.And this, it seems, is where the case languished. The appellate court in Manhattan did not issue its ruling until April 2011, which several lawyers said was an unusually long, though not unprecedented, time to issue a decision.The appellate court reinstated the charge, meaning the case will most likely be delayed for several more months as Mr. Vassilenko and his co-defendants appeal to have the charge thrown out again.Still, Mr. Vassilenko seems fed up. “If they have a case, they would have tried it two years ago,” he said in a brief telephone interview. “I’m saying yes, I want to plead guilty.”But when he was given the opportunity to plead guilty in 2009 to a judge’s offer of 4 to 12 years in prison, Mr. Vassilenko balked.Mr. Vassilenko said he now just wanted to be deported to Ukraine. But his bargaining position could be gone. Now that the top charge is back in the indictment, prosecutors said they were recommending an offer of 15 to 45 years in prison.Mr. Vassilenko’s case has attracted the attention of the Ukrainian Consulate in New York. Bohdan Movchan, the consul, said, “This is quite strange, five years behind bars without any verdict.”Although the consulate did not take a position on Mr. Vassilenko’s guilt or innocence, Mr. Movchan said, “We want just to deport him, then Ukrainian justice will take manage of him.”'"
"'11-09-13,'1','Tom Brady threw his first interception since October, so he was not perfect in the New England Patriots’ opener.He was close, though.Brady passed for a team-record 517 yards and 4 touchdowns, including a 99-yarder to Wes Welker, and the visiting Patriots started with a victory for the eighth consecutive season by beating the Miami Dolphins, 38-24, on Monday night.Defensive end Jared Odrick picked off a deflected pass to set up a Miami touchdown and end Brady’s N.F.L.-record streak of 358 passes without an interception. Otherwise, Brady and the Patriots picked up where they left off last season, when he threw 36 touchdown passes and his team led the league in scoring.New England gained 622 yards over all, the most in franchise history and the most allowed by Miami.The 906 net yards passing by both teams was a league record.“They made some plays on us,” Brady said. “We made a few more than them.”Brady, who completed 32 of 48 passes, became the 11th quarterback to throw for at least 500 yards. Norm Van Brocklin set the record of 554 yards in 1951; Brady’s total ranks fifth in league history.'"
"'11-09-13,'1','“Microsoft has got to make this work,” said Richard Doherty, an analyst at Envisioneering, a technology research firm.Tablets, as well as smartphones, look to be the computing devices of the future. Sales forecasts of personal computers have been scaled back in recent months, as consumers and business people have increasingly chosen tablets.Apple rules the tablet market with its iPad, while others have stumbled. Last month, Hewlett-Packard killed its TouchPad tablet, which used H.P.’s WebOS software. Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, has struggled to find buyers for its tablet, the PlayBook. Tablets running Google’s Android software have had little success so far, and ones using Microsoft’s Windows 7 operating system have had even less.“Windows 8 is Microsoft’s effort to get back in the game,” said Michael Silver, an analyst at Gartner, a research firm.Microsoft has offered glimpses of Windows 8 at a few industry conferences in recent months. The new design, Microsoft executives say, represents an ambitious rethinking of the operating system, including the chips used and the user experience. Windows 8 on a PC can be ready for use in less than 10 seconds. The look of Windows 8 borrows from Windows Phone software, the company’s new smartphone operating system, which was introduced last fall. It has large, tilelike icons that represent applications like e-mail or Facebook.Windows 8 is intended to run on both ARM chips, which now power most tablets and smartphones, and Intel microprocessors.Microsoft executives say Windows 8 has been designed so that tablet, notebook and desktop computers run equally well and share most features. For example, they speak of a “touch first” philosophy, meaning the touch features of Windows 8 work smoothly on tablets and on notebook and desktop PCs.Taps and finger swipes on a screen, Microsoft executives say, will become a routine way to open, close and browse applications, even on machines that have keyboards. Touch screens, they suggest, could help revive excitement in the PC category.Windows 8 also reflects Microsoft’s increasing commitment to open Web standards, like HTML 5, a new technology that makes it possible for developers to write applications with rich interactive features without using proprietary software controlled by individual companies. In the past, Microsoft had followed a more closed, proprietary path.Microsoft signaled its new approach in March with the release of Internet Explorer 9, a Web browser that was tailored for HTML 5. But the browser also includes software features that can take advantage of the underlying Windows operating system for faster performance.The goal, Microsoft executives say, is to reduce the skills that developers will need to write applications for Windows 8, which will run smoothly on both tablets and PCs. “Windows 8 will provide a unique industry opportunity across hardware architectures for developers,” said Steven Sinofsky, president of Microsoft’s Windows division.Web developers have been impressed with Microsoft’s new approach. “Microsoft is opening things up for Web developers,” said Emily P. Lewis, a 37-year-old Web applications designer in Albuquerque. “They had no choice. What I do isn’t a Windows thing or an Apple thing.”Microsoft, analysts note, has also made tools that so its millions of loyal developers of business software will not find their skills made obsolete by Windows 8. Microsoft, they say, is betting that its traditional developer community will be a ballast in the future and not an anchor.That approach is in contrast to Apple, which often forces developers to rewrite their applications for its new products, like the iPad, favoring innovation over stability.'"
"'11-09-13,'1','TEHRAN (AP) — Iranian regulators have frozen the assets of a businessman accused of masterminding a $2.6 billion bank fraud that is being described as the biggest financial scam in the country’s history, state media reported Monday.The investigation could also affect power struggles between Iran’s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and the nation’s ruling clerics. The suspect, who was identified by Kayhan, a hard-line newspaper, as Amir-Mansour Aria, a financier, has been linked to the so-called deviant current of Ahmadinejad allies who are facing arrest.Officials say the suspected fraud involved the use of forged documents to obtain credit at one of Iran’s top financial institutions, Bank Saderat, to purchase assets that included state-owned companies like the Khuzestan Steel Company, a major steel producer.An economic analyst based in Tehran, Saeed Leilaz, said in an interview that the scheme supposedly involved “privatization using government money.”The case “indicates a wide corruption within a wide network,” Mr. Leilaz said.After the first details of the inquiry became public last week, Mostafa Pour Mohammadi, the head of a judicial investigations unit, called it “the most unprecedented financial corruption case in the history” of Iran.Some bank employees were involved in the fraud, the intelligence minister, Heidar Moslehi, told state television on Monday. He pledged to recover the money, which the authorities estimated to be at least $2.6 billion.'"
"'11-09-13,'1','But the alliance stalled even before getting under way. In a column in the Nikkei business daily in July, Mr. Suzuki said that he had not found any technologies at Volkswagen that his company wished to adopt. Subsequently, he said that Suzuki might be open to forming alliances with other companies.Later that month, the chief financial officer of Volkswagen, Hans Dieter Pötsch, told investors that the partnership was under review because it was developing more slowly than expected.On Sunday, Volkswagen said it was serving notice to Suzuki that the Japanese automaker’s decision to buy diesel engines from another supplier would be considered an infringement of their 2009 agreement. The German company said it was giving Suzuki several weeks to remedy the infringement.The notice did not identify the supplier. Suzuki, however, recently decided to buy engines from the Italian automaker Fiat. Suzuki denied that it had broken its agreement with Volkswagen.In a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange Monday, Suzuki said that it also planned to sell its 1.49 percent stake in Volkswagen if the German automaker agreed to end the tie-up. The Suzuki board had decided at an unscheduled meeting earlier in the day that the alliance was hindering management, rather than helping it, the statement said.“Volkswagen underestimated the risks with Suzuki,” said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the Center Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen, in Germany.Volkswagen acknowledged problems with the alliance but said it wanted to continue working with Suzuki.“We are interested to continue the partnership and have no plans to sell our Suzuki stake,” Michael Brendel, a Volkswagen spokesman, said Monday.“Volkswagen considers this step regrettable, but necessary and has offered to discuss the matter with Suzuki,” Volkswagen said in a statement. “At the same time, the company stresses it still regards Suzuki as an attractive investment.”The failing partnership between Suzuki and Volkswagen would not be the first debacle involving Japanese and German automakers.In the early 2000s, Daimler bought a stake of almost 40 percent in Mitsubishi Motors, but offloaded its holdings in 2005 after a scandal involving defects dragged the Japanese carmaker into record losses.Renault of France has had better luck with Nissan Motor. Its 1999 alliance with the Japanese automaker is now in its 12th year.Volkswagen, the world’s third-largest automaker after Toyota and General Motors, based on annual sales figures for last year, forecasts that global vehicle sales will rise 5 percent this year from the 7.2 million units it sold in 2010. The company has said it aims to become the world’s largest carmaker by 2012.Suzuki sold 2.64 million cars in the 12 months ending in March 2011, almost half of those vehicles in India, where its sturdy compact cars dominate.It previously had a longstanding alliance with General Motors, which ended as the Detroit automaker’s financial situation deteriorated.'"
"'11-09-13,'1','When I was growing up in the 1940s and ’50s, I had to walk or bike many blocks to buy an ice cream cone. There were no vending machines dispensing candy and soda, and no fast-food emporiums or shopping malls with food courts. Nor were we constantly bombarded with televised commercials for prepared foods and drinks laden with calories of fats and sugars.Yes, we kids had our milk and cookies after school, but then we went out to run around and play until dark. Television watching (through my father’s business, my family acquired an early TV with a seven-inch screen) was mostly a weekend family affair, not a nightly ritual with constant noshing.Most meals were prepared and eaten at home, even when both parents worked (as mine did). Eating out was a special event. “Convenience” foods were canned fruits and vegetables, not frozen lasagna or Tater Tots. A typical breakfast was hot or cold cereal sweetened with raisins or fresh fruit, not a Pop-Tart, jelly doughnut or 500-calorie bagel with 200 calories of cream cheese.Before a mass exodus to the suburbs left hordes of Americans totally car-dependent, most people lived in cities and towns where feet served as a main means of transportation.Since 1900, the energy requirements for daily life have decreased substantially with the advent of labor-saving devices and automobiles, yet American weights remained stable until the 1970s. Dr. Boyd A. Swinburn, an obesity researcher at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia, and his co-authors in one Lancet paper call that decade the “tipping point.”As more women entered the work force, the food industry, noting a growing new market, mass-produced convenience foods with palate appeal. The foods were rich in sugar, salt and fat, substances that humans are evolutionarily programmed to crave.“Women were spending a lot less time on food preparation, but the industry figured out ways to make food more readily available for everybody,” Steven L. Gortmaker, a sociologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, said in an interview. “The industry made it easier for people to consume more calories throughout the day.”As Dr. Swinburn and his co-authors wrote, “The 1970s saw a striking rise in the quantity of refined carbohydrates and fats in the U.S. food supply, which was paralleled by a sharp increase in the available calories and the onset of the obesity epidemic. Energy intake rose because of environmental push factors, i.e., increasingly available, cheap, tasty, highly promoted obesogenic foods.”During a morning run in Ohio some years ago, I passed five fast-food and family restaurants in one long block, including one that advertised a “Texas-size breakfast” of three scrambled eggs, two fried potato cakes, a buttered croissant and a choice of three sausage links, three ounces of ham or four strips of bacon — enough to produce a Texas-size heart attack, and for $1.99. Americans are not known for resisting such temptations, especially if money is tight.The Lancet authors reported that to bring the weights of Americans back to 1978 levels, steep reductions in caloric intake are needed: about 240 calories a day less for the average person and double that amount for obese adults, whose body mass index is 35 or higher.Several coordinated, complementary policies are needed to turn the epidemic around, Dr. Gortmaker and his co-authors wrote in one report. He pointed out that four interventions worked together to drive smoking rates down to 20 percent from 40 percent.First, tobacco advertising was banned from television. Then tobacco taxes were increased, the nicotine patch became available and smoking was banned in more and more public places.Just as the decline in smoking did not happen overnight, a reduction in the rates of overweight and obesity will take a while, Dr. Gortmaker said. He emphasized the importance of taking action immediately, before the increase in life expectancy that Americans have enjoyed is reversed by obesity-caused diseases.He and his co-authors listed three of the most cost-saving and health-saving measures: a 10 percent tax on unhealthy foods and drinks (like sugar-sweetened beverages, a proposal defeated in New York State by industry pressure); more obvious nutrition labeling of packaged foods, like a red, yellow or green traffic light on package fronts; and reduced advertising of “junk foods and beverages to children.”“Marketing of food and beverages is associated with increasing obesity rates and is especially effective among children,” they wrote. Dr. Gortmaker pointed out that “very few children are born obese,” but most American children grow up in an obesogenic environment. For those who become obese by age 10 or 11, he and his co-authors said, family-based programs are needed to keep overweight from carrying over into adulthood. (In Scotland recently, authorities went so far as to remove two children from a family that had failed to control the youngsters’ girth.)“Children aged 2 to 19 consume seven trillion calories of sugar-sweetened beverages a year. It’s a $24 billion industry just for kids alone,” Dr. Gortmaker said.He called a tax on sugared drinks a “no-brainer,” noting that it could raise billions of dollars a year for cash-starved states. California, for example, could bring in $1.5 billion a year with a 1-cent-per-ounce excise tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, he said.But Dr. Gortmaker and his co-authors noted, “Almost all food policies recommended as priority actions, including front-of-pack traffic light labeling, have been heavily contested by the food industry.” Although there has been some reduction in unhealthy food advertisements on children’s television, the decline has been minimal.Also needed — and less controversial — are school-based programs to encourage healthier eating and exercise habits and to reduce television watching, the authors said. Schools that introduce healthful foods in the classroom have shown that they are more likely to be eaten in the lunchroom and at home.Of course, the rising overweight and obesity rate is not just an American problem. The effect is being seen globally, even in low- and middle-income countries. This month the United Nations General Assembly will focus on noncommunicable diseases, with the “wicked problem” (as Brian Head, a social scientist at the University of Queensland in Australia, put it) of the global obesity epidemic'"
"'11-09-13,'1','Mr. Abdel-Jalil said many in Colonel Qaddafi’s forces helped the revolution, through sabotage or collaboration with rebels or by aiming away from people they were ordered to shoot.“Let the law take the lead,” he said, before urging people in the remaining Qaddafi strongholds of Bani Walid, Surt and Sabha to rise up and join the revolution. “All of us Libyans are waiting.”Mr. Abdel-Jalil also called on Libyans to support a democratic system that honors Islam and respects the rule of law. “We will not accept any extremist ideology, on the right or the left,” Mr. Abdel-Jalil said. “We are a Muslim people, for a moderate Islam, and will stay on this road.”Early on Tuesday, however, released a report contending that the anti-Qaddafi forces had committed unlawful killings and torture during the long rebellion. The report said that the pro-Qaddafi forces had committed many more serious violations, but that supporters of the opposition “have also committed human rights abuses, in some cases amounting to war crimes, albeit on a smaller scale.”The council issued a statement acknowledging that while the vast majority of the abuses alleged in the report were committed by the Qaddafi regime, there were ""a small number of incidents"" committed by its opponents. The council condemned ""any abuses perpetrated by either side"" and said it was ""firmly committed to upholding human rights and the rule of law, both international and local — the violation of rights no longer has a place in Libya.""The report said that after the rebel forces took control of eastern Libya, angry supporters of the rebellion had “shot, hanged and otherwise killed through lynching” dozens of Qaddafi soldiers and suspected mercenaries.On Monday, Mr. Abdel-Jalil made his call for unity and moderation as tensions simmered between his government, led by Western-educated liberals, and some of the Islamist factions among the anti-Qaddafi fighters. Disparate groups are vying for positions in the interim government, which is also seeking to integrate former rebel fighters, many of whom were unemployed before the revolution, into the security forces.Mr. Abdel-Jalil took pains to everyone who had helped the revolution: the alliance whose airstrikes turned the tide of battle, rebels like a young man who had lost a leg in the fighting and joined the officials on the stage, and women, who he said had played a critical role in the revolution and would be given important positions.“Women will be ambassadors,” he said to cheers from the front of the crowd, where women and girls waved flags. “Women will be ministers.”Mr. Abdel-Jalil and other speakers praised the fighters who were from outside the capital, whose ranks include some who have complained that the groups dominating the council are not those that won the most gains on the battlefield. In a nod to those fighters, the speakers called out the cities one by one. Misurata, which held off a siege by Colonel Qaddafi’s forces, was called “the Stalingrad of Libya” by one speaker.Addressing two major complaints about Colonel Qaddafi’s rule, Mr. Abdel-Jalil assured the crowd that unemployment benefits would reliably be paid and that the country’s wealth would be safeguarded from corruption.Council officials also clarified what had been a confusing set of accounts about an attack by pro-Qaddafi forces on the Ras Lanuf oil refinery on the country’s eastern Mediterranean coast.Abdulrahman Busin, a military spokesman, said the refinery was attacked from several miles away with antiaircraft weapons, and 17 former rebel fighters who were guarding it were killed.Mr. Busin denied earlier reports that a large force had captured part of the industrial area around the refinery and killed prisoners. Fighting continued in the loyalist stronghold of Bani Walid, where anti-Qaddafi fighters said on Sunday that they had taken control of the town’s northern half. Outside Colonel Qaddafi’s hometown, Surt, fighters said Monday that loyalists had fired Grad rockets at them as they tried to push closer to the city, and that they had to pull back.'"

"'11-09-14,'1','“I fully agree,” Dr. Zetsche said. Without actually mentioning Daimler’s ill-fated 1998 acquisition of Chrysler, he added, “What we did then is the exact opposite of what we are doing now.”Instead of deciding to merge and then figuring out what to do together, Renault-Nissan and Daimler started with specific projects, among them the development of 3- and 4-cylinder motors for small cars, and a light commercial vehicle for urban areas to be introduced next year. The partnership works because it is based on pragmatic goals rather than a grand strategy dictated from above, Dr. Zetsche and Mr. Ghosn said.While there is broad agreement that conventional gasoline and diesel motors will slowly give way to new technologies, it is not clear what technologies will appeal to buyers nor how quickly those advancements will gain market share. Most companies are hedging their bets, with Daimler continuing to invest heavily in hydrogen fuel cells while also planning battery-powered cars.The uncertainty and expense is providing a powerful incentive for companies to share costs, which also increases the chances that the new technologies will be affordable to customers.“From every corner there is a challenge,” said Toru Saito, corporate vice president at Infiniti, who is in charge of the brand’s global business, in an interview Wednesday. “One company cannot meet all the requirements on its own.”“We need to be wide open,” Mr. Saito said. “It’s not easy to predict what technology will be most efficient.”For example, electric versions of the Renault Twingo and Daimler Smart will use the same motors and batteries when they come on the market in 2014. New generations of the models will also share fuel-efficient conventional engines.Those projects had been announced earlier, but on Thursday, Dr. Zetsche and Mr. Ghosn affirmed that the projects were on schedule. They also said that a new, compact Infiniti would use body and chassis components developed for Daimler’s expanding line of compact cars, as well as motors.Mr. Saito said that the motors, which are expected to come to market in 2013, would help meet growing demand in the United States for fuel-efficient engines that also provided the acceleration expected by the company’s customers.The new Infiniti compact is scheduled to arrive in 2014 and will be aimed in particular at the European market, where there is increasing demand for smaller luxury cars. Infiniti aims to increase its sales in Europe to 100,000 units annually by 2016, from only about 14,000 currently.Daimler unveiled a new incarnation this week of its Mercedes B-Class compact, which the company has redesigned to be sleeker and sportier. It will be the first of a family of five high-end compacts, including a redesigned A-Class due in 2012; a small S.U.V., and a coupe.For the first time, Daimler will export at least some of the compacts to the United States beginning in 2013. Previously, the company worried that the compacts did not fit with the premium image that Mercedes cultivated in the United States. But Daimler executives said they were more confident about the redesigned B-Class. In addition, Americans are becoming more receptive to the idea of luxury small cars.While Mercedes and Infiniti are aimed at high-end buyers, Dr. Zetsche said they had a different clientele. Renault and Nissan are volume carmakers that do not compete head on with Mercedes.“I don’t think Daimler is a competitor,” Mr. Ghosn said. The number of prospective buyers who consider both brands “is peanuts,” he said.The companies own 3 percent stakes in each other, and though Dr. Zetsche did not rule out increasing that, he said it was not a priority.In a blow to Japan, Mr. Ghosn said it was very unlikely that the new Infiniti would be manufactured there, because of the high value of the yen compared with other key currencies. A high yen would make the car too costly for consumers in export markets.'"

"'11-09-14,'1','The unit of the United States Marshals Service that manages complex assets seized in criminal cases, including that of Bernard L. Madoff, kept such shoddy records that it could not say who bought assets or how much was paid for them in 8 of the 55 sales it handled from 2005 to 2010, according to an audit released on Tuesday.Federal prosecutors in Mr. Madoff’s case were so concerned by the lack of transparency and oversight in the unit, the complex asset team, that they lost confidence in it, according to the audit, by the Justice Department’s inspector general.The report said that the auditors found significant problems in how the service managed complex assets and that those problems “increased the risk that the government could mismanage the administration and disposition of forfeited assets.” The team disposed of $136 million in seized and forfeited assets from January 2005 to August 2010.“This audit identified numerous deficiencies in the procedures the complex asset team implemented to track, safeguard, value and dispose of complicated and valuable assets,” the report said. The report added that the team’s overseer, the Asset Forfeiture Division, did not “vigorously oversee” the team.The audit was a result of a criminal investigation that began when an employee of a contractor hired to help the Marshals Service manage its assets made a number of allegations in 2010 about the team and its leader, Leonard Briskman. The agency oversees an estimated $3.8 billion in assets.'"
"'11-09-14,'1','Thiago Silva’s header during injury time Tuesday gave A.C. Milan a 2-2 tie with Barcelona, the defending champion, in a Champions League opener. Barcelona, playing at home, trailed after just 24 seconds when Alexandre Pato dashed through Barcelona’s half of the field and slid the ball under goalkeeper Victor Valdés. Lionel Messi of Barcelona set up Pedro Rodríguez’s 36th-minute goal to make the score 1-1 before David Villa curled home a long free kick in the 50th minute. Thiago tied it, 2-2, by leaping high to meet Clarence Seedorf’s corner kick. Barcelona midfielder Andrés Iniesta will miss about four weeks after injuring his leg in the game.In other games, Ivan Perisic tied the game with a late goal for host Borussia Dortmund, which tied Arsenal, 1-1. David Luiz and Juan Mata scored second-half goals as host Chelsea beat Bayer Leverkusen, 2-0.¶ The Irish striker Robbie Keane has jumped onto the list of top five earners in Major League Soccer, according to figures released by the league’s players union.

"'11-09-14,'1','A vast investigation by the Department of Homeland Security of 1.6 million cases of foreigners suspected of remaining in the United States after their visas expired has shown that more than half of them have already left the country or obtained legal immigration status, officials told Congress on Tuesday.Department officials put the remaining cases of foreigners who could still be in the country through an intensive electronic screening. About 2,000 of them were determined to be here and to pose a potential national security or public safety threat, they said.After further investigation of that group, the department opened “several hundred” new investigations of the foreigners where there was evidence of substantial risk, the officials said. The department said its priority was to detect and prosecute those high-risk immigrants.In two separate hearings, department officials reported the results of a review of all cases in the department’s files of foreigners suspected of overstaying their visas. The review was ordered in May by Secretary Janet Napolitano in advance of the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. The review yielded the first solid information about illegal immigrants in the country who first entered legally. Previously, officials relied on imprecise estimates.John D. Cohen, a senior department official for counterterrorism, told a House Homeland Security subcommittee that after running all the cases in the backlog through databases of law enforcement, border security and intelligence agencies, officials had found that 843,000 of the possible visa violators had left the country or fixed their status.The officials said the investigation showed that the Homeland Security Department had developed technology to track foreigners in the United States and determine if they had left when their visas expired. The new electronic search methods would greatly improve the ability to identify and punish those who overstay visas, they said.'"
"'11-09-14,'1','Prices of goods imported into the United States fell in August for the second time in three months as the cost of oil and food dropped, while autos stabilized, the Labor Department said Tuesday.The department said the import-price index fell 0.4 percent. The decline followed a 0.3 percent increase in July. Economists projected a 0.8 percent decrease, according to the median of 52 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Prices excluding fuel rose 0.2 percent.Slower growth in Europe and emerging economies like China, together with less demand in the United States, may restrain the cost of goods from abroad. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said last week that “transitory” influences that had pushed up some prices would wane, and that the central bank had tools to spur growth if necessary.Compared with a year earlier, import prices rose 13 percent, the report showed, down from a revised 13.8 percent increase in the 12 months ended in July.The cost of imported petroleum fell 2.1 percent from the prior month and was up 44 percent from a year earlier.'"
"'11-09-14,'1','Opponents, particularly in neighborhoods near the project site, said the issue was not Nimbyism or opposition to public housing but practical objections based on Woodstock’s small size (population about 6,000), charmingly Brigadoonish downtown and creaky infrastructure. Among their complaints: the project is too big, it is at a dangerous bend for traffic and the site should remain green space. They have picked apart particulars, like the nonprofit developer’s claim that residents would be within walking distance of a nearby “grocery store” that is actually a high-priced health food store.“It’s politically incorrect to oppose an affordable project, so you can’t even look at it,” said Robin Segal, who has a doctorate in energy policy and who moved to town two years ago in search of a garden and peace and quiet. She has since been consumed with writing a detailed blog about the project that has found errors and problems the planning process missed. “But,” she continued, “it’s the wrong project in the wrong place.”Woodstock’s lack of affordable housing has long been a public concern, though a low-level one, in a place where almost any building project — whether a cellphone tower, the expansion of a Buddhist monastery or solar panels at an animal sanctuary — can set off a nasty dispute.Finally, an affordable housing committee selected a wooded site with sensitive wetlands behind the drab strip shopping center leading into Woodstock’s downtown and, in 2003, invited the nonprofit Rural Ulster Preservation Company to design a plan.Their first proposal called for 81 housing units and a community center. That was later changed to 63 units without the center, and still later reduced to 53. The current plans, with a green design and geothermal heating and cooling, would set aside some units for households making less than 30 percent of the county’s median income of roughly $70,000 for a family of four; other units would have income ceilings of 50 percent and 60 percent of the county median.Twenty units are designed for senior citizens, half of them for those making 30 percent of the median income that would rent for $325. The most expensive family units, with three bedrooms, would rent for $890. Ten units would be set aside for artists and writers.For some, the issue is not complicated. Jackie Van Kleeck, 75, had lived her whole life in Woodstock and has been a member of Woodstock Volunteer Fire Company No. 1 for 56 years. But after her husband died three years ago, she lost his septic company to bankruptcy and then her house to foreclosure. She now rents a second-floor apartment in nearby Saugerties, though she can barely manage the 17 steps.“Woodstock, oh my God, no, I can’t afford it; I can’t come close,” she said. “What they have now is mostly city people who can afford it. Us little folks can’t. This project would be wonderful for people with no place else to go.”Proponents of the project say the town has shamefully ducked its obligations on housing.“This is a town where if someone is sick or someone’s house burns down, people will come out of the woodwork to be generous and to help,” said Susan Goldman, a longtime community volunteer. “But we don’t see people who have a need for housing as part of that community. It’s a town full of social progressives, but we don’t look at our own community the way we look at the rest of the country.”Paul Shultis Jr., chairman of the planning board that has overseen the project approval process, said Woodstock desperately needed housing for town employees and others so it could maintain some economic diversity.He said many critics were genuinely focused on environmental issues in a town where they often trump other concerns. But he was not moved by opponents’ arguments that the housing might go to outsiders and not to needy Woodstock residents.“You move from the city and buy a $1.5 million house, and you’re a Woodstocker,” he said. “You’re at 60 percent of the median income and you’re not a Woodstocker? I never got that.”Yet in Woodstock, as elsewhere, others remain unconvinced that building affordable housing should be a major priority, especially since there is less expensive real estate nearby.“It’s like if you can’t afford to live in Aspen, you don’t go to Aspen,” said Iris York, who lives near the project site. “You live where you can afford to live and where the jobs are. Go to Aspen and say, ‘What are you doing to make this affordable?’ — and they’ll laugh at you.”She and other critics said they would prefer to spend money upgrading existing substandard housing.Rather than ending the controversies, the beginning of construction has brought attention to existing legal, procedural and environmental issues, and also created new ones.Most prominent are uncertainty over water service and questions over who may have to pay for more than $100,000 in well tests before the project can connect to the water system. Also, neighbors are irate over construction they say is ignoring the project’s permit requirements, an issue that will be aired at a public hearing on Thursday.Mr. Moran, the town supervisor, said it was very unlikely the project could be derailed. Still, he said, of residents paying attention, perhaps half support it and half do not.“People on both sides just want some resolution,” he said. “But people have different ideas what a perfect resolution would be.”'"
"'11-09-14,'1','“If you look at the fundamentals over the past six months or so, there is very strong leasing, declining vacancies and positive net absorption,” said Tim Wang, a senior vice president at Clarion Partners, which last month purchased 2.8 million square feet in industrial properties from Prologis Inc. for $118 million and is looking for other acquisitions. In addition, “industrial properties are very simple to operate,” Mr. Wang said. Even large buildings typically have only one or two tenants; they are less capital-intensive because landlords do not offer tenant improvement allowances or other terms common in office leases; and the cash flow from the rent is mostly stable and predictable.Clarion Partners is one of several companies that have been increasing their industrial properties. Among the biggest buyers is Blackstone, which had meager holdings in the sector before spending $2 billion to acquire 275 industrial buildings earlier this year. Other companies that are buying aggressively include Terreno Realty Corporation, Morgan Stanley, the Cabot Group and CenterPoint Properties, according to Jones Lang LaSalle.Matrix Development Group, a private company with offices in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, recently joined with Morgan Stanley to acquire a 265,000-square-foot warehouse in Robbinsville, N.J. The company is also constructing a 150,000-square-foot industrial building for the beverage distributor Ritchie & Page, also in Robbinsville.“We are at the inflection point in the market,” said Alec Taylor, a principal of Matrix Development. “Building values are still low, but rental activity and absorption rates are improving. Now is the time to buy buildings and in six months to a year, lease them up and improve their value.”Ports also play a role in industrial real estate, and in New Jersey investors are making big bets that port business will increase. This is in part because of a $5.25 billion project to widen the Panama Canal by 2014. The widening will allow large cargo ships that currently anchor in California and use trucks or the railroad to move goods to the East Coast to sail directly to New Jersey.The widening of the canal could mean big business for Port Newark-Elizabeth, and to prepare for an influx of larger ships the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey plan to raise the Bayonne Bridge by 2016.“There is a growing need for shipping that is not showing signs of abating anytime soon,” said Dave Adams, the president of Port Newark Container Terminal, one of five major terminals at Port Newark. The terminal is positioning itself to take advantage of the improving market conditions. This summer, it extended its lease with the Port Authority, which owns the port, to 2050 and agreed to invest $500 million in capital improvements.“Our goal is to be able to double the capacity of our facility from about 650,000 shipping containers a year to 1.2 or 1.3 million,” Mr. Adams said.But while the market for larger properties, usually 300,000 square feet or more, that cater to the biggest beverage or food distributors or major retailers is showing improvement, the market for spaces of 50,000 square feet and under is still struggling.“There is a disconnect in the market,” said John Huguenard, a managing director and head of national industrial investment sales at Jones Lang LaSalle. “Entrepreneurial businesses haven’t come back the way big business has.”In Long Island, for example, where the industrial market mostly serves local businesses, “the vacancy rate is around 6.2 percent, which sounds good,” said Jack O’Connor, a principal and director of the national industrial practice group at Newmark Knight Frank in Long Island. “But that is because none of the firms track buildings under 20,000 square feet. If they looked at the smaller industrial spaces, they would see a vacancy rate of 10 percent to 11 percent.” Prices also have dropped: in 2007, smaller warehouses sold for $125 a square foot, but today the price would be closer to $75 a square foot, Mr. O’Connor said.Smaller properties are languishing, Mr. O’Connor said, “because banks aren’t lending, and people have no equity in their homes to take out second mortgages to finance new businesses.”And even the growth in the market for large industrial properties comes with cautions, experts say. “The volatility in the financial markets and the picture of a slow recovery, especially with employment, is having a guarded effect,” Mr. Kossar said. “The signs are trending in the right direction, they are all pointing toward a recovery, but it is a cautious optimism.”'"
"'11-09-14,'1','Even before the opening credits run, “The Mill & the Cross” casts a transfixing spell, as Pieter Bruegel the Elder, the great 16th-century Flemish artist, chats with his patron Nicholas Jonghelinck while he sketches studies for a large work he is preparing. Then the camera pulls back, blending scores of actors and animals with computer-generated effects, painted backdrops and location shots to restage Bruegel’s 1564 masterpiece, “The Way to Calvary.”Directed by the Polish filmmaker and video artist Lech Majewski, “The Mill & the Cross” has ambitions as sweeping as the vast canvas that Bruegel fills. In this lush and hypnotic examination of a painter’s work and the times in which he lived, Mr. Majewski presents an extended contemplation of the creative process itself.As social commentary, Bruegel’s depictions of life in Flanders were meticulously detailed. As a sly subversive, he had a gift for telling a hidden story to those who knew how to look for it.In “Calvary” he shifted the Crucifixion to his own age; it isn’t Roman soldiers marching Jesus to Golgotha, it is red-jacketed Spanish militiamen, then occupying the Low Countries and waging a brutal repression of the Protestant Reformation. But it’s not easy to find Jesus staggering beneath the crucifix he carries in the teeming crowds in the landscape; surrounding the procession are hundreds of local characters, most unaware of the world-shaking event about to occur.Adapted from a book by the art critic Michael Francis Gibson, who wrote the screenplay with Mr. Majewski, the film does not offer much plot. In its stead, it portrays — for the most part wordlessly — the daily lives and often harshly casual deaths in and around 16th-century Antwerp, episodes that often wind up in Bruegel’s panorama.'"
"'11-09-14,'1','Autumn approaches. Say hello to braising. It’s just right for an esoteric cut of veal, the brisket, actually the meatier, less fatty part of a boned breast. Spices, a touch of smoked paprika, and onions and mushrooms in a sauce with real depth give the meat what it needs alongside a graceful red wine with a piquant, smoky bite. I used free-range veal. Like most braises, this was best with patience. When done, refrigerating it overnight and reheating it only improves it. And for Rosh Hashana, consider potato pancakes alongside.1. Coarsely grind the spices. Mix with salt and rub on veal. Place veal in a bowl to fit snugly — you may have to fold it — add the garlic, thyme and wine to just about cover meat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.2. Remove veal, reserving marinade. Pat dry but leave spices clinging. Put 3 tablespoons of oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat and brown veal on both sides, about 5 minutes. Remove. Add onions to pan and lightly brown. Stir in vinegar. Remove onions and add remaining tablespoon of oil. Add mushrooms and lightly brown. Remove.3. Pour in marinade, reserving thyme. Add stock and paprika. Bring to a simmer. Return veal to pan, baste, top with reserved thyme, cover and cook on low about an hour, basting a few times. Add mushrooms and onions, and continue cooking another 20 to 30 minutes, until tender.4. Remove veal from pan. Cook sauce on high about 5 minutes to thicken it a bit. Slice veal, arrange on a platter, spoon onions and mushrooms around it, moisten with sauce and pass additional sauce on the side. Alternatively, meat and sauce can be refrigerated separately overnight and reheated the next day.'"
"'11-09-14,'1','The challenges involved were highlighted on Tuesday when Amnesty International released a report contending that anti-Qaddafi forces had committed unlawful killings and torture during the rebellion.The report said that the pro-Qaddafi forces had committed many more serious violations, but that Colonel Qaddafi’s opponents “have also committed human rights abuses, in some cases amounting to war crimes, albeit on a smaller scale.”The Transitional National Council, the new government in Libya, issued a statement on Tuesday acknowledging that there had been “a small number of incidents” committed by anti-Qaddafi fighters during the uprising.The council condemned “any abuses perpetrated by either side” and said it was “firmly committed to upholding human rights and the rule of law, both international and local — the violation of rights no longer has a place in Libya.”Dr. Aref Nayed, the chief of the council’s stabilization team, said a day before the report was released that a top priority was to seek the advice of international experts to establish Libyan institutions that could protect the human rights of both sides in the conflict.Many Libyans say they are hungry for foreign advice and help; some road signs even display the flags of the United States and other Western countries and thank them for their assistance — a rare sight in this part of the world. But Libyans are wary of the possibility that foreign interests might hijack their revolution, making even the visit of four members of the American military a delicate matter.Capt. John Kirby of the Navy, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told The Associated Press that the American service members, including two who specialize in the disposal of explosives, are not in Libya in an offensive or defensive military capacity, only to help the State Department.The Pentagon has acknowledged only once before that American service members were inside Libya during the uprising — in March, when Marines rescued an American pilot who had ejected over the country while participating in a NATO airstrike. There has been speculation that intelligence personnel were on the ground helping to target airstrikes. The White House said no ground troops would be deployed during the NATO action.Diplomatic relations soured early in Colonel Qaddafi’s rule; the United States withdrew its ambassador in 1972 and closed its embassy in 1979 after a mob burned it. That same year, the United States listed Libya as a sponsor of terrorism; in 1986, after a bombing in a Berlin disco, the United States conducted airstrikes in Libya. Relations worsened with the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988.But in 2003, relations started to normalize after Colonel Qaddafi renounced chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. A liaison office opened in 2004; it was upgraded to an embassy in 2006.While other American embassies in the region tend to be fortresslike compounds, the Libyan government had not given permission for construction, and the American diplomatic offices in Tripoli were instead in residential houses.'"
"'11-09-14,'1','Under the law, the committee must take a final vote by Nov. 23, but Mr. Elmendorf said his office would need a legislative proposal by early November to assess its impact on the deficit.Republican members of the panel said growth in federal spending — for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, in particular — was the main factor in the nation’s fiscal problems. Mr. Elmendorf said spending for the big three benefit programs would account for 12.2 percent of the gross domestic product in 2021, compared with an average of 7.2 percent in the last 40 years.The difference, 5 percent of the economy, “is a very big number,” Mr. Elmendorf said.Democrats said higher revenues were essential. Federal revenues are equivalent to 15.3 percent of the G.D.P. this year, compared with an average of 18 percent over the last 40 years, the budget office said. Under current law, which provides for the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts in 2013, revenues will grow to nearly 21 percent of the economy by 2021, it said.Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland and a member of the committee, said that without higher revenues, “you are talking about dramatic cuts in health and retirement security for America’s seniors.”But Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said, “Federal revenues have equaled or exceeded 20 percent of G.D.P. only three times: in 1944 and 1945, during World War II, and in 2000,” when the government ran a surplus.Two Republicans on the deficit reduction committee, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona and Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, said they believed that the government could save large amounts of money by rooting out fraud and waste in benefit programs.Mr. Elmendorf told lawmakers that “there is no evidence” to suggest that such antifraud efforts could produce a large share of the $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction the panel is supposed to recommend.The budget office director put a price tag on the cuts that would occur automatically if legislation originating in the committee did not become law by Jan. 15.Military spending would be cut by $454 billion over 10 years, Medicare by $123 billion and other domestic programs by more than $300 billion, he said. With these cuts, the government would have less need to borrow, so debt-service costs would be reduced by nearly $170 billion over 10 years, he added.Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and a member of the panel, said the goal of saving $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion was formidable but realistic in the larger context of federal spending. The budget office estimates that the federal government will spend $44 trillion in the coming decade.One of the most difficult questions for the panel is how to reduce the budget deficit without threatening the fragile economic recovery.Mr. Elmendorf said, “There is no inherent contradiction between using fiscal policy to support the economy today,” with tax cuts or additional spending, and “imposing fiscal restraint several years from now.”However, Republicans were skeptical of that approach. Too often, they said, the additional spending, though labeled temporary, has become permanent, as with some provisions of the economic stimulus law adopted in 2009.On one point lawmakers agreed on Tuesday.“All problems are easier to solve with a strong, growing economy,” said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania.Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, “We need growth, not just revenue and not just cuts.”'"
"'11-09-14,'1','A parliamentary panel investigating the in the British outpost of ’s media empire said on Tuesday that it would recall his son to answer more questions about the case.Committee officials said they expected to schedule the hearing for November, and a spokeswoman for Mr. Murdoch said he would comply. “James Murdoch is happy to appear in front of the committee again to answer any further questions members might have,” she said.The committee’s decision seemed likely to bring further drama to an unfolding story that has reached deep into British society, raising questions about the behavior and power of the press and the once-intimate cross-ties between the media, the political elite and the police.John Whittingdale, chairman of the House of Commons select committee investigating the scandal, told Sky News that Mr. Murdoch, 38, would be recalled after the committee had heard testimony from , a former top executive at The , and Mark Lewis, a lawyer representing individuals who were targets of the phone hacking.Mr. Hinton, who became the chairman of and publisher of The after the paper was acquired by the News Corporation, was the most senior Murdoch executive to quit as the hacking scandal unfolded this summer. Mr. Whittingdale said he expected James Murdoch to appear at the inquiry for a second hearing as part of the committee’s efforts to tie up “one or two loose ends” left after earlier testimony. In testimony last week, former News Corporation executives disputed Mr. Murdoch’s claims that he was unaware of widespread phone hacking at his papers.Another major figure in the investigation, , a former editor of the Murdoch-owned tabloid The News of the World who later served as Prime Minister ’s media director, told the committee through his lawyers last week that he would not accept an invitation to testify again because of concerns about the potential impact on a police investigation into the scandal and a separate judge-led inquiry appointed by the government. Mr. Coulson, who resigned from the prime minister’s staff in January, is one of more than a dozen former editors, reporters, lawyers and executives from the Murdoch newspapers in who have been arrested in recent months. All were released on bail after hours of intensive questioning, pending decisions by prosecutors on whether to bring charges.'"

"'11-09-15,'1','“I find the position of these agents questionable, at best,” Derek Fisher, the union president, said by telephone Wednesday evening. “If they’re so concerned about the direction of the union, then why have they not contacted me at a minimum to share these concerns?”Fisher said that dissolving the union — a tactic often referred to by legal experts as the “nuclear option” — was not necessary to get a deal done.“In our opinion, it’s always been something that, only when we truly believe that we cannot do our jobs as a players association, as a union, would we ever consider that,” Fisher said.The position of the five agents named in the reports — Arn Tellem, Jeff Schwartz, Mark Bartelstein, Dan Fegan and Bill Duffy — has been well known to union leaders. That group of agents, representing about one-third of the league’s players, has often advocated decertification in meetings with union officials. Four of the five (all but Fegan) are part of an agent advisory committee that the union consults on a regular basis.None of the agents responded to interview requests on Wednesday. So far, no agents or players have openly pushed for decertification or a shift in negotiating strategy. However, some players have expressed concern, via Twitter, that the union may be conceding too much in negotiations.Decertification is viewed by some as the best way to increase the players’ leverage at the bargaining table. By dissolving the union, players gain the right to sue the league under antitrust laws and perhaps secure an injunction to end the lockout. It is also considered a risky and expensive legal gambit, one that could take months or even years to resolve.Fisher referred to decertification as a “drastic move that leaves every player without pensions, without health care” and without the legal protections of the union.Decertifying would also force the union to withdraw the unfair-labor practice charge that it filed with the National Labor Relations Board last spring. A ruling on that charge is expected soon.If the board decides in the union’s favor, it could give the players the leverage they are seeking, without dissolving their union.Between 50 and 70 players are expected at Thursday’s meeting, which is being held here to coincide with an informal league that began play this week at the Impact Basketball training center.Between games, players expressed equal measures of hope and anxiety.“We all get antsy,” said the veteran guard Dahntay Jones. “We all want to play. We all want to get into our daily routine. But it’s not to the point where guys are being rebels and just will do anything to play.”Jones, who serves as the Indiana Pacers’ player representative — but is not part of the union’s executive board — said, “I have not seen any faction or group that’s trying to make us decertify.”Jones is represented by Bartelstein, but he distanced himself from his agent’s stance, saying, “He has his own opinion, and we have to trust in our union.”There are two ways for the union to dissolve itself. Union leaders could “disclaim interest” by sending a letter to the league indicating that they no longer represent the players. But the decertification effort that the agents are seeking requires a vote by the players. They would need signatures from 30 percent of the union’s members to put decertification on the ballot, and a simple majority to approve it.Forcing decertification would not be an easy task. Although the five agents represent about one-third of N.B.A. players, it is hardly a given that they would vote in lockstep. Other prominent agents oppose decertification and would likely push back against the effort, as would the nine players on the union’s executive board.The perception of a fractured constituency could, in itself, threaten the union’s bargaining position.“We just need to be on the same page,” said Roger Mason Jr., a member of the executive board. “We don’t need a contingent of agents pushing for one thing and then the union pushing for another.”Mason added: “I know the owners are hoping it happens, because any time there’s turmoil on one side of the negotiations, it hurts you. So I’m sure they’d love for us to have dissension among us.”Despite their gloomy public rhetoric, union officials are confident they can make a deal, having significantly narrowed the gap on the proposed revenue split.The major sticking point now is the owners’ insistence on a hard salary cap, which they contend is necessary to contain costs and promote parity. The union says there are other ways to achieve those goals — perhaps through shorter contracts, an easing of trade restrictions and greater penalties on high-payroll teams.Even after this week’s setback, union leaders insisted they can reach an accord at the bargaining table without resorting to legal maneuvers.“I feel we’re in a strong position to negotiate a fair deal,” Fisher said.'"
"'11-09-15,'1','And until the Bulldogs’ nine-win season in 2010, which was capped by a blowout of Michigan in the Gator Bowl, the university’s football image mirrored the reputation of a state that struggles with education, obesity and poverty.“Mississippi as a state is at the top of a lot of bad lists and at the bottom of a lot of good lists,” said Matthew Hughey, an assistant professor of sociology at Mississippi State.Whit Waide, who teaches in the political science department, said that he used to cringe anytime Mississippi State or Starkville was mentioned on ESPN’s “SportsCenter,” as it would inevitably be followed by a jab at the town, the university or the state.“It sounds kind of simple-minded, but what he’s done is made everyone here believe in ourselves again,” said Waide, the self-described People’s Professor, who has become a vocal advocate for the university and town. “When you do it in a place that’s used to losing, not only in athletic events, it’s important. Football in the South helps define how we think about ourselves.”Mullen has brought belief by beating rival Mississippi twice — convincingly — and by refusing to refer to that university by name, referring to it only as The School Up North. A third straight victory over the Rebels this year would mark the Bulldogs’ longest winning streak in the series since a four-game run that ended in 1942.Mississippi State’s 9-4 record last season came in the wake of eight losing seasons in the previous nine years and included victories over Georgia and Florida, the first time Mississippi State had beaten both in the same year.“Dan is a very confident person,” said the former defensive coordinator Manny Diaz, who left Mississippi State for Texas last year. “The first thing that Dan has done is that he’s instilled a belief. In the state of Mississippi, people are told from the day that they’re born that they’re second rate. And I think Dan has made them believe that doesn’t need to be the case.”After Mississippi State fell inches short of the end zone on the final play at Auburn last Saturday, falling to 1-1, Mullen said he received a flurry of hate mail questioning everything from his play calling to his competency as a coach. Two seasons ago, after a similar last-second loss to L.S.U., thousands of people lined up to comfort Mullen. He could not be happier with the hate mail.“I love that,” Mullen said. “We changed expectations. People are upset that we didn’t win.”The game Thursday against L.S.U., which Mullen jokes could “win the N.F.C. East,” epitomizes the rest of his challenge at Mississippi State, ranked 25th.Consider that Mississippi State finished No. 15 in the country last season but fifth in the SEC West. The Bulldogs have a 10-game winning streak outside the division, but Mullen is 2-9 in the division. Alabama spent much of last season ranked No. 1 in the country but did not finish in the top half of the six-team SEC West.“Honestly, I thought Alabama was the best team in the country last year and they finished fourth in the West,” Mullen said.The last coach to leave Mississippi State without being dismissed was Darrell Royal, who went to Washington in 1956 before starting a dominant run at Texas a year later.That streak could end with Mullen, whose name is already being bandied around at Georgia, where Mark Richt has been the focus of sustained criticism.Mullen’s potential departure is one reason building up the infrastructure in Starkville has been so important; Davis Wade Stadium, with a capacity of 55,000, is barely half the size of some of its SEC competitors.Athletic Director Scott Stricklin said the university would begin an $80 million stadium expansion, meaning more than $100 million will be invested in football facilities. He points to the sustained success of programs like Boise State, Texas Christian and Virginia Tech as models.“We live in a very fancy neighborhood in the SEC,” Stricklin said. “We’re never going to have the biggest house on the block. But we can have a house that’s very nice and creates a great home-field advantage.”After hearing the former Bulldogs tailback Anthony Dixon say in an interview a few years ago that he was going to “keep grinding for my State,” Waide turned it into the university’s unofficial slogan on Twitter. Adidas now makes T-shirts that say it.It will certainly be a grind for the Bulldogs to upset L.S.U., but the biggest shocker may be how in less than three years Mullen has infused optimism in a place where it has historically been missing.“Dan’s power as a football coach is that he understands the power of the symbolic and of the mind,”  Waide said. “He’s not only fighting a battle of X’s and O’s, he’s retraining us to think differently about ourselves.”'"
"'11-09-15,'1','To attract attention the alliance staged what its members called “zaps,” confrontations with people or institutions that they believed discriminated against gay people. Among other incidents, they confronted Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York, went to television studios to protest shows perceived as anti-gay, demanded gay marriage rights at the city’s marriage license bureau, and demonstrated at the taxi commission against a regulation, since abolished, requiring gay people to get a psychiatrist’s approval before they could be allowed to drive a taxi.In the fall of 1970, Mr. Evans and others showed up at the offices of Harper’s Magazine in Manhattan to protest an article it had published sharply criticizing gay people and their lifestyle. It was Mr. Evans’s idea to bring a coffee pot, doughnuts, a folding table and chairs for a civilized “tea party.” When the editor, Midge Decter, refused to print a rebuttal as the group demanded, Mr. Evans erupted.“You knew that this article would contribute to the oppression of homosexuals!” he yelled, according to the 1999 book “Out for Good: The Struggle to Build a Gay Rights Movement in America” by Dudley Clendinen, a former reporter for The New York Times, and Adam Nagourney, a current Times reporter. “You are a bigot, and you are to be held responsible for that moral and political act.”Arthur Evans was born on Oct. 12, 1942, in York, Pa. His father was a factory worker who had dropped out of elementary school, and his mother ran a beauty shop in the front room of the family house. Mr. Evans attended Brown University on a scholarship and there joined a group of self-styled “militant atheists.”He left Brown after three years and headed for Greenwich Village, having read in Life magazine that it welcomed gay people. In New York, he transferred to City College and switched his major from political science to philosophy. Graduating in 1967, he entered the doctoral program in philosophy at Columbia, where he studied ancient Greek philosophy and participated in antiwar protests.But, becoming disenchanted with academia, he withdrew from Columbia in 1972 and moved to rural Washington State, where he and a companion, calling themselves the Weird Sisters Partnership, homesteaded a small patch of forest land and lived in a tent.When the Washington experiment failed, Mr. Evans and his companion moved to San Francisco. There, he and Mr. Offen opened a Volkswagen repair business they named the Buggery.While living in Washington, Mr. Evans had spent his winters in Seattle researching the historical origins of the counterculture. After settling in San Francisco, he wrote “Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture,” a 1978 book tracing homophobic attitudes to the Middle Ages, when people accused of witchcraft, the book contended, were being persecuted in part for their sexuality, often their homosexuality.He went on to write “Critique of Patriarchal Reason” (1997), arguing that misogyny and homophobia have influenced supposedly objective fields like logic and physics.Mr. Evans is survived by his brother, Joe.Growing up, Mr. Evans had hid his sexual orientation, though he himself was aware of it at 10, he said. By November 1970, when he was scheduled to appear on “The Dick Cavett Show” with other gay leaders, he had still not told his parents that he was gay. But, by his account, he did tell them he was going to be on national television. Thrilled, they told friends and neighbors to tune in.Mr. Evans later said he regretted his handling of the matter.'"
"'11-09-15,'1','Yahoo, AOL and Microsoft, three major technology companies that have traditionally competed for digital advertising revenue, have created an unusual partnership in which they will sell ads for one another.The move represents an effort to challenge Google, which dominates the search advertising market and has increased its efforts in display advertising.The plan was discussed at a private meeting in Manhattan on Tuesday night among officials from the three companies and executives from the advertising industry, according to an agency executive who attended but who would speak only anonymously because the meeting was private. AOL, Yahoo and Microsoft declined to comment on the plan.The companies also hope to entice other online publishers to join their partnership. And by joining together and selling for one another, they hope to reduce the need for third-party ad networks that often sell some of the less desirable ad space on their sites.The plan was first reported Wednesday morning on AllThingsD, the technology Web site. The report said the deal was focused on selling remnant inventory, or the lower-priced ads that typically run at the bottom of Web pages or on secondary pages. Remnant ads are generally sold by third-party networks, usually for lower prices, and feature products or services like weight-loss or teeth-whitening treatments.'"
"'11-09-15,'1','Republicans are angry that the labor board’s acting general counsel filed a complaint against Boeing in April, asserting that the company had built an assembly line in South Carolina to retaliate against unionized workers in Washington State for engaging in numerous strikes.The National Labor Relations Act bars employers from taking any actions, including transferring an operation, in retaliation against workers for exercising their federally protected rights, including forming a union or going on strike.Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia and the House majority leader, has condemned the board’s move, calling it an “overbearing action” that discriminates against right-to-work states in the South and makes it “nearly impossible” for Boeing to add additional workers. Several Republican presidential candidates have also criticized the complaint. For example, Mitt Romney visited South Carolina last Monday and called the move “an egregious example of political payback, where the president is able to pay back unions for the hundreds of millions of dollars they put in his campaign.”The labor board is an independent agency that enforces federal laws regarding unionization and labor-management relations in the private sector. The president appoints its board members and general counsel, who is independent from the board and prosecutes cases claiming unfair labor practices.The acting general counsel, Lafe E. Solomon, has asked an administrative law judge in Seattle to order Boeing to move the production line, which will build seven planes a month, from South Carolina to Washington State. The House bill to halt action against Boring has a retroactive provision that would nullify labor board complaints, like the Boeing one, for which “final adjudication” has “not been made.”If the administrative law judge rules against Boeing, the company could appeal to the full board itself.Mr. Solomon issued a statement Wednesday, saying his decision to issue a complaint against Boeing “was based on a careful investigation and a review of the facts under longstanding federal labor law.”“The decision had absolutely nothing to do with political considerations, and there were no consultations with the White House,” he said. “Regrettably, some have chosen to insert politics into what should be a straightforward legal procedure. These continuing political attacks are baseless and unprecedented and take the focus away from where it belongs — the ongoing trial in Seattle.”To prove that Boeing’s decision to assemble the 787 Dreamliners in South Carolina was retaliation, Mr. Solomon pointed to statements by top Boeing executives saying their dismay about past strikes was motivating them to open the production line in North Charleston. But Boeing officials say low costs were the reason they located the plant in South Carolina. Some assembly began there this summer.Richard L. Trumka, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s president, said the Republican bill was “sleazy legislation,” and added, “This is sweeping legislation that would gut the National Labor Relations Act and result in serious harmful changes to workers’ rights throughout the country.”He said that if the bill passed, the labor board would be powerless to stop an employer from moving an operation to punish workers who staged a protest against unsafe conditions or sexual or racial discrimination.Republicans have voiced confidence that the bill will pass the House, which they dominate. But Bill Samuel, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s legislative director, said defeat of the bill was possible, although he said the bill’s chances were not good in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats.Representative John Kline, a Minnesota Republican and chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, has strongly backed the bill. “No government board should have the authority to dictate where a private employer can run a business,” he said.But Representative George Miller of California, the committee’s senior Democrat, said the bill was “the Outsourcers’ Bill of Rights.” He said that Republicans were pushing the bill “to change the rules midtrial on behalf of one Fortune 500 company.”Aric Newhouse, senior vice president for policy and government relations with the National Association of Manufacturers, said the action against Boeing was hurting job creation and discouraging investment in right-to-work states.'"
"'11-09-15,'1','When the annual United Nations gathering begins on Monday, the Palestinian leadership could take its statehood bid to the Security Council, where the United States has vowed to use its veto, or it could opt for a vote in the General Assembly, a more modest route that would upgrade the Palestinian representation to that of a nonmember observer state, comparable to the Holy See.Israel and the United States have tried to stop the showdown altogether, warning of dire consequences and insisting that the only way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is through direct negotiations. Israel has not spelled out the possible fallout of a vote, but some on the right have called for the suspension of the transfer of tax revenues to the Palestinian Authority, the cancellation of agreements and the annexation of territory containing Jewish settlement blocs in the West Bank. There has been talk in Washington of cutting financing as well.Yet the Palestinian public’s mood is strongly in favor of the United Nations bid, whatever the risks.“We have to do it,” said Selwa Yassin, 51, from the village of Ein Yabrud in the Ramallah district.“The consequences,” Ms. Yassin said, “cannot be worse than losing all of Palestine.”For now, the Palestinian leadership is trying to foster a festive atmosphere.In Ramallah on Tuesday, volunteers gave store owners and motorists flags emblazoned with the campaign logo “U.N. Palestine State No. 194,” a reference to the goal of becoming the 194th member of the United Nations.Those acquainted with the details say that the aspiration is to become a full-member state. “We do not want an honorary position,” said Qusai Khatib, 40, a barber and a teacher in Kalandia. “This would have no taste.”For Palestinians seeking independence, even virtual statehood would represent a new phase in a long struggle. But in a reflection of the Palestinian leadership’s conflicted attitude toward its own initiative, Mr. Abbas appears to want to shake things up abroad while avoiding any major turmoil at home.His instructions are for peaceful rallies to take place in the center of Palestinian cities, far from any friction points with the Israelis. Organizers have called on the Palestinian public to rally twice, on Sept. 21, the opening of the general debate in the United Nations General Assembly, and on Sept. 23, when Mr. Abbas is scheduled to address the forum.“From our side, no confrontations, no chaos,” Mr. Abbas told reporters in Ramallah last week. “Our instructions were very strict: Don’t go to the roadblocks, don’t make any friction with the Israelis, don’t run to the Israelis. If they come to the cities, don’t react.”The Palestinian leadership has recruited Abdallah Abu Rahma, an advocate of nonviolence and a leader of the popular resistance movement from Bilin, a West Bank village, as the coordinator of the “Palestine 194” campaign.“We are trying to be like the Arab Spring,” Mr. Abu Rahma said, “to bring large numbers of Palestinians into the squares.”The eagerness to avoid confrontation stems from the leadership’s desire to preserve its interests, according to Palestinian experts. Among other things, the Palestinian Authority, which governs in the West Bank, wants to maintain security cooperation with Israel and to prevent its rival, Hamas, the militant Islamic group that controls Gaza, from exploiting any tumult. It also wants to continue with state-building efforts and to avoid further damage to the authority’s already troubled financial situation.“This is the outcome of a bargaining process within the Palestinian leadership,” said Khalil Shikaki, a prominent Palestinian political analyst in Ramallah. “It is about how to balance between those who want to do something dramatic and those who want to maintain the status quo, however despicable the situation may be.”Mr. Shikaki added that Mr. Abbas, who is cautious by nature, also might not want to jeopardize the chance of resuming negotiations with the Israelis.Palestinians say they fear provocations by Israeli settlers. Extremists have already stepped up their activities, vandalizing two mosques in West Bank villages this month.The Israeli military says that it will tolerate Palestinian demonstrations within the confines of the cities and will generally act with restraint.Brig. Gen. Michael Edelstein, the chief officer commanding the paratroopers and infantry responsible for preserving order this month, told reporters that the army had equipped itself with a broader range of nonlethal weaponry. It has acquired more than 20 water-cannon trucks that can spray water or a foul-smelling liquid known locally as skunk; huge loudspeakers that can also emit intolerable noise to scatter protesters; and tear-gas launchers fitted with sights to allow soldiers to aim better when firing the gas canisters.Palestinians insist that the new emphasis is on peaceful resistance after two intifadas that they say achieved little. But there are concerns that encouraging people to demonstrate in the streets could unleash unpredictable forces.“People are not interested in clashes,” said Yusef Ehab, 18, who works in his family’s toy shop in downtown Ramallah. That would serve the Israelis’ interest, he said, because “Israel is interested in showing how the Palestinians are violent.”“Peacefully, peacefully,” he said, raising his hands in a sign of surrender.'"

"'11-09-15,'1','Rabbi Glanz was charged along with his brother, Menashe Glanz, 49, in a two-count criminal complaint that accuses them of theft and conspiracy for allegedly stealing Section 8 rent subsidies over 15 years, a case that city authorities called the largest individual case of tenant fraud they had ever investigated.The federal subsidies were paid for a duplex apartment at 85 Ross Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where Menashe Glanz, on applications and recertifications for low-income housing benefits, falsely claimed to live with his family, according to the complaint.But the complaint, sworn out by Mark Lintner, an investigator with the New York City Department of Investigation, says that Rabbi Glanz actually lived in the apartment with his family. The federal benefits were paid to the apartment’s owner, the United Talmudical Academy, which Menashe Glanz listed as his employer on the documents and which employed the rabbi until 2000, according to the complaint.Rabbi Glanz signed some early contracts for the subsidies on behalf of the academy, the complaint said, where he ultimately oversaw the entire school system for Satmar Yeshivas, a $35 million operation serving 8,000 children in 17 buildings.The charges were announced in a news release by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, and the city’s investigation commissioner, Rose Gill Hearn, whose agencies investigated the case together.“This kind of fraud depletes the precious taxpayer dollars available to individuals in need of housing assistance,” Ms. Gill Hearn said in the news release.The case was also investigated by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, which is prosecuting the two men.The men wore skullcaps, white shirts, and long dark coats and looks of concern on Wednesday afternoon when they appeared in front of United States Magistrate Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein. They were released on $50,000 personal recognizance bonds. Half a dozen similarly attired supporters leaned forward on benches in the gallery during the brief proceeding.The rabbi’s lawyer, Alan Vinegrad, declined to comment on the charges. Joseph Grob, Menashe Glanz’s lawyer, was not immediately available for comment. If convicted of both charges, the two men would each face a maximum of 15 years in prison.A rumpled man with a graying beard, the rabbi has for more than two decades been something of a Satmar master of ceremonies, arranging official tours of the community, based in Williamsburg; translating Yiddish for political leaders; and, in the past, charming mayors and their aides with gifts and then soliciting money and support for his sect’s priorities.'"
"'11-09-15,'1','“It was always clear that his ability to do the job would suffer substantially if and when lines of communication with Berlin and Paris broke down,” said Thomas Klau of the European Council of Foreign Relations and author of a book on the creation of the euro. “His advocacy of euro bonds damaged his relationship with Berlin and Paris and impaired his ability to function.”In an e-mailed response, Mr. Juncker’s spokesman, Guy Schuller, said Mr. Juncker intended to complete his mandate, which ends in June.“Not one single head of state or government or finance minister has ever publicly, or in the presence of Prime Minister Juncker, criticized his leadership of the Eurogroup,” he added.The European debt crisis has strained all the euro zone’s ramshackle structures and drawn attention to the need for deeper economic integration, something well beyond the ability of any single person to resolve.The chain-smoking Mr. Juncker was once one of the most influential figures in the bloc. Though the country he has led since 1995 is tiny, Mr. Juncker, who speaks fluent French and German as well as English, specialized in playing the go-between and deal maker.As head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, Mr. Juncker vied with the president of the European Central Bank for the informal title of Mr. Euro. But under his leadership, the Eurogroup has failed to emerge as a body able to broker big deals during the latest crisis, often having to refer difficult decisions to national leaders.During one meeting this year, Mr. Juncker canceled the customary news conference afterward, only to give ad hoc interviews in different languages as he left the building. Officials of the International Monetary Fund, who attended the meeting, said privately that they were shocked by the chaotic presentation.According to a senior European official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France have pulled back from the idea of trying to oust Mr. Juncker before the end of his term. “They decided the downside of doing that exceeded the upside,” he said. “No one is going after Juncker.”One complication is that, under part of the European Union’s governing treaty, the finance ministers themselves “shall elect” their own president, so imposing a candidate from outside would be difficult.An emerging proposal, however, would make the Eurogroup chief accountable to Mr. Van Rompuy. Under this plan, the agenda of euro zone finance ministers would be discussed with Mr. Van Rompuy before meetings, as would any decision to call an emergency meeting of finance ministers.That arm’s-length approach would probably suit Mr. Van Rompuy, whose position was instituted less than two years ago, since he is supposed to operate at the level of government leaders, not finance ministers.Mr. Schuller said that Mr. Juncker favored the selection of “a full-time president for the Eurogroup” after his term expires, someone who would have that “as his or her only job.” Ideas being discussed include tapping “a former finance minister or even an outstanding expert,” he added.Some within the European Commission are pressing for the economic and monetary affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn, to get the job, but that idea is likely to be resisted by Germany and France, who want to retain as much control as possible.It would also blur the lines of the structure in which the European Commission is supposed to be policing the finance ministers, ensuring that countries meet their economic objectives.All this means that the most likely solution is one that ties the head of the euro zone finance ministers group more clearly into a new line of command with Mr. Van Rompuy at the head.While Mr. Klau said he believed that more streamlined structures made sense, he warned that they were only a small element of any long-term solution for the euro.“Tinkering with the chairmanship is no alternative to devising a form of governance that operates on politically integrated or federal grounds,” he said.'"
"'11-09-15,'1','TRIPOLI, Libya — America’s top diplomat for the Middle East said on Wednesday that he was monitoring the growing influence of Islamists on the interim government that has replaced Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, but does not consider that influence a significant threat.On the first visit by a high-level United States official since the revolution that toppled Colonel Qaddafi last month, the diplomat, Jeffrey D. Feltman, said the United States shares the concerns of many Libyans about the possibility that Islamic figures here will impose their religious will on more secular leaders who are seeking to fill the leadership void.Nonetheless, said Mr. Feltman, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs: “We aren’t concerned that one group is going to dominate the aftermath of what has been a common struggle by the Libyan people to open the door to a better future.”He added: “I think it is something that everybody is watching; first of all, the Libyan people themselves are talking about this.”But based on what he has heard from Libyans across the political spectrum, Mr. Feltman said, there is “a shared desire for a different type of Libya that is going to have to take into account a lot of political trends.”Mr. Feltman was in Tripoli to speak with officials of the Transitional National Council, the interim government, while an advance team of diplomats began work to reopen the American Embassy. The embassy was among the many foreign outposts here that were closed in the early days of the conflict, which began in March and escalated into the most violent of the uprisings convulsing the Middle East.'"
"'11-09-15,'1','Retail sales in the United States unexpectedly stagnated in August, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, as a lack of employment and limited income growth restrained demand.The unchanged reading followed a 0.3 percent gain for July that was smaller than previously estimated, the department said. Prices paid by producers were also unchanged in August, according to the Labor Department, while so-called core costs that exclude food and fuel rose less than forecast.The dim outlook for household spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy, will make it hard for the two-year-old recovery to gain speed, giving the Federal Reserve reason to take additional steps to spur growth.“Consumers are being more cautious given all the economic headwinds,” said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. “Policy makers have to be focused on growth because growth seems to have come close to stalling in August.”Another report from the Commerce Department showed inventories rose less than forecast in July, indicating companies were bracing for a slowdown in demand. The 0.4 percent increase in stockpiles matched the revised gain in June, which was larger than initially estimated. The median projection in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.5 percent advance. Sales climbed 0.7 percent in July, the most since March.'"

"'11-09-16,'1','His foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, has a very different worldview. Mr. Lieberman’s open disdain for European leaders and diplomats is not a failure of diplomacy; he is a shrewd man, who first and foremost seeks to cultivate an image of a strong leader for his right-wing constituency. He believes that the West’s hegemony has come to an end, and that the future lies with autocratic governments like those ruling Russia and China. Hence he believes that Israel has no reason to pander to the West’s values.To him, liberal democracy represents weakness and he contends that Israel should evolve into a stronger state with less individual freedom. At the same time, he is completely secular: his constituency is primarily of Russian origin, and many of its members are not accepted as Jewish by Israel’s Orthodox rabbinical establishment.The national-religious parties in the governing coalition, meanwhile, are based on the belief that the Jewish people have a God-given right to what they call the Greater Land of Israel. In the long run, they want Israel to be a theocracy based on biblical law. Their participation in the democratic game is based on the prediction that Israel’s demography will inevitably lead to an Orthodox Jewish majority, and that they simply need to make sure that Israel doesn’t give up the West Bank before they rule the country.The ultra-Orthodox parties, Shas and Yahadut Hatorah, also want Israel to become a theocracy in the long run. Until a decade ago, they did not necessarily claim that Israel should hold on to the occupied territories, but they realized that their electorate is right-leaning, and they need space for the rapidly expanding families of their constituency. They see liberal elites as their primary enemies.The paradox, of course, is that Mr. Lieberman and the religious parties are on opposing ends of the spectrum in other ways. Mr. Lieberman wants a secular state; the religious parties want a theocracy. What unites them is that, for completely different reasons, they have no investment in the values of liberal democracy, which are one of the major stumbling blocks for Israel’s annexation of the West Bank. As Israeli liberals have repeated ad nauseam, such annexation will either lead to a binational state without a Jewish majority, or to an apartheid regime.The coalition partners have found a modus vivendi primarily by uniting in their hatred for the institutions that uphold liberal democratic values: Israel’s Supreme Court, its largely liberal academic community and its human rights organizations.Israel’s recent falling out with Turkey is just the latest example: Mr. Lieberman made it impossible for Mr. Netanyahu to apologize for the killing of nine people by Israeli commandos on the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara last year by insisting that it would undermine Israel’s national pride. When Turkey retaliated with trade sanctions and threats of an increased naval presence in the Mediterranean, Mr. Lieberman called on Israel to support Kurdish militants. Mr. Lieberman keeps upping the ante for being a patriotic Israeli, pulling Mr. Netanyahu along with him.The staying power of Israel’s governing coalition is primarily the result of the trauma Israelis sustained during the second Palestinian intifada and subsequent rocket attacks. Israelis have trouble trusting anybody but a hard-liner for fear that, once again, they will become targets of terror attacks.Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition may seem incoherent in its core values, but it has created a potentially explosive mix that has brought considerable damage to Israel, pushing it into unprecedented isolation that is only likely to deepen if a sizable majority of the United Nations General Assembly recognizes Palestine as a state later this month. This would be especially challenging when relations are already strained with historic regional allies like Egypt and Turkey.The irony is that Mr. Netanyahu himself is not opposed to liberal democracy. But the only way for him to prevent an independent Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders is to hold his right-wing coalition together.Mr. Lieberman has outflanked him and challenged his leadership of the Israeli right. Mr. Netanyahu needs to keep up with the right-wing Joneses and show that he is no less of a strong leader. The only common denominator of his major coalition partners is enmity to the core values of liberal democracy, and, for lack of choice, he has so far pandered to their wishes.'"

"'11-09-16,'1','Lee, a senior, followed up that touchdown pass with a cringe-worthy interception that recalled his brutal freshman year, in which he threw 16 interceptions and 8 touchdown passes. But he strung together a solid night on the road in the Southeastern Conference, completing 21 of 27 passes for 213 yards.“We counted on him,” Miles said of Lee. “He came through.”While L.S.U. will face tougher defenses, rowdier environments and higher stakes, Lee did not try to do too much and limited his mistakes. If the season is a series of steps, this will prove a big one. And Lee’s comfort level will only increase when the star receiver Russell Shepard returns for next week’s game at West Virginia, giving the Tigers an elite target to take the pressure off Randle and balance the passing game.L.S.U. won the 2007 national title with the unspectacular Matt Flynn at quarterback; the real star of that team was the monstrous defensive tackle Glenn Dorsey. L.S.U.’s front seven this year has emerged as similarly threatening, with a Tigers defensive lineman greeting Bulldogs quarterback Chris Relf behind the line of scrimmage on seemingly every snap. Mississippi State gained just 193 yards, including only 17 in the third quarter after the Tigers adjusted to Relf’s runs up the middle.“In this league, it’s hard to say that’s the best defense we’ve seen,” Mississippi State Coach Dan Mullen said of a defense that had 15 tackles for a loss. “But the way they’re playing, they’re playing like the No. 1 team in the country to me. There’s certainly not anyone playing better than them right now.”Lee’s admirable performance came against a porous Mississippi State defense, which gave up 41 points to Auburn last week. The Louisiana State offense, especially without the starting quarterback Jordan Jefferson and Shepard, is simplistic and predictable. L.S.U. feasted on heavy doses of short and powerful runs by tailback Spencer Ware, who finished with 107 yards and countless bruises on 22 carries.L.S.U. fans should get used to the sight of kicker Drew Alleman, a junior who provided the Tigers’ first 9 points on field goals of 21, 42 and 41 yards, and later added a 29-yarder. L.S.U. has the defense and special teams to set itself in adequate field position, but it lacks the offensive consistency to finish drives.Mississippi State’s fans began staking out their tailgating spots more than 24 hours before kickoff. With classes canceled on Thursday, the day turned into an all-day party in preparation for one of the biggest games in Starkville in recent years. The din of ringing cowbells echoed through Oktibbeha County, but the relentless support could not move an impotent offense.But as far as the program has come under Mullen, Mississippi State still cannot turn the corner in the SEC West, which may be the most difficult division in college sports. Mullen has a 10-game winning streak in games outside the West and a 2-10 record within it.Louisiana State will head to another heated environment Sept. 24, when it will face a largely untested Mountaineers team in Morgantown. (West Virginia plays at Maryland on Saturday.)If L.S.U.’s recent history is any indication, expect plenty of action, drama and suspense. As the Tigers’ offense inches forward, questions of consistency will not go away.'"

"'11-09-16,'1','The stadium upgrade, and the recently completed $150 million Student Athlete High Performance Center, are the handiwork of Cal’s intercollegiate athletics department, which has struggled financially for years. According to a report by the university’s academic senate, the department required almost $9 million annually from the general campus fund from 1999 to 2009. The figure for last year was $10.5 million, and Cal has vowed to reduce it to $5 million by 2014.The stadium financing plan was created in 2008, when the football team was on a roll under Coach Jeff Tedford. The U.C. Regents had ordered the campus either to fix the stadium — it sits on top of the Hayward fault in a ravine above the Berkeley campus — or to find a new place for the Bears to play.Cal contracted with Stadium Capital Financing Group of Chicago, an affiliate of Morgan Stanley, and developed the E.S.P. seat-selling plan The goal was to raise $250 million, with much of the money coming up front. Some of the money would go into an endowment, which would provide lasting support for all Cal athletic programs (budget cuts last year nearly killed off five sports, including the baseball program).“The fans and donors we’re talking about have a bigger picture in mind: to create this endowment,” said Sandy Barbour, the Cal athletic director.The seats are a key part of the stadium renovation, which also includes wider concourses and seats, more concessions and restrooms, and improved wheelchair access. The extra-plush E.S.P. seats are outdoors, and there are three levels, each with its own amenities and price tag. (Cal alumni had made it clear in surveys that they did not want to be separated from the rest of the fans in enclosed luxury boxes.) E.S.P. participants also receive parking passes, and access to the stadium and clubs on nongame days.Ms. Barbour said that E.S.P. had “altered” its financial aspirations, but that most sales are likely to come this year and that she still has faith that all the seats will be sold.“Given the year we went through, in the last 12 to 18 months, frankly I’m very pleased with where we are,” Ms. Barbour said. “Is it a little behind what our very ambitious projections were? Yeah, there’s no doubt about that.”A recent analysis by Cal Moore, an emeritus professor of math, projects that E.S.P. will raise more than $300 million by 2052. Supporters also note that E.S.P. is a long-term project, and only one piece of a financial puzzle that includes ticket revenue, naming rights, corporate sponsorships, and tens of millions of dollars in TV revenue from the new Pac-12 media contract.But skeptics, including vocal members of the Cal faculty, are not convinced.Brian Barsky, a computer science professor and longtime critic of athletic department spending, calculated in January that 82 percent of E.S.P. participants had opted for the 30-year payment plan, and that most opted for the cheaper seats.“Although nothing is impossible,” Mr. Barsky wrote in an op-ed article in the student newspaper, The Daily Californian, the athletic department “provides no convincing argument that it will succeed in raising so much more money in the near future.”The low percentage of donors who have paid up front worries Mr. Noll, the Stanford professor.“That strikes me as a warning sign,” he said. “People have bought the right to have tickets for a few years, but they haven’t really bought into the endowment part.”Mr. Noll said he believes the E.S.P. will fall $50 million to $100 million short of plan.Rich Magid, the chief executive of Stadium Capital, said the bad economy and a bad public relations year for the athletic department made it the “worst possible time” to roll out the program. Still, Mr. Magid said, “we’re seeing a level that we’re extremely comfortable with, to be in an area of 50 percent this far in advance.”But another university may serve as a warning of how the program could go wrong. In 2009, the University of Kansas embarked on a similar plan — selling 3,000 club seats to high-end donors to finance a stadium upgrade. Fans could pay $30,000 to own a seat for five years or $105,000 to own a seat for 30 years, with the goal of raising about $74 million.But the plan raised roughly $5 million before being scrapped in 2010, according to Jim Marchiony, associate athletic director at Kansas. He blamed bad timing, but he also said fans were not willing to spend that kind of money for football tickets.“Most of the fans we talked to were really looking for options that were not as ambitious” as those prices, Mr. Marchiony said.Mr. Magid said there is a big difference between the Cal and Kansas programs, namely that Kansas gave itself a much shorter time frame to recoup costs. He also suggested that Kansas had not done enough work in surveying its donors“We spent a year-plus on the Berkeley side really making sure we had proper input and designed it properly,” Mr. Magid said.“Intercollegiate athletics at U.C. Berkeley never comes anywhere close to breaking even each year, with ever-increasing annual spending as it is locked in a financial arms race with competing schools,” he said. “On what basis should we assume that this will turn around?”'"
"'11-09-16,'1','The Department of Energy has guaranteed loans of nearly $2.5 billion to companies that will make electric cars, a product whose market size is uncertain. Some analysts have concluded lately that there may be an oversupply of some components.“Based on the production capacity that’s been announced or planned, we expect there to be more batteries than there are vehicles to put them in,” said Kevin C. See, an analyst at Lux Research, which predicts substantial consolidation among the would-be manufacturers in the months or years ahead.While the market for Solyndra’s product, solar cells, is gaining in maturity and is somewhat predictable, the market for electric cars is less certain, analysts add.“In the case of manufacturing electric vehicles or batteries for electric vehicles, it’s basically speculation as to whether you think they’re going to have customers, ‘’ Mr. See said.Another analytical firm, Bloomberg New Energy Finance, reached a similar conclusion last week, saying that the manufacturing capacity for specialized lithium-ion batteries will greatly exceed the need “unless demand by automakers increases significantly in the short term.”Battery prices are “poised to fall,” Bloomberg said, just as a decline in solar panel prices hit Solyndra.Nissan North America has a loan guarantee of up to $1.448 billion for retooling a factory in Smyrna, Tenn., and building the Nissan Leaf, including the battery. In a telephone interview on Friday, Mr. Silver of the Energy Department said that the company, a “triple-B-plus investment-grade company, has the wherewithal to ensure repayment” even if electric vehicle sales prove to be weak.Mr. Silver said that the Energy Department’s loan guarantee program was supposed to take some risks.  “Congress directed us to identify technologies that could be brought to market in an effort to leapfrog the United States forward and re-establish innovation leadership,” he said. “ Our job is to identify those technologies and build them out.”A company spokeswoman for Nissan, Katherine Zachary, said that the Leaf was “selling great,” although total deliveries so far total only about 6,100. “If we had more, we’d sell more,” she said.Fisker Automotive got $529 million to develop and build two kinds of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles at a factory in Wilmington, Del. Tesla Motors got $465 million to reopen a factory in Fremont, Calif., to produce all-electric vehicles and to make battery packs, electric motors and other components. They both buy batteries from other suppliers, but their success depends on an electric vehicle market.Adding another layer of uncertainty, experts say, electric car sales rely heavily on inducements to consumers by state and federal governments, and in an era of budget-cutting, it is not clear how generous the governments will continue to be.The size of the future market for solar cells is also somewhat uncertain. But a former energy aide in the Clinton White House, speaking on condition of anonymity because he did not want to be drawn into the political debate over Solyndra, said that predicting the market for electric cars was much harder. “The electric vehicle market is much more based on an uncertain regulatory future and uncertain consumer preference,” he said.The Solyndra bankruptcy has already renewed a Congressional debate about the federal government’s ability to pick winners and losers in the commercial marketplace.“I think we have other Solyndras out there,” said Representative Cliff Stearns, a Florida Republican and chairman of the oversight and investigations committee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which held the hearing on Solyndra.“The government should not be picking winners and losers — that’s what they’re doing with Nissan, Tesla and Fisker,” he said in an interview. “They’re at risk in an global open competitive market.”Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, said in an interview after Wednesday’s hearing that any taxpayer investment in a green industry could be threatened by a decision by China to move into that industry and flood the market with subsidized goods, which is what happened with solar cells.'"
"'11-09-16,'1','LONDON — A closely contested election in Denmark resulted in victory on Thursday for a center-left coalition led by the Social Democratic Party, ending a 10-year run in power for a center-right coalition that adopted some of Europe’s toughest immigration controls.The results, based on broadcasters’ tallies of more than 90 percent of the vote, set the country on course to having its first female prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, whose party led an alliance known as the red bloc. She claimed victory about three hours after the polls closed. “We’ve written history today,” Ms. Thorning-Schmidt said.Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen of the Liberal Party conceded the election late Thursday, news reports said.For Denmark, a nation of 5.5 million people, the election turned on the issue that has also divided many other Western nations struggling with low growth, large government deficits and historic levels of national debt: what mix of government spending and tax policies to adopt in order to restore economic health and avoid slipping further toward a crisis like Greece’s.The Social Democrats’ campaign was based on Ms. Thorning-Schmidt’s promises to raise taxes on Denmark’s banks and its wealthiest citizens to pay for better schools and hospitals, and to finance a $4 billion expansion of what is already one of Europe’s most generous welfare systems. Her most headline-catching nod to austerity came with her proposal to add 12 minutes to the average Dane’s working day, and she also acknowledged the need to take action on the deficit, which is set to rise to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2012, well above the European average.The departing center-right bloc, led by Mr. Loekke Rasmussen, pointed to Europe’s deepening financial crisis and said Denmark should keep tight control of its public finances, avoiding “uncontrolled debt,” and not adopt tax increases that would stifle its weak economic recovery, with a projected growth rate this year of 1.25 percent. Denmark is Scandinavia’s worst-performing economy, with a growth rate less than half of Norway’s and less than one-third of Sweden’s.'"
"'11-09-16,'1','Right now, she said, “you’ve got this comprehensive poster that says all that is happening this weekend, but you still have to stand there with a map to be able to figure it out.”The Weekender does not redraw the usual map so much as annotate it. The A train, for instance, has an irritating habit of running along part of the F line on weekends. But the map, rather than repositioning the A’s blue trail onto the orange F route, simply flags the bypassed stations and offers a written explanation. (Officials said a more dynamic map would be logistically difficult to execute.)Still, the online map has appealing features, including a line-by-line view, which highlights, in vibrant colors, the entire length of an individual subway route while fading out the others, like pulling a strand of spaghetti from a knotty pasta. Riders can quickly find out about changes on their own route while ignoring the rest.The site also allows users to toggle between the subway diagram and detailed neighborhood maps, which list local attractions.Nostalgists and art enthusiasts may be most excited, however, by the triumphant return of Mr. Vignelli’s design, long considered the most artful guide to the New York system.When the Vignelli map made its debut in 1972, critics maligned it for a lack of geographic verisimilitude: Central Park was portrayed as a gray, squarish blob, and stations were placed misleadingly close to one another, leaving some riders disoriented upon ascending to the street.But its abstract design, similar to the subway maps of London and Paris, has a streamlined beauty, and its yielding to the current, more literal map (blue rivers, green parks) has long been lamented by purists.Mr. Vignelli’s atelier, which also designed the subway’s signature signage system, had already been in talks with the transportation authority about developing a 40th-anniversary edition of his map.The Weekender is a tweaked version of Mr. Vignelli’s original, with updated colors and routes and some small corrections, like restoring the 50th Street C stop to the west of its neighboring No. 1 stop. (Notoriously, the 1972 version had the two reversed.) Kennedy Airport is denoted by a perfect circle, representing the AirTrain.Weekend ridership is at its highest level in decades, but transit workers still perform most maintenance and repair work on Saturdays and Sundays; the L train, for instance, has been entirely canceled along much of its route on two weekends this month.Subway officials spent about six months designing the digital weekend guide, a recognition, they say, of riders’ increasing reliance on the Web and smartphones to navigate the city.The Weekender is not a panacea. Its landing page is not quite intuitive, and some users may at first have difficulty navigating it. But officials say that The Weekender is a work in progress, and that they will integrate users’ comments as they make adjustments.By coincidence, a preview of the site this week showed most subway lines looking relatively undisturbed for the coming weekend.That is likely to change.Referring to the blinking trouble lights, Paul Fleuranges, the head of the authority’s corporate communications division, said that on some weekends, the map might be “lit up like a Christmas tree.”'"
"'11-09-16,'1','WASHINGTON — A new book claims that President Obama’s response to the economic crisis was hampered by a White House economic staff plagued by internal rivalries, a domineering chief adviser and a Treasury secretary who dragged his feet on enforcing decisions with which he disagreed.The book, by Ron Suskind, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, quotes White House documents that say Mr. Obama’s decisions were routinely “re-litigated” by the chairman of the National Economic Council, Lawrence H. Summers. Some decisions, including one to overhaul the debt-ridden Citibank, were carried out sluggishly or not at all by a resistant Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, according to the book.Mr. Suskind quotes from two memos for the president in which Pete Rouse, a senior White House aide, wrote, “There is deep dissatisfaction within the economic team with what is perceived as Larry’s imperious and heavy-handed direction of the economic policy process.”A copy of the book, “Confidence Men: Wall Street, Washington, and the Education of a President,” published by HarperCollins, was obtained by The New York Times before it officially goes on sale on Tuesday. The White House declined to comment on Mr. Suskind’s account, which he said was based on interviews with more than 200 people, including the president.The book offers a portrait of a White House operating under intense pressure as it dealt with a cascade of crises, from insolvent banks to collapsing carmakers. And it details the rivalries among figures around the president, including Mr. Summers; Mr. Geithner; the former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel; and the budget director, Peter R. Orszag.In this rough-and-tumble environment, the book reports, female staff members often felt bruised. At a dinner with Mr. Obama in November 2009, several top female aides — including Anita Dunn, who was the communications director, and Christina Romer, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers — told the president about being talked over in meetings by male colleagues or cut out altogether.'"
"'11-09-16,'1','“Politics push elected officials to consider the short term in their decision making,” Tom Steyer said. “We think someone needs to be talking about what we as a society want for the future and the investments we need to make to get there.”The organization intends to tackle children’s issues and the environment, developing analyses and research, and campaigns across all media platforms to highlight the findings. “We’ve spent hundreds of billions of dollars on war over the last 10 years at the same time we’ve been spending less and less on kids,” Jim Steyer said. “That’s fiscally insane and morally bankrupt, but no one is talking about it.”More and more of the nation’s big philanthropists are devoting their money to influencing public policy, like Charles and David H. Koch, the billionaires behind the Tea Party movement, or Peter B. Lewis and Herb and Marion Sandler, who seeded the liberal Center for American Progress.Such efforts make many uncomfortable, but the Steyer brothers (Tom is a Democrat, Jim is an independent) say the new center will be “fiercely” nonpartisan and work only to get the public to think and talk more about major issues in California and the country at large.“I believe there is a huge void in American society because no one likes to speak out,” Tom Steyer said. “One of the reasons I admire Warren Buffett so much is that he has the courage of his convictions and steps up and takes part in the public debate.”He pointed to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s prominent role in the health care debate as a model for the Center for the Next Generation. “We will take the issues of this lost generation head on,” said Matt James, the former Kaiser executive who is the center’s chief. “This will be an aggressive campaign and one that we plan to run for many years, as that is what it will take to begin to turn the tide.”Tom Steyer and Ms. Taylor have pledged $15 million over five years to seed the center’s operations, but it must also raise money on its own. The Ford Foundation already has contributed $500,000, and, given the brothers’ network of connections, fund-raising is the least of the organization’s worries. “I call myself a member of the Jim Steyer repertory company,” his friend Geoffrey Cowan of the University of Southern California joked.Just 13 months apart in age, the Steyer brothers’ early life comes right out of “The Catcher in the Rye,” minus its protagonist’s angst. They shared a bedroom in an apartment on New York’s Upper East Side, attending the Buckley School, then Phillips Exeter Academy and Yale — where their father, Roy, had attended law school in a class with Potter Stewart, Cyrus R. Vance Sr. and Gerald R. Ford — and Stanford.After business school at Stanford, where he met Ms. Taylor, Tom Steyer worked at Goldman Sachs, where his boss on the firm’s vaunted risk arbitrage desk was Robert E. Rubin, who later was Treasury secretary. “One thing I remember about that time is his résumé,” Mr. Rubin said. “He had graduated summa cum laude from Yale and was captain of the Eli soccer team, and that combination struck me as pretty unusual.”Jim Steyer bucked the family tradition and went to Stanford as an undergraduate and as a law student. Desiring more knowledge about public interest law, he persuaded the law school dean to give him credit for starting a nonprofit group, the East Palo Alto Community Law Project.“Jim is the one of us most like our mother,” Tom Steyer said. Their mother, Marnie Steyer, taught for years in public schools in Harlem and the South Bronx. She “was fiery and emotional and intuitive,” Tom Steyer said. “She cared deeply about things, and Jim does, too.”In 1988, Jim Steyer started another nonprofit organization, Children Now. A year later, the organization hit the front pages with a “report card” on California’s children that showed only half were immunized and one-fifth lacked health insurance. He founded a company that produced children’s television shows and wrote a book, “The Other Parent: The Inside Story of the Media’s Effect on Our Children.”That led to the establishment of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group that helps children and their parents navigate media and technology. The group, with more than 600,000 members and programs in some 20,000 schools, was instrumental in the passage of the California law, recently struck down by the Supreme Court, restricting sales of violent video games.“Jim is not content to be a maintenance man,” said Gary Knell, chief executive of Sesame Workshop, producer of “Sesame Street.” “He’s always looking for another mountain to hike up; that’s what this new venture with his brother is.”The fight for children’s rights seems to have little to do with the environment, but the Steyers say the welfare of both is critical to the country’s future. “Developing advanced energy is critical to our economy, and so is a skilled work force, and both require substantial investments,” Tom Steyer said.The letter he and his wife wrote for the Giving Pledge explained that they had more money than they could spend in their lifetimes and “don’t require more material possessions.”“They live in a very modest house, he drives an old car, he doesn’t own a corporate jet — and then there are those bad ties,” Mr. Rubin said, referring to Mr. Steyer’s habit of wearing cheap, loud plaid or striped ties.The Steyer-Taylor philanthropy is perhaps best explained by One PacificCoast Bank, which works in low-income neighborhoods that are underserved by mainstream banks. They have invested roughly $50 million in the bank and donated their shares to its foundation.The TomKat Ranch in Pescadero, Calif., near where Ms. Taylor grew up, is a similar venture — though she and her husband disagree over whether it will ever be self-sustaining like the bank. “I lie awake at night worrying about that,” he joked.The ranch recently began selling beef (under the brand name Leftcoast Grassfed) from the cattle that graze behind solar-powered fences on native grasses on a schedule designed to protect the soil. “The first day of sales, they sold out in a few hours, and Kat was so excited,” Jim Steyer said. “Tom’s take was that she must have mispriced it.”Tom Steyer and Ms. Taylor have practiced more traditional philanthropy as well, including a $40 million gift to Stanford to underwrite a new institute to tackle energy issues and a $25 million gift to Yale for a similar project.He said more of their money may go to efforts like fighting Proposition 23, a ballot initiative that would have rolled back state-mandated cuts in greenhouse gases. The initiative was financed by two Texas refiners — and a petrochemical company owned by the Koch brothers.Mr. Steyer gave $5 million to the successful effort to defeat it.The approach he took in that battle offers a hint about how the Center for the Next Generation will operate. Rather than engaging in a bitter debate about environmental benefits of California’s emissions requirements, that effort repeatedly emphasized the jobs the standards were creating, the investments they were attracting and their health benefits.“I’ve kind of had it with the politics of screaming and yelling and going crazy,” Mr. Steyer said. “I won’t live by those rules.”'"

"'11-09-16,'1','“If they didn’t radically change their cost structure,” Mr. LoGiudice said of Netflix, “we probably would have just kept paying the old rate without much thought or review.”Netflix’s subscriber base had been on a reliably upward trajectory since its founding more than a decade ago, with one slight exception in 2007. The company — widely praised for making it easy to stream films and some TV shows via the Internet — had 24.6 million customers at the end of the second quarter of the year, when it last reported figures to investors. Back then, it expected that it would end the third quarter with 25 million, three million of whom would opt only for the DVD service.But early Thursday morning it lowered its subscriber estimates for the third quarter, which ends in two weeks, to an expected total of 24 million, a quarterly decline of 600,000.The decline is due in large part to customers who were unhappy about the price changes. Netflix now expects that 2.2 million customers will opt for DVDs by mail only.Investors and the Internet video-consuming public have been paying close attention to Netflix as a leader in the growing over-the-top video industry, a reference to the fact that Netflix piggybacks on other companies’ Internet connections.Netflix has proved that many people will pay for a premium selection of films and shows online, helping to create a new revenue stream for media companies and sparking competition from Hulu, Amazon and other competitors. But Netflix also has shown that customers can reject what they perceive as an unfair deal.Netflix knew that some customers would drop out when the changes were instituted. It had previously cautioned investors that the change would benefit the company, but not until the fourth quarter. “Despite the guidance revision, we remain convinced that the splitting of our services was the right long-term strategic choice,” the company wrote in a letter to shareholders on Thursday.The splitting of the services, the company said in July and again Thursday, will give it more money to spend on content for its streaming service, which is widely recognized as the future of the company.Some analysts backed Netflix. While noting the short-term uncertainty, Anthony DiClemente of Barclays Capital said in an analysts’ note Thursday that Netflix “remains among the best user experiences for watching video online” and credited it for remaining “disciplined on costs” and pursuing international opportunities.Earlier this month, Netflix started new streaming services in Brazil, Mexico and many other Latin America countries. Previously the service was available only in the United States and Canada.Netflix faces the same hurdle in every country it opens up shop: a need for compelling content. That fact was reaffirmed in the United States earlier this month when the premium cable channel Starz, which supplies Sony and Disney films to Netflix, said it would stop doing so in February when its contract expires.The films from Starz helped to jump-start Netflix’s streaming service several years ago, but according to Starz, the two companies could not come to terms on a new contract. Netflix said it would acquire content from other sources, essentially spending its subscribers’ money elsewhere.'"
"'11-09-16,'1','The Army Corps of Engineers estimates it will cost more than $2 billion to repair the damage to the nation’s levees, dams and riverbanks caused by this year’s flooding, dwarfing the $150 million it has to make such repairs. Floodwaters that raged down the nation’s rivers this year have strained dams, eroded riverbanks, filled harbors with silt and ripped football field-sized holes in some earthen levees protecting farmland and small towns. The damage estimate, confirmed Thursday to The Associated Press by corps officials, promises to be more significant than with a typical flood in which high water recedes quickly. The estimate does not factor in flood damage caused by Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee, and the corps does not have an estimate of the damage from those storms yet. The Senate is considering a $7 billion emergency disaster relief bill, but only $1.3 billion of that would go to the corps. A competing House bill would allocate $3.7 billion to overall disaster aid, $226 million of it to the corps.'"
"'11-09-16,'1','The comments of the virus hunter W. Ian Lipkin (“The Real Threat of ‘Contagion,’ ” Op-Ed, Sept. 12) concerning the reality of the movie “Contagion” are highly poignant given the emergence of new diseases due to viruses, bacteria, fungi and/or parasites each year. We are vulnerable, but there are new molecular tools available to help us diagnose infections and monitor transmission of new disease-causing agents.An important consequence of the anthrax attacks in 2001 and the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in 2002-4 was the realization that the national laboratory infrastructure was woefully inadequate to handle these agents. In response, the National Institutes of Health invested more than half a billion dollars to create both national and regional biocontainment laboratories where emerging pathogens can be studied safely.This national laboratory infrastructure is critical to domestic and global health security. Yet beyond the initial capital investment, there is no money available from the federal government to operate most of these complex facilities.As a nation, we invest in technology. But we need to be sure that the infrastructure to work on threat agents is maintained and strengthened to ensure that we are prepared to handle the next major infectious challenge.The writer is executive director of the Public Health Research Institute and Regional Biocontainment Laboratory, New Jersey Medical School-U.M.D.N.J.I agree with W. Ian Lipkin that we need a stronger public health work force to help fight potential pandemics, and I also urge parents and families to use the movie “Contagion” as an opportunity to reflect on their own disaster planning.Does your family have a disaster plan? What about your child’s school or child care center? Is your local hospital equipped for an influx of pediatric patients? For children who survive disasters, how are we caring for their long-term emotional needs?'"
"'11-09-16,'1','However, other cautionary pressures — severe market swings, recession, more complex investment choices and increased longevity — might seem familiar to anyone with a 401(k).To a novice 401(k) investor, the most obvious solution might be to switch money out of volatile stocks and into more stable bonds, and in fact, many traditional plans are doing just that.But unlike a 401(k) investor, a giant fund like the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, known as Calpers, cannot easily move its $237.5 billion around without causing financial tidal waves. Instead, the fund last December adopted what it called a “risk-focused asset allocation strategy.” The staff now looks at the investments in terms of how they perform in different market conditions.In another example, officials from a dozen large plans, including Boeing, meet regularly to demand more data on risk from their outside managers.“The desire is to have a system that tells them where they are exposed across the market,” said Karyn Williams, a managing director specializing in risk management at the Los Angeles consulting firm Wilshire Associates.Pensions are a delicate topic, as companies increasingly shift new employees to 401(k)s. In addition, “It’s not a fun thing to talk about, when the funded status is low and equity values are low,” said the Vanguard Group’s chief actuary, R. Evan Inglis.In the broadest sense, defined-benefit and 401(k) retirement portfolios are similar because they must try to anticipate developments decades in advance and then find investments that match those projections.Still, size matters, and there are strong arguments against copying the big plans too closely.Because their losses are spread around a wider base, defined-benefit plans enjoy more flexibility, which allows them to take more investment risk. “An individual in a 401(k) has a set time frame,” said Alison Borland, the retirement manager for Aon Hewitt’s outsourcing arm. The individual must make sure there is enough money to stretch from Year 1 of retirement all the way through the actuarially expected lifespan. A pension plan, by contrast, can juggle the estimates for thousands of different retirement schedules. “You can be pretty sure the entire population is not going to live to 90,” Ms. Borland said.“Individual investing tends to be more complex,” said Stephen M. Horan, head of private wealth management for the CFA Institute, a trade group for financial advisers. “I need to think about that individual’s past profile, estate planning, life situation and any family dynamics that might have wealth implications.” Again, a defined-benefit manager can disregard the personal details and “aggregate the employees altogether,” Mr. Horan said.Another important distinction is that 401(k) holders must worry about inflation eating away at their savings. Traditional pension plans can ignore the topic, because most do not offer cost-of-living adjustments.All those differences might seem to imply that 401(k) holders should be even more cautious than the newly cautious defined-benefit plans. They cannot afford losses jeopardizing their ability to retire on their hoped-for date.But experts also cite some intriguing reasons why 401(k)s could actually be a bit more daring than their larger cousins.For one thing, a 401(k) holder can delay retirement if the portfolio gets depleted. The pension manager cannot change the decisions of the work force. “An individual is aiming for a target, but it’s not so precisely nailed down,” said Stephen P. Utkus, director of Vanguard’s Center for Retirement Research.The new pension funding law also constrains traditional plans, because they have only seven years to get their assets and liabilities back in balance after a market crash. Individuals face no such limits. “If I’m an individual, 30 years old, I’ve got a lot more than seven years,” Mr. Archer of Towers Watson said. In theory, that 30-year-old has until age 65 to make up the losses. “Even if I’m 60 years old,” Mr. Archer continued, “I still have more than seven years, because I’m not planning to use up all my money the day I retire.” He said “this gives you as an individual an ability to take on more risk.”True, defined-benefit managers have access to professional advice and complex investment choices that allow them to hedge against risk. But simplified versions of those investment options are becoming increasingly available to the retail and 401(k) markets. Michael Kresh, president of M. D. Kresh Financial Services in Islandia, N.Y., advocates using Treasury inflation-protected securities, international bonds and mutual funds that specialize in commodities, even if it must be done outside the 401(k), via an individual retirement account.Whether 401(k) investors decide to be more cautious, less so or stay the course depends on their attitudes toward risk. And that is something that has always been true, regardless of what the big players are doing.'"
"'11-09-16,'1','The dividend payers are also less volatile, nearly nine percentage points lower in standard deviation for those companies paying dividends and almost a percentage point lower than the entire S.& P. 500.Many of the steadiest dividend payers have been paying for decades. The 3M Company, for example, has paid for 59 consecutive years.“Dividend growth stocks that raise payments every year fly under the radar,” said Dave Van Knapp of sensiblestocks.com, author of “The Top 40 Dividend Growth Stocks.” He said the market’s recent hypervolatility had only reinforced the dividend strategy.When building a portfolio, you can assemble it one stock at a time or buy exchange-traded funds, pools of securities that trade on stock exchanges.Many mature companies that offer dividends reward investors with no- or low-fee purchase plans and dividend reinvestment plans, known as DRIPs. Still, if you’re building a portfolio with individual stocks, you’ll need to buy a variety of companies to avoid concentrating too much in a particular industry, like utilities or health care. You’ll also need to pay attention to whether high dividends are sustainable, whether share prices are too dear and whether the company is stable.Charles B. Carlson, whose Horizon Publishing has specialized in dividend selection for decades, said a “reasonably diverse portfolio should consist of 25 to 30 stocks” from different industries. Horizon’s stock-picking system employs about 80 variables to a universe of 4,000 stocks to find the most consistent payers and growth prospects.If you’re not a stock picker, consider exchange-traded funds like the SPDR Dividend (SDY), which invests in a pool of top dividend payers; the Vanguard High-Yield Dividend Index (VYM); or the Dividend Appreciation Index (VIG). Managers will be constantly monitoring the market and selecting the best stocks.Of course, with your own portfolio, you control which stocks are chosen and their tax consequences. Unless you sell shares, you don’t generate any capital gains taxes. And if held within an Individual Retirement Account or other plan with a brokerage window, all taxes can be deferred until you take withdrawals.No matter which dividend vehicle you choose, keep in mind that you have to monitor your investment, because even companies perceived as secure can suspend their dividends or depreciate quickly — BP, for example, after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and financial stocks after the 2008 crisis. There’s always market risk in holding stocks, and even more risk if you try to time your purchases around market movements.'"
"'11-09-16,'1','WASHINGTON — The final legal and diplomatic building blocks fell into place this week for the Obama administration’s rejiggered defense of Europe against a potential Iranian missile attack. Romania signed a deal for 24 interceptor missiles to be based there, and Turkey officially agreed to have in its territory a sophisticated American radar system that could be on the watch by the end of the year.American officials called the deal with Turkey the most significant military cooperation between Washington and Ankara since 2003, when Turkish officials infuriated their American counterparts by refusing to allow an armored division to cross Turkish territory to join the invasion of Iraq.“This is probably the biggest strategic decision between the United States and Turkey in the past 15 or 20 years,” one senior administration official said Thursday at a White House briefing meant to call attention to the developments.Turkish officials were careful in their comments to avoid identifying Iran as the specific threat motivating their decision to join NATO’s American-designed missile shield. But Turkey is worried by Iran’s evolving missile capabilities and by signs that Tehran has secretly supported the bloody crackdown on protesters in Syria. (Iran crushed its own pro-democracy demonstrations in 2009.)There were hurdles to the deal. The Turkish news media published objections to the sharing of information gathered by the American radar with Israel. Relations between Turkey and Israel, once fairly close, soured badly after the Israeli government refused to apologize for the deadly assault last year on a flotilla trying to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza.'"
"'11-09-16,'1','Not surprisingly, the markets reacted. Look at a stock chart during the week after the downgrade: the zigs and zags form a distinct W, which took shape when the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index plummeted nearly 7 percent, and then, in the days following, rose about 4.7 percent, gave up 4.4 percent, then rose 4.6 percent once again.Further market gyrations are inevitable. So to protect your portfolio from yet another risk — your emotional impulses— during these unsettling times, you might consider reassessing whether your money is invested in a way that you can truly handle for the long haul.  Start by trying to answer these questions:HOW MUCH RISK CAN I TOLERATE? Though the most recent downturns are painful, they have served a purpose. “It did provide a nice stress test for investors,” said Fran Kinniry, a principal at Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group.How did you do? Were you able to ride out the crash in 2008 and 2009 (or perhaps even the debt ceiling debate) without touching your investments — or did you fold and go to cash? If it’s the latter, then you were invested too aggressively, experts said.“If they were at 60 percent in stocks and 40 percent in bonds going into the bear market, and sold during the downturn, then that is above their tolerance for risk and they shouldn’t go back to the level,” said Rick Ferri, author of “All About Asset Allocation” and founder of the money management firm Portfolio Solutions. “Perhaps 50-50 or 40-60 is more appropriate, that is if they need to take that much risk based on their situation.”At financial planning firms across the country, advisers have been re-evaluating their clients’ stomach for volatility. “We moved a lot of our retirees that exhibited lower risk tolerance during the last crash to lower equity exposures once the recovery was well under way,” said Rick Kahler, a financial planner in Rapid City, S.D. “In the last year, many wanted to return to their previous portfolio that had the higher equity exposure, and we discouraged them.”That sort of flip-flopping can be attributed to a behavioral phenomenon known as recency bias — the tendency of investors to weigh recent events more heavily than those in the past.Though advisers say that many of the risk tolerance questionnaires available on the Web are an overly simplistic gauge, many of them use FinaMetrica, a 25-question tool that combines psychology and statistics and generates an investor risk profile illustrating where they stand relative to others. While it is geared for advisers (and costs $45 for consumers), it could prove to be an educational exercise, or serve as a conversation starter for couples with different outlooks.HOW MUCH STOCK DO I NEED?  The amount of stock funds you can tolerate may not necessarily match what’s recommended to reach your retirement goals. (But you generally want to take as little risk as you need to reach those goals.) The optimal allocations will vary depending on your specific circumstances and how much money you need to withdraw for annual expenses not covered by Social Security, pensions and other income sources. Because retirement does not come with a do-over option, it often pays to visit a certified financial planner, particularly one that charges an hourly rate or a flat fee, to help you sort this out.Still, even among investment professionals, the recommended allocations tend to differ. Consider the varying allocations of target-date funds — whose investment mix becomes more conservative as you age — for people who recently retired or are nearing retirement.Schwab’s Target 2010 fund, for example, holds slightly more than 38 percent in domestic and foreign stocks, while Vanguard’s 2010 target-date fund is nearly 46 percent in stocks. Fidelity’s Freedom 2010 has 47 percent, and  T. Rowe Price’s Retirement 2010 fund has 53 percent. Meanwhile, a Vanguard fund for people who have already retired or are over the age of 69 has a stock allocation of 30 percent.Mr. Ferri, the author and money manager, suggests some investment mixes in his book that could serve as a starting point. For example, a person who is about three to five years from retirement and has a moderate tolerance for risk may consider a diversified portfolio evenly split between stocks and bonds, he said, while a conservative investor may keep only 30 percent of the portfolio in stocks.Once retired, moderate investors may dial down their stock allocation to 40 percent, Mr. Ferri said, while more aggressive investors may still decide to keep 60 percent in stocks. “These examples probably cover 80 percent of retirees,” he said. “There are some people who can and should be more aggressive, and those that should be more conservative. It all depends how much they have saved and whether that’s enough, or if they have much more than enough and are really investing for someone else.”HOW MUCH SHOULD I HAVE IN CASH? People nearing or in retirement might consider setting aside anywhere from one to five years of their expenses in a safe and cashlike account, experts said. This may help you rest easier since you know that your immediate needs will be met.Alan Moore, a financial planner at Kahler Financial Group in Rapid City, S.D., said some investors did not like seeing a sizable chunk of money sitting on the sidelines, but he called it market insurance. “We set up direct deposits into their checking account for their monthly expenses,” he said, “and each year we replenish the cash reserve.” If the market is on the decline, and a retiree isn’t comfortable selling, they wait.AM I KEEPING MY RISK LEVEL IN CHECK? Over time, market swings will inevitably throw your portfolio out of balance, so you need to establish a strategy to periodically recalibrate your investment back to your targets. For most investors, it usually makes sense to rebalance either annually or semiannually, when a particular investment category — say, large-cap stocks or bonds — deviates about five percentage points from your target, according to a study by Vanguard based on historical market returns.It’s a counterintuitive strategy: you are generally selling your winning investments and buying the laggards. The study, however, found that investors who rebalanced after big market drops had typically been rewarded over the long term. Increasing your stock allocation (especially when stocks are cheap) can position you for an eventual rebound, which can help returns over time. But at its core, rebalancing is not about maximizing your returns.“Rebalancing is about maintaining risk tolerance and objectives of the portfolio,” Mr. Kinniry said. “What we do know is that over long holding periods, the portfolios that are allowed to drift have slightly higher returns, as expected, as the average equity position is larger. But it has significantly more risk.”AM I FOCUSING ON THE BIG PICTURE? This is admittedly hard to do during periods of uncertainty. But consider the recent performance of a diversified portfolio. Since the market peaked in October 2007, a portfolio split evenly between stocks and bonds had a cumulative return of 5.9 percent through Sept. 6, while a portfolio with 30 percent stocks and 70 percent bonds had a cumulative return of 15.8 percent. An all-stock portfolio, meanwhile, lost 18.9 percent over the same period, according to calculations by Vanguard.Rewind 30 years, and the same evenly split portfolio returned an annualized 10.3 percent from July 31, 1981, through the same date this year, while the 30 percent stock portfolio earned 9.9 percent, and the 100 percent stock portfolio yielded 10.9 percent annualized.WHAT’S MY CONTINGENCY PLAN?  If your retirement date happens to coincide with a significant market downturn, it can do long-term damage to your plan because the money you withdraw will not be invested for a potential recovery. “A person considering retirement should determine how much of a contraction he or she could withstand and still be able to meet their retirement spending goals,” said Troy Sapp, a financial planner at Commencement Financial Planning in Tacoma, Wash.For Chris Gruber, a 63-year-old research psychologist in Long Beach, Calif., and his wife, Diane, a retired surgeon, the market swings have underscored their need to remain flexible. The couple finished paying off their son’s college bills and her medical debt a little more than a decade ago.They saved aggressively in the years that followed, and they both planned to work part-time for a year or so after they gave up their full-time positions. But when his wife’s retirement date rolled around two and a half years ago, he said her employer eliminated many part-time slots — just as the market crashed.“My wife and I say we chose the worst time in 75 years to retire,” he said.Fortunately, his part-time prospects were much better, and he discovered that he enjoyed working part time, especially because he was able to give up many administrative duties. But in light of the market swings, he said they’ve already done some belt-tightening.His wife’s pension and their Social Security will cover about 60 percent of their annual expenses once they’re fully retired, with the remainder coming from their savings, which is largely invested in stock funds. “On any given day, I can tell you how much I have over my nut to spend,” said Mr. Gruber, who has created a spreadsheet tracking how close their funds match their spending goals. Right now, they’re about 30 percent below their targets, which is well below his comfort zone.“I manage my risk by readjusting what I can do for the rest of my life,” he said. The couple’s goal was to keep their four-bedroom ranch for 10 years, but now they may stay only five, which will allow them to spend more time in Colorado, where they have an apartment near their son’s family.  “We are willing to downsize as it becomes necessary.”'"
"'11-09-16,'1','Kent Tritle devoted the opening of the 23rd season of the Sacred Music in a Sacred Space series at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola to the New York premiere of Juraj Filas’s grandly scaled requiem “Oratio Spei” (“Prayer of Hope”) on Wednesday evening. Technically, the work is not a response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but it has a connection that makes it a fitting commemoration.Mr. Filas, a Czech composer based in Prague, was commissioned to write the piece in 2000, and when the attacks happened, just as he was completing it, he decided to dedicate the work “to the victims of terrorism,” as he put it in his program note, broadening the purpose to make a more global point.Surely the sense of occasion at the church could be attributed partly to the anticipation of a major new work and partly to the 10th anniversary of the attacks, a few days earlier. But much of it had to do with Mr. Tritle, who announced in July that he was leaving St. Ignatius Loyola, and the series he founded in 1989, to become the music director and organist at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine. This was his final performance as director of the superb St. Ignatius choir and orchestra, and it seemed that the 10-minute standing ovation that ended the evening was as much for Mr. Tritle’s work over all as for the score and the richly textured, finely polished, high-energy performance.Mr. Filas writes in a melodic, accessible style, rooted in the traditions of the late 19th century. He also clearly approached his work with a sense of where he wanted it to stand in relation to other beloved requiem settings.The gentler parts of the score — the Introitus and the Kyrie, the Recordare, the Lacrimosa and the Libera Me, in particular — have the light textures and easygoing lyricis of Fauré’s Requiem and some of the melodic litheness of Mozart’s. Mr. Filas rejected Brahms’s ecumenical approach; he not only uses the traditional Latin text but also adds a concluding section that revisits the day of judgment and includes a mystical dialogue between Jesus and St. John, and a bright-hued prayer for deliverance.And in the more terrifying parts of this Mass for the Dead — the vision of the final judgment in the Dies Irae sequence, most notably, but also in parts of the Offertorium — Mr. Filas followed Mozart’s and Verdi’s leads in supporting choral vehemence with orchestral thunder. He actually outpaces Verdi in his passion for soul-shaking percussion.'"

"'11-09-16,'1','Having just commemorated the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, another, more hopeful, September anniversary on Saturday is likely to draw no comment. On Sept. 17, 1978, after 13 days of negotiations at Camp David, President Jimmy Carter brought President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel to the White House to sign an accord to end the state of war between their two countries.“Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace” is a well-reported history of the Camp David talks, the events that led to them, and the difficult negotiations that followed to forge the peace treaty that was signed the next spring. Directed by Harry Hunkele and using interviews with more than two dozen involved parties, including Mr. Carter, the film pays particular attention to the behind-the-scenes communications among nongovernment officials who helped the peace process along when official representatives could not. Leon Charney, for example, an American adviser to Ezer Weizman, the Israeli defense minister, practically jump-started the final round of talks when he learned from an Austrian businessman with ties to Egypt that Sadat would approve a deal that simply returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt.The film also focuses on the interplay among the leaders and the pressures they faced from powerful factions within their camps, and it reminds us what it takes to resolve the seemingly unresolvable: a total commitment from heads of state willing to put themselves at risk. After the treaty Mr. Carter lost significant support among American Jews and was not re-elected; Begin too saw support from his conservative base erode, and he left office in 1983 much diminished. Sadat, of course, was assassinated in 1981.Even after this year’s overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, Sadat’s successor in Egypt, the treaty still holds, however shakily. But the film is not congratulatory. The treaty, it notes, was supposed to be a first step toward a comprehensive peace settlement for the Middle East. More than 30 years later that larger task remains undone.Directed and edited by Harry Hunkele; written by Matthew Tollin, Jonathan Hicks, Mr. Hunkele and Arick Wierson; director of photography, William Fitzgerald; music by Uri Djemal and Shane Koss; produced by Mr. Tollin, Mr. Wierson and Mr. Hunkele; released by Fisher Klingenstein Films.

"'11-09-16,'1','The National Labor Relations Act prohibits companies from taking any actions, whether firing employees or relocating a factory, against workers for exercising federally protected rights that include forming a union or going on strike.Republicans asserted that the N.L.R.B.’s move was causing some foreign companies to think twice about opening operations in the United States, while Democrats said the bill would speed the exodus of American jobs overseas.Representative John Kline, a Minnesota Republican who is chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said: “This legislation represents an important step in the fight to get our jobs back on track. It tells job creators they don’t have to worry about an activist N.L.R.B. telling them where they can locate their business.”But Representative Rush Holt, a New Jersey Democrat, said the bill “would be devastating to workers across this country.”“It makes it easier to shift jobs overseas,” he said. “It eliminates the only remedy to force companies to bring back work from overseas. This outsourcers Bill of Rights is not only bad for the interests of workers, it’s bad for the economy at large.”The Boeing case is pending before an administrative law judge, who is to decide whether to order Boeing to move the South Carolina production plant, which assembles 787 Dreamliners, to Washington State. The House bill has a retroactivity clause that would bar the labor board from seeking such an order.Republicans argue that the bill would still let the labor board pursue many other remedies, among them back pay, although the opening of the assembly line in South Carolina has not caused any layoffs of Boeing workers in Washington State. But officials with the machinists’ union say 1,800 may soon be laid off after the new plant gets up to speed.The labor board’s acting general counsel, Lafe Solomon, said on Wednesday that his decision to file a complaint against Boeing “was based on a careful investigation and a review of the facts under longstanding federal labor law.”“The decision had absolutely nothing to do with political considerations, and there were no consultations with the White House,” he said. “Regrettably, some have chosen to insert politics into what should be a straightforward legal procedure. These continuing political attacks are baseless and unprecedented.” The general counsel is independent from the full labor board and prosecutes cases asserting unfair labor practices.To prove that Boeing’s move was retaliatory, Mr. Solomon pointed to statements by top Boeing officials saying their unhappiness over past strikes motivated them to build the South Carolina plant. But Boeing officials say South Carolina’s low production costs were the reason behind the move.Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, applauded the House vote. “The N.L.R.B.’s actions are having a chilling impact on job creation and causing a great deal of uncertainty for manufacturers throughout the country,” he said. “Today’s vote is just one step in the process of reining in this rogue agency.”More than 250 professors signed a letter criticizing the legislation as “unprecedented interference with a pending legal proceeding for the benefit of a particular employer.” They said the legislation would severely diminish the board’s power to move against employers that illegally retaliate against unionization efforts or protests over working conditions by moving their operations elsewhere. They note that the bill would bar the labor board from bringing actions like the one against a California jewelry manufacturer that announced it was shutting its California operation and moving it to Mexico after its 118 workers voted to unionize. After a federal judge ruled that the company’s move was an illegal, retaliatory action, the jewelry company agreed not to move the plant.'"
"'11-09-16,'1','A joint effort by five major central banks to support Europe’s financial system set off a rally in stocks Thursday. Gold plunged and Treasury yields rose as traders sold the safest investments. Markets in Europe soared.The European Central Bank, the United States Federal Reserve and three other central banks said Thursday they would provide European banks with unlimited dollar loans. The aim is to fend off worries that the banks could be weakened by their holdings of government bonds from Greece and other struggling European countries.“It’s a pretty powerful action,” said Brian Gendreau, senior investment strategist at the Cetera Financial Group. “And it’s another piece of news that leads you to think the crisis in Europe could be on the road to resolution.”The Dow Jones industrial average rose 186.45 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 11,433.18.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 20.43 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,209.11. The index has jumped 4.8 percent this week but is still 10 points short of where it started the month.Gold plunged $45, or 2.5 percent, to settle at $1,778 an ounce. Treasury prices fell, pushing their yields up. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 26/32, to 100 12/32, and the yield rose to 2.08 percent from 1.99 percent late Wednesday.'"

"'11-09-17,'0','William F. Galvin, the Massachusetts secretary of state and securities regulator, has proposed a change in that state’s regulation of interactions between experts like Dr. Bomback and securities traders who may be tempted to seek out and act on information that could be construed as confidential.The changes, effective Dec. 1, would force Massachusetts’ regulated investment advisers to obtain disclosure of all the areas that a consultant in an expert network is prohibited from discussing before the investment advisers could talk to that consultant. Mr. Galvin, in an interview, said the rule would clarify what was illegal.“The bigger issue here is there were loopholes being exploited by companies to get insider information and basically corrupting the marketplace,” Mr. Galvin said.He said that states were playing a much larger, everyday role in regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act of 2010, even as a few prominent federal cases made headlines.Dr. Bomback’s role was that of an academic researcher with connections. His findings, including remarkable success on his own patients, have helped a drug market balloon, even as he signed a $50,000-a-year consulting contract with the drug maker, records show, and took thousands of dollars from an intermediary, Guidepoint Global, an expert network, that put him in touch with money managers.In one sense, his research was limited to a retrospective case series reported in a fairly obscure medical journal, Drug Design, Development and Therapy. But in another sense, it was vitally important for the company and its investors.Dr. Bomback reviewed every known patient in the nation who had tried the drug by the end of 2009 for a debilitating kidney disease known as nephrotic syndrome.There were only 21 such patients total, eight of them in Dr. Bomback’s own practice. Most had failed other treatment and pinned their hopes on a kidney transplant or a lifetime of dialysis.The study found that 9 of 11 of the patients with a certain type of nephrotic syndrome responded well to treatment. In doing so, the study has helped transform the drug, called H.P. Acthar Gel, from the status of an orphan to that of a potential blockbuster.Questcor told investors this month that the expensive, injectable drug could have $1 billion sales for the niche condition Dr. Bomback studied. The drug costs more than $23,000 a vial; Questcor, betting on its value, had raised the price from $1,650 a vial in 2007. The drug is also sold for ultrarare infant spasms and select multiple sclerosis patients.Dr. Bomback and other Columbia researchers continue to analyze Acthar in a company-sponsored clinical trial. As for the $50,000-a-year consulting agreement he signed with Questcor in January 2010, Dr. Bomback said it was changed in April 2010 to $10,000 a year for five years “to comply with new rules adopted by Columbia University limiting consulting fees.”The university’s policy was actually last changed in July 2009, said Douglas Levy, a spokesman. It generally prohibits faculty with consulting payments over $10,000 from researching that company’s products.Mr. Levy declined to discuss Dr. Bomback’s actions in detail, saying any university inquiry would be conducted and resolved privately.Dr. Bomback said his pay for talking to money managers in the Guidepoint expert network was small: just $3,541 since Jan. 1, 2010.The Massachusetts complaint portrays a sharp turnaround for Mr. Silverman’s hedge fund after he began paying Guidepoint $80,000 a year for the right to interview two experts a week. Most of them were conducting confidential research for various drug makers, the complaint said. They were supposed to talk about other things — a policy Guidepoint informs them about but does not track to ensure compliance.Mr. Silverman’s fund, Risk Reward Capital, had lost 16 percent of its value in 2007, but after joining Guidepoint in 2008, it gained 55 percent in 2009 and 52 percent in 2010, the complaint said. State authorities also accuse him of illegal trading in another company, Ariad Pharmaceuticals, with help from unidentified Guidepoint experts, which he also denies.Mr. Silverman, in his response to the state, said he had actually outperformed his peers in the market turmoil of 2007. He also said he had invested in Questcor before talking with Dr. Bomback and continued to hold the stock, which are not considered signs of a get-rich-quick inside trader.Mr. Silverman and his lawyer, Peter R. Pendergast of Boston, declined comment. In the written response, they noted that Questcor stock did not rise much when Dr. Bomback’s abstract results were made public.But it did rise significantly after Dr. Bomback’s findings were published and disseminated by the company. Questcor assigned five salespeople to nephrologists as the article was coming out, and recently expanded that to 28. Mr. Silverman, after talking with Dr. Bomback on June 14, 2010, invested $846,889 in Questcor between July 6 and Sept. 9, the Massachusetts filing showed. He paid an average of $9.80 a share. The stock closed Friday at $27.27 a share, giving him a paper gain of $1.5 million.Both Mr. Silverman and Dr. Bomback said any information they shared was not secret and not “material,” a legal term meaning it was not really important to Questcor’s stock value.“Mr. Silverman has never received any material nonpublic information from me,” Dr. Bomback wrote.Questcor had hailed the Bomback report in a press release, saying it was the first modern test of the drug for kidney patients.Dr. Bomback and Mr. Silverman disagreed over just what was shared between them. The investor’s notes, subpoenaed and quoted in the state filing, show Dr. Bomback talking about the then-secret 21-patient study and Questcor marketing plans. Dr. Bomback denied talking about 21 patients — he said he had mentioned only his own patients — or marketing plans.Mr. Silverman had tried to destroy those notes after receiving a state subpoena. The state, in its filing, said that showed evidence of guilt. Mr. Silverman, in his filing, said he was suffering “a severe bout of anxiety” and later provided the notes voluntarily.'"
"'11-09-17,'0','The Inter-American Court on Human Rights ruled on Friday that Venezuela must allow Leopoldo López, a prominent opposition leader, to run for public office. The decision could shake up a presidential election scheduled for October 2012, opening the way for a strong opponent to run against President Hugo Chávez. Mr. López, a former mayor of Chacao, a municipality in Caracas, was disqualified by Mr. Chávez’s government from running because of legal claims against him from his time as mayor. Mr. López argued that the disqualification, a method used by Venezuela’s government against other opposition figures, amounted to political discrimination. In a statement, the Foreign Ministry called the ruling “politically partial.” Venezuela is believed to be required to respect the decision by the court, a judicial entity of the Organization of American States.'"

"'11-09-17,'0','One afternoon this week, there was a man sitting in a barber chair and not getting a haircut, but that was O.K., as he was the barber, Mr. Curtis. He agreed to tell his side of what happened.The night before the parade, the shop did not close, as in years past. The next morning is festive, called J’Ouvert, a form of the French phrase for “the day having been opened.” Outside, Nostrand Avenue was indeed opened and teeming.“We were all here,” Mr. Curtis said. “This guy with two girls, a barber, another guy — like, five of us, and two more.” The restroom is in the corner, a humble but tidy little affair, welcome relief in a neighborhood with scant public facilities. It was getting a lot more use than the barber chairs as the morning wore on.Then the toilet backed up. The culprit appeared to be a feminine pad. The barbers and their friends, all men, decided it was time to add a new rule: “From now on,” Mr. Curtis said, “we’re going to charge a dollar.” Not to make money, but more like a nuisance tax.Mr. Curtis lumps the women from that morning into one collective enemy. “Five of them come inside, and one guy.” A woman asked to use the restroom and Mr. Curtis told her about the fee. “She didn’t take me serious,” Mr. Curtis said. “I said, ‘You don’t listen to me? It’s a dollar to use the bathroom.’ ”The woman, in Mr. Curtis’s telling, flew into a rage, insulting his race and his manhood in a few salty words. She left and slammed the door. One of her friends stayed, dancing with a guy. Mr. Curtis danced a little, then went outside to sit in a chair. Soon he was surrounded by angry women. “We should spit in his face,” one said, according to the barber.They left, but came back, “a bunch of them this time, and two dudes,” Mr. Curtis said. A friend of the woman who wanted to use the restroom accused Mr. Curtis of disrespecting her. When a man appeared to wind up to throw a punch, Mr. Curtis lunged, he said. “We’re tussling with them,” he said. “I was just hitting.” Turns out he was hitting the woman, 19, and turns out she was wearing a wig. “My hand tangled in her hair and it fell off,” he said.Officers broke up the brief fight, Mr. Curtis said. The women left — and came back again, which gave the barber pause: “To go and come back? They got to be tough.”Again, the police intervened, as if to protect Mr. Curtis and Mr. Del Pratt, but instead walking them to the stationhouse in handcuffs. It was the first arrest for both men. The day dragged on. “There were, like, 17 people in the precinct,” he said. “Fourteen of them caught with guns.”The two other people in the fight, the woman and a man, 23, were treated for cuts from a blade at a nearby hospital, the police said. Mr. Curtis concedes that a barber denying that he cut someone in a fight outside his barbershop may not have the easiest case to defend, but that, he said, is the truth.'"
"'11-09-17,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans’ wealth declined this spring for the first time in a year, as stocks and homes fell in value, a Federal Reserve report said Friday. At the same time, corporations increased the size of their cash stockpiles.The combination could slow an already weak economy because it implies that families have less to spend and businesses are reluctant to expand.Household net worth dropped 0.3 percent to $58.5 trillion in the April-June quarter from the previous period, according to the Federal Reserve’s Flow of Funds report. The decline followed three straight quarterly increases.The value of Americans’ stock portfolios fell 0.5 percent in the second quarter. Home values dropped 0.4 percent.Corporations held a record $2 trillion in cash at the end of June, an increase of 4.5 percent.Net worth is expected to fall even further in the current quarter because stocks plunged in late July and early August.'"
"'11-09-17,'0','But Mr. Riggio said he was sufficiently dazzled by Ms. Gbowee during a lunch in June at the Barnes & Noble headquarters in Manhattan that he volunteered to help.The luncheon meeting was arranged by David Steinberger, the president and chief executive of the Perseus Books Group, and Tina Brown, the editor in chief of Beast Books, which is a joint venture between the Newsweek Daily Beast Company and Perseus. Mr. Steinberger said he wanted to get the book on Mr. Riggio’s radar, since it is the kind of title that could have easily become lost among the many books released in September.“It doesn’t have the characteristics of an obvious blockbuster best seller,” Mr. Steinberger said, adding that Beast Books has printed 50,000 copies. “It doesn’t look like a lot of the books that are on the top of The New York Times best-seller list.”Mr. Riggio had never heard of Ms. Gbowee until he watched a documentary that featured her, “Pray the Devil Back to Hell,” which was produced by Abigail E. Disney, a filmmaker and philanthropist who is also a grand-niece of Walt Disney. “Then I looked at the book and thought, ‘O.K., how resonant will it be, and how are you going to promote it?’ ” Mr. Riggio said.Ms. Gbowee, who is 39 and lives in Ghana, said she had no idea who Mr. Riggio was either. “I really didn’t know he was a big deal,” she said in a phone conversation before an event in New York this week. “I went to Google to read about him.”At their meeting in June, over a lunch of grilled fish, pasta and salad, Ms. Gbowee told her life story to Mr. Steinberger, Ms. Brown, Mr. Riggio and several other Barnes & Noble executives, at one point describing her defiant brushes with armed guards while protesting the civil war in Liberia, which ended in 2003.“You could have heard a pin drop,” Mr. Steinberger said.The idea for the book originally came from Ms. Brown, who suggested it to Ms. Gbowee after meeting her at a conference last year. It was written with the help of Carol Mithers, a journalist and author.“I wanted her to really put her whole self into it, to bring in all the enriching personal details that show you who she really is and what she’s done,” Ms. Brown said in an e-mail. But, Ms. Brown added, the budget at Beast Books would not have allowed for the tour that Ms. Gbowee has begun.In recent years many book tours have drastically changed format. Declining traffic in bookstores has forced publishers to look for other locations, so the authors who do go on tour often appear in grocery stores and casinos, at corporations and discount retailers, all in an effort to find potential book buyers where they shop and work.Ms. Gbowee’s tour is focused on universities, churches and nonprofit organizations, in keeping with the book’s themes of women’s rights and community activism. This month she will deliver a speech at the annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative; her tour includes appearances at a church in Washington and the Los Angeles Public Library. (She is not planning to do any readings or signings in bookstores, but local stores will sell books at events.)While Mr. Riggio said he met with authors on a regular basis — probably once a month — Ms. Gbowee stood out because of his longstanding interest in civil rights and nonviolent protest. He emphasized that the donation came from his personal funds, not through Barnes & Noble. (He declined to name the exact sum, saying only that it was “not a lot of money.”)“If you met her and she said, ‘I need some money to help me get my message out,’ ” Mr. Riggio said, “I guarantee you would write her a check.”'"
"'11-09-17,'0','The county defaulted on the debt in 2008 and has since been in acrimonious and mostly unproductive talks with creditors about what to do next. The creditors have called on the county to raise sewer rates, but many residents have said they should not have to pay more because contracts were signed amid so much lawbreaking.The new agreement calls for yearly rate increases, but smaller ones than creditors proposed in the past. It also calls for outside consultants to vet the sewer system’s expenditures and costs, for a low-income assistance fund to be created at creditor expense, and for the county to catch up on its audited financial statements, which have been late ever since 2008.Mr. Knight and others on the five-member commission said they decided to approve the deal because it would involve the state’s help for the first time. Gov. Robert Bentley is to call a special session of the state Legislature this fall, where lawmakers will be asked to work on several forms of assistance.First, the legislators are to create an independent public corporation to take the troubled sewer system off Jefferson County’s hands. Because Jefferson County is now in default on the existing sewer debt, it cannot issue new debt, which is an essential part of the planned restructuring. The new corporation would be able to issue the debt separately from the county, with a clean balance sheet.The legislators will also be asked to draft a “moral obligation covenant” for the corporation, meaning state money could be appropriated, upon approval, if the corporation fell behind on its debt payments. Although this covenant would not be as secure as a state guarantee, it would add a layer of credibility to help reduce the new corporation’s borrowing costs.In addition, state lawmakers are expected to look for ways to help Jefferson County close a $40 million budget gap that became apparent over the summer.Until this year, state officials refused to help the county straighten out its finances, saying it had made its own problems and should solve them on its own. That led to a hardening of public opinion in the county, with more and more people calling for the commission to declare bankruptcy.County Commissioner Sandra Little Brown said that since the state had finally offered some help, “it would really be a slap in the face to the governor and the Legislature” to turn it down. She pointed out that the framework agreement still gives the county a chance to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy court protection if the state’s efforts prove fruitless.The one commissioner to vote against the agreement, George F. Bowman, said he did so mainly because it included rate increases.In the meeting on Friday, he read part of a letter the commissioners had received from a county resident who urged them “not to accept the extraordinarily damaging terms,” particularly annual rate increases that could go on for as long as 40 years.'"
"'11-09-17,'0','Nazri Aziz, a government minister who overseas legal matters, said Friday that legislation would be introduced in Parliament next year because time was needed to work out the details, according to Agence France-Presse.A government statement described the proposed changes as the “biggest shake-up of the Malaysian system since independence from Britain in 1957.”Mr. Najib said in a televised address that the proposed changes underlined his “commitment to making Malaysia a modern, progressive democracy.”When he came to power in 2009, Mr. Najib promised a series of reforms, but he has been criticized for being slow to act.Public support for Mr. Najib has been falling, and his government was widely condemned for its handling of a protest in July calling for free and fair elections, at which the police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters.Ong Kian Ming, a political science lecturer at UCSI University in Kuala Lumpur, said that initial responses to the proposed changes in the security laws, “seem to be overwhelmingly positive, even from people and organizations who may be seen as being antigovernment.”Ibrahim Suffian, director of the Merdeka Center, an independent polling firm based in Kuala Lumpur, said the proposals were giving people “a sense of hope and a very positive feeling, especially among people who are not ideologically aligned with the government or the opposition.”But he said some people remained cautious about the laws that would replace the Internal Security Act and the Emergency Ordinance, saying that they wanted to see proof that the old laws were “really gone.”Opposition members said the proposed changes did not go far enough because they would still result in detentions.The vice president of the opposition People’s Justice Party, who goes by N. Surendran, called the moves “election gimmicks.” He said that the proposed changes to the media law were a “hollow reform” because the government would still be able to cancel a publication’s license.Almost 4,500 people were detained under the Internal Security Act between 2000 and 2010, and 37 people are now being held under the law, introduced in 1960.Mr. Najib said that the law that would replace the Internal Security Act would guarantee the rights of those detained and that no one would be detained solely because of political affiliation.'"

"'11-09-18,'0','Where all of this leaves the left-handed craftsman Mark Buehrle is anybody’s guess. Now 32, Buehrle has been a Cellular Field fixture since 2000, as dependable as your grandpa’s Buick while leading all of baseball in innings pitched and not missing a start since his first one on July 17 of that year. He was 21, and he strolled to the mound with Fernando Valenzuela-like self-assurance.Along with captain Paul Konerko, Buehrle has come to embody the workingman’s ethic that South Siders value alongside God, country and the Democratic Party — remember his ambling in to nail down the final-out save in Game 3 of the ’05 World Series, 48 hours after pitching seven innings as the Game 2 starter?“This is all I’ve ever known,” Buehrle said in a recent clubhouse conversation.He sounded as if the idea of pitching elsewhere had never occurred to him, but it will: Buehrle becomes a free agent when the season ends. Starting pitching is the most valued commodity in baseball, so there will be a strong market for the 200 innings and double-figures victory total Buehrle has provided each year for more than a decade. The question is whether the White Sox can afford to keep him as they pick up the pieces from their “all-in” commitment to 2011.“Buehrle is the most underrated pitcher in baseball,” Guillen said. “He doesn’t throw 100 miles an hour, and he doesn’t strike out 200 guys. All he does is take the ball every five days and pitch, compete, have fun. He doesn’t care about numbers.”Numbers, though, help define his worth. Buehrle has averaged more than 14 wins and 218 innings per season as a rotation starter. He allowed 3 or fewer earned runs over 18 straight starts during one stretch this season, putting to rest the retirement talk Buehrle floated during spring training. With the Sox falling out of contention, he was hit hard in his last three starts — 0-3, 11.78, 33 hits in 15.1 innings — but he clearly intends to keep pitching.“It’s easy for me to spend Jerry Reinsdorf’s money, but the Sox should realize that Mark Buehrle makes the other pitchers better,” said Steve Stone, the team’s TV analyst and a pitching connoisseur. “The Cubs didn’t realize that when they let Greg Maddux go. He was only 26, but the other pitchers fed off his work habits, his approach and his smarts. Buehrle is like that with the White Sox. And he’s a great teammate.”No one on the Sox has benefited from Buehrle’s presence more than John Danks, a fellow left-hander who pretty much is Buehrle with a little more zip on his pitches.“He kind of took me under his wing when I got here, and we talk all the time,” Danks said. “He’s taught me a ton about pitching: Attack the strike zone, change speeds, make ’em hit it.”Danks is 26 and a free agent after next season. Locking him up might be a wise commitment to the future, but it reduces the chances of retaining Buehrle.“I can’t imagine the White Sox letting him go to pitch somewhere else,” Danks said. “The p.r. hit would be massive.”A standing ovation greeted Buehrle as he left the mound Aug. 29 after pitching seven and two-thirds scoreless innings against the Twins. There was a wistful quality to the cheers, as if the fans sensed the last vestiges of something special.It was oddly reminiscent of July 23, 2009 — Buehrle’s perfect game. When Gabe Kapler crushed a drive to center field leading off the ninth inning, the crowd seemed to will the ball into DeWayne Wise’s glove as he hit the wall and held on. They wanted Buehrle to have that moment and to share it with him.“The fans here have always been great to me,” Buehrle said.They recognize a true professional. And in a way they’re acknowledging themselves. Mark Buehrle is Chicago.'"
"'11-09-18,'0','This time, it was Boyd picking apart Auburn’s defense, something Fairley, the Detroit Lions’ first-round pick, rarely let happen last season.Auburn (2-1) took a 14-0 lead in the first quarter before Boyd began hitting his targets over the final three periods. Clemson converted 10 straight third-down attempts during one stretch, sapping Auburn’s energy.“We got to get off the field on third down,” defensive back Ryan White said. “That killed our spirit. You go on the road, that takes a lot of energy, and you could see they rallied. They got the crowd into it and they couldn’t be stopped.”Auburn may have a dynamic offense, but its was last in Southeastern Conference defense coming in, and it showed at Death Valley. Clemson scored on five of six possessions at one point, and its 624 yards was the most it has ever totaled against an SEC opponent.Trailing by 38-24 in the fourth quarter, Auburn moved to Clemson’s 8. But Barrett Trotter was intercepted by Coty Sensabaugh, which ended the threat.“We’re angry that we lost that game,” Trotter said. “That goes without saying.”Clemson players jumped around in celebration when the clock struck zero, and fans swarmed the field. Coach Dabo Swinney told his players they had greatness in them but had to decide to show it.“I couldn’t think of a better place to end the streak than Death Valley, South Carolina, baby,” he said.Clemson had lost 14 straight to Auburn since a 34-0 win in 1951. That was also the last time Clemson posted as many yards of offense (524) against an SEC opponent. Clemson plays South Carolina, an SEC member since 1992, each year.Boyd’s touchdown passes included throws of 65 and 19 yards to the freshman receiver Sammy Watkins, who finished with 10 catches for 155 yards, setting Clemson records for a freshman.Trotter was continually harassed by Clemson’s defense, particularly in the second half, when he completed four passes. He finished 12 of 25 for 198 yards in his first road start.Auburn expected to see a mirror image of its offense out of Clemson: its new coordinator, Chad Morris, is a good friend and student of the Auburn offensive leader Gus Malzahn.But it was Malzahn’s well-honed attack that got the better of things early on, threatening to give the Atlantic Coast Conference another black eye in nonconference play.Malzahn said he and Morris spoke after the game and that he was glad for his friend’s success. He’s not happy, he said, that it came against Auburn.“We’re a work in progress,” Malzahn said. “We got to find a way to get better at doing everything. I feel strong that this group will be a successful offense.”'"
"'11-09-18,'0','But in places like Uttar Pradesh, the price of corruption can be far higher, witnessed not just in the deaths of the doctors but in the toll it takes on the health of India’s most vulnerable people.Uttar Pradesh is by almost any measure one of the most corrupt states in the nation. It also has some of the worst health statistics anywhere, including rates of infant and child mortality and malnutrition to rival sub-Saharan Africa. If Uttar Pradesh were independent, its 200 million people would make it the world’s fifth-largest nation, more populous than Brazil, a country with 35 times the land mass.In 2005, the government, led by the Congress Party, created the National Rural Health Mission, which sought to overhaul the delivery of health care to the rural poor by building hundreds of thousands of new clinics and hiring millions of health workers.Because of India’s federal structure, most of the work was carried out by state governments like the one here, run by a lower-caste leader, Mayawati, who once accepted a garland of 1,000-rupee notes from supporters worth about $36,000. Not all of the states were prepared to handle it, and here, at least, much of the money never fulfilled its promise.Some states fared much better, using the money effectively. Supporters of Mr. Hazare say that his demand for the creation of an ombudsman in every state could help stem corruption and protect whistle-blowers.The central government handed over the cash to Uttar Pradesh with virtually no oversight.Only after the doctors were killed did a review by the central government’s investigators find that contracts worth millions of dollars were granted without competitive bidding, and millions more was paid in full to contractors who did not complete the work they were required to do, leaving health centers in ruins and without vital equipment. The government failed to make its investigative report public; The New York Times acquired a copy from The Indian Express, a leading newspaper that broke the story about the scandal.Naseemuddin Siddiqui, Uttar Pradesh’s health minister, said that the state had asked for the central government’s inquiry. Asked for more details, he hung up the phone. Two state ministers have been forced to resign.It is hard to see where the money went. Two years ago state officials approved a plan to build a 30-bed health clinic in the village of Kurebhar, a three-hour drive from Lucknow. The new clinic would replace a four-bed site, which was straining to provide decent health services for 74 villages. More than $700,000 was budgeted for the project.The building was supposed to be ready last December. Nearly eight months past that deadline, the health center was still a skeleton of red brick.“We are trying to push them to do the work faster,” said J. L. Mishra, the chief medical officer in the Sultanpur district. But the government had already paid all the construction fees in advance, leaving almost no leverage.There is little evidence of the influx of cash in the health center. “We sometimes don’t even have soap for our hands,” said P. N. Tiwari, the center’s vaccination officer. “Meanwhile, they are looting like monkeys,” a reference, he said, to politicians, bureaucrats and contractors.Half a dozen babies are born in the clinic daily, but the water tank is broken, so deliveries are performed without running water. The center has an ambulance, but it, too, is broken. Repairs would cost only about $30, but there is no cash to pay for it.Crucial medical supplies, like oral rehydration salts for children with diarrhea, have been out of stock for months. Mr. Tiwari said that the money to fuel the generator ran out, leaving workers scrambling to keep vaccines cold.Mr. Tiwari, a 30-year veteran of the government health system, said he was among those who believed that the vast increase in health funds with so little oversight had led to murder.“Because of this money two doctors were killed,” he said. “A huge amount of money is involved, so a huge amount of crime is taking place.”Doctors started dying in Lucknow last October. When the first to die, Vinod Kumar Arya, was shot, the case was treated as a puzzling mystery: why would anyone kill a mild-mannered government doctor?The government did not immediately replace Dr. Arya, who had been the chief medical officer for the city, installing as interim chief a more junior officer, Dr. Y. S. Sachan. It was an important position that included responsibility for spending millions of dollars in rural health money from the central government.In February, a cardiologist, B. P. Singh, was named chief medical officer. He had accepted the job in March under pressure, relatives said, and felt a great deal of strain in the post.“He used to say there was a lot of corruption,” said a cousin, Inder Pratap Singh, a lawyer at Lucknow’s high court. Dr. Singh had begun keeping a diary of improprieties, Mr. Singh said, and complained that he was being pressured to approve false expenditures worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.On April 2, Dr. Singh was killed by two gunmen. A police investigation later concluded that the same weapon had been used in the killing of Dr. Arya.Suspicion fell on Dr. Sachan, a politically connected bureaucrat who had worked in the city’s health department for years. He was an associate of the minister who managed the health funds, Babu Singh Kushwaha, a close ally of Ms. Mayawati, the state’s chief minister. Dr. Sachan was arrested, but few people believed that a relatively junior bureaucrat would have carried out the murders on his own.Dr. Sachan’s wife, Malti, who is also a physician, said that her husband had been sacrificed to protect more powerful people.“He told me, ‘I am being framed in this case,’ ” she said.Dr. Sachan had told his wife that he feared someone would kill him and felt safer in jail. He had decided to reveal who had directed him to steal money from the health department, relatives said, in a court appearance.But the day before he was to appear he was found dead. Initially, officials ruled his death a suicide, but an autopsy revealed that he had bled to death from deep wounds that could not have been self-inflicted.“The intention was very clear,” said R. K. Sachan, Dr. Sachan’s brother. “He was going to disclose the involvement of senior politicians in the scam. That is why he was silenced.”The families of the dead doctors hope for justice, but they have kept their expectations low.“If he had been corrupt, he would have survived,” said Mr. Singh, Dr. Singh’s cousin. “Never will a senior bureaucrat or politician be convicted. Some small fish will suffer, but never the big ones.”'"
"'11-09-18,'0','If Sprint Nextel’s financial results were showing a nicely profitable business, humming in the shadows of its much bigger rivals, Verizon Wireless and AT&T, customers who hate meters could rejoice.Unfortunately, the company has not posted annual net profits since 2006. Mr. Souder says the unlimited plans have not contributed to the losses, saying Sprint has had four consecutive quarters of growth in average revenue per user and has reversed a trend of losing customers.Sprint has been monitoring use patterns and costs, and in January it increased the price of “Everything” plans for newly activated smartphones by $10 a month. The move has helped the company keep its business on a healthy, sustainable foundation, Mr. Souder says.Sprint is behaving more like some carriers across the Atlantic. Smaller operators in Europe “tend to be more aggressive in pricing strategies” and are using unlimited data plans to differentiate their offerings from larger rivals, says Thomas Tschentscher, a partner at the international law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer who specializes in telecommunications.In the United States, T-Mobile sells “unlimited” plans, too, but it throttles back the download speeds when data use passes a certain threshold each month.Mr. Tschentscher says that in Europe, data throttling is all but absent. “Because of the interoperability of the handsets, customers in Europe can easily switch carriers,” he says. “So it would be a competitive disadvantage for a carrier to impose throttling down if the others don’t.”Sprint says its network hasn’t been swamped by too many users wanting to watch movies or television shows on Android phones. “Long-form video on the handset today is still in its infancy,” Mr. Souder says. Of course, tablets are a different matter — and that’s why Sprint has never extended unlimited data plans to them.Asked what happens when smartphone screens become larger and some tablet computers become smaller, blurring the boundaries between the two, Mr. Souder said Sprint would “constantly evaluate our pricing strategy.”Sprint’s network has accommodated the arrival of Android phones. The iPhone may come to Sprint next month, if rumors on tech blogs prove accurate. Mr. Souder declined to respond to questions about how his network could absorb a sharp spike in data use if Sprint — speaking only hypothetically, of course — were to add an unnamed, but very, very popular smartphone.Some independent analysts see nothing but difficulties ahead for Sprint. Craig E. Moffett, a vice president and senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, says scale is essential to this business and is the reason that the only profitable major carriers are AT&T and Verizon Wireless.Mr. Moffett notes that Sprint has $4 billion in debt that will soon mature. It is also the majority owner of Clearwire, whose half-built 4G network covers only half the United States population. To have 4G cover the next 40 percent of the population, spread across a much wider area, it will have to build eight times as much infrastructure as required for the first phase, he says, adding: “It can’t afford to abandon Clearwire but it can’t afford to finish it either.”If Sprint doesn’t complete the next-generation network, it won’t be able to keep unlimited data plans for long, Mr. Moffett says, because “the burden on the 3G network will be too great.”There are no signs that Sprint will pull back from unlimited data, at least for now. In fact, the company seems to be staking its identity on the appeal of all-you-can-eat pricing. It may even expand the concept further.Speaking at the Dive Into Mobile conference last December, Daniel R. Hesse, Sprint Nextel’s C.E.O., talked about the logical next step: including the phone, tablet, PC, e-reader and whatever in a single plan. The idea was mentioned merely as a possibility, and it was not clear whether it would be feasible to have unlimited data for multiple devices on one plan — the ultimate in simplicity.Sprint’s unmetered wireless business needs more customers to reach scale. Salad eaters who like one worry-free, all-you-can-eat price are especially welcome at the table.'"
"'11-09-18,'0','“Without the roof, I just don’t think Saturday-Sunday is feasible any longer at this point,” said Federer, a six-time finalist.Andy Roddick said he saw the importance of television revenue but argued that back-to-back matches exhausted even the fittest finalist. “From a pure quality-of-tennis-player standpoint,” he said, “it’s obviously not the way to go.”The women also do not have a scheduled day off between the semifinals and the final. With the schedule backed up this year, the women’s semifinals had to be played after the men’s on Saturday, with the final less than 24 hours later on Sunday afternoon.“I definitely think that is not the best way to plan for the final,” said Serena Williams, who lost in the final to Samantha Stosur after winning a semifinal that ended about 11:30 p.m. the night before.Bad weather has, in fact, aided the men’s finalists for each of the last four years, as tournament officials had to move the match to Monday. But playing the men’s final on Monday afternoon, especially one as scintillating as the one between Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, hurts the bottom line.“I hated to see the Open cave in to the players and not finish on Sunday,” said Franklin Johnson, a U.S.T.A. board member for 11 years, who noted that the men’s final was not on CBS’s post-N.F.L Sunday broadcast for the fourth consecutive year.Backing up the men’s semifinals to Friday would not be a satisfactory solution to Johnson, who wrote in an e-mail, “The TV revenue from playing the men’s semis on Saturday instead of Friday is materially better.”Johnson suggested that the tournament begin on a Sunday, as the French Open does.“It is a great TV day and attractive for families if we offered a discounted family price,” he said.Gordon Smith, the tennis association’s executive director and chief operating officer, said he did not see a Sunday start in the short term. “But we clearly get the message, and I think in the longer term we will be looking and considering scheduling changes,” he said.It would not be easy, according to those who conduct the tournament.“If you can figure out a better way,” said Brian Earley, the tournament referee, cheerfully handing a reporter a spreadsheet with a 26-line, day-and-night schedule of men’s and women’s matches.Smith said the U.S.T.A. would consider a Sunday start only after consulting the players and the association’s television partners, which now include CBS, ESPN and the Tennis Channel.“If they want to put an extra day in, then they better increase the prize money substantially because it’s an extra day’s work for us,” Andy Murray said.That cost would be dwarfed, of course, by the expense of the most commonly cited remedy for rain delays: installing a retractable roof over the main stadium at Flushing Meadows.“A roof over Arthur Ashe is technologically extremely difficult to do,” said Smith, a top-level college tennis player in the 1970s. “And even if you could do it technologically, it is prohibitively expensive to do.”When the time comes to rebuild Ashe Stadium, Smith said, a roof would be “in the equation.” Asked whether the Ashe structure, now 15 years old, might be rebuilt within five years, he said: “It’s probably more than five. But I’d hate to put a number on it for that.”Djokovic might be waiting even longer for tarps to cover the courts.The tennis association said that covers might be fine for grass or clay, but that tests showed tarps can damage hardcourts by trapping moisture and causing surfaces to bubble.“Perhaps a system like Wimbledon where the tarps are inflated and kept that way by pumped air would work, but would take awhile to get going and the court would get wet while tarps were being deployed,” said Jay Snyder, a consultant to the U.S.T.A. who umpired at Wimbledon and served as the Open’s tournament director.Blowers would still be necessary to remove moisture, and covering and uncovering courts with tarps would take about the same amount of time as using blowers, Earley said.Besides, he added in an e-mail, “They are a pain to store.”'"
"'11-09-18,'0','Defending champion Serbia avoided elimination from the Davis Cup semifinals by beating Argentina in straight sets in Saturday’s doubles. Now the team is hoping Novak Djokovic can lead a comeback in the best-of-five series in Belgrade, Serbia.Nenad Zimonjic and Viktor Troicki defeated Juan Ignacio Chela and Juan Mónaco, 7-6 (4), 6-4, 6-2, to cut Argentina’s lead to 2-1 ahead of the reverse singles on Sunday. That is when the top-ranked Djokovic is expected to play Juan Martín del Potro in the first match.Djokovic pulled out of the opening singles Friday against David Nalbandian because of back pain, four days after beating Rafael Nadal in the United States Open final. He was replaced by Troicki, who lost, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.Djokovic led Serbia to its first Davis Cup title last year as it defeated France, 3-2, in the final.In the second reverse singles, Janko Tipsarevic is expected to face Nalbandian.FRANCE CUTS DEFICIT Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Michael Llodra cut France’s Davis Cup semifinal deficit to 2-1 with a doubles victory over Spain. Tsonga and Llodra routed Feliciano López and Fernando Verdasco, 6-1, 6-2, 6-0, in Córdoba, Spain.Spain can clinch a place in the final on Sunday, when Rafael Nadal is scheduled to face Gilles Simon in reverse singles, though the France captain, Guy Forget, may opt to play Tsonga against Nadal. Tsonga is the only French player with repeated wins over Nadal, although they have never met on clay.'"
"'11-09-18,'0','G.M. is the first of Detroit’s Big Three to reach a deal with the union. Details of the agreement were being withheld until the union can inform members, who will vote on ratification over the next two weeks.The union’s president, Bob King, said in a statement that union members would get a larger share of the profits from G.M.’s comeback from its federal bailout and bankruptcy in 2009.“When G.M. was struggling, our members shared in the sacrifice,” Mr. King said. “Now that the company is posting profits again, our members want to share in the success.”G.M.’s lead negotiator, Cathy Clegg, said the agreement allows G.M. to continue adding jobs as it increases market share in the United States.“We worked hard on a contract that recognizes the realities of today’s marketplace, enabling G.M. to continue to invest in U.S. manufacturing,” she said.Industry analysts said the union achieved its goals of balancing economic gains in the agreement with solidifying G.M.’s cost structure for future growth.“I think the U.A.W. went way beyond holding the line here,” said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “The union made some real gains in the contract in the context of where G.M. becomes a more competitive company.”“They are bringing back work from other countries,” Mr. Shaiken added. “In this environment, to be creating jobs is not an insignificant achievement.”Increasing jobs in the United States was a critical goal for U.A.W. leaders under pressure to show that the government’s bailout of G.M. is producing positive economic benefits.Mr. King took the unusual step of acknowledging the Obama administration’s support of the industry in his statement: “None of this would have been possible without the efforts of President Obama, who invested federal funds to help turn the company around, protect the auto supplier base and keep good-paying jobs in America.”The union said that it had successfully fought off G.M.’s proposals to weaken pensions and obtain major concessions on health-care benefits.Mr. King’s next task is to seek broad support among local union leaders and G.M. workers for the tentative deal. U.A.W. leaders from plants across the country are expected to gather in Detroit on Tuesday to hear the details.“No one’s going to like the entire contract,” said Jim Graham, president of U.A.W. Local 1112 in Lordstown, Ohio. “I’m not going to like all of it. But if I like 90 percent of it, I’m behind it.”He added: “I have no doubts it will get ratified.” Then Mr. King will most likely move to Chrysler, which is smaller and less profitable than G.M., and may not match the $5,000 bonuses.'"
"'11-09-18,'0','Among the worst came on July 27, 2002, when 77 people were killed and 543 injured after a military jet flew into a crowd of spectators and exploded at an air show at the Sknyliv Air Base in Ukraine. The pilots ejected from the aircraft and survived. In August 1988, 70 people were killed during a show at the United States air base in Ramstein, West Germany, when three jets from an Italian stunt-flying team collided and crashed into the crowd. Hundreds among the 350,000 spectators were severely injured.And even as federal aviation officials were arriving here on Saturday to take the lead in the investigation, a stunt pilot was killed in Martinsburg, W.Va., when his post-World War II plane crashed and burst into flames at an air show. No spectators were injured.The Federal Aviation Administration does have some oversight over air races, including the one here this weekend. Organizers must file plans with the agency showing any possible disruption of commercial flights, the location of spectators and the availability of emergency equipment. While supporters say that spectator safety is paramount at the events, and that they are closely regulated by the F.A.A., the world of air shows has a more accident-ridden recent past than the nation’s commercial carriers, which have strict rules about everything from hours worked to mandatory retirement age.Each of 19 previous fatal accidents in the Reno race involved only pilots, and each time they set off calls for increased safety. Race officials have heeded some of those calls, softening some of the sharp turns on the course after crashes in nearby neighborhoods in 1998 and 1999. In 2007 and 2008, four pilots were killed at the races, prompting local school officials to consider barring student field trips to the event, The Associated Press reported.But the annual races generate tens of millions of dollars for the Reno economy, and for the pilots, there is the lure of $1 million in prize money. On Friday, a Reno casino sports book — for the first time in the history of the race — took bets on the outcome. The betting was suspended after the crash.On Saturday afternoon, Mark Rosekind, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said investigators discovered both a “component” from the plane and a partial piece of its tail, where a three-foot crater marked the spot of impact. That discovery may lend credence to speculation about a mechanical failure of a critical control at the back of the plane known as the trim tab. But Mr. Rosekind said other issues were also under scrutiny, including the ages of the pilot and the plane, how the plane had been modified, its maintenance records and the race’s safety procedures.“We’re not just interested in the metal,” said Mr. Rosekind, who added that the board would also be evaluating the F.A.A.’s oversight of the air race.Fans of air racing are just as ardent as car racing fans, and see the danger as part of the sport.“I don’t think they should cancel air shows; you can’t take away every risk,” said Marcy Klatt, 46, a frequent air show spectator from Pembrook Pines, Fla. “Me getting in a car and driving down the street is a risk. You can get hit crossing the street or break your neck falling out of bed.”“You just do what you can to be sure that you’re putting in the safety procedures,” she added.Air race officials said that Mr. Leeward, a real estate developer from Ocala, Fla., had flown in the event many times. According to his Facebook page, he had more than 30 years of flight experience. He was flying a modified P-51 Mustang nicknamed the Galloping Ghost, and had commented in an interview with Live Airshow TV, which broadcasts aviation events, that his plane was “as fast as anybody in the field, or maybe even a little faster.”“We’ll see on Friday what happens,” he said.The accident occurred about 4:30 p.m. at Reno-Stead Airport, a small general aviation outpost in the hills north of the city, on a fair afternoon with little wind. It was the last race of the day, a marquee event noted for its blistering speeds, skilled pilots and altitudes as low as 100 feet.Mr. Leeward was running behind the leaders when disaster struck. “We saw them come through: No. 1, No. 2 and he was 3,” said Jack Reinholz, a retired police officer from California who was watching from a parking lot packed with R.V.’s just south of the airstrip. “And all of the sudden he pulled straight up.”R. John Hansman Jr., a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said P-51 Mustangs were “the fastest piston-engineered planes ever built,” capable of speeds of more than 400 miles an hour.Such conditions, he said, can turn fatal quickly. “It’s definitely higher risk than normal flight operations, sort of like racecars versus normal cars,” Dr. Hansman said. “They’re flying very, very close to the ground, so there is very little margin for error.”How high the death toll here might go was uncertain, but the shock of the accident was still palpable on Saturday, as witnesses and race participants struggled to make sense of what happened.“We’re here to entertain,” said David Costa, a pilot and owner of one of the competing airplanes. “We’re here to get their heart pumping a little bit. We’re not here to kill them.”One witness, Cameron Mason, an airplane mechanic, said he had seen the plane’s impact from a nearby hangar.“He crashed into an area where I was hoping there wouldn’t be a big crowd of people,” said Mr. Mason, who stood outside a crew area early Saturday morning, chain-smoking and shivering. “But there was.”Mr. Mason said that he and other aircraft mechanics at the race had spent the hours after the crash wondering if a failure of Mr. Leeward’s trim tab might have led to a more catastrophic mechanical error. “If it flutters enough,” he said, “your flight controls can rip off.”Such theories were still conjecture as investigators searched the wreckage on Saturday afternoon.The disaster was the latest in a series of deadly accidents this year at air shows. Last month, an aerial stuntman plunged 200 feet to his death as he attempted a plane-to-helicopter stunt in Harrison Township, Mich. He was standing on the wing of a small plane, then twice grabbed the skid of a helicopter and fell on the third try. Days before that, a pilot was killed in Kansas City, Mo., as his plane spiraled into a fiery crash after he could not complete a stunt meant for the show.On Saturday afternoon, a pall had fallen over the airstrip, as followers of the sport — who track planes and pilots the way some fans might follow the Yankees — pulled up stakes and headed home. Crews, some still wearing flight suits, also prepared to leave, as dozens of vending stands sat abandoned.But despite the accident, most spectators interviewed on Saturday said that the races should continue.Mark Rouch, 44, a private pilot, said he had attended the Reno races for more than two decades and seen other accidents unfold. “I don’t know that they could change anything,” he said. “It’s a tragedy. But the sport is what it is.”To be sure, competitors have been killed in the Reno air races before. In 2007, three pilots died in three crashes over four days — one when his plane stalled shortly after takeoff, another when his jet crashed during a race and the third after colliding with another pilot. In 2008, a pilot died when the wings fell off her home-built plane during practice, the 19th death in the history of the races, which started in 1964.But Mr. Costa, the competitor, said that Friday’s accident was different, taking the lives of those on the ground as well as one of those plowing through the air.“We fly fast aircraft, close to the ground,” he said. “We sign up for that. But nobody wants to see anybody in the crowd get hurt.”'"
"'11-09-18,'0','But the limited dining and lodging options — tourist accommodations were either tents or hostels (or looked like them) and restaurants were more like canteens — kept most international travelers away. Now Rocha is undergoing a discreet transformation. In the last few years, Uruguayans and Argentines in search of rest and rusticity have begun visiting the area, buying land and building elegant summer homes. Some have become innkeepers or restaurateurs, stepping in to fill the hospitality gap and drawing more and worldlier clients.La Pedrera’s first boutique hotel, Brisas, opened in late 2009. Laura Jauregui, an Argentine who has traveled the world working for multinational technology firms, bought and renovated the 14-room property near the village’s scenic cliffside promenade, decorating it with a mix of midcentury finds and custom-made rattan furniture. Televisions and telephones are purposely missing.Ms. Jauregui said she considered the hotel, housed in a building constructed in the early 1900s, an investment. “The Uruguayan coast has always been very popular, and it’s been moving progressively toward the north,” she said. Yet she was surprised by the “geometric growth” of her business after just a year. “We were fully booked this season, from Christmas until Carnival,” Ms. Jauregui said. “Many people who were in José Ignacio last year are here now.”It took José Ignacio, just outside Punta del Este, about a decade to go from sleepy fishermen’s village to enclave of luxury and exclusivity. While it retained its rustic low-rise architecture, it also became home to $800-a-night rooms and restaurants with hard-to-book tables from Christmas to February, the peak season. But the unspoiled, unplugged feeling that once made it so attractive can still be found in La Pedrera.“Here it’s two steps behind,” Susie Galbraith, a British marketing executive who was traveling with Mr. West, said sitting in the lobby at Brisas. “It’s a bit more hippie, and more quaint.”Residents like to say that watches and mirrors are beside the point in La Pedrera; people eat when they’re hungry, sleep when they’re tired and wear whatever they want. And what they want to wear, it seems, are mostly flip-flops and bathing suits.After all, much of life unfolds on the sand. Playa del Barco, a wide beach with rough waves and a distinctive sculpture of sorts — the rusty bow of a cargo ship that sank there in the 1970s — has visitors well into the night, mostly 20-somethings who gather around bonfires.Night-life options are limited, especially for those over 30, but La Pedrera has a growing stable of restaurants. Olinda, which opened in 2010 in an old house, is a cozy spot with brick walls, vintage tiles and wooden chairs. It serves well-executed international dishes like curried chicken with mixed greens and rib-eye steak with garlic mashed potatoes. The back patio, open until 3 a.m., is a good option for late-night drinks.Another relative newcomer is Lo de Charlie, the outpost of a seafood restaurant in Punta del Este. At this smaller but equally colorful space, the owner and chef Charlie Begbeder added sushi to his roster of classics like sautéed baby squid and garlic shrimp. And at Darwin, a parrillada (or steakhouse) decorated with artfully mismatched antiques, the barman prepares tasty variations of the caipiroska, replacing lemon wedges with blackberries and other fresh fruits.Some people fear that with these arrivals La Pedrera risks losing its appeal. But development has been quite slow, partly because to drive there from Punta del Este, the hub of the Uruguayan Riviera, involves a roundabout route that takes about 90 minutes. The most direct path between the two locations, a panoramic coastal highway, is interrupted by the Garzón and Rocha Lagoons. While cars can cross the Garzón Lagoon on a shabby raft that carries up to four vehicles at a time, a process that is both impractical and anachronistically charming, right now there’s no way across the larger Rocha Lagoon. (Bridges would make the trip from Punta del Este about half as long.)Still, its relative isolation was — and is — a large part of the appeal. One of La Pedrera’s most notable pioneers was Julio Bocca, the renowned Argentine ballet dancer. He rented a house there about a decade ago, and within days was found by paparazzi, who chronicled his every move for gossip magazines and generated buzz about the village. Undeterred, Mr. Bocca has returned to Rocha many times over the years. “It’s a wonderful place,” he said. “The beaches are gorgeous, and the quiet nights are incredible.”More privacy can be found farther north. Five miles up the coast from La Pedrera is San Antonio, a settlement of about 30 houses that’s lined with sandbanks and is reportedly attracting Argentine actors and artists who want to escape the limelight. “This is the kind of place that people discover only through word of mouth,” said David Tezanos Pinto, owner of Posada San Antonio, a rough-hewn but chic four-room guesthouse that opened in late 2005. Mr. Tezanos Pinto, who divides his time between Rocha and Buenos Aires, was one of the first foreigners to arrive in the area. When he bought the property — an old carpentry shop surrounded by a eucalyptus forest — there were no real roads, only paths carved by the occasional utility vehicle.“My wife and I traveled all over the world looking for a place to build a small inn and change our lifestyle,” he said. “The combination of countryside and beach was what really attracted us.” The posada has a restaurant — the only one in San Antonio — with a rotating menu that typically includes freshly caught fish. There’s also a small pool, made out of a round cattle tank and, less than a half-mile away, a seemingly endless beach.Going north again you’ll find Posada Buscavida on a barely populated stretch of coast called Oceanía del Polonio. It is the first and most secluded boutique lodging in Rocha, with 10 austere rooms and a not-so-austere clubhouse, where guests can lounge on oversize white sofas and order perfect fried calamari, or walk a few steps to the beach bar and sip a chilled martini bianco on a hammock.Buscavida, which is open in the Southern Hemisphere’s summer, can arrange horseback rides to nearby Cabo Polonio, perhaps Rocha’s most emblematic site. El Cabo, as locals call it, is a protected sand-dune reserve with no roads, no electricity, hundreds of sea lions and a dozen or so shacks, many painted in bright colors. In January and February, the warmest months, Cabo Polonio fills with visitors who come to experience beach life as it was hundreds of years ago.“Rocha has so many places that are still pristine,” Mr. Bocca said. “You can get into a four-wheel-drive and easily find a completely deserted beach, and disconnect from the world.”There are no direct flights from New York to Rocha. The nearest commercial airport is in Punta del Este, about 80 miles away, but flying into Montevideo’s Aeropuerto de Carrasco, another 70 miles away, is usually cheaper. From Montevideo, rent a car or take one of the Rocha-bound buses that stop at the airport daily.Brisas, just steps from La Pedrera’s Desplayado beach, has 14 comfortable rooms, with doubles starting at $180 in the summer. (La Pedrera, Ruta 10, kilometer 229; 598-4479-2265; brisasdelapedrera.com.)Posada San Antonio is a rough-hewn but chic guesthouse surrounded by a eucalyptus and pine forest. The property has a round pool made out of a steel stock tank, and the beach is a five-minute walk away.

"'11-09-18,'0','WHEN the notion of the Park Avenue Armory’s becoming a temporary home for the New York Philharmonic during a proposed refurbishing of Avery Fisher Hall (still waiting) was raised, listeners were understandably skeptical: could the hangarlike Wade Thompson Drill Hall possibly be configured as an acoustically appropriate space for concert performances? Those doubts began to vanish in 2008, when the Lincoln Center Festival presented Bernd Alois Zimmermann’s opera “Die Soldaten” at the armory. And in February, the armory itself brought in Eighth Blackbird, the adventurous new-music ensemble, to assemble its first Tune-In Festival, which was judged a hit.Tune-In returns (Feb. 23 to 26) in an installment that is essentially a four-day celebration of Philip Glass’s 75th birthday, a milestone he reaches on Jan. 31. Mr. Glass programmed everything but the opening concert. But that event — a work based on Allen Ginsberg’s epic poem “Kaddish,” commissioned for the occasion from the jazz guitarist Bill Frisell — has at least a tangential connection with Mr. Glass, whose “Hydrogen Jukebox” (1990) and Sixth Symphony (“Plutonium Ode,” 2002) are settings of Ginsberg poetry.More of Ginsberg’s work will be heard in the second armory concert. The rock poet Patti Smith will read Ginsberg poetry, and Mr. Glass will play some of his piano works as an accompaniment.On the third night the Philip Glass Ensemble will give a complete performance of Music in 12 Parts (1971-74) a seminal, nearly four-hour immersion in the techniques and processes that Mr. Glass developed early in his career (just before he composed his epochal first opera, “Einstein on the Beach”). And the series ends with another crucial but rarely heard early work, “Another Look at Harmony,” Part 4 (1975), a fascinating hourlong piece for organ and large chorus in which Mr. Glass mulled over gradually shifting relationships among harmony, melody and rhythm. The organist will be Michael Riesman, Mr. Glass’s longtime music director; the Brooklyn Youth Chorus and the Collegiate Chorale will sing the involved, bright-hued vocal music.Fans of Mr. Glass’s energetic music will have plenty more opportunities to revel in his work. The New York Philharmonic, having ignored Mr. Glass’s work all these years — none of his music has been performed at a Philharmonic subscription concert — will join forces with the Philip Glass Ensemble for the stunning 1982 film score “Koyaanisqatsi,” in which Mr. Glass began to trade in repetition for an almost neo-Romantic sense of harmony and color. This was the soundtrack to Geoffrey Reggio’s meditation about mankind’s negative influence on the planet, and Mr. Riesman will conduct two performances to accompany screenings of the film at Avery Fisher Hall (Nov. 2 and 3).Just as the final basso profundo chants of “Koyaanisqatsi” are fading away, the Metropolitan Opera will revive its Phelim McDermott production of Mr. Glass’s second opera, “Satyagraha” (1980), a metaphorical telling of Gandhi’s early life and the development of his nonviolent approach to political protest with a libretto drawn from the Bhagavad Gita (opens Nov. 4). And for listeners who want to hear what Mr. Glass has been up to more recently, Dennis Russell Davies leads the American Composers Orchestra in the American premiere of the Ninth Symphony at Carnegie Hall (Jan. 31). Mr. Davies and the Bruckner Orchestra Linz give the work’s premiere in Linz, Austria, on Jan. 1, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic takes it up in the spring at Walt Disney Concert Hall (April 5 to 7).'"
"'11-09-18,'0','For the essayist the past is less a foreign country than a home address, a lodestar or touchstone, in Phillip Lopate's words the “Aladdin’s lamp which he or she never tires of rubbing.” It is more markedly so in a collection assembled over time, or in the case of Jonathan Raban, over the two decades this eloquent Englishman has spent in America. Raban presents his selections humbly, mindful of the gap that separates American from British English. “The longer I stay here,” he writes, “the more conscious I am of nuances to which I must still remain deaf.” It is impossible not to take to the author of a book called “Driving Home” who reveals that on his arrival he made the greatest of idiomatic American mistakes: he bought the wrong car. Less than gently, the woman for whom he had crossed the ocean translates. What message does his black Dodge Daytona communicate? “Midlife crisis,” she answers. “Who drives them?” he asks. “Kids. Black teenagers. Gang members,” she replies, crisply. She sounds very much aware that she is interpreting for a man who previously assumed Oregon to be an invention of Bernard Malamud.Raban offers the work of his expatriate years up wholesale, billing his essays as readings “of the American landscape, literature and politics, along with some backward glances to England that may betray a lurking nostalgia for a society more settled in its shape, more instinctively known, than the one I live in now.” The displacement, the attention to a familiar, foreign language, the lurking sense of another world account in large part for his success. The comprehensiveness is more ­problematic.Raban takes as his hero William Empson, the influential critic whose work Raban discovered over his first college summer and whom he would befriend a decade later. It was Empson who encouraged him to dive below the surface of the page. It was Empson who taught him to slow down, “to listen, savor, question, ponder, think,” of which Raban does a great deal here as he conjures with his new home, with the Pacific Northwest, with history, poetry, geography, catastrophe. He continues his love affair with water, as ever Raban’s natural element. Among the aquatic essays come his travel writings, his reviews, his personal and political pieces, assembled in rough chronological order.Essay collections are the stuff of day trips rather than extended holidays, but this one makes for an uneven journey all the same. It will reward the reader who dips in and out. Raban is always fluent, regularly epigrammatic, sometimes rev­elatory. In acknowledging the Pacific Northwest’s appeal to “hopefuls and new-lifers of every imaginable cast,” he notes that Seattle is about resurrection as much as relocation. The salvation of wildlife blurs easily into the salvation of self in that corner of the country, where recycling operates on many levels. Driving the wrong car does nothing to blunt Raban’s powers of perception; in America, he observes, “where the lust for the antique is no less keen than in Britain, the true antiquity is wilderness.” In one of his finest essays, Raban dissects President Obama's Inaugural Address. Leave it to an Englishman to read every speech since George Washington’s. (Well, leave it to an Englishman to admit he skimmed all 56.) Raban locates a subversive point in Obama’s address, artfully buried in platitude. He reminds us, too, that Obama thanked his predecessor for his service to his country in five words. He thanked him for leaving in 10.Either because he learned his Empson lessons well, by reason of temperament, or because he has never stopped holding the receiver close to his foreign-born ear, Raban knows how to listen. Several times I found myself wondering — not only on account of his velvety prose — if he sings. Again in a political essay, he parses Obama’s campaign speeches to find the clear cadences of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. (Presciently, Raban noted in 2008 that crowds turned out for the sermons, but the eyes glazed over when the ­candidate-evangelist delivered policy talks instead. From “this scrupulous agnostic” the public hungered for “the ecstatic consolation of old-time religion.”) Raban has an ear. Who else has noticed that Obama is a “melancholy baritone,” George W. Bush a “scratchy tenor” and Sarah Palin — don’t even try to pretend you knew this already — a mezzo-soprano?Raban is no slouch himself when it comes to coloratura. His voice is supple and sumptuous, seductive even when his point is highly debatable. Lewis and Clark may be “America’s foremost male couple,” but I’m not sure they qualify as the most endearing figures in our history. Raban knows that the best essayist trusts in drift and digression and habitually adds a literary trill. He is an erudite but adaptable companion, tart and genial, promiscuous in experience yet reliable in temperament. He is on the page as he professes to be on the water, without a flag, “preferring to think of the boat as an independent republic; liberal-democratic in temper, easygoing in its manners, bookish in its daily conversation.” Generally, he displays a sailor’s sense of decorum. We get to know his love of good late-night talk (Seattle goes to bed hopelessly early for his taste); his weakness for Waugh; his affection for the authentic, the seedy, the regional. On the other hand, we get to know some of these things too well. Raban moves from London to Seattle more times in these pages than I could count. No one has ever eked so much copy out of his adopted city’s devotion to REI, Eddie Bauer and Velcro; its deracinated feel; the calamitous migration, to the suburbs, of great dim sum.“Driving Home” bogs down in those repetitions but is especially waterlogged by its comprehensiveness. A little judicious pruning would have worked wonders. The opening essay, Raban’s meander around the West, feels stale, as indeed it should; it not only predates GPS but was published in 1993. A desultory 18-year-old article explaining America to a foreign readership is perhaps not the best place to open a collection in any event. After Katrina it is difficult to appreciate Raban’s account, however closely observed, of the Mississippi climbing out of its banks in 1993. And a five-year anniversary piece about 9/11, written for a British audience, is surely one for the file drawer. Motley is fair in a collection. Moth-eaten is not. There is the past, in all its rosy glory, and there is the recent past, wan and immature. Too many of these essays occupy a soggy middle ground, not so much half-ripe as beyond their expiration date.'"
"'11-09-18,'0','BUNNY tails, bustiers and white-glove deference. It almost seems like men have gone mad on “Mad Men,” wresting network television backward to the boom-boom, coffee, tea or me 1960s.Whether it’s the come-hither stewardesses of “Pan Am” on ABC or the bunnies on the NBC drama “The Playboy Club,” or even the rejiggled jiggle TV of “Charlie’s Angels” on ABC, the new fall season seems intent on reliving the days when men were men, and women were girls who didn’t mind getting less pay and having their garters snapped.It’s tempting to brand all this retro programming as wish fulfillment for network executives trying to ride the success of “Mad Men” to suit their own tastes and universal male fantasies. But it’s not of course. Most of network television nowadays is for women and about women.And these nostalgic series may be to female audiences what series like “Combat!” and “Band of Brothers” have been for so many men — a chance to relive historic battles in all their glory as well as horror. Many men are fascinated by their predecessors’ exploits and sacrifices at Guadalcanal or the Battle of the Bulge. And plenty of women are increasingly curious about their mothers’ struggles with illegal abortion, men-only clubs and mandatory girdles — “Band of Bunnies.”The power shift is most obvious in a new wave of sitcoms about young single women. On Fox “New Girl,” which stars Zooey Deschanel, was created by Liz Meriwether, a member of a posse of high-powered Hollywood writers known as “the Fempire.” The comedian Whitney Cummings not only is the star and executive producer of “Whitney” on NBC but also helped write and is an executive producer of “2 Broke Girls” on CBS.Ms. Deschanel plays an adorable nerd who wraps three male roommates around her little finger. Ms. Cummings’s series showcase heroines who are less postfeminist than pre-Amazon; they are hard-edged sophisticates who don’t expect much from men besides sex, maybe, and who instead find fulfillment in the company of fellow warrior queens, which is to say urban warrior queens who battle cellulite and New York City landlords.“Apartment 23,” an ABC comedy that is scheduled for midseason, is even more brazen, featuring a semi-sociopath who sleeps with her roommate’s boyfriend and traffics in black market A.D.D. medication. “Anyone want to study like an Asian teenager?” she says, holding up her stash.Not surprisingly, perhaps, new comedies about men, like “Man Up!” and “Last Man Standing” (both on ABC) and “How to Be a Gentleman” (CBS), mine the humor in emasculation.The comedies depict the battle of the sexes as a victory for women — a pyrrhic one. The period dramas instead showcase heroines at the dawn of the women’s movement.There is horror in seeing how dismissively many men treated women back then, but also a kind of pleasure in revisiting — with hindsight — a noble cause played out in a simpler time. Sexism hasn’t been vanquished, obviously, but it has splintered into more subtle, ambiguous channels. Back then it was overt, coarse and overdue for assault.“Pan Am,” set in 1963 when the airline was a symbol of progress and cosmopolitan savoir faire, has a “Mad Men” gloss: lush cinematography and Buddy Greco singing “Around the World.”One of the executive producers is Nancy Hult Ganis, a former Pan Am flight attendant, who relied on her own experiences. One of the earliest scenes shows the airline’s mandatory weigh-in and a sour-faced matron slapping the fanny of one of her charges to make sure her girdle is on. She warns a sleek French stewardess not to wear dark stockings, saying, “This is not a cabaret.” The stewardesses suffer indignity with accepting smiles, because it’s a small price to pay for freedom of the skies. (One is a runaway bride who couldn’t face a life of suffocating subservience in a pre-Betty Friedan suburbia.)The male characters are almost comically weak: the married man who cheats, the deadbeat beatnik who can’t tell Marx from Hegel, the insecure co-pilot who demands to be called “first officer.” The women, on the other hand, are filmed in a gauzy haze of golden light as idealists who yearn for adventure and battle limitations with sisterly solidarity. In one shot four of them glide in tight blue uniforms and white gloves through a gleaming Pan Am terminal like the astronauts in “The Right Stuff.” As they pass, a little girl watches them through a glass window, awestruck. They are, as one pilot puts it, “a new breed.”The same is true of the cocktail waitresses in rabbit ears on “The Playboy Club,” who endure tight corsets and loose manners because the money is good and the opportunities better than back home. And particularly when compared with the desperate blond bubbleheads who wash up at the doorstep of the senescent Hugh Hefner on the reality show “The Girls Next Door,” these fictional bunnies come off as Simone de Beauvoir.'"
"'11-09-18,'0','Ms. Hall, 29, is amused at suggestions she’s heard that having her play produced in London was a savvy strategic move.“Everyone thinks I was a sneaky girl who had this play produced over there because it was controversial,” she said in an interview. “The fact was, the opportunity arose. I had acted in the director James Dacre’s play three years before. I e-mailed him the play, and a couple of weeks later he e-mailed me and said he’d convinced his theater to do it. At the time I was working on a bare-bones workshop production here. After the workshop I flew to London and two days later was working on a full production — in a theater over a pub.”Ms. Hall’s desire to write grew out of her frustrations as an actress.“At Columbia I took an acting course, and my acting partner and I were assigned to do a scene from a play with two young black women,” she recalled. “We go to the library and start pulling down plays, and eventually gave up. ‘Maybe we can share the role of Tituba in ‘The Crucible’?” she remembered saying. “In that moment I thought, I have to write.”Her ebullience over reaching Broadway is tempered by an awareness that this season is hardly a usual one. “I’m used to the Great White Way being the Great White Way,” she said, “so yes it feels really good. But I’m hesitant to celebrate because next season we may be back to white male writers only. Let’s be cautious.”Ms. Diamond’s “Stick Fly,” a comedy about generational conflicts in a well-to-do black family on Martha’s Vineyard, comes to Broadway after achieving a critical mass of well-received productions at regional theaters across the country. She mentioned Mr. Leon’s championing of the play, which he directed in a co-production for the Arena Stage in Washington and the Huntington Theater Company in Boston, as being integral to attracting the interest of Broadway producers. Among them, adding a soupçon of the necessary star luster all but required for presenting plays on Broadway these days, is the pop singer-songwriter Alicia Keys. The cast includes the TV and movie actor Mekhi Phifer and the stage veteran Ruben Santiago-Hudson.Ms. Diamond, 41, acknowledged the excitement arising from a comparatively unknown playwright splashing down on Broadway; her only previous New York production was a staging of “The Bluest Eye,” an adaptation of the Toni Morrison novel, at the small Duke on 42nd Street theater. But having forged a 20-year career as a playwright outside the sometimes insular precincts of New York, she has always seen the American theater as a much larger canvas.“When you decide to major in playwriting in college,” she explained, “aunts and uncles say, ‘Oh I hope one day we’ll see your plays on Broadway.’ But the way you build a career in Chicago is very different. You don’t necessarily think of Broadway as the light at the end of the tunnel.”Ms. Diamond hesitated to opine on the issue of whether black audiences remain underserved on Broadway, but she has witnessed the enthusiasm and the sheer numbers of African-Americans coming to Broadway that has made the recent revivals of “Fences,” and “A Raisin in the Sun” (also directed by Mr. Leon) and the all-black staging of “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,” directed by Debbie Allen, solid hits. (An all-black “Streetcar Named Desire” is on the docket for 2012.)“I remember standing in line for ‘The Color Purple’ with my in-laws and my mother,” in 2005, she said, “and seeing black audiences lined up around the block twice. That was sort of mind blowing for me. I thought, I don’t know why we don’t see more things like this here if there are this many people lining up to see them.”But even at the major regional theaters where her work has been produced, Ms. Diamond noted that she has had to take a hand in recruiting African-American audiences, which do not normally make up a large percentage of regular subscribers.“I’ve worked very hard with marketing people to include African-Americans,” she said. “I know that there’s a huge population interested in seeing themselves reflected onstage.” Yet, she added, “At the same time I don’t think my work speaks only to an African-American audience.”Mr. Leon pointed to other black female writers who deserve to have their work seen on New York’s largest — or at least most paid-attention-to — stages.“Lynn Nottage is a top-of-the-line, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer who should have her plays on Broadway,” Mr. Leon said. “Regina Taylor is writing some great work. Pearl Cleage is still writing good plays.”It is, of course, an uphill battle for any emerging playwright to new work presented on Broadway. But while Ms. Hall cheerfully said, “The fact that me and Lydia and Suzan are coming to Broadway I have to see as something of a triumph,” she still has discouraging memories of regional theaters, where much new American work first gets seen.“I’ve had frank conversations with theaters who say, ‘We love your play, but we’ve already done a play by another black person this year,’ or ‘I don’t think the kind of people you write about are the ones our audience wants to see,’ ” she said. “Up and coming young black female writers are still struggling to have their voices heard and have their plays produced. I may be on the mountain right now, but they are still in the trenches.”'"

"'11-09-19,'0','In a statement earlier Sunday, the president of UConn, Susan Herbst, lent some credence to the speculation that the university was looking for a new conference. She hailed the university for being a charter member of the Big East but added that it would be proactive in discussions with other leagues.That made the revelation that UConn was pursuing membership to the A.C.C., which was first reported by ESPN.com, perhaps less surprising.It was her role, Herbst said in the statement, to “stay in constant communication and be actively involved in discussions with our counterparts from around the country to ensure the successful long-term future of our university’s athletic program.”UConn finds itself in a particularly tricky situation, despite its recent athletic success, which includes winning the men’s N.C.A.A. tournament basketball title in April. The university has essentially been functioning without an athletic director for almost a month. Herbst, the former executive vice chancellor for the University System of Georgia, formally took over in June. Paul Pendergast takes over as the interim athletic director Monday, succeeding Jeff Hathaway, who resigned Aug. 19.Pernetti said that Rutgers was “engaged with several parties,” and that the conversations had occurred before this weekend’s upheaval. Pernetti would not say whether Rutgers would be better off leaving the Big East.“I don’t know that I could say one way or another,” Pernetti said during a conference call Sunday. “We continue to be well positioned as the landscape continues to shift. You could evaluate that from your perspective however you want to evaluate that.”In particularly candid comments, Pernetti asserted that unanimity on many fronts was the most important attribute for a conference, and that it was “the one thing that continues to challenge the Big East.”Pernetti may have been referring to a television contract the Big East recently declined. Officials from Pitt led an effort to reject what would have been a lucrative deal, with Pernetti, a former television executive, also part of that group. The deal was similar to the $155 million yearly package that the A.C.C. signed last year. In retrospect, it appears to have been a mistake for the Big East, which has a number of members that lack a major football program.The Big East’s remaining members, including St. John’s, Seton Hall, Villanova and Georgetown, appear to be in limbo while awaiting the conference carousel to stop spinning.'"
"'11-09-19,'0','The Hamas charter calls for eliminating Israel, but the Islamist movement’s public statements have been vague on whether that remains its ultimate goal. Generally, its leaders speak of full Palestinian sovereignty in the 1967 lines and a 20-year truce without granting Israel recognition.The movement’s stand on the United Nations effort has produced some confused discussion here in Gaza, in particular on the question of why Hamas finds itself on the same side as Israel and the United States and on the opposite side of nearly everyone else. Mr. Haniya said Sunday that Hamas’s position was based on the desire to protect Palestinian rights, while Israel and the United States objected to Palestinian membership for the opposite reason: to take rights away.In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel told his cabinet that the Palestinian membership drive would fail. He said he was convinced that between the American veto and the help of other unspecified governments, the Palestinian effort at the United Nations Security Council would go nowhere. He was also dismissive of another option, an approach to the General Assembly, where the Palestinians would be almost guaranteed a majority in favor of upgrading their status to that of a nonmember observer state.Mr. Netanyahu described the General Assembly as a forum “in which almost any decision can be passed. It is possible to decide there that the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, and this would pass there,” he said, adding, “But it has neither the same weight nor the same importance.”In Gaza, Hamas has been holding workshops and seminars, mostly attended by its supporters, to develop arguments against the United Nations effort. At one such event held last week at the Palestinian Engineers Syndicate, Mushier al-Masri warned that accepting a Palestinian state on the 1967 lines puts the Palestinian cause in danger because it yields the rest to Israel. “This includes an implicit concession of nearly 80 percent of the land of Palestine,” he said.Mr. Masri also said that, under current discussions, Palestinian refugees would be denied the right of return to their original homes and villages inside what is today Israel, instead forced to find homes in Gaza or the West Bank.Hamas has banned any public support of Mr. Abbas’s United Nations drive, according to a Fatah official in Gaza, Abdullah Abu Samhadana.On Sunday, Ahmed Yousef, who until a few months ago was political adviser to Mr. Haniya and a well-known voice for Hamas to the West, objected to the ban. This “comes at a time when the world, especially Turkey and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation” stand with Mr. Abbas, Mr. Yousef told Voice of Palestine radio. “This also amounts to repression of freedom of expression.”'"
"'11-09-19,'0','BERLIN — Siemens, the largest engineering conglomerate in Europe, announced Sunday that following the German government’s decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022, it would stop building nuclear power plants anywhere in the world.“The chapter for us is closed,” Peter Löscher, the chief executive of the Munich-based conglomerate, said in an interview with Der Spiegel, the weekly news magazine. He emphasized the company’s commitment to the rapidly growing renewable energy sector.He said the decision was also “an answer” to political and social opposition to nuclear power in Germany.Siemens, which built all of Germany’s 17 nuclear power plants, is the first big company to announce such a shift in strategy. But other German companies involved in the nuclear energy industry are also reconsidering their options.In May, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the accident at the nuclear power station in Fukushima, Japan, had convinced her that Germany should look to other power sources. The decision represented a turnaround for Mrs. Merkel, who a year ago agreed to prolong the life of the country’s nuclear plants by an average of 12 years.'"
"'11-09-19,'0','The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press proposed last week that the Supreme Court adopt a new rule saying every document filed in or by the court “shall be available to the public for inspection” unless it orders that the document be sealed. That presumption of openness would be in the interest of everyone — the Supreme Court, lawyers who practice before the court, scholars who study the court and, of course, the American public.It is sometimes necessary to restrict public access to court documents — to protect privacy, genuine secrets and people in danger, and for other reasons. But in the last 18 years, the court has gone from allowing records to be sealed in two cases per term to 24 last term out of 9,066 petitions for review. While the fraction remains tiny, the increase is disturbing.Informed self-government is essential to a healthy democracy. The First Amendment’s guarantees of free speech and press are intended to ensure that. It is important that the Supreme Court’s rules reflect its long-stated preference for the open administration of justice.The court has ruled that access to proceedings and records in criminal cases can be limited only in exceptional circumstances. Federal appeals courts have said so convincingly about civil proceedings, including records. But the Supreme Court needs a clear rule that ensures transparency whenever possible.The Reporters Committee urges the court to adopt a rule about the presumption of public access like that of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Judge Frank Easterbrook of that circuit wrote, “The political branches of government claim legitimacy by election, judges by reason. Any step that withdraws an element of the judicial process from public view makes the ensuing decision look more like fiat.” His argument is compelling.'"
"'11-09-19,'0','But the Fed also faces mounting pressure against additional action, including strident criticism from Republican presidential candidates and divisions in the policy-making committee. Moreover, the options available to the central bank have less power to generate growth, a greater chance of negative consequences, or both, than those it has already tried.Some close watchers of the central bank say investors’ behavior could let the Fed offer a token gesture now, postponing any larger move at least until its next meeting in November. After all, the Fed is reaping the benefits of action without the costs.“There is no reason for the Fed to rush,” Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson/ICAP, wrote in a recent note to clients predicting such an outcome. “It is in the Fed’s interest to milk the anticipation effect as long as possible.”The move markets are anticipating is a new effort to reduce long-term interest rates, which would allow businesses and consumers to borrow more cheaply. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to a record low of 1.88 percent at the start of last week, reflecting the Fed’s earlier efforts to lower rates and investors’ pessimism about the economy.The hope is that an additional reduction in rates will provide a little more encouragement for companies to build factories and hire workers and for consumers to buy cars and dishwashers.The Fed has held short-term rates near zero since December 2008, by increasing the supply of money.To further reduce long-term rates, the Fed bought more than $2 trillion in government debt and mortgage-backed securities, reducing the supply available to investors and thereby forcing them to pay higher prices — that is, to accept lower interest rates.The Fed could seek to amplify that effect by adjusting the composition of its portfolio, selling short-term securities and using the proceeds to buy long-term securities, which it predicts would further reduce rates.An analysis by the forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers estimated that such an effort by the Fed could raise gross domestic product by 0.4 of a percentage point over the next two years, and create about 350,000 jobs. That is comparable to estimates of the impact of the central bank’s most recent aid campaign, the QE2, or quantitative easing, purchases of $600 billion in Treasury securities, which concluded in June.Mr. Bernanke announced in August that the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making board, would meet for two days, extending its scheduled one-day meeting this week to include both Tuesday and Wednesday, to consider that and other options.The Fed could take smaller steps, like promising to maintain current efforts longer. It may also consider options that could deliver a more powerful jolt to the economy, like increasing the size of its investment portfolio again. But more aggressive measures have little internal support.The Fed, Mr. Bernanke said, is “prepared to employ these tools as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.”He still commands a solid majority of his 10-member board despite the emergence of the largest bloc of internal dissent in two decades. Three members voted against the decision last month to declare an intention to hold short-term interest rates near zero for at least two more years, replacing a stated intention to maintain the policy for an “extended period.”The central bank has also become a target of conservative politicians, with several Republican presidential candidates denouncing its efforts to increase growth. But even Mr. Bernanke’s internal critics dismiss these attacks.“I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about what any one candidate says about us,” Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, told Fox Business Network in a recent interview. “The issue is to get it right.”Of greater concern is the possibility that the Fed is nearing the limits of its powers. Interest rates are already depressed and, like a board mounted on a spring, pushing down gets harder as the floor gets closer.Studies also have found the Fed’s success in reducing rates has not yielded the full measure of predicted benefits. Mortgages and small business loans may be cheap, but because lenders remain cautious, they are not easy to get.The research firm Capital Economics said recently any renewed effort by the central bank would be unlikely to overcome those obstacles.“We don’t expect it to have any dramatic impact on the wider economy because many households will still not qualify for loans at those lower rates,” it said.The Fed also would face an increased risk of losing money on its investments.And only so many Treasuries are available for sale. If the Fed sold all of its securities maturing in the next four years and bought only securities maturing in more than 17 years, maximizing its impact, it would end up with 70 percent of the available long-term inventory. That could interfere with the normal operations of insurance companies and other traditional buyers.Laurence H. Meyer, a former Federal Reserve governor who now leads Macroeconomic Advisers, said he expected the Fed to conclude that the potential benefits outweighed these issues, but that it needed more time to hammer out details.“We expect them to come out of the committee meeting feeling that they’ve decided and have a consensus to move in November,” he said.Mr. Meyer suggested that the Fed could mollify the markets by announcing what amounts to a preview, by investing the proceeds of maturing securities — about $20 billion each month — in longer-term debt.Such a move might not do much to move the economic needle, because the amounts involved would be minute by the standards of monetary policy, but it could be enough to preserve the valuable conviction that the Fed will do more soon.'"
"'11-09-19,'0','“He is a prolific e-mailer and always available for making connections for even the smallest things,” said Mr. Mohseni, speaking by phone during a visit to the last week from Afghanistan. He said that Mr. Freston had introduced him to , among others. “When he comes here, he talks with the producers, the managers, the people doing the work,” Mr. Mohseni said.In the ’70s, Mr. Freston ran a clothing company called Hindu Kush — “I had no idea what I was doing,” he said — out of and . He developed a lasting crush on Afghanistan and now, more than 30 years later, he’s traveling there about three times a year.He has time on his hands because in 2006 he parted ways with , the founder of , which owns MTV. The reason? Because Mr. Freston failed to buy . “One of the best deals I never made,” he said, smiling in retrospect. He now sits on the board of Animation and serves as chairman of the One campaign, the African poverty initiative co-founded by Bono.In addition to working with Vice Media, he does consulting for , a broadcast superstar who has discovered that starting your own cable channel has its challenges. But his work with Moby combines his enduring interest in Afghanistan with the belief that storytelling can help change a nation. “All Americans ever see of Afghanistan is the brown mountains in the war footage and things getting blown up, but when you spend time at Tolo TV, you get a feeling of what this place could be,” Mr. Freston said.Unlike some foreign affairs analysts, he’s optimistic about the country’s future. “People assume that when the U.S. leaves, the Taliban will just resume control, but Afghanistan has become a different place because independent media has become an instrument of social change.”A popular soap opera from Tolo TV, “The Secrets of This House,” has frankly discussed the gender inequality, domestic abuse and government corruption, all in the name of entertainment.Cynthia P. Schneider, professor of diplomacy at , said that it’s hard to underestimate the value of such programming, which the rest of us take for granted.“Last year, 10 million people watched the finale of ‘Afghan Star,’ which is one third of the people in the country,” she said, referring to the Afghan version of “ .” “You have men and women in a competition that is based on merit, which is unusual in a tribal society. And the results are settled by voting, which is very important.” She added, “In a country where nothing else seems to work, independent media has been a huge success story.”Mr. Freston got involved in Moby after meeting with Mr. Mohseni, the son of an Afghan diplomat who decided not to return to Afghanistan with his family after the Soviet invasion. After many years of living in , Mr. Mohseni returned in 2002 to Kabul, where he began building a media infrastructure in a country with an unreliable electric grid and a 70 percent illiteracy rate.Improbably enough, Moby has become an epicenter of original programming, and last year it began a news channel that has become a source of accountability for a populace accustomed to corruption and dysfunction.“We are a very young country,” said Mr. Mohseni. “Sixty percent of the people here are under 20 years old, and if anyone knows how to reach young people, it’s Tom.”Mr. Freston deflects attention to Moby’s content. is an “Office” knock-off, featuring a preening bureaucrat in charge of garbage collection who mostly drinks tea and gives jobs to his relatives. “Eagle Four” brings to mind featuring brave men and women who deliver action-packed justice.“When those actors hit the streets of Kabul in costume, they are like the Beatles, they get mobbed,” said Mr. Freston. “The people in Afghanistan can’t depend on their government, so they are inspired by the show.”Fifty percent of Afghans have TV sets, according to Mr. Mohseni, compared with almost none in 2001. The advertising market, because of the influx of international aid and global brands, is estimated at $50 million and growing, Mr. Mohseni said.“In today’s Afghanistan, you can’t go to the ballet or go out to dinner with friends,” Mr. Mohseni said. “So they watch television. It is very much like America in the 1950s when families gathered around the TV set to watch a show together.”It’s not all inspiration and aspiration. On the day I had lunch with Mr. Freston, a rocket aimed at the American embassy in Kabul landed on the roof of a Moby production facility.“If it were simple, big media companies would be here and doing business,” Mr. Mohseni said. “The difficulties of doing business here have created an opportunity for us to come up with our own programming and facilities.”The interests of Moby and the United States government occasionally align, and the American government is a big advertiser and has underwritten some of the production costs of “Eagle Four.” Mr. Mohseni plays down the role of any one advertiser. And he prefers to talk about Mr. Freston as a kind of a secret weapon.“Afghanistan was stuck in the 12th century, not because of any decisions we made, but because we had these proxy wars imposed on us,” said Mr. Mohseni. “There are people here who oppose what we are doing, but then, there were a lot of people who said the same thing about MTV when Tom was building it.”'"

"'11-09-19,'0','BEIJING — In a fresh indication of growing public anger over pollution, hundreds of demonstrators in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang on Sunday were camped outside a solar panel manufacturing plant that stands accused of contaminating a nearby river.The demonstration was the latest move in a four-day protest that has sometimes turned violent.The unrest began Thursday, when about 500 residents gathered outside the plant, in Haining, roughly 80 miles southwest of Shanghai. Some protesters stormed the five-year-old factory compound, overturning eight company vehicles, smashing windows and destroying offices. The next day, four police cars were damaged.The factory is owned by JinkoSolar Holding Company, a Chinese firm with more than 10,000 employees that is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and reported total revenue in the second quarter of 2.3 billion renminbi, or about $360 million. Some investment analysts described the company last year as a promising upstart in the solar-energy products business.“Return our lives to us, stay away from Jinko,” read one protest banner that was photographed by a news agency. Company officials could not be reached for comment on the unrest.According to Chinese news reports, residents claimed runoff from solid waste laced with fluoride and improperly stored at the plant had been swept into the nearby river after heavy rainfall on Aug. 26. They said that a sea of dead fish rose to the surface, covering hundreds of square yards of water. Pigs whose sties had been washed with river water also were reported to have died. The state-run China News Agency reported that government inspectors later found that the water contained 10 times the acceptable amount of fluoride.The Haining demonstrations follow a mass demonstration last month in Dalian, in northeast China, in which 12,000 people protested a new chemical plant that produces paraxylene, a toxic chemical used to make polyester products. Government officials promised to relocate the plant after the protest, one of China’s largest in nearly three years.'"

"'11-09-20,'1','A federal appeals court on Monday vacated an order by a New York judge that barred an $18 billion judgment in Ecuador against Chevron related to contamination in the Amazon.The three-judge panel of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit previously expressed skepticism that a New York judge could wield jurisdiction outside the United States.The lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, Pablo Fajardo, said they expected to start collecting by the first quarter of 2012 the damages that a court in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, ordered Chevron to pay.“We can now at least dream there will be justice and compensation for the damage, the environmental crime, committed by Chevron in Ecuador,” he said.“Chevron remains confident that once the full facts are examined, the fraudulent judgment will be found unenforceable and those who procured it will be required to answer for their misconduct,” the oil company said in a statement on its Web site Monday. Chevron has appealed the decision, issued in February, and Mr. Fajardo said he expected an appeals court ruling in Ecuador in the next few months.In New York, United States District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan had barred collection of the award, after determining that Chevron could prove that lawyers had manipulated a corrupt legal system in Ecuador. The company had argued that the plaintiffs would collect the judgment before an appeals process was completed.But a lawyer for the plaintiffs told the appeals court in oral arguments Friday that they would not try to recover damages until the appeal in Ecuador was completed. The award followed nearly two decades of litigation.'"
"'11-09-20,'1','“The president likes him, thinks he is a man of principle, and also a man of action,” the White House national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, said in an interview.Mr. Erdogan, an ambitious, quick-tempered leader once jailed for reading a poem at a political rally, looms large in Mr. Obama’s calculations on issues like the Arab upheaval and the Middle East peace process.This year alone, he and Mr. Obama have spoken by phone nine times; only Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain has talked to the president as frequently.“It’s an investment that has yet to pay off, but we’re still early in the game,” said Robert Danin, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Trying to pull Turkey toward the West is a good investment, in light of Europe’s failure to do so.”Still, Mr. Danin said, “Erdogan’s actions, and particularly his rhetoric, are causing a lot of anxiety.”In 2009, Turkey was the first Muslim country that Mr. Obama visited as president. At the time, he spoke of how Turkey could be emblematic of a new relationship between the United States and the Muslim world.“I’m trying to make a statement about the importance of Turkey,” Mr. Obama said at a news conference at the time. The two countries, he said, could “build a model partnership.”Given Turkey’s growing sense of its own importance, Mr. Erdogan might have been difficult to ignore in any event. The Turkish foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, has described a new order in the rapidly transforming Middle East in which Turkey could form a powerful alliance with Egypt.But Mr. Erdogan has flexed Turkey’s muscles in ways that have flummoxed the United States. When the Obama administration was trying to rally international support for United Nations sanctions against Iran last year, Turkey teamed up with Brazil in a separate diplomatic effort to break an impasse with Tehran over its nuclear program.The United States spurned the effort, and Turkey and Brazil angrily voted against the sanctions in the Security Council. That left the United States with a less-than-unanimous vote and led to Mr. Obama’s bruising encounter with Mr. Erdogan in Canada.In August, Mr. Erdogan made another diplomatic overture to a neighbor, Syria, which was cracking down on protesters at a time when the United States was marshaling support for an international response. Mr. Erdogan, officials said, pleaded with Mr. Obama for a few days to see if he could persuade Mr. Assad to relent.Mr. Obama resisted, citing intelligence reports that Mr. Assad was intensifying his crackdown, officials said. Mr. Erdogan, stung by that news, agreed to go along with the international pressure, and Turkey is now weighing its own sanctions.Repairing the rift between Turkey and Israel will not be easy, American officials said. The deadly Israeli raid on a Turkish flotilla bound for Gaza last year left deep wounds.On Monday in New York, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton pleaded with Mr. Davutoglu to “keep the door open” to Israel, according to a senior administration official. But it was not clear that Mrs. Clinton made any headway.“This is either the result of a mishandling of the situation or a Turkish decision driven by ideology and strategy,” Mr. Danin said. “We have to test which it is.”'"

"'11-09-20,'1','LONDON — The family of Milly Dowler, the teenage murder victim whose voice mail messages were illegally intercepted by The News of the World, has been offered a multimillion-dollar settlement by the tabloid’s parent company, a person with knowledge of the negotiations said Monday.The person said the company, Rupert Murdoch’s News International, had offered about $3.2 million to the Dowler family, with an additional payment of about $1.6 million to go to charity.The News of the World is believed to have hacked into the voice mails of hundreds, possibly thousands, of people, including celebrities and politicians. Widespread public revulsion resulted from the revelation in July that its victims included the 13-year-old Milly Dowler, who disappeared in 2002 and whose messages were intercepted and erased to make room for new ones even as her family searched for her.That disclosure ultimately led the Murdochs to close The News of the World, the government to open several inquiries into the matter and the police to expand their criminal investigation into the paper’s conduct.Mr. Murdoch, who seemed unperturbed by earlier accusations about his employees’ phone hacking, was demonstrably shaken by the news about Milly Dowler. He met with the Dowler family to apologize, and later told a parliamentary committee that he had been humbled by the episode.News International would not disclose the amounts currently under discussion.If both parties agree to the proposal, the settlement will be by far the largest to date in the hacking case. In 2008, Gordon Taylor, a soccer executive, received about $1.4 million from News International, the British newspaper arm of Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation.'"

(AP) — Tony Stewart ended his season-long funk, winning for the first time this year in the opening race of the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship on Monday.He had one of the best cars at Chicagoland Speedway, where Nascar’s title-deciding series opened a day late because of rain.That was a gift of sorts for Stewart, who had a migraine Sunday. Given a day’s rest, he broke a 32-race losing streak dating to California last October.Stewart stretched his final tank of fuel to the finish, which he had failed to do in the Chase opener at New Hampshire last year. Then, he ran out of gas with a lap to go, costing him five spots in the standings, and he never recovered to challenge for the title.Now it is the competition that has to worry. Stewart jumped from ninth in the standings to second, 7 points behind Kevin Harvick. “We’ve had a rough year, so this is a good way to start it off,” Stewart said.Jimmie Johnson, the five-time defending series champion; Kyle Busch; and Matt Kenseth were among the drivers who ran out of gas on the last lap, and all plummeted in the final finishing order.'"
"'11-09-20,'1','Re “The Cough That Launched a Hit Movie” (On View, Sept. 13): In writing the movie “Contagion,” we took great care to make sure that our fictional story was based on real science. The world has seen more than three dozen new pandemic-ready viruses in the last three decades. The scientists who consulted on the film, along with most of their colleagues in epidemiology and virology, believe it is only a matter of time — coupled with a lack of preparation — before the world faces a real-life pandemic like the make-believe one in the film.Dr. Abigail Zuger’s point that the “Contagion virus,” or MEV-1, does not precisely replicate Nipah encephalitis, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic or H.I.V./AIDS is correct. She is also right about the truncated speed of a pandemic, as we have collapsed months of social catastrophe into about an hour and half of a movie. The truth is we do not know where the next real virus may appear or how it might progress.But a highly transmissible and novel respiratory virus in humans like MEV-1 could plausibly occur. Our objective in making this film was to entertain, educate and initiate a discussion among the stakeholders in public health on the importance of global biosurveillance and pandemic preparedness.Dr. Zuger’s article — and her perspective of a clinician — has highlighted the importance of this work, and we welcome her into what we hope will be a national and global discussion of how to prepare for, prevent and, when necessary, respond to the next pandemic. Scott Z. BurnsMr. Burns is the screenwriter of “Contagion,” for which Dr. Brilliant, Ms. Garrett, Dr. Lipkin and Dr. Smolinski were scientific consultants.Dr. Zuger writes that “Contagion” portrays an epidemic as being more visible than it would be. But I think it would be wrong to discount how monumental the scale of a flu epidemic could be. Samuel Pepys reported in 1665 that the worst outbreak of the plague emptied London of everyone except the poor. He wrote: “I could walk Lombard Street and not meet 20 persons from one end to the other and not 50 upon the Exchange; till whole families, 10 and 12 together, have been swept away; till my very physician, Dr. Burnet, who undertook to secure me against infection, having survived the month on his own being shut up, died himself of the plague.”'"
"'11-09-20,'1','Deaths of infants and young mothers continue to decline around the world, but nearly not as quickly as the world’s health ministers hoped when they set targets in 2000, according to an analysis released Monday by University of Washington researchers.In 1990, more than 11 million children under age 5 died each year; in 2011, about 7 million are expected to. Deaths of women in pregnancy and childbirth declined to about 274,000 from 409,000 over the same period.Countries doing particularly well on both fronts include China, Egypt, Iran, Libya, the Maldives, Mongolia, Peru, Syria and Tunisia. (Above, awaiting delivery of a stillborn child in Senegal.)The study was done by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which was created by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to measure the effectiveness of global health efforts independently of the World Health Organization, which is often put under pressure by member states.According to William Heisel, a spokesman for the institute, several factors contributed to the decline. Donor nations are giving about twice what they used to toward maternal and child health. Previously the focus was on AIDS.In countries with malaria, mosquito nets have helped to reduce mortality among infants and young mothers. So have efforts like paying rural women in India to give birth at hospitals instead of at home.“The single biggest factor, though, is the education of young women,” Mr. Heisel said. Girls with more schooling make better decisions about getting pregnant and learn to protect themselves and their newborns.'"

Oil prices in New York fell more than 2.4 percent to $85.81.“We have risk aversion, profit taking and a stronger dollar on the back of the ongoing concerns both in Europe and domestically,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist for Rockwell Global Capital.'"

Government inspectors have confirmed that fluoride contamination was 10 times higher than acceptable levels after heavy rainfall swept improperly stored wastewater into a canal, according to the state-run news media.Residents have also blamed the five-year-old plant for what they claim is an unusual number of cancer deaths, although local officials say such fears are exaggerated.According to the Haining city Web site, JinkoSolar has been fined about $74,000. Company employees reached by phone on Monday declined to comment. JinkoSolar, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, reported revenue of about $360 million in the second quarter.'"

"'11-09-21,'0','But they are not the only ones with an edge: the admissions officers said they admitted minority students, athletes, veterans, children of alumni, international students and, for the sake of gender balance, men, with lesser credentials, too.At many colleges and universities, the survey found, whom you know does matter. More than a quarter of the admissions directors said they had felt pressure from senior-level administrators to admit certain applicants, and almost a quarter got pressure from trustees or development officers.“If external parties are trying to influence admissions decisions, that’s a concern that strikes at the legitimacy of the whole process,” Mr. Hawkins said. “We certainly have standards, but there needs to be awareness that when the economy starts to crumble, the standards may start to go out the window.”Lloyd Thacker, executive director of the Education Conservancy, a two-person nonprofit he founded in 2003 to improve college admissions, said the Inside Higher Ed findings were troubling.“There’s always been elements of this behavior, but it seems to me that it’s growing,” Mr. Thacker said. “I don’t know whether to blame it on hard times or lack of courage and leadership.”Mr. Thacker said his own research had found students becoming more cynical about higher education.“Students say, ‘They’re cheating us, so we can cheat them,’ ” he said. “The cheat they see is that colleges are out for themselves, not for them as students. Our research, with 2,500 students, found that of all the sources of information students get about higher education, they thought the least trustworthy sources are the colleges and college reps themselves.”While said their most important challenge in the near future was reduced state funding, all the other institutions named rising concerns from families about tuition and affordability.Admissions directors at many public universities said in the survey that recruiting more out-of-state and international students, who pay higher tuition, was their top strategy. At community colleges and private institutions, admissions officers were more likely to say that providing aid for low- and middle- income students was their focus.More than half the admissions officers from four-year institutions said that coaching by parents or college counselors was making it harder to really learn about applicants.'"
"'11-09-21,'0','AUSTIN, Tex. (AP) — Gov. Rick Perry has revoked the blind trust that holds most of his investments, revealing for the first time in 15 years where his money is invested.Mr. Perry, who announced Aug. 13 that he was seeking the Republican nomination for president, provided a range for the number of shares he holds in each of 25 stocks that together are worth $108,000 to $319,000. His portfolio was diversified, with holdings in corporations from the United States and Europe. He also listed eight municipal bond holdings, all of them from outside of Texas. No value was given for those bonds. He listed a money-market account worth more than $10,000.The trust was established in 1996, while he was state agriculture commissioner, and was managed by a broker. In a letter to the Texas Ethics Commission dated Aug. 12, he amended his annual personal financial disclosure to reflect that he now knows where his assets are invested.Blind trusts are used by politicians to avoid appearances of conflicts of interest in making important decisions. The Associated Press obtained the letter and the new disclosure form in an open-records request.While blind trusts are legal in Texas, candidates for federal office must report all of their holdings to the Federal Election Commission. Mr. Perry will be required to file a federal candidate disclosure form by Oct. 15.'"
"'11-09-21,'0','WASHINGTON — The top two executives of a solar-energy company that filed for bankruptcy after getting $528 million in loan guarantees from the Obama administration said Tuesday that they will invoke their constitutional rights against compelled self-incrimination when they appear at a Congressional hearing.The chief executive of Solyndra, Brian Harrison, and Bill Stover, the chief financial officer, hired lawyers in preparation for the hearing this week before the House Energy and Commerce committee and got advice not to say anything, according to a representative of the lawyers.The offices and the homes of some executives of Solyndra, a California solar-panel manufacturer, were recently raided by the F.B.I. as part of a criminal inquiry into the bankruptcy. The company said in a statement that it was “not aware of any wrongdoing by Solyndra officers, directors or employees in conjunction with the DOE loan guarantee or otherwise.”In the wake of the bankruptcy filing, the Republican leaders of the committee asked the Department of Energy on Tuesday not to rush to give out loan guarantees for clean-energy projects in the final days of the program. But the department said it had already weeded out the projects that it would not have time to finish by the deadline, Sept. 30, and would press ahead with the others.Republicans maintain that the department rushed through the approval of the loan to Solyndra for political reasons. They have released internal Obama administration e-mails that show that the White House was eager to have Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announce the deal in part because it would show action on creating jobs.The committee chairman, Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, and two subcommittee chairmen wrote to Energy Secretary Steven Chu that his agency’s haste had hurt “the quality and comprehensiveness” of the due diligence performed by the department and the Office of Management and Budget, which had to sign off on the loans. The department has been approving new loans at an accelerated pace in the last three months, the Republicans said.'"
"'11-09-21,'0','AVA, Mo. — A child takes a stool at a soda fountain, drops a nickel on the counter and orders a chocolate ice cream cone. This nostalgic tableau — backed by ’50s tunes piping out of a jukebox — is fodder for the brush strokes of Norman Rockwell paintings and when-I-was-your-age stories spun by grandparents.But it also comes to life here at Ava Drug, where pocket change still goes a long way.A nickel buys a scoop of ice cream, a soda or a cup of coffee. And each afternoon the place fills with the frenetic chatter of students arriving for their daily overdose of sugar and the clang of an antique cash register. Haley Barker, a high school freshman whose $1-a-week allowance is barely dented by her sweet tooth, said she found this retro-pricing “totally normal.”There is, of course, a story behind how nickel ice cream returned to this hamlet of 3,000 in the Ozarks. That was the price when Ava Drug first opened in 1950 just off the town square, complete, like many pharmacies of the day, with a soda fountain. But within a few years the price jumped to a dime, and it continued its long climb from there.David Norman, whose father and grandfather started the business, eventually tore out the soda fountain, a money loser that he believed detracted from the core business. The pharmacy was a sleepier place afterward, and he sold the business in 1991.But almost a decade ago, Mr. Norman, more sentimental with the years, bought it back and set about re-creating, as faithfully as possible, the soda fountain that dominated the memories of his youth.The nickel prices were introduced as a short-term gimmick to draw traffic. But they filled the place with energy and gave customers a reason to ignore the Wal-Mart that had eroded other local businesses, so the discount remained. One regular thanked Mr. Norman as he walked out earlier this month: “I can’t make coffee for a nickel a cup.”'"
"'11-09-21,'0','The prime minister of Zimbabwe, one of southern Africa’s poorest and most politically anxious countries, expressed hope on Tuesday that elections for a new government could be held next year, bringing an end to an awkward and rancorous power-sharing partnership between him and his rival, the country’s legendarily autocratic president, Robert Mugabe.In an interview with the editorial board of The New York Times, the prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, said his relationship with Mr. Mugabe had evolved since 2008, when Mr. Tsvangirai was forced to abandon a presidential runoff with him after a campaign of violence and intimidation by Mr. Mugabe’s supporters who feared Mr. Tsvangirai might win. Under a truce brokered by South Africa, both men embarked on a collaboration that has been fraught with tension and occasional blowups but has remained basically intact.“The tone has changed,” Mr. Tsvangirai said. “We’ve gone from enemies to opponents.”Mr. Tsvangirai, who flew with Mr. Mugabe to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, said the two had regularly scheduled meetings every Monday in Mr. Mugabe’s office. There is “no defined agenda,” he said.Nonetheless, it is clear that Mr. Tsvangirai and his political party, the Movement for Democratic Change, have remained on guard for the possibility that Mr. Mugabe and his party, ZANU-PF, might subvert the partnership. A number of Mr. Tsvangirai’s supporters have been arrested and harassed by the police and criminal justice system in Zimbabwe, which remain under Mr. Mugabe’s control.This year, a high-ranking army commander said he would ensure that Mr. Mugabe remained president, and he called Mr. Tsvangirai a “national security threat” who took orders from foreigners, suggesting the army’s intention to interfere in elections.Mr. Tsvangirai noted that the commander, Brig. Gen. Douglas Nyikayaramba, had been censured for the remarks, which he described as the view of an individual. He also said that others in the armed forces, as well as in other branches of government under Mr. Mugabe’s control, had come to realize that Zimbabwe could not go back to the days of one-party rule and intolerance for opposing points of view.'"
"'11-09-21,'0','Many Joplin residents either ignored or were slow to react to the first warning sirens about a deadly tornado this spring, partly because of years of false alarms, the government said Tuesday. In assessing the warning systems used in the storm that killed 162 people, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said many people waited for additional information. While officials believe residents did not respond quickly enough to sirens and warning systems, Richard Wagenmaker, leader of the assessment team, said it was unclear if the slow reaction cost lives. Also, after the intensity of the storm was clear, the resulting warnings “lacked enhanced wording to accurately portray that immediate action was necessary to save lives with this tornado,” the assessors said.'"
"'11-09-21,'0','“Unauthorized status casts a big shadow that really extends to citizen as well as undocumented children,” Marcelo Suárez-Orozco, a professor of education at New York University who is an author of the study, said on Tuesday. “It affects their cognitive development, engagement in school and their ability to be emerging citizens.”The Harvard study reports that “fear and vigilance” guide the home lives of young children whose parents are illegal immigrants, making the parents significantly less likely to engage with teachers or be active in schools.Parents’ fears of deportation led to lower levels of enrollment of their American children in public programs for which the children were legally eligible, including child care subsidies, public preschool and food stamps, the study found.The other authors were Carola Suárez-Orozco and Robert T. Teranishi of New York University and Hirokazu Yoshikawa of the Harvard Graduate School of Education.Many illegal immigrant parents work long hours in low-wage jobs, sometimes more than one job. New research on very young children cited in the Harvard study showed that the undocumented parents’ difficult work conditions “contribute substantially to the lower cognitive skills of children in their families.” This was true even though the children were more likely to be in two-parent families than American children as a whole.As teenagers, children without legal status face a hard awakening when they apply for jobs, driver’s licenses or financial aid for college and discover they are not legally qualified for any of them. Their paths diverge from siblings who are American citizens by birthright.“In late adolescence, they start to realize their legal limitations, and their worlds turn completely upside down,” said Roberto G. Gonzales, a sociologist at the University of Chicago whose research on college-age illegal immigrants is cited in the Harvard study.Academic achievement does little to lift the prospects of illegal immigrants who have grown up here. Out of 150 immigrants Professor Gonzales studied in depth, 31 had completed college or advanced degrees, but none were in a career that matched their educational training. Many were working low-wage jobs like their parents.The Harvard study found that many illegal immigrant youths, facing the “reduced promise of mobility,” had dropped out of school and begun the search for work they could do without legal papers, “forced deeper and deeper into an underground work force.”The researchers said that a generation of young illegal immigrants raised in this country was moving toward “perpetual outsider-hood.”'"

"'11-09-21,'0','BEIJING — The new United States ambassador to China, Gary F. Locke, warned China on Tuesday that its undervalued currency, its increasingly restrictive business environment and the rampant theft of intellectual property threatened both the country’s long-term economic prospects and American job growth at a time of continued weakness in the global economy.In his first speech on economic matters since arriving in Beijing last month, Mr. Locke, a former commerce secretary and an expert on trade relations, told a gathering of American business leaders that the Chinese government’s refusal to open up important sectors of its economy to foreign investment was an increasing concern in the United States, where some members of Congress have been calling for a harder line against China.“China’s current business climate is causing growing frustration among business and government leaders, including my colleagues back home,” Mr. Locke said in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in China. He said a raft of obstacles to foreign corporations — including those focused on mining, health care, energy and financial services — “was planting seeds of doubt in the minds of foreign investors as to whether they are truly welcome in China.”In his speech, Mr. Locke reiterated many of the themes he advocated as President Obama’s commerce secretary, but he also waded into the politically delicate realm of Internet freedom, calling on the ruling Communist Party to relax online censorship. Such restrictions, he suggested, hamper China’s ability to compete in the global economy by hindering the free flow of information and stifling innovation.“If China’s businesses, entrepreneurs, academics, scientists, researchers and students and even ordinary citizens aren’t able to fully participate in the international marketplace of ideas, then China as a country and as an economy will fail to realize its full potential,” Mr. Locke said.Despite China’s robust economic growth, many American businesses say they are increasingly stymied by government regulations that favor Chinese corporations, especially the state-owned enterprises that dominate banking, energy, telecommunications and other sectors. Another irritant involves longstanding rules that force many overseas companies into ventures with Chinese partners.As part of its efforts to spur domestic job growth, Mr. Locke said the Obama administration was pressing for initiatives to reduce limitations on the export of American technology to China, while helping foreign investors navigate the sometimes daunting tangle of American government regulation. Such measures, he said, would invariably benefit Chinese corporations, which have enjoyed a 400 percent increase in direct investment in the United States since 2008.'"

It sold its building on West 53rd Street to the Museum of Modern Art to pay off its debt; it has been closed since July. The museum’s staff, once at 50, is down to a dozen, and its budget is $7 million, down from $10 million in 2009.The building on 53rd Street opened in 2001 after a renovation by Billie Tsien and Tod Williams. To finance the construction, the museum borrowed $32 million by issuing bonds through the city’s Trust for Cultural Resources, a public benefit corporation that helps cultural institutions borrow money for capital projects. The debt payments on the bonds were significant, about $3 million a year, and in 2009, the museum defaulted on the debt, the first institution that borrowed through the trust to do so.In a struggle made worse by the recession, the museum was unable to attract the crowds it had expected or the wealthy contributors it needed. Last year, as it ran a nearly $4 million deficit, the museum raised just $3.3 million from donors. Before the new building opened, consultants predicted it would draw 255,000 visitors a year by 2005. But this year, the museum, in its two locations, is drawing 160,000 a year.'"
"'11-09-22,'0','Ruling that the intentional voter discrimination that led to the passage and multiple extensions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 still exists, a federal judge in Washington on Wednesday dismissed an Alabama county’s claim that portions of the act were unconstitutional.The challenge to the law was brought last year by Shelby County, a mostly suburban county south of Birmingham, and concerned sections of the act that set apart certain jurisdictions that have shown past patterns of discrimination. These jurisdictions — which include the entirety of most Southern states but also Alaska, Arizona and isolated towns and counties around the country — are required to obtain “preclearance” from the Justice Department or a panel of federal judges before making any changes to voting procedures.In 2006, Congress found enough evidence of continuing discrimination to warrant an extension of the act for 25 years.In its suit, Shelby County argued that the widespread discrimination of the Jim Crow era had ended, and that “it is no longer constitutionally justifiable for Congress to arbitrarily impose” on the county and other covered jurisdictions the “disfavored treatment” of having to obtain preclearance from Washington.The county said that Congress “lacked the evidence of intentional discrimination” to justify the extension. The suit also said parts of the act violated the principle of equal state sovereignty.'"
"'11-09-22,'0','Moody’s cut its credit ratings Wednesday on three large banks — Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo — underscoring the challenges the sector still faces three years after the onset of the financial crisis.The downgrades were driven by Moody’s conclusion that the federal government was less likely to step in and provide support for a faltering big bank the way it did after the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, when Washington executed a series of actions including capital infusions and credit guarantees to halt the spreading panic.Moody’s had put the banks on notice for a possible downgrade on June 2.While Moody’s said it “believes that the government is likely to continue to provide some level of support to systemically important financial institutions,” the agency added that the government “is also more likely now than during the financial crisis to allow a large bank to fail should it become financially troubled.”Under the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform passed by Congress in 2010, financial institutions must file a so-called living will that lays out steps for an orderly liquidation in the event of a financial collapse. The goal is to avoid future government bailouts, as well as the kind of turmoil unleashed by Lehman’s unexpected bankruptcy.“Now, having moved beyond the depths of the crisis, Moody’s believes there is an increased possibility that the government might allow a large financial institution to fail, taking the view that the contagion could be limited,” the firm said in a statement.

"'11-09-22,'0','The following is the full text of the statement released on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve:Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that economic growth remains slow. Recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has been increasing at only a modest pace in recent months despite some recovery in sales of motor vehicles as supply-chain disruptions eased. Investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed. However, business investment in equipment and software continues to expand. Inflation appears to have moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their peaks. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.Consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The committee continues to expect some pickup in the pace of recovery over coming quarters but anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Moreover, there are significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets. The committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the committee’s dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further. However, the committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the committee decided today to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities. The committee intends to purchase, by the end of June 2012, $400 billion of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of six years to 30 years and to sell an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three years or less. This program should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.To help support conditions in mortgage markets, the committee will now reinvest principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. In addition, the committee will maintain its existing policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.The committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions — including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run — are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.The committee discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. It will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ its tools as appropriate.'"
"'11-09-22,'0','It is these foundation experiments that have now come under attack by David Gems and Linda Partridge, researchers on aging at University College London. In an article published Wednesday in the journal Nature, they and colleagues have re-examined experiments in which roundworms and flies, genetically manipulated to produce more sirtuin than normal, were reported to live longer.Both experiments were flawed, they say, because the worms and flies used as a control were not genetically identical to the test organisms. The London researchers report that they have repeated the experiments with proper controls and found that extra sirtuin does not, after all, make the worms or flies live longer.The genetic study of aging is a relatively new field that has had its fair share of teething problems. In an article in Nature four years ago, Dr. Gems and Dr. Partridge warned of some of the mistakes being commonly made. “The biology of aging is a young field with emerging pitfalls,” they wrote.The authors of the original worm and fly experiments on the sirtuins fell into one of these traps, the London researchers now write, namely the failure to make sure their test and control animals had the same genetic background in all respects except for the added gene that forced extra production of sirtuins.In the worm experiment, published by Leonard Guarente of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2001, the strain of worms used had picked up an extra mutation that also had the effect of prolonging life, the London researchers report. When the mutated gene is removed, the worms with extra sirtuin do not live longer, they said.Dr. Guarente said he did not agree with the thrust of this criticism. The 2001 experiment was done with the best techniques then available, he said. When he heard of the mutated gene two years ago, he redid the experiment, using worms from which the gene had been removed. The worms with extra sirtuin still lived longer, though the effect was less pronounced than before, a finding he also reports in the current Nature.“We agree there is a glitch in one of the worm strains used in the 2001 paper,” Dr. Guarente said in an interview. “We absolutely do not agree that there is a serious question about whether sir2 extends life span in worms,” he said, using the name for the worm’s version of the sirtuin protein.“I think the whole thing is a tempest in a teapot,” he said.Stephen Helfand of Brown University is the author of the fly experiments. Like Dr. Guarente, Dr. Helfand criticized the London researchers for focusing on an old experiment of his and ignoring a subsequent one that reached the same conclusion with a much-improved technique.In the more recent experiment, published in 2009, he was able to arrange that genes for extra sirtuin were switched on only when the flies were given a drug. The test and control flies were genetically identical, and differed only in whether they got the drug. Those with the drug lived longer, he reported.Dr. Gems said at first that he had not cited Dr. Helfand’s 2009 experiment because it was “redundant,” and then he said that Nature had limited the number of papers he could cite.All scientists agree that it is important to correct flawed experiments, but there are differences of opinion as to how this should be done. The London group believes the aging field is full of sloppy experiments done by people new to the field and more interested in publicity than in excluding the factors that confound this difficult subject. The American sirtuin researchers under criticism believe the London group has gone beyond simple correction into “gotcha” science that is not collegial. Usually, they say, if a scientist cannot repeat another’s experiment, he will call up first to find out why instead of putting his objections into print first.Scientists not involved in the dispute say that sirtuins remain a field of vast interest, even if their relationship to longevity now seems considerably more complex than originally suggested. The theory that resveratrol activates sirtuins, which then prolong life span, is popular because of the notion that drinking red wine can make people live longer, but it “should have been abandoned five years ago,” said Richard A. Miller, who studies aging in mice at the University of Michigan. “But sirtuins are very important proteins which probably have a lot to do with how diseases are controlled.”Dr. Miller suggested that Nature had given too much attention to resveratrol and sirtuin reports in the past. “Maybe they are trying to make amends by giving equal time to people who have been more careful,” he said.'"

""But who could doubt that a veto at the Security Council risks engendering a cycle of violence in the Middle East?""The Palestinians currently have the status of an observer “entity” in the United Nations.""Why not envisage offering Palestine the status of United Nations observer state?” said the French leader. “This would be an important step forward. Most important, it would mean emerging from a state of immobility that favors only the extremists.”Recognition as an observer state would not mean much here except for some procedural changes, but it would allow the Palestinians to join subsidiary bodies and treaties of the United Nations.Alain Juppé, the French foreign minister, told a news conference that the Palestinian bid for full membership via the Security Council would proceed as expected, but that France anticipates that it is bound to fail given American opposition. In the ensuing weeks, France would work on refining its plan, which was based on four pillars, he said.First is changing the method, because that of the past decades has failed; second is to get the negotiations between the two parties started again as quickly as possible and without preconditions from either side; third is to establish a concrete timetable; and finally is to work on elevating the Palestinians to a full observer state in the General Assembly.Most Israeli concern has focused on the possibility that making the Palestinians an observer state could enhance their ability to join the International Criminal Court and pursue Israeli leaders through “lawfare.”In choosing to go to the Security Council to seek full membership, Mr. Abbas chose a more difficult path but one that could get lost in the thicket of United Nations bureaucracy for months before the United States used its threatened veto. There is even a question if the Palestinians can muster the needed 9 votes.But the United States has no veto over a General Assembly resolution, and the Palestinians enjoy overwhelming support there.'"
"'11-09-22,'0','WASHINGTON — Existing home sales rose more than expected in August to the fastest annual pace since March, as falling prices and low interest rates drew more buyers into the market, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.The data did little to change the view that housing, hobbled by a burst bubble that prompted a major recession, will not help the economy much anytime soon.Sales climbed 7.7 percent from the previous month to an annual rate of 5.03 million units, the group said. The median price was 5.1 percent lower than a year earlier.The association said the increase in sales came despite some disruptions from Hurricane Irene, which battered much of the East Coast at the end of the month.Economists polled by Reuters had expected sales to rise 1.4 percent to a 4.71 million-unit pace. Compared with August 2010, sales were 18.6 percent higher.“This housing market is still very distressed,” said Michael Hanson, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. “We have to get a lot of good news for a meaningful turnaround in the housing market.”'"
"'11-09-22,'0','LONDON — The Metropolitan Police Service said on Wednesday that it had withdrawn its demand, at least for now, that the Guardian newspaper reveal the sources it used for articles about phone hacking.In a statement, police officials said they had consulted the Crown Prosecution Service, which would be responsible for pursuing the case in the courts if it were to go ahead, and that the agency had asked for more information. As a result, police officials had decided to delay a decision on how to proceed.But this “does not mean that the investigation has concluded,” the statement said. “We have agreed with the C.P.S. that we will work jointly with them in considering the next steps.”The prospect of reporters being forced to reveal their sources has led to outrage across the British news media, even from some of the Guardian’s bitterest rivals.“We greatly welcome the Met’s decision to withdraw this ill-judged order,” the Guardian’s editor, Alan Rusbridger, said.'"
"'11-09-22,'0','He described the new measure as a “net wash,” because there was no expansion of the balance sheet.Investors sold short-term bonds and bought longer-term ones, because they were “trying to buy up something that is going to be in demand, getting in front of the Fed, in essence,” Mr. Joy said.The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 283.82 points, or 2.5 percent, at 11,124.84, and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 2.9 percent, or 35.33 points, at 1,166.76. The Nasdaq composite index fell 2 percent, or 52.05 points, to 2,538.19.The 10-year bond yield fell to 1.86 percent, a new low. That compared with a yield of 1.94 percent late Tuesday. The price on the benchmark note rose 24/32 to 102 14/32.Another analyst suggested that there were perceptions that the Fed’s move could not get to the root of the problem.Clark Yingst, the chief market analyst for the investment firm Joseph Gunnar, noted that the declines on Wednesday were in fact preceded by losses in cyclical stocks in previous sessions, like those sensitive to whether the economy was growing or not. Those included stocks in the materials, and industrial sectors related to coal and copper production. The two sectors finished more than 4 percent lower.Tightening monetary policy in Europe, which is struggling with a sovereign debt crisis, would not help, because it might affect exports.“This is happening in my view because we are in the midst not only of a U.S. slowdown but a global slowdown,” Mr. Yingst said.Mr. Yingst said that there could also be some questions about whether the cost of credit was really at the heart of the issue, and that the lower interest rates could take away the incentive for banks to lend, and further squeeze their net interest margins.“It could backfire,” he said.But Lee Quaintance and Paul Brodsky, analysts at QB Asset Management Company, said they thought the move could help banks, in part by improving balance sheets.“We think this twist is just the latest permutation of bank aid,” they said in a statement. “Frankly, we cannot remember the Fed doing anything that threatened bank profitability.”Still, bank stocks as a group fell nearly 5 percent on Wednesday. In addition, Moody’s Investors Service cut its credit ratings on Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, saying that Washington was now less likely to bail out the banks if needed. Bank of America fell 7.5 percent to $6.38. Citigroup was down 5.24 percent at $25.52. Wells Fargo was 3.89 percent lower at $23.71. JPMorgan Chase was down 5.92 percent at $30.34.“Moody’s certainly did not help,” Mr. Yingst added.Still, some analysts said that the decision was more “aggressive” than the market expected. Anthony Valeri, investment strategist for fixed income with LPL Financial, said that was particularly true with regard to the dollar amount and maturity focus of the Fed’s buying program. “They erred to the aggressive side, I think, because they feel they are the only game in town,” he said.'"
"'11-09-22,'0','Now there appears to be division and disarray within and the . bank efforts to help the economy have become politically controversial, and there has been infighting at both the and the Federal Reserve.At the European Central Bank, the departing president, , has faced sniping from and the resignation of Jürgen Stark, a German member of the bank’s executive board. Mr. Stark cited personal reasons, but his departure was widely interpreted as a repudiation of the bank’s purchases of issued by troubled European nations.At the Fed, , the chairman who succeeded Mr. Greenspan, has faced dissents within the central bank on recent efforts to stimulate the economy.There was a long-lived bipartisan consensus in the United States — it lasted at least from 1992, when Mr. Greenspan helped banks recover from bad to Latin American nations, through 2008 — that the Fed was expected to steer the economy and would be treated gently by politicians.Presidents tended to reappoint Fed chairmen, even those appointed by predecessors of the other political party, in part because of fear that markets would be outraged by any effort to politicize monetary policy. There have been six presidents since took over at the Fed in 1979, but Mr. Bernanke is just the third chairman.That consensus seems to have vanished, with candidates for the Republican presidential nomination vying with one another to show their hostility to Mr. Bernanke, even though he is a Republican who previously served as the chief economic adviser to President .One candidate, , has said he would ask Mr. Bernanke to resign. Another, , the governor of , suggested that Mr. Bernanke might be trying to stimulate the economy to aid ’s re-election campaign. On Tuesday , Republican Congressional leaders took the extraordinary step of publicly calling for the Fed to do no more.That did not stop the Fed from announcing some initiatives on Thursday, but they were relatively small and disappointing to investors. Share prices fell sharply after the announcement.The political challenges may make it harder for the Fed to do much more over the next year, even if the economy is weaker than expected. Similarly, , the Italian central banker who will take over from Mr. Trichet on Nov. 1, will be under great pressure from Germany to avoid actions that might increase inflation, even if they may be needed to prevent a new financial collapse.At the same time, European governments have found it hard to agree on effective action. A July 21 agreement, which was supposed to provide money for while limiting the losses for banks, has yet to be put in place, and markets seem convinced that a Greek default is inevitable. is the latest country to find bond markets hesitant to provide funds.European banks, many of which were slower than American ones to raise capital when investors grew more friendly in 2010, may need to be rescued again precisely because of fears that the rescuers of 2008 — national governments — may not be able to meet their obligations.At a meeting of European finance ministers last week, , the secretary, pleaded for coordinated action. “Governments and central banks need to take out the catastrophic risk to markets,” he said. After he left, ’s finance minister said Americans should stop lecturing Europe.Those countries that can borrow money easily and cheaply — most important, Germany and the United States — are reluctant to do so, even with the threat of a new seeming to grow. The Germans argue that other European nations must cut back spending to regain competitiveness, that there is no gain without pain. Mr. Obama has proposed a new stimulus program, but it faces uncertain political prospects only weeks after the two parties agreed to seek consensus on ways to reduce government spending.Large banks around the world have seized on the disarray of governments to begin campaigns to reduce regulation, complaining that new rules adopted after the 2008 debacle threaten growth. They want capital rules eased and hope that few will remember it was their excessive risk-taking, relative to the capital they had, that helped to create the 2008 disaster and that threatens a new one.Some politicians join in that complaint, saying current problems stem from excessive government interference in the economy, particularly in free markets.Those who remember the “Greenspan put” may find that argument odd. It is the fear that governments may not ride to the rescue that seems to have unnerved markets.Perhaps it is the low expectations that provide the best hope for some kind of success at the meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank. Three years ago, it was widely expected that governments and central banks could act cooperatively and effectively. Now any indication they can still do so would come as a pleasant surprise.'"

"'11-09-23,'1','Five Questions for HP’s New CEO Meg Whitman and Chairman Ray LaneIt’s been an extraordinary week for Hewlett-Packard. On Monday, HP was a sleeping giant with an unclear strategy, an unpopular CEO and a stagnating share price.Then word came, via AllThingsD, that something big was coming from the board of directors. And as AllThingsD first reported (again), HP directors made one of their own, Meg Whitman, the former eBay CEO who had become a director earlier this year, the new CEO. Léo Apotheker resigned, but don’t cry for him, because according to his contract, he made out rather well. Even before it was made official, investors applauded the move, sending HP shares skyward.Analysts did what they always do, and, well, analyzed. And though it looked more like drama criticism, it’s not as if HP hasn’t known boardroom dramas before. Finally, the deed was done, meaning it was time to hold a conference call, but not before talking first to Kara Swisher of AllThingsD.I got to talk to Whitman and HP Chairman Ray Lane yesterday, too, but I had to wait until after the conference call. With so many critics screaming that Whitman has no experience running an enterprise hardware company — and let’s be honest, there aren’t that many who do — I asked her to elaborate on the defense, made on the conference call with analysts, that her experience as a buyer of enterprise technology, during her years as CEO at eBay, provided important experience that will help her be an effective CEO at HP. I also asked about Autonomy, the British software firm that HP is in the process of acquiring for $10 billion, and how it will fit within HP; about the company’s plans for cloud services; and about the state of the HP brand amid all the corporate mishegas that has unfolded in the last several months.AllThingsD: Meg, the main criticism of you, since you’ve been named CEO of HP, is that your primary experience before was at eBay, which is a consumer-facing company. The response on yesterday’s conference call has been that at eBay you were a purchaser of a lot of enterprise technology and that this gives you some important relevant experience. I get the point, but could you elaborate on it a bit? How does having been an enterprise buyer help you be HP’s CEO?Whitman: What HP needs now more than anything else is management skills, communication skills and a commitment to executional excellence, all of which I know well, and are sort of core competencies from my 35-year career in business. I know technology because I ran a company whose very existence would not have been possible without it, and was a very significant buyer of technology products. And so that brings me a unique buyer’s perspective. But I have not spent 35 years in the enterprise business. Add so what that means is that I will be relying heavily on Dave Donatelli; on Todd Bradley; on the senior executives at HP; and also, frankly, on Ray Lane, who was at Oracle for many years, and EDS, and who knows this space well. So I think what customers will get is that one plus one equals three.Lane: I agree with that. What we need here, and what we didn’t have before, is operational execution, communication skills, getting the team on the same page and leading them. The CEOs of $130 billion companies are not leading the technology development of those companies. I think Meg can go into any enterprise and visit with any CIO or CEO and do really well. So whether it is the technology side or the sales side, I don’t think anyone is giving her enough credit on those fronts. She can do just fine. And then on top of that she has strong operating executives under her who do know the enterprise business. But right now it is the need for leadership of the people, a focus on executing and operating. I could point back to Lou Gerstner at IBM, or even my own days at Oracle. When I joined Oracle, people thought the board had lost its mind, because I was a consultant at Booz Allen. People scoffed and said ‘How is a consultant going to lead the worldwide sales force at Oracle, a trained wolf pack?’ And somehow I figured it out. And I knew nothing about software, but I learned, and I learned from Larry Ellison, who is one of the best.I want to talk a bit about Autonomy, and about unstructured data. You made a comment about that when you talked with Kara Swisher of AllThingsD yesterday. Talk to me about where you see Autonomy fitting within HP. Do you still intend to let it be independent? How do you see the alignment shaping up?Whitman: It’s a big and fast-growing market. Of all the data out there, about 15 percent of it is structured and 85 percent of it is unstructured. And the unstructured data is growing by leaps and bounds. There are not a lot of good software companies that can help companies manage unstructured data and help companies make business decisions based on what they see in that unstructured data. So what we hope to do with Autonomy, and I’m enthusiastic about this acquisition, is take what is fabulous about Autonomy — they have a leading position in the marketplace — and put it through the very powerful HP distribution system. And I think what Mike Lynch is excited about — he is the founder and CEO of Autonomy — is taking this great product and getting it into more people’s hands. And we just need to grow this company as fast as we can; extend our lead and our accumulated experience in this area. So that’s the plan for Autonomy.Lane: Yeah, I think the synergies are great, and I think it makes a lot of sense. It will make a lot of sense to customers if HP engages them in a dialogue of managing unstructured data.You don’t think HP paid too much for Autonomy?Whitman: You know what? It is what it is.Lane: We wish we could have bought it for cheaper, but it was the market price. People thought we overpaid for 3Par, and you know what? We’re hitting it out of the park.Is HP still going to be player in cloud services? That was a big commitment that Léo made in March. How far along is that plan?Lane: Absolutely. The cloud is way ahead of plan. So our cloud services have gone live. So that is absolutely part of the plan, yes.Meg, a lot of the same people who applauded your selection to HP’s board of directors are criticizing your selection as CEO. Why do you think there’s a disconnect?Whitman: I don’t know. There’s always people who have different points of view on things. What I have to do — and I said this on the conference call — is lead this company, make it a great company again and fulfill its destiny as the icon of Silicon Valley and of California, and deliver the results. I will have to prove myself by delivering the results. If we’re going to restore the confidence that investors have in us, and that employees have in us, we have to deliver. We have to mean what we say and say what we mean and deliver the results. And that is what I intend to deliver.Meg, you have a lot of history managing brands. I’m thinking of the job you had managing brands for Procter & Gamble. What’s wrong and what’s right about HP’s brand right now?Whitman: I think HP is known as the world’s largest provider of information technology, and we are a trusted brand. We are a worldwide brand that touches both consumers and businesses. If you’re an enterprise, we have full suite of solutions. I know that when I bought enterprise hardware and software at eBay, I wanted one person to choke when something went wrong. I wanted one supplier to go to and say ‘Hey, this is not working.’ And so I think we have a fabulous brand in a world where technology is increasingly fundamental. I will say — and Ray would say this as well — I think we need crisper communications with all the constituencies. I think on Aug. 18 we confused people. We didn’t mean to do that, but we did. And so I think we’ve got some work to do around communicating crisply and cleanly about what we’re about — the moves that we’re making — to employees, customers, shareholders and, frankly, to the press.'"

"'11-09-23,'1','The dollar amounts involved in such cases tend to be small, which has led critics to question whether the S.E.C. shouldn’t be spending more of its resources on larger offenses like mortgage fraud. But in truth, insider trading is just the sort of activity the S.E.C. was created to combat. Not so very long ago, the public had a sense that the agency was watching out for small investors and keeping markets safe. Then in 2008 came a pair of cataclysmic failures: virtually the entire investment-banking industry, which the S.E.C. regulated, either failed or sought a bailout; then, having ignored explicit warnings about Madoff, the agency was further humiliated by the revelation that he’d been running a .Some have criticized the emphasis on insider trading cases as a kind of quick fix to the S.E.C.’s battered image. “Nonsense,” says Khuzami, who joined the agency two months after the Madoff fiasco. But image actually is important; it’s part of providing an effective deterrent. To an unusual degree, respect for insider trading laws depends on the visibility of enforcement. In a survey of 2,500 traders taken in 2007, more than half said they would take advantage of an illegal tip if they were assured they wouldn’t be caught. Without S.E.C. enforcement, Wall Street would degenerate into a cesspool of conspiratorial tipping — as it was before the agency existed. If you think that doesn’t matter, ask yourself if you’d be comfortable investing in, say, Oracle, if Larry Ellison, its lavishly compensated C.E.O., were free to buy and sell the stock, and to clue in his friends, every time Oracle’s sales took an unexpected but not yet public twist. By bringing cases and challenging hedge funds, the S.E.C. aims, at very least, to remind investors that insider trading isn’t simply financial naughtiness — it’s a crime.Over the past several months, I met with Khuzami and others at the S.E.C. and pored over some of the more controversial cases on the agency’s docket. There is no question that the agency is pushing the boundaries, and the definition of insider trading was blurry to begin with. Linda Thomsen, Khuzami’s predecessor, once remarked approvingly that “the genius of insider trading law . . . is its flexibility.” Though lawmakers have proposed legislation codifying insider trading in the statutes, the S.E.C. seems to prefer a common-law approach, on the theory that it will be a less fixed — thus a more worrisome — deterrent.The courts have established that it is illegal to trade on “material” information in breach of a duty to keep the information private. The legal ambiguity arises on two fronts. First, the standard for “material”— any news that a trader would consider important — is fuzzy enough to recall Potter Stewart’s famously elusive definition (he would know it when he saw it) of pornography. Rumors and gossip circulate in the stock market every day; not all of it is “material.” Background information on an industry is clearly O.K. And it’s fine to ask the manager of a local Best Buy about the store’s iPod sales (this is called a channel check). Getting advance word on the entire chain’s sales, however, could be a problem. In general, investors are allowed to assemble pieces of information that, viewed collectively, give them a fuller picture of the whole. But if any one of the mosaic pieces is, in itself, too revealing, the S.E.C. looks askance.Second, the question of who has a duty to keep the material information private is not always clear. In one influential case in the 1980s, Barry Switzer, the University of Oklahoma football coach, was sued for buying stock in a company run by a team booster — a company that was acquired shortly after he invested. At trial, Switzer claimed that he was sunbathing in the stands when he innocently overheard the booster describing the deal. Since the leak was inadvertent, the court ruled that Switzer did not have a duty not to trade.One of the more contentious current cases also involves a sports mogul, Mark Cuban, the irreverent owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team. A few years ago, Cuban was a big shareholder in a Canadian search engine, Mamma.com, which needed to raise cash. The company decided to offer stock to large investors at a discounted price; so in June 2004, according to the S.E.C.’s complaint, the chief executive of Mamma.com called Cuban and asked if he would like to participate. The C.E.O. supposedly prefaced his offer by telling Cuban he was about to impart confidential information. Typically, when such private placements are disclosed, the market price falls — and for that reason, Cuban reacted angrily. At the end of the call, the S.E.C. claims, he snarled: “This means I’m screwed. I can’t sell.” But hours later, he phoned his broker; the next day, he dumped his stake. When the private offering was announced, the stock plunged; Cuban’s early sale saved him $750,000.Cuban’s behavior was exactly what the insider trading rules should prevent: a mogul profiting from privileged information. But it isn’t clear that the rules do prevent it, at least in this case. The difficult part centers on Cuban’s relationship with the Mamma.com chief executive. According to the S.E.C., at some point during their eight-minute phone call, Cuban acquired a duty not to trade. Cuban has denied that he agreed to keep the information about the offering private; even if he did agree, his lawyers argue, he would still have been free to trade, because he and the C.E.O. were not in a relationship of trust. A district court agreed and dismissed the complaint; on appeal, however, the decision was reversed. The case may now go to trial. Cuban, who has been fined nearly $1.7 million for yelling at basketball officials over the years, has, through his lawyers, cried foul against the S.E.C., which he accuses of “a transparent plan to expand the scope of insider trading liability.” The billionaire is said to be fuming and is considering making a movie about the case when it is done.What the Cuban case is to the question of “duty,” the S.E.C.’s suit against the consummately ordinary Steffes family is to the definition of “material.” Last year, the S.E.C. charged six family members with tipping or trading on tips in advance of the 2007 leveraged buyout of Florida East Coast Industries. Two defendants were employees: Gary Griffiths, a former trainman who had risen to the executive position of chief mechanical officer; and his trainman nephew, Cliff Steffes. The two supposedly tipped other relatives; collectively, the family purchased $1.6 million in stock and options. What makes the case unusual is that the S.E.C. is not charging that either man was given an explicit tip. Rather, the complaint charges that a procession of pinstriped bankers took minibus tours of company facilities, that the tours gave rise to rumors of a deal among railyard workers and that Griffiths was asked to arrange a private tour for one group. Such circumstantial evidence gave them to “know” that a deal was in the works, or so contends the S.E.C. Thomas Bishop, the lawyer for Griffiths — who, like Steffes, is fighting the charges — says: “This means anybody who works for a company possesses insider information. That’s past the frontier of what the security laws are intending.”The scale of the family’s investment does suggest that they knew something was up. Yet few Americans would have dreamed they could get into trouble for drawing an inference based on observations at work. And until recently, they might not have. But the Florida East Coast case is the third of its kind in recent years. Whether it will hold up in court is another matter. Khuzami has already had some embarrassing setbacks on insider trading cases — one against a Goldman director that was recently dropped and another, relating to credit-default swaps, that was dismissed by a federal judge. “What the S.E.C. is doing,” says Tom Gorman, a lawyer at Dorsey and Whitney, “is changing the law.”I met Khuzami on a Friday afternoon, when official Washington was heading out for the weekend. The son of ballroom dancers, he is 54, his hair tinged with gray, and has the kind of résumé you often see in Washington: successful prosecutor in his 30s for the Southern District of New York, then a well-paid lawyer for Deutsche Bank. His seven-year stint in the private sector coincided with the years in which securities regulation was, at least in retrospect, too lax. He returned to government in 2009, with a goal of restoring the S.E.C.’s reputation for vigilance. He has nurtured a close relationship with Preet Bharara, the United States attorney who prosecuted Rajaratnam. The S.E.C. has at times seemed out of its element while handling complex mortgage cases, though lately it has been stepping up activity in that area. But insider trading cases are closer to its ken.Khuzami scoffed at the notion, proposed to me by defense lawyers, that he is bringing “gray area” cases and noted that many of the S.E.C.’s targets took pains to hide their tracks. In other words, they knew they were doing wrong. “People claim it’s a trap for the unawares because they don’t know where the line is drawn,” Khuzami said. “From where I sit, it’s pretty clear. Insider trading requires intent.” The traders often rationalize that intent, of course, by telling themselves that cheating is normal and not really so serious. A smattering of free-marketers defend insider trading as aiding market efficiency; except in extreme cases, they question whether it should be a crime at all. Unlike with, say, Ponzi schemes, you can’t identify a victim who suffers a loss when someone profits from an illegal tip.On a little reflection, though, that rationalization doesn’t hold up. The American system of markets may get a lot wrong, but one thing it gets absolutely right is the principle of disclosure. This bedrock of U.S. markets was established in the 1933 Securities Act, and the S.E.C. was created, in 1934, largely to enforce a single proposition: that a corporation issuing securities to the public has to come clean about its financial results and outlook. Disclosure prevents corporations from duping investors. It’s worth noting that disclosure, though a technical term in the context of securities, expresses a broader and distinctly American ideal — that of openness. Governments and most institutions operate better in the sunlight; markets too. Since insiders have a duty of disclosure to people who buy their securities, the courts have ruled that executives who trade in their own stock while failing to disclose confidential information are committing fraud.The traditional theory of insider trading applies to corporate insiders and other fiduciaries (even to executives’ psychiatrists); it also covers traders who pay insiders for information or otherwise induce them to leak. Ivan Boesky, the arbitrageur who pleaded guilty to securities fraud in the 1980s, was the classic case. But the traditional theory doesn’t, by a long stretch, cover all of the behavior that the public would consider cheating. What happens, for instance, when a corporate outsider steals information? The law on that issue was, for years, unresolved. Then, in the ’90s, James O’Hagan, a partner in a Minneapolis law firm, learned that a client of the firm was planning a bid for Pillsbury. O’Hagan bought options on Pillsbury and made a quick $4 million. His conviction was reversed under the theory that since his firm had no obligation to Pillsbury, he hadn’t defrauded it. But in a 6-to-3 opinion written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1997, the Supreme Court reinstated it. Stealing information, the court reckoned, was just that: stealing. The decision validated “misappropriation theory,” which holds that outsiders are guilty of securities fraud when they misappropriate confidential information “in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information.” This seems the right result: whether an executive trades on a secret or a lawyer steals the secret and trades on it makes little difference.And without “misappropriation theory,” Khuzami’s crusade against hedge funds would scarcely be possible.Khuzami assured me he wasn’t intent on “slamming” hedge funds, but he clearly sees them as breeding grounds for potential cheaters. “People ask me, ‘Is there more inside trading going on?’ ” Khuzami said. “Developments in the market” — he meant the growth of hedge funds — “suggest there might be. People are looking for any advantage.” Hedge funds, he noted, command large sums of capital (in total, an estimated $2 trillion); many have contacts with well-placed Wall Street and corporate sources, and they operate hidden from public view (this will change somewhat as a result of the Dodd-Frank law, which will require medium- and large-size funds to register with the S.E.C.). Finally, the hedge fund business is immensely lucrative and fiercely competitive, which ratchets up managers’ incentives to cheat.In testimony to Congress, Khuzami said the S.E.C. was canvassing the industry for funds with “aberrational performance,” on the theory that above-average funds may be benefiting from tips. Khuzami went further at the hearing and declared that “anybody who is beating market indexes by 3 percent and doing it on a steady basis” could be a suspect. This pronouncement horrifies professional money managers, who rightly point out that there are plenty of ways of beating the market that don’t involve cheating.Khuzami and Bharara have advanced a theory that, for some minority of the hedge fund industry, trading on illegal tips has become a “business model” — a routine aspect of doing business. In effect, they view insider trading as a white-collar version of organized crime.This theory was years in the making. In 2005, the S.E.C. learned that, improbably, a retired seamstress in Croatia had bet big on Reebok stock just before the sneaker company announced a takeover. The seamstress turned out to be a front. The agency ultimately charged 17 people in a huge insider trading ring, prominently including Eugene Plotkin, a dashing ballroom dancer and Russian-born Goldman Sachs analyst. For Sanjay Wadhwa, a lawyer in the S.E.C.’s Manhattan bureau, the “seamstress case” was a new concept: inside trading as a group endeavor. It “whetted our appetite,” Wadhwa recalls.Then, in August 2006, the S.E.C. got a tip about a New York hedge fund, Sedna Capital Management. Wadhwa was assigned to this case, too. Sedna was a small fund, but its manager, Rengan Rajaratnam, was the younger brother of Raj Rajaratnam, the head of Galleon Group, a $7 billion fund. Born in Sri Lanka and educated at Wharton, the elder Rajaratnam kept an extensive network of business associates, many of whom were also South Asians. Since 2000, his fund outperformed its peers by a stunning eight percentage points a year. Wadhwa’s focus began to shift to Raj, a gregarious, daring trader who reminded him of Plotkin.When I met Wadhwa at a coffee bar near his office, he seemed upset by the agency’s bad press and, perhaps for that reason, eager to tell me how they caught Rajaratnam. In 2007, the S.E.C. began an examination of Galleon, issuing subpoenas for its trading, telephone and bank records, its appointment calendars and e-mail. Wadhwa’s interest was piqued by the cryptic tone of Rajaratnam’s instant messages with Roomy Khan, a former Intel employee with extensive contacts in Silicon Valley. One, from Khan to Rajaratnam, urged the hedge fund magnate not to buy Polycom stock until she got “guidance.” Sensing the potential for a criminal case, the agency briefed lawyers at the Southern District, who agreed the case looked promising. Then, in March 2007, the S.E.C. received an anonymous letter on plain white paper claiming that Galleon traded tips in exchange for prostitution and “other forms of illegal entertainment.” The author hurled a taunting challenge at the regulators: “It hurts my heart to see how these guys make monkeys out of individual investors, S.E.C. insider trading regulations and the attorney general’s office.”The S.E.C. could not identify the letter’s author, nor did prostitution figure in the eventual charges. But that June, Rajaratnam trooped downtown to the S.E.C. for a formal deposition. The agency’s lawyers asked about insider trading — which he denied. Less than a month later, Hilton Hotels revealed that it was being acquired; Finra promptly notified the S.E.C. that Galleon had invested in Hilton before the news broke. Wadhwa was stunned by Rajaratnam’s brass.Two weeks later, Rajaratnam did it again: Galleon sold Google just before it announced disappointing earnings. In November, an F.B.I. agent visited Khan and asked if she would be willing to talk about Rajaratnam. Khan replied, “What took you so long?” In a bid for a reduced sentence, she agreed to be a cooperating witness. In interviews with the S.E.C. and prosecutors, she divulged the identity of numerous tippers and sketched a broad map of inside traders. Armed with Khan’s proffer, prosecutors for the Southern District obtained the first of many wiretaps, which were crucial in winning convictions.The Rajaratnam case exposed some of the elite of American business: an Intel executive, a former McKinsey partner, a married senior vice president of I.B.M. who was tipping his lover. The trial transcripts suggest a Wall Street subculture that is, in a word, rotten. The tipped information was plainly material; much of it amounted to brazen cheating. But it’s unclear that Galleon is a template for the industry. The S.E.C. has yet to find another large hedge fund for which insider trading is a “business model.” It is known to be investigating SAC Capital Advisors, one of the country’s biggest and most successful hedge funds. Since its inception in 1992, SAC has returned 29 percent a year. Steven A. Cohen, the founder, told me that the fund comes by its results without cheating; as compared with other funds, he says, SAC has more analysts (900 traders and support staff) and more-effective incentives to discourage losses, and it has magnified its returns with leverage. This is plausible, although his returns remain eye-catching. SAC’s huge volume gives it privileged relationships with traders across Wall Street. At very least, it would be hard to argue that firms like SAC do not have an informational edge.At least three traders who worked at SAC have pleaded guilty to using inside information while employed at other hedge funds. One, Noah Freeman, a Harvard grad who traded computer-chip stocks, testified that he also cheated while at SAC. There is no evidence that SAC knew this, and in fact, Freeman testified that he took pains to circumvent SAC’s compliance policies. SAC eventually fired Freeman for poor performance.Hedge fund managers are plainly frightened of becoming the next target. McDermott, Will & Emery, an international law firm, has warned its clients, “Investment managers who outperform the market should be aware that the S.E.C. may soon come knocking.” Compliance staffs of hedge funds are warning their traders to report information sources that might be a problem. Though information is central to what they do, fund managers are becoming sensitized to thinking about whether the information gleaned by their traders is, in fact, too good to use. One New York investor, explaining why he took a loss rather than sell a stock on which he had borderline information, said, “The line on what is material is blurry.” If traders who were not engaged in illegal behavior have stepped back from the line, I sensed that that was O.K. with Khuzami.One sign of the S.E.C.’s impact is that hedge funds have sharply cut their use of so-called expert networks. These networks hire people with knowledge of specific industries to talk to traders. Networks serve a valid research function, but the potential for experts to cross the line into illegal tipping is plain. Six onetime employees at a Mountain View, Calif., network, Primary Global Research, have been indicted (Freeman was one of those). Since the scandal, business at networks is down by 40 percent, according to Integrity Research. No other network has been implicated, but if hedge funds and other traders have to be extra careful about how they do research — even if an occasional borderline trade is ruled off limits — it’s a reasonable price for ensuring that markets are fair.The real problem with the S.E.C.’s focusing on high-return funds is that it skates over the crucial distinction between short- and long-term investing. There are at least 8,000 hedge funds in the United States, and quite a few, like SAC, are engaged in rapid-fire trading — basically trying to outguess the competition with regard to disclosures that will become public in a week or two anyway. Freeman, for instance, was obsessed with trying to outguess the Wall Street “chatter” and the “whisper number” (the predisclosure estimate of earnings). Absent some tip regarding forthcoming news, he had no value added and no edge. For investors working longer horizons the picture is different. Skillful, long-term investors can make money without tips, by analyzing information that is already public. Indeed, to someone holding a stock for years, a quarterly earnings tip would be of little use.Society has an interest in genuine — hopefully intelligent — research, the kind that asks whether Google or Apple will be the more dominant business down the road or whether oil reserves will run short. But the sort of desperate hypertrading that was Freeman’s specialty does not add to economic output or jobs or anything that matters. What it does do is ratchet up market volatility, contributing to the mind-numbing daily swings that send ordinary investors to the sidelines. Lately, thanks in part to that feverish trading, triple-digit market moves have become routine. The marked increase in volatility complicates the S.E.C.’s job considerably. When stocks jump or plummet in reaction to news, the payoff for those who trade on tips ahead of the news rises as well. Ferreting out who is prescient and who is crooked becomes more important than ever.The Galleon case instilled fear in a lot of traders — just as the Boesky-era cases did — but the fear may have subsided somewhat. Especially in volatile markets, the temptation to cheat is fierce. A stiff sentence for Rajaratnam would reinvigorate the sense of a deterrent; on the other hand, a light penalty would make the lengthy, costly prosecution look like a waste. It would discourage future prosecutions and stoke the populist suspicion that no one on Wall Street ever really does time. The loser would be the public’s faith in market integrity. And, as Khuzami notes, “Who’s going to trade if they think the game is rigged?”'"
"'11-09-23,'1','Five Questions for HP’s New CEO Meg Whitman and Chairman Ray LaneIt’s been an extraordinary week for Hewlett-Packard. On Monday, HP was a sleeping giant with an unclear strategy, an unpopular CEO and a stagnating share price.Then word came, via AllThingsD, that something big was coming from the board of directors. And as AllThingsD first reported (again), HP directors made one of their own, Meg Whitman, the former eBay CEO who had become a director earlier this year, the new CEO. Léo Apotheker resigned, but don’t cry for him, because according to his contract, he made out rather well. Even before it was made official, investors applauded the move, sending HP shares skyward.Analysts did what they always do, and, well, analyzed. And though it looked more like drama criticism, it’s not as if HP hasn’t known boardroom dramas before. Finally, the deed was done, meaning it was time to hold a conference call, but not before talking first to Kara Swisher of AllThingsD.I got to talk to Whitman and HP Chairman Ray Lane yesterday, too, but I had to wait until after the conference call. With so many critics screaming that Whitman has no experience running an enterprise hardware company — and let’s be honest, there aren’t that many who do — I asked her to elaborate on the defense, made on the conference call with analysts, that her experience as a buyer of enterprise technology, during her years as CEO at eBay, provided important experience that will help her be an effective CEO at HP. I also asked about Autonomy, the British software firm that HP is in the process of acquiring for $10 billion, and how it will fit within HP; about the company’s plans for cloud services; and about the state of the HP brand amid all the corporate mishegas that has unfolded in the last several months.AllThingsD: Meg, the main criticism of you, since you’ve been named CEO of HP, is that your primary experience before was at eBay, which is a consumer-facing company. The response on yesterday’s conference call has been that at eBay you were a purchaser of a lot of enterprise technology and that this gives you some important relevant experience. I get the point, but could you elaborate on it a bit? How does having been an enterprise buyer help you be HP’s CEO?Whitman: What HP needs now more than anything else is management skills, communication skills and a commitment to executional excellence, all of which I know well, and are sort of core competencies from my 35-year career in business. I know technology because I ran a company whose very existence would not have been possible without it, and was a very significant buyer of technology products. And so that brings me a unique buyer’s perspective. But I have not spent 35 years in the enterprise business. Add so what that means is that I will be relying heavily on Dave Donatelli; on Todd Bradley; on the senior executives at HP; and also, frankly, on Ray Lane, who was at Oracle for many years, and EDS, and who knows this space well. So I think what customers will get is that one plus one equals three.Lane: I agree with that. What we need here, and what we didn’t have before, is operational execution, communication skills, getting the team on the same page and leading them. The CEOs of $130 billion companies are not leading the technology development of those companies. I think Meg can go into any enterprise and visit with any CIO or CEO and do really well. So whether it is the technology side or the sales side, I don’t think anyone is giving her enough credit on those fronts. She can do just fine. And then on top of that she has strong operating executives under her who do know the enterprise business. But right now it is the need for leadership of the people, a focus on executing and operating. I could point back to Lou Gerstner at IBM, or even my own days at Oracle. When I joined Oracle, people thought the board had lost its mind, because I was a consultant at Booz Allen. People scoffed and said ‘How is a consultant going to lead the worldwide sales force at Oracle, a trained wolf pack?’ And somehow I figured it out. And I knew nothing about software, but I learned, and I learned from Larry Ellison, who is one of the best.I want to talk a bit about Autonomy, and about unstructured data. You made a comment about that when you talked with Kara Swisher of AllThingsD yesterday. Talk to me about where you see Autonomy fitting within HP. Do you still intend to let it be independent? How do you see the alignment shaping up?Whitman: It’s a big and fast-growing market. Of all the data out there, about 15 percent of it is structured and 85 percent of it is unstructured. And the unstructured data is growing by leaps and bounds. There are not a lot of good software companies that can help companies manage unstructured data and help companies make business decisions based on what they see in that unstructured data. So what we hope to do with Autonomy, and I’m enthusiastic about this acquisition, is take what is fabulous about Autonomy — they have a leading position in the marketplace — and put it through the very powerful HP distribution system. And I think what Mike Lynch is excited about — he is the founder and CEO of Autonomy — is taking this great product and getting it into more people’s hands. And we just need to grow this company as fast as we can; extend our lead and our accumulated experience in this area. So that’s the plan for Autonomy.Lane: Yeah, I think the synergies are great, and I think it makes a lot of sense. It will make a lot of sense to customers if HP engages them in a dialogue of managing unstructured data.You don’t think HP paid too much for Autonomy?Whitman: You know what? It is what it is.Lane: We wish we could have bought it for cheaper, but it was the market price. People thought we overpaid for 3Par, and you know what? We’re hitting it out of the park.Is HP still going to be player in cloud services? That was a big commitment that Léo made in March. How far along is that plan?Lane: Absolutely. The cloud is way ahead of plan. So our cloud services have gone live. So that is absolutely part of the plan, yes.Meg, a lot of the same people who applauded your selection to HP’s board of directors are criticizing your selection as CEO. Why do you think there’s a disconnect?Whitman: I don’t know. There’s always people who have different points of view on things. What I have to do — and I said this on the conference call — is lead this company, make it a great company again and fulfill its destiny as the icon of Silicon Valley and of California, and deliver the results. I will have to prove myself by delivering the results. If we’re going to restore the confidence that investors have in us, and that employees have in us, we have to deliver. We have to mean what we say and say what we mean and deliver the results. And that is what I intend to deliver.Meg, you have a lot of history managing brands. I’m thinking of the job you had managing brands for Procter & Gamble. What’s wrong and what’s right about HP’s brand right now?Whitman: I think HP is known as the world’s largest provider of information technology, and we are a trusted brand. We are a worldwide brand that touches both consumers and businesses. If you’re an enterprise, we have full suite of solutions. I know that when I bought enterprise hardware and software at eBay, I wanted one person to choke when something went wrong. I wanted one supplier to go to and say ‘Hey, this is not working.’ And so I think we have a fabulous brand in a world where technology is increasingly fundamental. I will say — and Ray would say this as well — I think we need crisper communications with all the constituencies. I think on Aug. 18 we confused people. We didn’t mean to do that, but we did. And so I think we’ve got some work to do around communicating crisply and cleanly about what we’re about — the moves that we’re making — to employees, customers, shareholders and, frankly, to the press.'"

"'11-09-23,'1','We all three sat at the kitchen table in our raincoats, and Joel smashed tomatoes with a small rubber mallet. We had seen it on TV: a man with an untamed mustache and a mallet slaughtering vegetables, and people in clear plastic ponchos soaking up the mess, having the time of their lives. We aimed to smile like that. We felt the pop and smack of tomato guts exploding; the guts dripped down the walls and landed on our cheeks and foreheads and congealed in our hair. When we ran out of tomatoes, we went into the bathroom and pulled out tubes of our mother’s lotions from under the sink. We took off our raincoats and positioned ourselves so that when the mallet slammed down and forced out the white cream, it would get everywhere, the creases of our shut-tight eyes and the folds of our ears.Our mother came into the kitchen, pulling her robe shut and rubbing her eyes, saying, “Man oh man, what time is it?” We told her it was eight-fifteen, and she said [expletive], still keeping her eyes closed, just rubbing them harder, and then she said [expletive] again, louder, and picked up the teakettle and slammed it down on the stove and screamed, “Why aren’t you in school?”It was eight-fifteen at night, and besides, it was a Sunday, but no one told Ma that. She worked graveyard shifts at the brewery up the hill from our house, and sometimes she got confused. She would wake randomly, mixed up, mistaking one day for another, one hour for the next, order us to brush our teeth and get into PJs and lie in bed in the middle of the day; or when we came into the kitchen in the morning, half asleep, she’d be pulling a meat loaf out of the oven, saying, “What is wrong with you boys? I been calling and calling for dinner.”We had learned not to correct her or try to pull her out of the confusion; it only made things worse. Once, before we’d known better, Joel refused to go to the neighbors and ask for a stick of butter. It was nearly midnight and she was baking a cake for Manny.“Ma, you’re crazy,” Joel said. “Everyone’s sleeping, and it’s not even his birthday.”She studied the clock for a good while, shook her head quickly back and forth, and then focused on Joel; she bored deep in his eyes as if she was looking past his eyeballs, into the lower part of his brain. Her mascara was all smudged and her hair was stiff and thick, curling black around her face and matted down in the back. She looked like a raccoon caught digging in the trash: surprised, dangerous.'"

"'11-09-23,'1','Financial markets are tiring of the Federal Reserve’s love offerings. The central bank has long been able to soothe nervous investors with rate cuts or newly printed money. But markets on Thursday spurned the announcement of the Twist, an operation to lengthen the maturity of $400 billion of the Fed’s $1.7 trillion Treasury holdings.Stocks fell sharply and the price of bonds from governments still considered safe rose. Investors were right not to be impressed. The Twist is aimed primarily at the American housing market. But even if the Fed’s rearrangement lowers mortgage costs, house prices will be held back by a weak economy and the huge oversupply left from the bubble years.Tight monetary policy has long ceased to stand in the way of economic growth. Official real interest rates are solidly negative almost everywhere. The Twist could even impede lending — and growth — by narrowing the gap between short and long term rates. Banks, after all, gain from a steep yield curve.Central banks could try to regain the favor of investors with yet more monetary love. The Bank of England dropped some not-so-subtle hints this week about another round of quantitative easing. In the United States, some are calling for QE3. But no amount of money, whether from fiscal transfers, QE3 or QE33, can force banks to lend or consumers to borrow and spend.More money will not push up the prices of financial assets that investors deem too risky. The Asian market rout is caused in part by fund managers trying to get ahead of an expected wave of redemptions from cross-border investors.'"
"'11-09-23,'1','The snap decision to issue a statement — the dinner was intended as an informal gathering before the opening Friday of the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund — is a reflection of rising concern about the health of the global economy.The I.M.F. -World Bank meeting is traditionally a chance for nations to address problems in the developing world. This year, however, the meeting has been given over to talk about problems in Europe and the United States.There is growing evidence that those issues are weighing on the economies of developing nations by unsettling their markets.“The immediate problem at hand is to get growth back on track in developed countries,” the countries Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa said in a statement Thursday. In language more often directed at poorer countries, the five nations called on developed countries “to adopt responsible macroeconomic and financial policies.”Even traditional allies are expressing growing frustration with the political paralysis and economic problems of Europe and the United States.The leaders of six members of the G-20 released a letter Thursday to Nicolas Sarkozy, president of France, calling for “decisive action to support growth, confidence and credibility.”Five of the six countries — Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Mexico and South Korea — have little in common except that they are not members of the European Union. Yet they, along with the sixth, Britain, stressed the need for stronger steps.“The barriers to action are now political as much as economic,” the letter said. “We must send a clear signal that we are ready to take the actions necessary to maintain growth and stability for all for the future.”The United States elevated the meetings of the G-20 during the financial crisis after concluding that its traditional meetings with six other countries — the Group of 7 — were excluding too many important players. The nations now represented at the table account for about 85 percent of global economic output.'"
"'11-09-23,'1','While no evidence has emerged that political favoritism played a role in what administration officials assert were merit-based decisions, Solyndra drew plenty of high-level attention. Its lobbyists corresponded frequently and met at least three times with an aide to a top White House official, , to push for loans, breaks and other government assistance.Administration officials lay the blame for Solyndra’s problems in part on the global collapse in the price of components, which forced the company to sell its innovative solar panels at less than it cost to make them. Some lawmakers on Capitol Hill question whether the firm’s executives may have engaged in a cover-up of their precarious financial condition, allegations the company denies.But industry analysts and government auditors fault the Obama administration for failing to properly evaluate the business proposals or take note of troubling signs already evident in the solar energy marketplace.“It was alarming,” said Frank Rusco, a program director at the , which found that Energy Department preliminary loan approvals — including the one for Solyndra — were granted at times before officials had completed mandatory evaluations of the financial and engineering viability of the projects. “They can’t really evaluate the risks without following the rules.”The Energy Department’s senior staff has acknowledged in interviews the intense pressure from top Obama administration officials to rush stimulus spending out the door.“We had to knock down some barriers standing in the way to get these projects funded,” Matthew C. Rogers, the Energy Department official overseeing the loan guarantee program, said in March 2009, just days before Solyndra got its provisional loan commitment. Mr. Rogers said Energy Secretary had been personally reviewing loan applications and urging faster action on them.Two committees of Congress, the Department of Energy’s inspector general and the Department of Justice are now investigating what went wrong in the Solyndra case. In Washington, it has set in motion a highly partisan battle over the benefits or failings of Mr. Obama’s stimulus program.Some Republican lawmakers have raised questions about political interference in the loan decision, pointing to the fact that George B. Kaiser, a billionaire from Tulsa, Okla., was a fund-raiser for Mr. Obama’s 2008 campaign and the backer of a foundation that is Solyndra’s leading investor. While he has met with top White House and administration officials multiple times, Mr. Kaiser and administration officials say they discussed issues related to his foundation, not Solyndra.But during the period when Solyndra’s loan guarantee was under review and management by the Energy Department, the company spent nearly $1.8 million on Washington lobbyists, employing six firms with ties to members of Congress and officials of the Obama White House. None of the other three solar panel manufacturers that eventually got federal loan guarantees spent a dime on lobbyists.Energy Department officials said the lobbying had no impact on their decisions. But Solyndra, which had been among 143 companies to express an interest in a loan guarantee and 16 that were asked to submit a formal application — ended up securing the first financial commitment. Solyndra’s loan guarantee was the highest of the four companies.Tim Harris, the chief executive of Solopower, which got a $197 million loan guarantee last month to build solar panels in , Calif., said his company had never considered employing a Washington lobbyist to grease the application. “It was made clear to us early in the process that that was clearly verboten,” Mr. Harris said. “We were told that it was not only not helpful but it was not acceptable.”If there was a single bet made by the Obama administration that would determine the success or failure of its investment in Solyndra, it centered on the global price its competitors pay for one of earth’s most common elements: silicon.Solyndra’s unique tube-shaped solar panels — which harvest early morning and evening light for electricity instead of just midday sun — do not rely on silicon. But it assumed its competitors would continue to pay a relatively high price for silicon, allowing Solyndra to charge the premium required to turn a profit on its panels. It was an assumption Obama officials bought into. But industry experts outside the federal government, going back to 2008, were predicting silicon prices were headed for a steep fall.Bush administration officials had started the review of the Solyndra application in May 2008. They were anxious to approve the deal, because members of Congress were complaining that the loan guarantee program, signed into law in 2005, still had not given out its first award. But in the final weeks of the administration, Energy Department officials put the brakes on any loan commitment to Solyndra, partly out of concern that its costs made the price of manufacturing power capacity significantly higher than its competitors.The Obama administration, though, was determined to move ahead. “DOE is trying to deliver on the first loan guarantee within 60 days from ,” one March 2009 e-mail from an official said.Damien LaVera, an Energy Department spokesman, said administration officials realized the Solyndra plan posed some certain risks. The loan program was designed to help finance cutting-edge projects that could not otherwise find enough private-sector investors.“But we did not just take what this company was telling us,” Mr. LaVera said. “We did the analysis on our own and decided it was a good bet.”But Shyam Mehta, a senior analyst at GTM Research who follows the solar energy industry, said that he questions just how careful this review was, given the obvious warning signs.“There was just too much misplaced zeal at the Department of Energy for this company,” Mr. Mehta said.Solyndra executives, seeking an edge in the competition for federal loan guarantees, began employing Washington lobbyists in 2008. The company stepped up its efforts in early 2009, retaining McBee Strategic Consulting. Five lobbyists employed by the McBee group eventually worked on Solyndra’s behalf, including Michael Sheehy, a former top aide to Representative of California, the House Democratic leader. Solyndra has paid McBee Consulting $340,000 since 2009.Steve McBee, the firm’s founder and a former Senate aide, did not return calls seeking comment, but in an April 2009 press release he said that his firm could help technology companies gain a chunk of the projected bonanza of $100 billion in federal money for clean-energy projects.Mr. McBee said that lobbying was not allowed as part of the process. But in early 2009, the firm filed a disclosure form saying it was retained by Solyndra to lobby on stimulus act spending related to the Energy Department’s loan guarantee program. A critical piece of the stimulus bill removed a requirement that firms like Solyndra pay a substantial up-front fee to cover the risk of a loan, a provision that had slowed approvals of loan guarantees. Once that was removed, loans began to flow and Solyndra was the first to benefit.Over the next three years, Solyndra retained two other lobbying firms, hired two in-house lobbyists and aggressively pushed for White House meetings to plead its case. Another lobbying and public relations firm with close ties to the White House — Glover Park Group — also worked on Solyndra’s behalf.In January 2010, four months after the loan was finalized, Solyndra executives and lobbyists pressed Gregory S. Nelson, an aide to Ms. Jarrett, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, for a meeting to boast about progress at the plant financed with federal money and to discuss a possible second loan, according to White House e-mails. That meeting occurred on Jan. 15, 2010, records show. White House scheduling officials later began talks that led to Mr. Obama’s visit in May.But signs were increasing in 2010 that the company’s business plan was imploding. The dive in silicon prices, which had started in late 2008, accelerated by the end of 2010. Solyndra sales were growing, but so were its losses. It was forced to slash prices much lower than its costs in order to compete with conventional silicon panel producers. Trade publications began to question whether Solyndra would survive — even its own accountant in March 2010 said it had “substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.”But Solyndra and its lobbyists continued to provide assurances to the White House and the Energy Department, which still could have stopped the flow of federal money that was being given out for construction of a new factory.“We have no intention of going out of business,” David Miller, a Solyndra executive, wrote to Mr. Nelson, the White House aide, in July 2010. Mr. Miller, added in May 2011, as the cash crunch had severely worsened, that “we have good market momentum.”Mr. Nelson wrote back encouraged. “Fantastic to hear that business is doing well,” he said, according to a May 2011 e-mail released by the White House. “Keep up the good work.”Similar positive predictions were shared with members of Congress this year, after the company sought and received permission from the Obama administration to restructure its $535 million loan, which put private investors ahead of the government for some of the debt if the company was liquidated.That disconnect has led some members of Congress to question if Solyndra was intentionally misleading officials in Washington.“Even as late as this summer, Solyndra executives told us here in Washington that the company’s finances were improving,” said Representative Cliff Stearns, Republican of , and the chairman of the panel leading the Solyndra inquiry. “Solyndra was never profitable, and it was obviously poorly managed and unviable in the global market.”'"
"'11-09-23,'1','The sell-off in gold was part of a broader move in the markets that had investors shifting away from perceived riskier assets, like commodities, and into the dollar in reaction to the Federal Reserve’s announcement on Wednesday of its new stimulus program.In addition, the Fed said that there were “significant downside risks” to the United States economy, which sent several commodities, including crude oil and copper, tumbling on Thursday on fears of a global slowdown in demand.Other market participants said hedge funds were selling their positions in gold to raise cash to meet increased capital demands for their borrowings from Wall Street banks as the assets they have put up as collateral, like other commodities or stocks, have declined sharply in value.“On the one hand you have a lot of strength in the U.S. dollar, historically gold and the dollar do trade inversely,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “The hedge funds are long gold and they need to raise cash and it looks like they are definitely selling some gold.”Others say some hedge funds may be selling to meet redemption requests from investors who have been spooked by the recent market volatility and fear a repeat of the problems of late 2008.“A lot of investors are waking up to the realization that something is off. We’ve seen Goldman Sachs close its flagship fund, legendary hedge funds are down sharply, and I suspect we’re going to see significant withdrawals from some hedge funds this year,” said Michael A. Gayed, the chief investment strategist of the investment advisory firm Pension Partners.“The tendency for individual hedge funds or anybody is to sell winners before they sell losers. What’s been one of the few winners this year? It’s been gold,” Mr. Gayed added.Still, some are not yet ready to call the end of the gold rush. Even with the pullback, gold remains one of the most profitable investments this year with a gain of 22 percent.Some strategists have even predicted that gold will reach a record of above $2,300, which it hit during the early 1980s when adjusted for inflation and translated into current dollars. Likewise, the world’s largest exchange-traded gold fund, the SPDR Gold Shares, fell 2.6 percent on Thursday, but remains up 22 percent for the year.Gold, whether through futures contracts or via exchange-traded funds, has been a popular investment among some of the world’s largest hedge funds. One of the best known “gold bugs” is John A. Paulson, whose firm, Paulson & Company, is the biggest shareholder in the SPDR Gold Shares ETF. But many other hedge funds have embraced the metal as well.After peaking in early August, hedge funds have been reducing their exposure in the gold futures market, according to Mary Ann Bartels, the head of United States technical analysis for Bank of America Merrill Lynch.“A lot of speculators were very long in July,” Ms. Bartels said. “But they’ve been taking it down ever since.”'"
"'11-09-23,'1','The lower house of Congress has approved the creation of a Truth Commission charged with investigating human rights abuses, including those committed during the 1964-1985 military dictatorship. The Chamber of Deputies approved the government proposal late Wednesday to create a commission that will “examine and clarify” rights violations between 1946 and 1988, during which Brazil saw several periods of authoritarian rule. The measure would be a significant step in the effort to bring dictatorship-era abuses to light in Brazil, which has largely avoided formal discussion of the topic and never sentenced anyone for political crimes carried out during military rule. The bill will now go to the Senate.'"
"'11-09-23,'1','As bedbugs have made a comeback, aided by resistance to pesticides and spread by worldwide travel, scientists have found that panic over the blood-sucking pests may be more dangerous than their bite. Some people are misusing poisonous chemicals in a desperate bid to eradicate the pests, federal officials said Thursday.At least 111 people in seven states — 64 of them in New York City — have been sickened by the overuse or misuse of common pesticides against bedbugs over the last eight years, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. One person who became ill, a woman in North Carolina, died after dousing her home and herself with pesticides.The poisonings serve as a warning, experts said, that people could do more damage to their health by misusing pesticides than they would suffer from the bedbugs, which are upsetting and unpleasant, but not known to be carriers of disease.“People lose their minds and, yeah, they’ll do a lot of things trying to get rid of them,” said Dini M. Miller, associate professor of urban pest management at Virginia Tech. “Certainly the overapplication of pesticides is one of them.”When Lilah Gray started getting bitten by bedbugs, all she could think of was getting rid of them. Her husband sprayed and saturated their double-wide trailer home in Rocky Mount, N.C., with pesticides. But convinced that she could still feel the bugs crawling on her, Ms. Gray soaked a napkin with Hot Shot Bedbug and Flea Killer and applied it directly to her chest, then soaked her hair in pesticide and put a plastic bag over it.Within a few days, Ms. Gray, 65, who had a history of breathing problems, was hospitalized and breathing with the aid of a ventilator. She died on May 26, 2010, of respiratory failure, which, a federal official said Thursday, is believed to have been exacerbated by high doses of pesticides. Most of the other poisoning cases were mild, with victims commonly having headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting.'"
"'11-09-23,'1','From interviews with associates and friends, as well as court documents filed by both sides in the trustee’s case, a picture emerges of Wilpon as the polished, glad-handing networker and face of the Mets and Sterling Equities, and Katz as a rough-hewn financial whiz who called many of the important shots over the years.“Fred makes you feel good, and Saul makes sure you get your pencil,” said one friend who did business with the Wilpons. “Saul wouldn’t be Saul without Fred, and Fred wouldn’t be Fred without Saul.”Their financial history is at the center of the trustee’s case against Wilpon and Katz, the fate of which is to be decided as early as next week by Judge Jed S. Rakoff of United States District Court in Manhattan.Most of Picard’s claim against the team’s owners — some $700 million — effectively hinges on his assertion that the men were experienced, accomplished and sophisticated businessmen and investors who had plenty of reasons to be suspicious of Madoff’s operation, but who were simply too enamored of their years of profits to heed those warnings. In contesting Picard’s claim, Wilpon and Katz draw a line between what they knew and did not know. They claim to be experts in real estate but novices at investing in stocks and bonds. Their lack of knowledge about the equity markets, they say, is precisely why they put so much trust in Madoff.In depositions taken under oath last year, Wilpon and Katz said that they rarely asked questions of Madoff, and that despite having entrusted him with $1.6 billion over their decades of dealings, they long ago stopped even looking at their account statements.Some of the businessmen who know or have worked with Wilpon and Katz, and who were interviewed over the last several months, were eager to be identified by name; others would not be, for fear of embarrassing the men or losing the chance to do business with them in the future. A number of those interviewed subscribed to the notion that Wilpon and Katz could be sophisticated in one business and almost ignorant in another. They accepted the idea that Wilpon and Katz simply trusted the wrong man.“I know real estate, but there’s a difference between developing real estate and the stock market,” said Stephen M. Ross, chief executive of the Related Companies, who has done business with Wilpon and Katz. “It’s a different world altogether. Could I have been duped by Madoff? Totally.”But others interviewed — including some who had sat at the same negotiating table with Wilpon and Katz over the years — were more skeptical, or at least less forgiving. One banker who has worked with the Mets’ owners said he had no doubt that they were smart and surrounded themselves with sharp advisers. The banker, who did not want to jeopardize future business with Wilpon and Katz, said they were tough negotiators who grasped complex financial concepts.Another friend and associate called Katz “a very sophisticated guy with an intellect like a machine,” and another associate called Wilpon “the brains of the operations” who “buried his head in the sand” and was “smart enough to know right from wrong.”Wilpon and Katz, both publicly and in sworn testimony, have said that if there were any warning signs about Madoff, they either were not aware of them or lacked the background and financial acumen to meaningfully appreciate their import.Indeed, in court documents and depositions, Wilpon and Katz portray themselves as typical brokerage customers relying on Madoff’s expertise, not as executives comfortable with the complexities of stock investing. They assert that they did not understand Madoff’s investment strategy, but also that they did not question his distinctively reliable returns.Wilpon and one of his senior partners say they were aware of investigations of Madoff by the Securities and Exchange Commission but were always comforted that nothing seemed to come of them.Katz, for his part, even appears to make light of his investing I.Q.With a mix of pugnacity and pride, Katz testified that he had earned nothing more than a 2.1 grade-point average at Brooklyn College. He testified that he had not bought stock on his own in 19 years and “got killed” trading stock options a quarter-century ago. “I’m not good at it,” he said. “It’s not my business.”That said, Katz insisted that he was still the smartest of the Sterling partners, and that if he did not know how Madoff achieved his investing magic, no one at the company did. “Which is kind of scary, isn’t it?” Katz said in his deposition.Wilpon’s understanding of Madoff’s strategy was that “he was never going to hit a home run, so to speak,” but “he wasn’t going to lose a lot.” He said in his deposition that investing was not his specialty, so he did not question Madoff on business matters. He said he was aware of news articles critical of Madoff’s strategy, but said he just figured they “didn’t understand it.”“I just didn’t discuss business with him,” Wilpon added of his dealings with Madoff. They were not “in a context of, you know, what’s happening in the business, how are you investing these funds? Because frankly, I wouldn’t — that’s not my expertise.”Picard and his lawyers have little regard for claims by Wilpon and Katz that they were not equipped to be suspicious of Madoff.“The Sterling partners are not your average investors,” Picard’s lawsuit asserts. “They are a team of sophisticated professionals who built a business empire spanning four major industries, including real estate, professional baseball and sports media, private equity, and hedge funds. Notably, very early on in their almost quarter-century-long business relationship with Madoff, the Sterling Partners discovered Madoff’s anomalous and implausibly high and consistent returns, and then found endless ways to exploit those returns.”The size and nature of the men’s business empire have certainly come to light in the course of the legal fight over the nearly 10 months since Picard filed his suit.In nearly 40 years, Sterling grew into a diversified private company run by a small group of Wilpon and Katz family members and trusted lieutenants that owns, develops and manages property, sometimes on its own, sometimes with partners. Sterling has bought or developed more than 23 million square feet of commercial property, 57,000 residential units and 8 million square feet of retail property.Among its best-known developments are Citi Field, the $800 million home of the Mets, and the Lipstick Building in Manhattan, where Madoff had his offices and where he met Wilpon and Katz for lunch from time to time.The tiny share of the Mets that Wilpon bought in 1980 was important to his real estate business, said John Pickett, who brought him into the ownership group, because it gave Sterling instant credibility and celebrity in real estate circles. Subsequently, Wilpon and Katz became half-owners with Nelson Doubleday in 1986, then bought him out in 2002. They subsequently bought a minor league team, the Brooklyn Cyclones, and built a ballpark for them in Coney Island.Sterling also ran its own version of an in-house bank; created real estate funds and a hedge fund that manages billions of dollars; and invested in companies like PathoGenesis, a biotechnology company, and Changing World Technologies, which turns waste into energy. Another investment, Katz said in his deposition, was an Internet business “that I don’t understand.”“I know everybody wants to believe that because they’re so wealthy they are somehow sophisticated,” said one person who has worked as a partner with Wilpon and Katz. “I wouldn’t say they are. Fred is a tremendous salesperson and a warm person. He looks you in the eye and listens. He’s naturally charming.“Saul is not Fred,” the person said. “He has a totally different charm. He’s tough and provocative and hilarious and proud of his Brooklyn roots. He’s still a man of the street, almost jealous that Fred was so smooth. He’s like, I’m not the most popular or most handsome, but what I have is chutzpah, bring it on.”In the interviews with those who know and have worked with Wilpon and Katz, the depiction of their differing strengths and personalities was consistent. Wilpon was described by one person as a Ronald Reagan figure, Katz as a person deeply involved in the details of any deal.“Saul is a financial machine, as precise and informed as anyone I’ve ever been across the table from,” one sports television executive said. “He is brilliant.”No one interviewed — either people who had worked with them or experts in the world of financial regulation — suggested that Wilpon and Katz knew Madoff’s operation was a fraud. Several, while acknowledging that the men might well have been duped by Madoff, took exception to their public claims of investing naïveté.“You can’t run those businesses and be successful, and pretend you are a rube,” one said.Another said: “These guys asked incisive questions during negotiations; they were very tough negotiating loan documents. They understood interest rates and loan swaps. They are not country bumpkins, and they had sharp people around them on the financial side.”How sharp a set of businessmen Wilpon and Katz are, or how sophisticated a pair of investors they are — it all may prove interesting, but not decisive. Rakoff, the judge handling the case, may decide it on legal questions having to do with bankruptcy or constitutional law, or on the more narrow legal theory known as willful blindness.Rakoff, in two separate hearings, has suggested that for Picard to prevail in his most ambitious financial claims against Wilpon and Katz, he may have to prove that they not only missed warnings signs about Madoff, but that they also consciously, intentionally turned away from evidence that he was involved in wrongdoing.“The issue isn’t really going to turn, in my view, on whether Wilpon and Katz were sophisticated,” said Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the S.E.C. “They surely were as to some things.”He added: “Their claim has to be, ultimately, that they weren’t aware of the scam being perpetrated and therefore have no obligation to return funds that were paid out to them. That shouldn’t make it important whether they were sophisticated or not.”'"
"'11-09-23,'1','BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) — Nike said on Thursday that its quarterly profit rose 15 percent as sales of its athletic gear rose faster than its costs.Nike, the world’s largest athletic shoe and clothing maker, reported after the market closed Thursday that it earned $645 million, or $1.36 a share, for the quarter, up from $559 million, or $1.17 a share, a year earlier.Revenue in the period, which ended Aug. 31 and was the first quarter of Nike’s fiscal year, rose 18 percent to $6.08 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, revenue rose 11 percent.That far exceeds the $1.21 a share and revenue of $5.75 billion that analysts polled by FactSet had expected on average.Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., said demand for its products remained strong around most of the globe. That helped make up for the higher prices it paid for raw materials and for selling more items at a discount, both of which hurt its profit margins during the period.The company said its orders for September through January were 16 percent higher than a year earlier.'"
"'11-09-23,'1','“I hate to call someone a liar, but that’s not true,” safety Kenny Phillips said of Kehl’s comments.The Giants drafted Kehl in the fourth round of the 2008 draft and waived him after one game last season, Fewell’s first as the Giants’ defensive coordinator. Kehl was picked up by the Rams and appeared in 14 games for them last season.“That’s why he’s a former teammate, man,” linebacker Michael Boley said. “It’s ridiculous. Why would anybody coach somebody to do that? Maybe he has some bitterness toward being let go last year.”Grant, an 11-year veteran, also denied Kehl’s comments but acknowledged the tactic was used throughout the league.“It definitely happens,” he said. “I’ve been around coaches, where, I mean, it was time for something like that to happen. But as far as Perry Fewell coaching that, I’ve never heard a coach on this team ever say anything about that.”On Monday, Grant and Williams both fell to the ground after St. Louis used its no-huddle offense to drive inside the Giants’ 20-yard line. Williams got right back up, while Grant received attention from trainers. He jogged off and was back on the field on the next play. On Wednesday, the N.F.L. issued a memo to all 32 teams warning that the punishments for players faking injuries would include fines, suspensions and a loss of draft picks.Beyond the injury discussion, the defense struggled Monday. The Rams’ second-year quarterback Sam Bradford threw for a career-high 331 yards, after Washington’s Rex Grossman threw for 305 in the Giants’ season-opening loss.Those subpar performances were against middling offenses, but the defense will again be without defensive end Osi Umenyiora against the Eagles on Sunday. Umenyiora, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery Aug. 19, did not practice as scheduled Thursday and will not play against the Eagles, who have defeated the Giants six consecutive times.Umenyiora talked to reporters for the first time since arriving a day late to training camp. He said he was close to getting back on the field.“I feel an urgency, but I don’t want to go out there for one or two games and then not be able to play for the rest of the season,” he said. “That would just be dumb. I just have to wait until it’s at least close to being 100 percent before I go out there.”Offensively, the Giants may be without receiver Mario Manningham in Philadelphia. Manningham sustained a concussion at the end of the first half against the Rams and has undergone a series of concussion tests this week. He was held out of practice again Thursday.Eagles quarterback Michael Vick returned to practice Thursday, just four days after he sustained a concussion against the Falcons. During the portion of practice open to the news media, Vick was seen throwing passes to assistant coaches, jogging around with teammates and participating in all the drills that the other quarterbacks, Mike Kafka and Vince Young, participated in. Vick’s participation showed that he has been cleared by the N.F.L.-appointed independent neurologist. (AP)'"
"'11-09-23,'1','Don’t let the title fool you. “Killer Elite” has next to nothing to do with the 1975 film “The Killer Elite,” which had both an extra word in its title and an openly dissatisfied Sam Peckinpah (“We have no script”) in the director’s chair. The old thriller was based on the novel “Monkey in the Middle”; the new one originated with “The Feather Men,” a British book that was sold as nonfiction but may not have been. The earlier film starred James Caan and Robert Duvall as professional killers; the new one has Jason Statham and Robert De Niro as elite mercenaries. Peckinpah tried to turn his into a mockery of itself, while the new flick’s director, Gary McKendry, has stumbled into accidental near-parody.Well, I think the burlesque is inadvertent. Hyperbolic violence and risible dialogue are routine in bottom-drawer action cinema, but the memorable bad examples, like “The Expendables,” Sylvester Stallone’s ode to ruined male beauty, at least gives you something to mull over between the explosions and rushing rivers of blood. “Killer Elite,” by contrast, which involves shadowy British powerbrokers and shadowy Middle East oil men, only inspires curiosity about whether Clive Owen, as a special forces type going grunt grunt against Mr. Statham’s free agent, was in it for the paycheck or is enduring a regrettable career slowdown. Whatever the case, Mr. Owen and Mr. Statham (who provides a nice duet with a chair) make a prettily matched pair amid the pileup of sub-Bourne action set pieces, sad laughs and clichés.“Killer Elite” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Bangs and splatter.Directed by Gary McKendry; written by Matt Sherring, inspired by the book “The Feather Men” by Ranulph Fiennes; director of photography, Simon Duggan; edited by John Gilbert; music by Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil; production design by Michelle McGahey; produced by Sigurjon Sighvatsson, Steven Chasman, Michael Boughen and Tony Winley; released by Open Road Films.

"'11-09-23,'1','Elsewhere on Thursday, Tripoli’s new leaders continued to inch forward toward their twin goals of subduing the old government and building a new one. Officials of neighboring Tunisia said Thursday that on the previous night their security forces had arrested the last of Colonel Qaddafi’s figurehead prime ministers, Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmoudi, for crossing its border illegally while fleeing Libya. A Tunisian court immediately sentenced him to six months in prison for illegal entry, the government said.The Libyan provisional government said that anti-Qaddafi fighters continued to battle loyalist forces in the area around Colonel Qaddafi’s southern stronghold and onetime childhood home of Sabha. Anti-Qaddafi fighters also remained locked in standoffs with Qaddafi forces in his other two remaining bastions, Surt on the Mediterranean coast and Bani Walid in the desert south of Tripoli.Libya’s provisional government has already said it is eager to welcome Western businesses, although both Mr. Cretz and the Libyan leaders acknowledged that addressing the rampant corruption of the Qaddafi era remains a potential hurdle.In a news conference last week, Mustafa Abdel-Jalil, chairman of Libya’s Transitional National Council — the civilian leadership of the former rebels — said the new government would even give its Western backers some “priority” in access to Libyan business.There had been no promises to its Western supporters, he said, “But as a faithful Muslim people we will appreciate these efforts and they will have priority within a framework of transparency.”But he also acknowledged that the “framework of transparency” could be a significant qualification, at least as far as the many contracts with Western companies signed under the Qaddafi government. While the provisional government had respected “all legitimate contracts” from the Qaddafi period, it was undertaking a systematic review “for whatever financial corruption may have tainted them.”Cleaning up the former government’s habitual corruption was all the United States hoped for, Mr. Cretz said, but he acknowledged it was a tall order. “The stench of corruption affected everything that the Qaddafi regime did with respect to commercial entities,” he said. “The bureaucracy was rife with it because that was the way it was done, and the family was at the top. Every deal involved a payoff to the Qaddafi family or a crony.”Still, Libya’s new leaders, he said, appeared “willing to accede to international standards of transparency and accountability, and I think that is a good thing.”In the final years of the Qaddafi government, Mr. Cretz wrote vividly of its rampant corruption in diplomatic cables released by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, including a 2009 dispatch titled “Al-Qadhafi: The Philosopher-King Keeps His Hand In.” After the release of those cables late last year, he said Thursday, he had been “physically threatened” and “I had to leave immediately.”The United States abandoned its embassy when the uprising began in February, and on May 1, the empty building was ransacked by Qaddafi forces, ostensibly in retaliation for the death of Colonel Qaddafi’s son, Seif al-Arab, in a NATO bombing.Reviewing the situation he found on his return, Mr. Cretz cited several factors for concern, including the challenge of disarming the newly armed populace and many autonomous militias; the many fissures within the anti-Qaddafi forces along regional or other lines; and the potential for militant or at least anti-Western Islamists to take control.But so far, he said, the Islamists were emphasizing moderation, democracy and pluralism, and the Libyan leaders deserved a chance to overcome their differences. “Don’t underestimate the Libyan people because they have shown for the last six months what a truly heroic people is,” he said.'"
"'11-09-23,'1','In comparison with the bracing programs presented to open his first two seasons as director of the , Wednesday night’s concert at Avery Fisher Hall, which began his third, was not as adventurous, nor as clear an artistic statement.That said, it was a good concert. The soprano was the star soloist, singing works by Wagner (“Dich, teure Halle” from ), Barber (the seldom-heard “Andromache’s Farewell”) and Strauss (the daunting final scene of ). Mr. Gilbert filled out the program with smart choices: an early Barber work, Wagner’s Overture to “Tannhäuser” and orchestral music from “Salome.” The Philharmonic sounded great over all, especially in the Strauss. Ms. Voigt, in strong voice, received a warm standing ovation from the gala audience. The event was broadcast on ’s “Live From ” (not quite live, but delayed by 30 minutes).Still, the concert was not a strong expression of artistic vision. For his debut as music director, in 2009, Mr. Gilbert began with the premiere of an exciting work by Magnus Lindberg, the first time since 1962 (under ) that the Philharmonic included a premiere in a season-opening concert. Mr. Lindberg’s piece was followed by the soprano stretching herself artistically in a sumptuous performance of a 30-minute Messiaen score. The evening ended with ’s In 2010 Mr. Gilbert opened the season with the American premiere of ’s “Swing Symphony,” along with works by Strauss and Hindemith. Those two programs embodied Mr. Gilbert’s conviction that presenting a new work is an ideal way to begin a season. What could be more gala?To Mr. Gilbert’s a Philharmonic premiere is coming right up. Next Friday the extraordinary mezzo-soprano introduces a song cycle written for her by , with Mr. Gilbert conducting.Wednesday’s program was more typical of opening gala concerts, probably because the Philharmonic was preoccupied with several preseason events this month. There was the free concert to commemorate Sept. 11 with Mr. Gilbert conducting Mahler’s Symphony, an artistic high point of his tenure to date. And there was the Andrea Bocelli concert in Central Park with the Philharmonic reduced to a backup band, which was, well, not an artistic high point. There were also two special film music programs. So the official season-opening concert seemed almost anticlimactic.'"
"'11-09-23,'1','The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index flirted with a bear market, generally a 20 percent decline from a recent peak, but recovered in the final hour and closed down 17 percent to 1129.56 from a late April high. The MSCI All-Country World Index, a grouping of 45 countries, however, fell more than 20 percent, pushing it into bear territory.Financial markets beyond also reflected growing anxiety. Commodities like oil fell, and even gold dropped sharply in price. As investors continued to seek havens, United States bond prices soared for a fifth consecutive trading session, pushing the 10-year benchmark yield to a new low of 1.72 percent.The cost of insuring the government bonds of Western European nations against default rose to a record high. The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian government debt also rose, pointing to lingering worries about debt levels in currency region. Despite steps taken last week by central to help banks in Europe borrow dollars, there were signs of rising borrowing costs for these institutions.It is not only economies in the United States and Europe that are faltering. Financial markets in developing countries are showing levels of stress last seen during the financial crisis, a senior official said Thursday.The official said that problems in the developed world increasingly were shaking the economies of developing nations, not because of a drop in trade flows or capital , but because a sense of gloom was spreading around the world, shaking the confidence of domestic investors.“We are increasingly worried about the possibility of global contagion,” said the official, who shared the World Bank’s assessment of the global situation on condition of anonymity.“At some point the global . Just like the realization that even big banks are vulnerable” shook world markets in 2008, the official said, “the idea that even the U.S. is vulnerable means that many investors have lost an anchor.”The market downturn was set in motion on Wednesday after the Fed announced that a complete economic recovery was still years away, adding that the United States economy has “significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets.”The Fed also announced it would buy long-term Treasury bonds and sell short-term bonds to help stimulate lending and growth.Some analysts were disappointed the Fed did not act more forcefully and they had little faith that policy tools like lower interest rates were encouraging consumers and businesses to spend more or to start creating jobs.“The initial and follow-up reaction from the equity market is likely the realization that the Fed has little left to offer, that Washington is a mess, and their only hope is to ‘ride it out’ over a long period of time,” said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company.The policy conundrum is illustrated by the fact that despite lower rates people are not taking up new or refinancing existing ones. Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages dropped after the Fed’s announcement, falling to 4.05 percent from 4.21 percent on Wednesday, according to HSH.com, which publishes mortgage and consumer information.But the number of new mortgage applications is running at the lowest level since August 1995, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Guy Cecala of Inside Mortgage Finance, which monitors mortgage activity, said the volume of new mortgages this year would probably be about $1 trillion, down from $1.5 trillion in 2010, which was already anemic.Companies, too, are holding back on spending even though they have built cash reserves to 6 percent of their total assets, the highest level since at least 1952, according to .The proportion of United States companies’ cash flow being spent on new equipment and other investments has not rebounded since the financial crisis and is stuck at the lowest level since the late 1950s, said Doug Cliggott, an analyst at Credit Suisse. A survey by the bank of 60 large American companies published Thursday found that two-fifths actually planned to cut spending in the next six months.In what may be a bellwether trend, , the logistics company, on Thursday cut its expectations for earnings for the entire fiscal year, citing a slowdown in global growth and sending its stock down 8 percent.The markets on Thursday homed in on a darkening economic outlook in the euro zone and concerns that ’s growth rate would start to slow. A closely watched gauge of private sector activity from the euro zone — the composite purchasing managers’ index — fell to 49.2 points in September from 50.7 in August, according to Markit, a financial data provider.Analysts said the fall in the euro area index reflected a combination of slowing global growth, significant belt-tightening in the euro area and growing concern about the escalating .A review on Thursday by Standard & Poor’s showed that the market capitalization of publicly traded equities worldwide had fallen by more than 17 percent, or $9.2 trillion, since July 1.In the United States, without greater stimulus, headed sharply higher on Thursday, catching investors off guard and causing rapid selling of investment positions, like gold, that had relied on a cheaper currency.“I think that the market had performed so bullishly across all the precious metals that a correction was probably in the offing,” said James Steel, an analyst at . “And it may have been used as a convenient place for some profit-taking.”When the price of gold moved so quickly below $1,800, he added, it encouraged further selling. With sustained losses in stocks, investors could be using gold as it was meant to be used — to raise cash.“This might sound perverse but gold is actually fulfilling its traditional role allowing you to raise cash in uncertain times,” Mr. Steel said.'"

"'11-09-24,'0','Still, the recent conference would never have occurred without Mr. Boudra. Now 24 and majoring in political science, Mr. Boudra grew up after much of Morocco’s Jewish population had moved to France or Israel. But he heard from his grandmother about her childhood in the Jewish quarter of Casablanca, and a grandfather still had Jewish neighbors in his apartment house.Those few personal connections kindled a broader curiosity. That curiosity ultimately led Mr. Boudra to study with Simon Levy, a scholar who directs the Museum of Moroccan Judaism of Casablanca, and to read such classic Holocaust memoirs as “If This Is a Man” by Primo Levi and the diary of Anne Frank.“What upsets me about this subject,” Mr. Boudra wrote in an e-mail message last week, “is some people’s claims that the Holocaust never took place. It is simply absurd to hear such claims in the light of the historical evidence the world has today.”As a student at Al Akhawayn, an elite university with an international orientation, Mr. Boudra and several dozen friends formed a club around their shared interest in Morocco’s Jewish culture and heritage. They named it Mimouna, after the holiday that Moroccan Jews celebrate on the final day of Passover.Through Mimouna and Al Akhawayn, Mr. Boudra met another barrier-breaker named Peter Geffen. The descendant of a distinguished rabbinic family, Mr. Geffen had founded a Jewish day school in New York and an organization, Kivunim, that provided students and teachers with study and travel in Jewish communities around the world.Last December, Mr. Geffen took 60 Kivunim participants to Ifrane to meet with the Mimouna Club. As the session ended, Mr. Boudra pulled him aside to say that the club wanted to hold a Holocaust conference and to ask if Mr. Geffen could help.“The whole power of it is that it was their idea,” Mr. Geffen said in a recent interview, recalling the conversation. “This is before the Arab Spring, and here’s a group of Muslim students, 20, 21 years old, on an Arab campus in the Arab world. And to have an intuitive recognition that opening the discussion in the face of widespread Holocaust denial is a major human step forward.”In the intervening months, Mr. Geffen and Mr. Boudra worked both separately and together to assemble financial support, formal sponsorship and a schedule, which included scholarly presentations, panel discussions, first-person testimony, museum visits, a concert of Moroccan Jewish music and scrupulously kosher meals.So it was that on Sept. 21, the eminent Holocaust historian Michael Berenbaum spoke of the Jewish genocide in Europe, the tide that Mohammed V succeeded in holding back in his nation. An 80-year-old survivor, Elisabeth Citron, recounted her childhood in Romania and Hungary — wearing the yellow star, being deloused with gasoline in front of a laughing first-grade class, being deported to Birkenau, watching the daily selection of inmates for the gas chambers and ovens.“I don’t expect any of you to understand how today I’m here standing in front of you,” Ms. Citron said. “I have no clue why I am here.” By which, of course, she meant alive.For their part, the Moroccan students asked questions and got answers. Were there any German Jews powerful enough to intercede with the Nazis? Was propaganda the way the Nazis justified the Holocaust to non-Jews? Why hasn’t Mohammed V been listed among the righteous gentiles in the Holocaust museum of Yad Vashem?At one point, a Jewish adviser to the current king, Andre Azoulay, addressed Mr. Boudra and the Mimouna Club directly. Mr. Azoulay was born in 1941, during the Vichy occupation, which made him a half-century older than the students. To make sure all the visitors, too, would understand him, he switched from French into English.“You have decided by yourself,” he said. “No one asked you to do it. It was your decision, your vision, your commitment.” He mentioned the significance of naming the club for Mimouna with its connection to the Exodus. “You Muslim students decided to be identified with our liberation,” he said. “It’s not something usual.”'"
"'11-09-24,'0','A young woman who was found beheaded and mutilated, apparently by Syrian security agents, is believed to be the first woman to die in Syrian custody since the antigovernment uprising there began in March. Amnesty International said Friday that the woman, Zainab al-Hosni, 18, had been detained by security agents to pressure her brother to turn himself in. Ms. Hosni, from the central city of Homs, was seized by men in plain clothes on July 27, the rights group said. Her brother Mohammed, a protest organizer in Homs, was told by telephone that she would be released only if he stopped his activities, the group said. He was arrested this month. On Sept. 13, his mother was summoned by security forces to pick up his body, which showed bruises, burns and gunshots, the group said.'"
"'11-09-24,'0','LONDON — A lawyer representing some of Britain’s phone hacking victims said on Friday that he was planning legal action in the United States against the News Corporation, the parent company of Rupert Murdoch’s global media empire.In a series of interviews in London, the lawyer, Mark Lewis, said he had held discussions with American lawyers about the steps necessary to open proceedings against the News Corporation in New York, and that he expected the process to begin soon. He said he had hired Norman Siegel, a New York lawyer who has represented many of the families of those killed in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, to handle the case.In an interview with Sky News, a British television network that is part of the Murdoch empire, Mr. Lewis said that the legal action in the United States would focus on the “News Corporation’s liability for actions by its foreign subsidiaries,” including the tabloid The News of the World, which has been at the center of the phone hacking scandal and was closed in July. He said the lawsuits would focus on the revelations of widespread phone hacking in Britain and on accusations that the police were bribed to assist in the tabloid’s pursuit of scoops.Mr. Lewis did not respond to voice mail messages requesting an interview on the issue.In another development, Andy Coulson, a former editor of The News of the World, has sued News International, the News Corporation’s British subsidiary, because it stopped paying for his legal fees in the hacking case, the BBC reported. Mr. Coulson, who was arrested in July in connection with the investigations into phone hacking and payments to police officials under his editorship, resigned in January as the communications director for Prime Minister David Cameron.Mr. Lewis, based on his remarks in the interviews with Sky News, the BBC and the newspaper The Guardian, appeared to be relying, as a basis for the American legal action, on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a 1977 statute that holds American companies and their executives liable for corrupt activities abroad, including bribery of foreign officials. In the Sky News interview, he said part of the reason for pursuing the News Corporation in American courts was the prospect of higher damage settlements than are customary in the British courts.The prospect of defending itself against civil suits in American courts would add a daunting new dimension to the challenges facing the News Corporation as a result of the phone hacking revelations in Britain. But some legal experts in Britain said that Mr. Lewis’s announcement was a publicity stunt, and that the move could complicate legal proceedings in Britain.'"
"'11-09-24,'0','But Mr. Rodríguez, without being explicit, suggested that Cuba and the United States could find mutual humanitarian gestures to end the stalemate.“I do not see any way in which we can move on towards a solution of the Mr. Gross case but from a humanitarian point of view and on the basis of reciprocity,” he said.Mr. Rodríguez declined to say what he had discussed with Mr. Richardson, but he said that all topics between the two nations remained open to discussion, including the return of one or all of the Cuban Five, men serving prison sentences in the United States on espionage charges.“I can tell you the agenda submitted to the U.S. government — and I reiterate here it is still on the table — included the topic of the Cuban Five, although we understand that as it is an element related to justice, it is also of a humanitarian character.”He said President Obama could pardon them “as a humanitarian act, which would be appreciated by their mothers, wives and the entire Cuban people.”Still, Mr. Rodríguez later said he was not linking the Gross case to the Cuban Five, and he took pains to keep the Gross affair separated from the five decades of hostility and diplomatic tit-for-tat that has defined Cuban and United States relations.“I believe that establishing a link between pending bilateral issues to a humanitarian solution in the case of Mr. Gross is a mistake,” he said, later adding, “it is not right to merge this with political issues or add it to the bilateral agenda, which is quite hefty already.”The State Department, too, prefers no link between Mr. Gross and the Cuban Five. William Ostick, a spokesman, said the case of the Cuban Five and Mr. Gross “are not comparable.”“We will continue to use every available diplomatic channel to press for his immediate and unconditional release,” he said.'"
"'11-09-24,'0','“I realize we may disagree on some of this,” he said. “But in our party, we can disagree in some areas and still be united in our core beliefs.”Representative Michele Bachmann’s appeal at the event was simple: Do not settle for anything less than the kind of conservative you want.“If there was any election when we conservatives don’t settle, it’s this election,” Mrs. Bachmann argued, insisting that the person to pick was herself. “This is the election where we can have it all. Don’t settle!”It is an argument aimed at Mr. Romney, who is viewed by many conservatives with suspicion, and at Mr. Perry, whose positions on immigration and the human papillomavirus, or HPV, vaccine have angered many of the party’s most conservative activists.In her appearance Friday morning, Mrs. Bachmann focused on the support that she has traditionally received from social conservatives, pleading with the activists in the ballroom to pick a nominee who is a true Tea Party believer.“We need a nominee who is not ashamed of the Tea Party, who is willing to stand up for our Tea Party and our Tea Party values,” she said.Mr. Perry’s struggles in Thursday night’s debates seemed to pump new life into Mrs. Bachmann and some of the other candidates on the stage, most of whom have had a tough time getting noticed recently.Rick Santorum, the former senator from Pennsylvania, is billing himself as the best of both worlds: a staunch conservative who has proved himself able to win elections in a Democratic-leaning state.With renewed vigor, Mr. Santorum is reminding voters that his career was notable for victories in heavily Democratic areas that he was never expected to win.Mr. Santorum promotes his record as a conservative lawmaker, citing his battle for a ban on late-term abortions, his fight against welfare and his war against heath care legislation offered in the 1990s by Hillary Rodham Clinton.“Fighting is great. Winning is better,” he said. “I fight and I win.”Mr. Santorum’s appeal is a mix of Mrs. Bachmann’s promise to stand on principles and Mr. Huntsman’s pledge to win. He says — to applause from the audience — that he will work harder than anyone else to return the White House to Republicans.“I’ve done it,” he said. “No one else on the panel last night has done what I have done.”The other candidates in the contest have stuck to their specific themes: Representative Ron Paul of Texas and Gary E. Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico, argue for a vastly scaled-back federal government that stays out of the lives of average Americans. Herman Cain continues to promote his plan to replace the tax code with a flatter, simpler approach.All of them, it seems, are sensing an opening as the 2012 presidential contest heads into the fall.If Mr. Huntsman is right, the two leading candidates for the Republican nomination will end up destroying each other, providing an opening for an alternative.“When all is said and done, the two guys standing in the middle here, Romney and Perry, aren’t going to be around, because they’re going to bludgeon each other to death,” Mr. Huntsman joked during Thursday night’s debate.The back-and-forth between Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry continued Friday, giving new hope to Mr. Huntsman and the other contenders.They will each have another opportunity next month to try to show that they are the best alternative when the group gathers in New Hampshire for another nationally televised debate.'"
"'11-09-24,'0','“I have not been afraid to step up and disagree when I think they were wrong,” he said.Mr. Stringer had criticized Mr. Bloomberg for appointing Cathleen P. Black as schools chancellor and for choosing not to disclose that Deputy Mayor Stephen Goldsmith had been arrested after an altercation with his wife. Ms. Black and Mr. Goldsmith both resigned.But Mr. Stringer also said he had supported the mayor’s plan to make the city more environmentally sustainable and had collaborated with him on land use and other issues. “So I feel very comfortable positioning myself in a way that is not as a negative force, but as somebody who can offer a different view,” he said.He added, “When I’m able to put forth a substantive reform agenda, more times than not the administration eventually sees it my way.”In Mr. Stringer’s prepared remarks, which he plans to deliver Saturday at Riverside Church in Morningside Heights as part of a symposium on prison issues, he calls on Mr. Bloomberg and the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, to create an expert panel to explore ways to reduce the use of stop-and-frisk practices and to develop new training standards “that achieve the right balance between policing and civil rights.”Mr. Stringer proposes several changes, including establishing “clear behavioral triggers” to justify a stop-and-frisk; currently, he said, the police often cite “furtive movement” as their only justification. Mr. Stringer suggests trying alternate policing techniques, which he said have been used successfully in other cities. He cited a Boston program called Operation Ceasefire, which sought to deter gang violence.Asked about Mr. Stringer’s speech, the Police Department’s chief spokesman, Paul J. Browne, defended the stop-and-frisk practice.“Stops save lives, especially in communities disproportionately affected by crime, and especially among young men of color who last year represented 90 percent of murder victims and 96 percent of shooting victims in New York City,” Mr. Browne said in an e-mail.A spokesman for the mayor, Marc LaVorgna, disputed Mr. Stringer’s suggestion that the practice was an “ineffective policy” that made it harder to fight crime.“The facts tell a different story — crime has been driven down to historic lows by the N.Y.P.D., in part due to this policy,” Mr. LaVorgna said by e-mail. “We’ll continue to take our cues on crime-fighting from Ray Kelly, not career politicians like the Manhattan borough president.”Last year, about 85 percent of people stopped by the police were black or Latino, although those groups make up only slightly more than half of the city’s population.Criticism of the practice has grown recently. Early this month, a black city councilman and a city aide were arrested while walking in a restricted area along the route of the West Indian Labor Day parade in Brooklyn, in what the arrested men have alleged was a case of racial profiling. The episode prompted several city officials, including Mr. Stringer, to argue that the increasing use of the stop-and-frisk practice had contributed to a culture of racial bias in policing.The practice is also the subject of a legal challenge brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights. Last month, a federal judge rejected the city’s effort to have the case dismissed.'"
"'11-09-24,'0','On Sept. 2, he and 20 others boarded a Chilean air force plane bound for Robinson Crusoe Island, 420 miles from the coast, where his organization was helping to rebuild one of the areas most affected by the wave. He was traveling with other volunteers and a television crew, on the way to inaugurate a new home for tsunami survivors and businesses on the island.Amid fierce winds, the plane failed twice to land and crashed. The authorities said there were no survivors.Mr. Cubillos was a rare species in Chile, said officials and people who worked with him: a highly successful businessman with a social conscience.“He is an extraordinary person, the private citizen who has done the most for reconstruction,” Rodrigo Pérez, Chile’s Housing Minister, said after the plane went down.Born in the capital, Santiago, Mr. Cubillos, 49, was one of four children of Hernán Cubillos, who served as foreign minister to the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. The elder Mr. Cubillos actively conspired with Navy officers to oust former President Salvador Allende in 1973.HE was Pinochet’s first civilian foreign minister, serving from 1978 to 1980. He oversaw negotiations over the Beagle Channel, talks that eventually avoided a military confrontation with Argentina at the last minute. But in 1980, Pinochet and his delegation were forced to return to Chile while in mid-flight to the Philippines when that country’s leader, Ferdinand Marcos, suddenly canceled the visit for unexplained reasons. Pinochet blamed the elder Mr. Cubillos for the humiliating retreat and ousted him from his cabinet.The former minister returned to the business world, working for major beer and tobacco companies, investment firms and banks. He died in 2001.His son, Felipe, studied law at the University of Chile and followed his father into the business world at a young age, joining the salmon industry just as it was taking off in Chile. At 25, he was a manager at Eicomar, a company that was one of the first to experiment in salmon cultivation.He started a handful of businesses, including an Internet company, as well as boat repair and sea transport companies. He started a family, fathering a son and three daughters. But he still was not satisfied.“I am drawn to the unknown, to uncertainty,” he said in an interview this year. “It’s tough for me to live with routine.”Sailing was always a passion, and in 2008 he pursued a dream to sail around the world. To complete the Portimão Global Ocean Race, he got sponsors, sold one of his companies and went to France to build a sailboat.He named the 40-foot boat the Cape Horn Challenge. After departing for his voyage from Portugal, he and a friend, José Muñoz, “lived in permanent crisis,” especially during the 30 days sailing from South Africa to New Zealand, 27 of which were under storm, he said. After passing Cape Horn, at the southernmost point of Chile, there were times when the boat’s electronics did not work.The worst moment came near Puerto Rico, when one of the boat’s two rudders broke. “We were at risk of having to abandon the regatta,” he said. But they fixed the rudder two months later, in May 2009, and sailed on.“ ‘Dad, how beautiful that you never give up,’ ” wrote his two daughters in an e-mail, he said. “That’s when I realized that the regatta around the world made sense for me,” Mr. Cubillos said. “I was setting an example for my children, so that they never give up.”In the summer of 2009, after 142 days at sea, the two men sailed into Portugal, finishing second in the regatta. He called the journey “a life-changing” experience, “a trip towards the soul, in which you discover your essence, your limits, your own capabilities.”THOSE lessons aided Mr. Cubillos in February 2010, when Chile suffered the quake. Before his death, the organization he started, Let’s Lift Up Chile Challenge, had about 60 people participating, with more young people joining every day.“There is a lot of time still to think about challenges,” he said he told a young girl a motivational speech after the earthquake. “I am just beginning. There is a lot more to do.”On Sept. 14, Mr. Cubillos’s family held a memorial ceremony in Algarrobo, a bay about 70 miles east of Santiago. It was there, at a nearby yacht club, where Mr. Cubillos had learned how to sail with his father — the same club where Mr. Cubillos’s father had conspired with Navy officers against Mr. Allende.About 40 sailboats went out to sea and formed in a circle. His family members released Mr. Cubillos’s ashes from the remains recovered to the Pacific Ocean, as friends threw flowers into the sea from the sailboats.That same day, President Sebastián Piñera introduced a bill in Congress. The “Cubillos law,” if passed, would speed up the awarding of tax benefits for corporate donations for reconstruction efforts.'"
"'11-09-24,'0','Temple could be an option to help stabilize the Big East after the recent announcement that Syracuse and Pittsburgh would be leaving for the Atlantic Coast Conference. The university and the Big East have been in communication in recent weeks, according to a person involved in the discussion.In 2001, the Big East moved to kick Temple out for failing to meet criteria for competitiveness and attendance. The football team was formally removed from the conference before the 2005 season, and the university considered eliminating the program. But in five seasons under Golden, Temple became a respectable Mid-American Conference football program, advancing to a bowl game in 2009 for the first time in 30 years.Addazio inherited a team with talent when Golden left for Miami in December. The junior running back Bernard Pierce is the brightest star left over from Golden’s tenure, during which Temple’s schedule became more competitive. The Owls (2-1) play at Maryland (1-1) on Saturday afternoon. Addazio said Pierce was better than any running back he coached while at Florida, where he helped the Gators win national titles in 2006 and 2008. Addazio, who helped bring some of the nation’s top players to Florida, is hoping to mine the surrounding areas for untapped talent like Pierce. A Connecticut native, Addazio was responsible for recruiting the Northeast in coaching stops at Syracuse, Indiana and Notre Dame.“I’m a Northeast guy, and I’m proud of it,” said Addazio, who takes his wife out to the city’s Italian restaurants and stops for cannoli at local bakeries. “It’s hard to take a guy and supplant them up here. You can’t put a stranger in a strange land. You can’t just walk into the state of New Jersey and recruit.”As if to underscore his affinity for the city, there is a panoramic photograph of the skyline behind the desk in his office.Once primarily a commuter university, Temple now has about 12,000 of its 37,000 students living on or near its North Philadelphia campus, which has engendered spirit for its sports teams. The university is also undergoing a $1.2 billion construction and renovation program over the next decade. The team shares Lincoln Financial Field with the Philadelphia Eagles, whose coach, Andy Reid, has a son on Temple’s roster. Addazio also noted that the region is the country’s fourth-largest media market and a home to rabid sports fans.“I rarely take college football phone calls,” Anthony Gargano, a Temple alumnus and host on the sports-talk radio station WIP, said in a telephone interview. “But before the Penn State game, I was getting unsolicited calls. I didn’t even bring it up.”The Nittany Lions escaped Philadelphia with a 14-10 win after scoring a touchdown with 2 minutes 42 seconds left. But the crowd was so supportive that it moved Addazio to tears, and the tense game left some fans talking about Temple football for the rest of the weekend.“It was to the point where people were upset at the loss,” Gargano said. “Fans were borderline angry, which is actually a great thing for the school. That means they care.”'"
"'11-09-24,'0','Hours after it was supposed to have made a fiery plunge back to Earth, a wayward NASA satellite was still in orbit, and space experts were still uncertain when exactly it would fall.At 10:50 p.m. Friday, NASA posted an update that said the satellite, the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, was expected to re-enter between 11:45 p.m. Friday and 12:45 a.m. Saturday.“During that time, the satellite will be passing over Canada and Africa, as well as vast areas of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans,” the update said. A day earlier, NASA had said it expected re-entry on Friday afternoon.“The satellite’s orientation or configuration apparently has changed,” the space agency said in an earlier update. Perhaps some piece had broken off, leaving it more streamlined as it tumbled through the upper atmosphere. “That is now slowing its descent,” NASA said.The satellite, which weighs six tons, circles the Earth on a tilted orbit, and as the planet turns each day, different locations pass underneath.'"

"'11-09-25,'0','Thirty-eight years after Roe v. Wade recognized a woman’s right to make her own childbearing decisions and legalized abortion nationwide, a newly intensified drive by anti-abortion forces who refuse to accept the law of the land has seriously imperiled women’s ability to exercise that right. Opponents of abortion rights know they cannot achieve their ultimate goal of an outright ban, at least in the near future. So they are concentrating on enacting laws and regulations narrowing the legal right and making abortion more difficult to obtain.The most visible battleground is Congress, where the House Republican majority seems to have time for a big-government attack on women’s reproductive health and freedom but not to pass a job-creating bill.However, as in the past, most of the fights are taking place in state capitals. The result has been a huge number of new abortion restrictions, traceable in part to the 2010 mid-term elections, which increased the number of anti-abortion governors and state legislatures controlled by abortion opponents, who keep concocting new schemes to make terminating a pregnancy a right on paper only. The spate of new laws comes on top of many state and federal abortion curbs already in place.The map illustrates the barriers, state by state, facing women needing access to a constitutionally protected medical procedure. States shown in the darkest shade have enacted five of the most harmful restrictions: mandatory waiting periods; demeaning “counseling” sessions lacking a real medical justification; parental consent or notification laws that pose a particular hardship for teenagers from troubled homes, including incest victims; needlessly onerous clinic “safety” rules governing such things as the width of hallways and the amount of storage space for janitorial supplies; and prohibitions on abortion coverage in insurance policies. States in lighter shades have fewer of these restrictions. Twenty-seven states have enacted three or more of these laws, while only 12 states, shown in white, have none.The graphic traces the total number of a broad range of major abortion restrictions enacted by the states, including the five covered in the map and others, like mandatory ultrasounds. Sixty-one such laws were enacted during just the first eight months of this year — nearly triple the number in all of 2010, and more than double the previous record of 28 set in 1997. Although some of this year’s statutes have already been preliminarily enjoined by courts as unconstitutional, others will be left to stand as constraints on women’s reproductive freedom.If anything, the chart understates the limits on access to abortion. It fails to capture other negative developments, like the big decline in the number of abortion providers. In 1982, there were 2,908 providers nationwide. As of 2008, there were only 1,793. In 97 percent of the counties that are outside metropolitan areas there are no abortion providers at all.One powerful strategy of the anti-abortion forces has been to portray abortion as outside the mainstream and cast women who have abortions as immoral outliers. In reality, abortion is one of the safest and most common of medical procedures, one that about one-third of American women undergo during their lifetime.'"
"'11-09-25,'0','HAS American political life become a carnival so invasive, indiscriminate and sometimes even crude that it repels some of the best potential officeholders and almost guarantees that the most important business of the country won’t be properly done? I wonder sometimes. I wondered in particular last week.That’s when Joe McGinniss’s “The Rogue,” about , and ’s “Confidence Men,” about the rocky start of ’s presidency, were officially published. I say officially because both books already seem to have been around forever, thanks to the painstakingly orchestrated drum rolls, the parceled-out previews and the blanket media coverage. But it was only on Tuesday that hungry readers outside the news media could actually buy and begin to digest, in full, the tattling, hearsay and innuendo that McGinniss and Suskind, to different extents, serve.There’s certainly some nutrition in these meals, but a whole lot of empty as well: anecdotes as intent on titillation as illumination; scoops of questionable provenance and dubious reliability; winding digressions from anything central to public discourse. Taken together, “The Rogue” and “Confidence Men” illustrate the unsettling degree to which journalism and entertainment overlap and to which elected officials are regarded as all-purpose celebrities, their every inner thought, every little tiff and every last peccadillo consumed as raptly as paparazzi shots of Brangelina. There’s a market, seemingly more robust than ever, for political secrets.And there are real downsides to this, one of which was suggested by yet another book published Tuesday, “Keeping the Republic,” a policy prescriptive by , the governor of . Daniels’s book doesn’t focus on the messy intrusions of American politics, but it affirms him as an earnest, serious politician, one who declined in the end to compete for the Republican presidential nomination. By all accounts that decision was guided by family members who had no appetite for the national stage, with its merciless spotlight. If they’ve read much about “The Rogue” or “Confidence Men,” they must feel powerfully vindicated.Maybe Daniels would have been better than the existing Republican candidates. Maybe not. The point is that we’ll never know, and we’ll also never know how many other thoughtful would-be contenders are turned off and away by the crass spectacle of modern politics. I suspect we’re losing valuable people and wish all of us — reporters, talk-show bookers, blog devourers, hardcover buyers — would pause to think about that.I’m cheating somewhat by lumping “The Rogue” and “Confidence Men” together. The former is an infinitely more salacious project, with a subject who has arguably surrendered any right to gripe about overly prying eyes by inviting those gazes she and her family can monetize themselves. That of course doesn’t stanch her complaints. There’s a transcendently hilarious moment in the reality show “Sarah Palin’s ” when she asks, in regard to McGinniss’s camping out in the house next door, whatever happened to privacy. She herself exiled it, along with any last vestiges of self-awareness.'"
"'11-09-25,'0','The financial aid department is hustling to meet the increased demand, and some officials and students worry that the situation could undercut the university’s reputation as one of the nation’s foremost low-cost public education systems.For the first time this year, the University of California will receive more of its money from student tuition than from the state — a shift that will inevitably put more pressure on students from middle- and low-income backgrounds.In a letter to parents and students about the recent tuition increase, Mark Yudof, the University of California president, struck an apologetic note, acknowledging the “economic uncertainties and hardship” facing many families.“No one should feel they have to leave U.C. due to rising tuition and fees,” Mr. Yudof wrote in the letter, dated July 27. “I implore you to discuss your financial aid options with your campus financial aid office.”Systemwide, roughly three-quarters of undergraduates applied for financial aid this year, up from two-thirds three years ago. With demand expected to grow, the university is considering new measures, including outsourcing some financial aid services, boosting corporate fund-raising and expanding aid for needy students.Among the proposals is a plan to cover all tuition for students from families with incomes of less than $90,000 a year. Currently, students’ families must earn less than $80,000 to qualify.“We need to be creative in dealing with the additional demand from students,” said Kate Jeffery, director of the Student Financial Support Unit for the 10-campus system.Last week, Richard Blum, a University of California Regent, suggested a public fund-raising campaign to offset cuts in state financing. The University of California, Berkeley, has added three financial aid counselors to its staff, bringing the total to about 50 this year, and it put in an upgraded computer system to process applications.But students say any enhancements to the university’s financial aid still will not be enough.Elizabeth Beltran is a junior from a low-income family whose fees are covered by the university. Because of increases in student housing costs this year, she had to move back home with her family in East Oakland.“I won’t be able to hang out with friends or get to go to study groups late at night,” said Ms. Beltran, who needs financial aid to buy a laptop she could use from home.The steep tuition increases forced Mario Lopez to postpone graduation by a year, until next summer.Last spring, Mr. Lopez, a 23-year-old political science major, raised nearly $2,500 from private donors. He also took an extra job over the summer and invited a roommate to move in last month, cutting his rent in half.“I really wanted to continue my education, so there was really no alternative,” Mr. Lopez said. “It has definitely been sort of a love and hate relationship. I love U.C., but I hate that I had to go through these tough circumstances.”'"
"'11-09-25,'0','Katya Sergeyeva, 28, who works for a foreign trade company, took a similar view: “Of course, Putin, Putin,” she said. “Let him stay on. Nothing changes.”These are the voices of people who have accepted Mr. Putin’s domineering system of what is called a vertical of power in which their votes are unlikely to have much effect on the outcome.But for some people, Saturday’s news was an occasion to express disillusionment with the system.“It’s a tandem, and they decided between themselves who will hold which job,” said Ivan Chaikin, 71, a retired official from both Soviet and post-Soviet times. “United Russia holds all the power. Unfortunately, the hopes in the ’90s for real democracy didn’t come to fruition. Nowadays the young people don’t have ideals. They don’t care about democracy and good government. Everything today is about money and getting rich.”Yulia Belova, an advertising manager, said she would have preferred a choice, with new blood, fresh faces, fresh air in the political arena. “In brief, I feel bad about it,” she said. “But I suspect we won’t have a choice. It will happen anyway.”Yan Khromenko, 23, a lawyer, called United Russia “a miserable parody of the Communist Party Central Committee” in Soviet times.“As a citizen of the Russian Federation, I refuse to vote for him,” he said of Mr. Putin, asserting that he had not moved the country forward over the past decade. “As a person, he is a leader and I like him,” he said, “but as a politician, no.”Tatyana Yevsultsina, 44, a designer, had a response for those who are not satisfied with the system, and indeed for those who are satisfied as well.“In the bigger picture, truly, it’s all the same,” she said as she strolled in the pale autumn sunshine, “because I believe in God. I see that God controls life, no matter who is in power.”Both Muscovites and people in surrounding villages seemed to share a fatalism about the election.“I tend to distrust most if not all politicians,” said Andrei Richter, 51, a professor at the school of journalism at Lomonosov Moscow State University, “but I always vote.”If Mr. Putin and Mr. Medvedev were the only two choices in an election, he said, “I would choose the lesser evil.”Not far from Moscow, a 67-year-old villager named Anatoly said, “The most important thing for us is to have our pensions paid on time and not to have prices go up. Who is president is in fact not very important.”Asked about differences between Mr. Putin and Mr. Medvedev, another villager, Antonina, 72, said, “Oh, I don’t know. I’ve lived in my village all my life and nothing has changed. Well, they brought in gas, thanks very much.”'"
"'11-09-25,'0','I GREW up outside Albany, N.Y. When I was about 14, I got to work for the Washington Redskins. My father, a family physician, cared for the mother of the coach, George Allen. For two summers, I spent two weeks at the team’s training camp, handing out towels and water to legendary players like Joe Theismann. I even traveled with the team to a couple of preseason games, where I’d try to catch kickoff balls from Mark Moseley during the pregame warm-up. It was a kid’s dream.For my last three years of high school I attended the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn. Then I attended the University of North Carolina as a Morehead Scholar. The program paid for college and it funded terrific summer internships. I completed an Outward Bound program in Colorado, I worked for the county police department in Portland, Ore., and one summer I worked for the Coors brewery in the public relations department.In 1985, after graduating with a bachelor’s degree in political science, a couple of friends and I started a video production company. For me, it was a way to stay in Chapel Hill while my girlfriend, Jane, finished. We got married in 1989 and moved to Boston so I could attend Harvard for an M.B.A. I graduated in 1991.My first job after that was working for the Walt Disney Company in California in the home video group. As a senior financial analyst, I focused on financial modeling using Excel spreadsheets. I developed carpal tunnel syndrome and had to wear wrist braces while typing.In 1994 I moved to Hong Kong to help set up an office in Asia, and in 1997 I was promoted to managing director for the region. It was a fantastic climb in a booming business, but then the Asian economic climate took a nosedive and video piracy exploded in the region. In turn, our business imploded. Learning to manage in crisis stayed with me longer than managing in the boom. In 1999 we shuttered the office and I returned to California. I commuted to Asia part of the month visiting one of our other offices there, but that got old fast. I started looking for new opportunities.I was interested in the Internet, so next I joined Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch as vice president of e-commerce. I was hired to build a business to sell concert memorabilia on the site, but the venture wasn’t successful.'"
"'11-09-25,'0','The separatist war is mostly over in Chechnya, but kidnappings and extrajudicial killings continue in a more targeted way against people who support the rebels or speak out against the government of the Chechen leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, human rights groups say.“When you talk to ordinary people, you are shocked to see how afraid they are,” Mr. Laptev said.The human rights group Memorial said its monitors were finding it more difficult to do their work, partly because victims and their relatives have become more frightened than in the past about reporting abuses.“The kidnapping goes on without fear,” said Mr. Sadykov, who is here on his fourth tour. “They do it openly. They show that they are with law enforcement, and law enforcement leaves them alone.”He added: “It’s simple work, no investigation, no documents, no legal steps. Just seize someone and take him away.”The Joint Mobile Group, with its main office in Nizhny Novgorod, recruits lawyers and investigators from human rights organizations around the country to work in teams of three in Chechnya for a month or more.In May, the group was recognized for its work in bringing human rights abuses to light with the annual Front Line Award for Human Rights Defenders at Risk by Front Line, a Dublin-based group that advocates on behalf of human rights investigators.“We work like investigators, looking at pictures, talking to witnesses,” Mr. Sadykov said. “We do all this the way it should be done, though we have no official standing. We get evidence and then we ask official organs to make their own investigation.”The team’s work sometimes bears fruit, he said, and charges have been brought against some law enforcement officers.The Joint Mobile Group was founded in 2009 after the abduction and killing of Natalya Estemirova, a local researcher for Memorial who was one of the most persistent and best-known activists in Chechnya.Two of Ms. Estemirova’s colleagues at Memorial were evacuated and one who worked closely with her moved to Norway.Since Ms. Estemirova’s death, human rights advocates here have mostly stepped back from confronting the authorities directly with reports of abuses, Mr. Sadykov said. Memorial has at times withdrawn its monitors from Chechnya for periods of several weeks or several months.In a way, the Joint Mobile Group is carrying on Ms. Estemirova’s work.“They had the idea that she was causing problems and without her there would be fewer problems,” Mr. Sadykov said. “But who am I? We rotate. They know there are people behind us and that if they kill me someone else will come.”Among the half-dozen cases the group is currently pursuing is one of Ms. Estemirova’s final ones, the disappearance of a former rebel named Apti Zainalov, 23 at the time, who had turned himself in and served a year in prison. After his release, he disappeared in 2009, reappeared briefly under armed guard in a hospital and then vanished again.In the days before she was killed, Ms. Estemirova had been demanding information about him from the hospital and the police, and the Joint Mobile Group has continued the pressure.But Mr. Zainalov’s mother, Aima Makayeva, said she was weary of the pursuit and was ready to abandon the legal case if the authorities would just hand back her son.“The only thing left is to go to Kadyrov,” she said. It is a view that is often expressed in Chechnya, where Mr. Kadyrov is in firm control of both the government and the security forces.The tactic might work, Mr. Sadykov said. It would relieve the authorities of the constant pressure being brought by the investigators, and of the possibility that someone might actually be arrested and charged.But, Mr. Sadykov said, it would run counter to the aim of the advocates to foster the rule of law and would instead demonstrate that it is still the men with guns who have the power to seize and release.“The system is like a swamp,” Mr. Laptev said. “You throw in a stone and you make some ripples, and then it quiets down and the stone sinks to the bottom.”Mr. Sadykov had an inside look at the system last year when he was part of a three-person team held overnight in a police station while investigating a report of a human rights violation. The group was released unharmed and has filed its own case charging illegal detention.In a late-night discussion, he said, the police defended their methods, saying a harsh environment demands harsh tactics. “You have to torture,” he said one officer told him. “Without torture how can you fight terrorism?”But Mr. Sadykov also observed that the work of human rights monitors seemed at least to be making an impression. When the three were released, he said, an officer asked him to sign a statement confirming that they had not been mistreated.“Otherwise,” the officer said, “you will say we tortured you.”'"

"'11-09-25,'0','“Emily truly has the mind of a historian, and the area she happened to pick is railroads,” said Ted Bowen, customer service manager for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Metro-North Railroad, speaking unofficially (the railroad has no connection to the project).Ms. Moser’s passion for the railroad developed after she started commuting to her job as a graphic designer at Fujifilm in the Valhalla office complex called the Summit three years ago. She is nearly blind in her left eye, so driving to work is not an option. “There are already enough bad drivers on the road,” she said. “They really don’t need another.”Ms. Moser said she started the blog to write about the “crazy people” whom she encountered on the train. But the more that commuting became part of her life, the more engrossed in the Harlem line’s history she became. With a reporter’s curiosity, she unearthed vintage train minutiae at museums, from retired railroad workers and on eBay, and explored stations from the South Bronx to central Connecticut in her free time. “As I started reading about it, I got really into it,” Ms. Moser said. “The blog turned in that direction.”Ms. Moser’s archival findings, Mr. Bowen said, “are a real service to the railroad community.”That community is, by most accounts, exceedingly male and considerably older than Ms. Moser. The heady days of deluxe passenger trains were over by 1971, said Robert Klara, a railroad historian and the author of “FDR’s Funeral Train” (Palgrave MacMillan). Before that, regal trains from the New York Central System and the Pennsylvania Railroad, among others, rumbled down the tracks, and train enthusiasts waited for hours to witness a few seconds of their ear-splitting glory.“People would pick a favorite railroad the way you pick a favorite sports team,” Mr. Klara said.Watching trains was the bailiwick of fathers and sons, Mr. Klara added, and the model train manufacturers marketed their wares as a way for fathers to spend time with their male children. “I’ve yet to meet a single woman who said she got a Lionel train set as a girl,” he said. Growing up in Southbury, Conn., Ms. Moser was no different.Ms. Moser usually shoots photographs on weekends, and sometimes on workday evenings. Arriving by train, of course, she spends about an hour at each stop, exploring the station and surrounding area to scope out the most compelling shots.In an age of heightened security, she has been stopped only once: a suspicious track worker called the police about her in December at the Melrose station in the Bronx, and the train she was to board was delayed while she was questioned. She said she would love to put the photos — quirky, color-rich creations that seek out each station’s unique attributes — into a book. But for now, Ms. Moser, who has also photographed trains in Japan and South Africa, among other far-flung locations, is happy to share them on her blog.The iPod, iPad and other “I” first tech toys have made on-train banter almost as archaic as the old New York Central trains. But Ms. Moser looks forward to the time spent with her fellow commuters, and has made several close friends on Metro-North. The seatbacks on the weathered M3 cars she often rides are not as high as those on the newer trains, she notes, which promotes interaction. “Riding the train is probably the better part of my day,” Ms. Moser said. “I just think it’s fun, mostly because of the people.”She also has a few pals among the conductors, who refer to Ms. Moser as Cat Girl for the various custom-made hats with cat ears she wears in chilly weather.Guy Galati, a Metro-North employee of 18 years, said: “Emily’s the ideal commuter: pass ready, happy, a smile, a ‘good morning.’ A lot of people don’t do that. It’s pretty refreshing; it’s a conductor’s dream.”'"
"'11-09-25,'0','Let us say that novelists are like unannounced visitors. While Norman Mailer and Saul Bellow pound manfully on the door, Jonathan Franzen and Zadie Smith knock politely, little preparing you for the emotional ferociousness with which they plan on making themselves at home. Neal Stephenson, on the other hand, shows up smelling vaguely of weed, with a bunch of suitcases. Maybe he can crash for a couple of days? Two weeks later he is still there. And you cannot get rid of him. Not because he is unpleasant but because he is so interesting. Then one morning you wake up and find him gone. You are relieved, a little, but you also miss him. And you wish he’d left behind whatever it was he was smoking, because anything that allows a human being to write six 1,000-page novels in 12 years is worth the health and imprisonment risk.It is tempting to call Stephenson a “cult writer,” but cult writers are typically under-or selectively read. All of Stephenson’s novels published since the late 1990s have been best sellers, and some of his original editions go for precious-metal asking prices online. His still-fresh, still-­astounding cyberpunk parody “Snow Crash” (1992) standardized use of the Sanskrit word “avatar” to denote virtual human identities and came impressively close to predicting how the Internet would come to be understood, which is to say as a “metaverse” paradoxically larger than the world that enfolds it. For these and other reasons, Stephenson is the rare writer whose 20-year-old magazine essays have their own Wikipedia pages.That leaves us with his dense, funny and erudite novels, which are packed with so many different kinds of information, they sometimes scarcely feel like novels at all. What do they feel like? Eldritch downloads, maybe, from some mind-­flaying computer brain.This critic — a Stephenson fan and admirer of long standing — has read most of Stephenson’s novels. His “Baroque Cycle,” a three-volume megatome about 17th- and 18th-century Europe and New England published over 2003 and 2004, put the author’s many gifts on full display. But halfway through the second volume I set the “Cycle” aside. Mainly it was the prose, which made it feel as if one were being winked at for a thousand pages by a Laurence Sterne impersonator. Stephenson followed up with “Anathem” (2008), a work of philosophically inclined science fiction that seemed determined to scare away anyone who regards “A Canticle for Leibowitz” as anything less than the premier achievement of human imagination.If you are a Stephenson fan who believes “Snow Crash” and “Cryptonomicon” (1999) are his greatest novels, “Reamde” will come as very good news, for in many ways it can be read as a thematic revisitation of those excellent precursors. Once again Stephenson is asking us to think about virtual worlds and information storage; once again, by God, he makes reading so much fun it feels like a deadly sin.Just about any novel’s plot can be made to sound ridiculous in summary, but the plot of “Reamde” is ridiculous no matter how sympathetically one summarizes. Here goes: Richard Forthrast, an erstwhile drug smuggler who funneled his earnings into founding a Fortune 500 video game company, takes under his wing a young woman named Zula, who was born to hardship in East Africa and later adopted by Richard’s Iowan sister. Richard’s company is the publisher of a massively multiplayer online game called T’Rain, which has eclipsed World of Warcraft as the world’s most popular such entertainment. Zula’s boyfriend, Peter, borrows a thumbstick from Richard, which he uses to save stolen credit card information and gives to an associate of the Russian mafia. Richard’s thumbstick, unfortunately, is tainted with a T’Rain virus called REAMDE (“an accidental or deliberate/ironical misspelling of README”), created by a Chinese T’Rain player. The virus incapacitates the Russians’ computers, after which they come violently calling for assistance. With Peter and Zula in tow, the Russians fly illegally into Xiamen, China, to find and kill the Chinese hacker responsible for the virus. This brings them into accidental contact with a jihadist cell led by one Abdallah Jones, a wanted terrorist, who despite being black and British somehow regards China as an appropriate place to hide. Jones kidnaps Zula and flies her into the wilds of British Columbia. The novel ends with a 150-page-long running firefight along the Canadian-­American border. So it turns out you can make this stuff up.'"
"'11-09-25,'0','Bill Keller’s belated conclusion that the Iraq war has been a “monumental blunder” is welcome to this reader, who marched with hundreds of thousands to protest the impending attack. As the old saying goes, it takes a big man to apologize, and the recent denials of reality and culpability from Dick Cheney, John Yoo and others show that some are not so open to evidence — or ethics. But given the many tragic consequences in terms of lives lost, our economy derailed, our reputation besmirched and more, even Keller’s candidness elicits a long sigh and the resigned sentiment “better late than never — I guess.”You could put my name in place of Bill Keller’s and you would know how I felt about the Iraq war then and now. The difference is that I was not the executive editor of The Times. I depended on The Times to help me understand what we were getting into, just as I depended on Colin Powell. Both you and he failed the American people. This failure is not one that can be excused with a “whoops, sorry about that.” You have the resources to get to the truth. We do not. When you fail us, you fail democracy.After what we went through in New York and our rush to find and protect our loved ones — all I could think of during the rush to bomb someone, anyone, was compassion for the terror of a mother in Kabul or a mother in Baghdad trying to shelter her children. We have now had 10 solid years of war. And what we have to show for it, aside from the degradation of civic life here, is the tally of the dead and wounded — military and civilian, young and old, all reduced to carnage.It is laudable for each of us to admit, analyze and learn from our mistakes. However, for Bill Keller to do so in the pages of The New York Times Magazine is sheer self- indulgence: it is not as if he ordered the war in Iraq or made a tactical error in the field. The notion that his apology is worthy of such a forum rests on the belief that The Times disproportionately sways public opinion — a dubious assumption, particularly these days.Good for Bill Keller for noting the elite male nature of the “I Can’t Believe I’m a Hawk Club.” I knew and even liked some of the men in the club, but I had only contempt for their uncharacteristic stupidity. Like Keller, I was also working in the opinion section of a newspaper, The San Francisco Chronicle, and while they kept up a drumbeat for the Iraq war, I kept writing a steady series of columns exposing lies of mass deception. Those of us who exposed the lies and deceptions never had a chance. If anyone listened, they dismissed us as unpatriotic or as women or men who had been emasculated because they, too, were equally convinced an invasion of Iraq was a serious mistake. The gender politics of that moment is another story, deserving much greater detail.Asking “what has been achieved?” in those wars is like asking a cook the same question while the grand design is still in the oven. From the mess in the kitchen you might hope that we have learned to not take on these challenges so lightly or with so much arrogance.It sounds like Bill Keller never read his columnists Paul Krugman, Nicholas Kristof and Bob Herbert in the months leading up to the Iraq war. Their well-argued and factual columns left me with no doubt that the war was based on lies and would bring on disaster for America and the Middle East.'"
"'11-09-25,'0','OVER the last six months or so, it seems several New Jersey towns have developed symptoms of split personality — at least when it comes to their real estate markets.Take Montclair, for instance: the median sales price has been declining, as anyone can clearly see from looking at the downward pitch of the line graph updated weekly on many brokers’ Web pages by Altos Research. But decline means different things in different places. In the area often called Upper Montclair (ZIP code 07043), the descent to $615,000 from $700,000 was herky-jerky, up and down, between April 1 and the middle of September, according to Altos. But in the rest of town (ZIP code 07042), the median skied nonstop down a steep mountain: $700,000 all the way to $400,000.Likewise, median prices harmonized in Millburn Township and its Short Hills section — another area with its own ZIP code — while clearly singing different parts. Millburn/Short Hills is one of the very few communities in the state where sales values are rising again, according to Karen Eastman Bigos, a broker with the Towne Realty Group.The median for the township rose to $620,000 from $570,000 from April 1 to mid-September. Over the same period, the median for Short Hills rose to $1.6 million from $1.5 million. That means property in Short Hills escalated more in value — by about a percentage point — even though it is more than twice as expensive.“How do we explain these things?” asked Ken Baris, the president of Jordan Baris Realty, a company that recently developed a “hyperlocal” computer system for analyzing price trends by school district or neighborhood. “Local, local, local — there is no other word but local in real estate.”West Orange being the Baris agency’s home turf, Mr. Baris was able to supplement the township’s overall April-to-September median graph numbers on Altos — a decline to $310,000 from $345,000 — with more focused data from three of its neighborhoods: Llewellyn Park, Valley and Mount Pleasant.'"
"'11-09-25,'0','The dollar amounts involved in such cases tend to be small, which has led critics to question whether the S.E.C. shouldn’t be spending more of its resources on larger offenses like mortgage fraud. But in truth, insider trading is just the sort of activity the S.E.C. was created to combat. Not so very long ago, the public had a sense that the agency was watching out for small investors and keeping markets safe. Then in 2008 came a pair of cataclysmic failures: virtually the entire investment-banking industry, which the S.E.C. regulated, either failed or sought a bailout; then, having ignored explicit warnings about Madoff, the agency was further humiliated by the revelation that he’d been running a .Some have criticized the emphasis on insider trading cases as a kind of quick fix to the S.E.C.’s battered image. “Nonsense,” says Khuzami, who joined the agency two months after the Madoff fiasco. But image actually is important; it’s part of providing an effective deterrent. To an unusual degree, respect for insider trading laws depends on the visibility of enforcement. In a survey of 2,500 traders taken in 2007, more than half said they would take advantage of an illegal tip if they were assured they wouldn’t be caught. Without S.E.C. enforcement, Wall Street would degenerate into a cesspool of conspiratorial tipping — as it was before the agency existed. If you think that doesn’t matter, ask yourself if you’d be comfortable investing in, say, Oracle, if Larry Ellison, its lavishly compensated C.E.O., were free to buy and sell the stock, and to clue in his friends, every time Oracle’s sales took an unexpected but not yet public twist. By bringing cases and challenging hedge funds, the S.E.C. aims, at very least, to remind investors that insider trading isn’t simply financial naughtiness — it’s a crime.Over the past several months, I met with Khuzami and others at the S.E.C. and pored over some of the more controversial cases on the agency’s docket. There is no question that the agency is pushing the boundaries, and the definition of insider trading was blurry to begin with. Linda Thomsen, Khuzami’s predecessor, once remarked approvingly that “the genius of insider trading law . . . is its flexibility.” Though lawmakers have proposed legislation codifying insider trading in the statutes, the S.E.C. seems to prefer a common-law approach, on the theory that it will be a less fixed — thus a more worrisome — deterrent.The courts have established that it is illegal to trade on “material” information in breach of a duty to keep the information private. The legal ambiguity arises on two fronts. First, the standard for “material”— any news that a trader would consider important — is fuzzy enough to recall Potter Stewart’s famously elusive definition (he would know it when he saw it) of pornography. Rumors and gossip circulate in the stock market every day; not all of it is “material.” Background information on an industry is clearly O.K. And it’s fine to ask the manager of a local Best Buy about the store’s iPod sales (this is called a channel check). Getting advance word on the entire chain’s sales, however, could be a problem. In general, investors are allowed to assemble pieces of information that, viewed collectively, give them a fuller picture of the whole. But if any one of the mosaic pieces is, in itself, too revealing, the S.E.C. looks askance.Second, the question of who has a duty to keep the material information private is not always clear. In one influential case in the 1980s, Barry Switzer, the University of Oklahoma football coach, was sued for buying stock in a company run by a team booster — a company that was acquired shortly after he invested. At trial, Switzer claimed that he was sunbathing in the stands when he innocently overheard the booster describing the deal. Since the leak was inadvertent, the court ruled that Switzer did not have a duty not to trade.One of the more contentious current cases also involves a sports mogul, Mark Cuban, the irreverent owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team. A few years ago, Cuban was a big shareholder in a Canadian search engine, Mamma.com, which needed to raise cash. The company decided to offer stock to large investors at a discounted price; so in June 2004, according to the S.E.C.’s complaint, the chief executive of Mamma.com called Cuban and asked if he would like to participate. The C.E.O. supposedly prefaced his offer by telling Cuban he was about to impart confidential information. Typically, when such private placements are disclosed, the market price falls — and for that reason, Cuban reacted angrily. At the end of the call, the S.E.C. claims, he snarled: “This means I’m screwed. I can’t sell.” But hours later, he phoned his broker; the next day, he dumped his stake. When the private offering was announced, the stock plunged; Cuban’s early sale saved him $750,000.Cuban’s behavior was exactly what the insider trading rules should prevent: a mogul profiting from privileged information. But it isn’t clear that the rules do prevent it, at least in this case. The difficult part centers on Cuban’s relationship with the Mamma.com chief executive. According to the S.E.C., at some point during their eight-minute phone call, Cuban acquired a duty not to trade. Cuban has denied that he agreed to keep the information about the offering private; even if he did agree, his lawyers argue, he would still have been free to trade, because he and the C.E.O. were not in a relationship of trust. A district court agreed and dismissed the complaint; on appeal, however, the decision was reversed. The case may now go to trial. Cuban, who has been fined nearly $1.7 million for yelling at basketball officials over the years, has, through his lawyers, cried foul against the S.E.C., which he accuses of “a transparent plan to expand the scope of insider trading liability.” The billionaire is said to be fuming and is considering making a movie about the case when it is done.What the Cuban case is to the question of “duty,” the S.E.C.’s suit against the consummately ordinary Steffes family is to the definition of “material.” Last year, the S.E.C. charged six family members with tipping or trading on tips in advance of the 2007 leveraged buyout of Florida East Coast Industries. Two defendants were employees: Gary Griffiths, a former trainman who had risen to the executive position of chief mechanical officer; and his trainman nephew, Cliff Steffes. The two supposedly tipped other relatives; collectively, the family purchased $1.6 million in stock and options. What makes the case unusual is that the S.E.C. is not charging that either man was given an explicit tip. Rather, the complaint charges that a procession of pinstriped bankers took minibus tours of company facilities, that the tours gave rise to rumors of a deal among railyard workers and that Griffiths was asked to arrange a private tour for one group. Such circumstantial evidence gave them to “know” that a deal was in the works, or so contends the S.E.C. Thomas Bishop, the lawyer for Griffiths — who, like Steffes, is fighting the charges — says: “This means anybody who works for a company possesses insider information. That’s past the frontier of what the security laws are intending.”The scale of the family’s investment does suggest that they knew something was up. Yet few Americans would have dreamed they could get into trouble for drawing an inference based on observations at work. And until recently, they might not have. But the Florida East Coast case is the third of its kind in recent years. Whether it will hold up in court is another matter. Khuzami has already had some embarrassing setbacks on insider trading cases — one against a Goldman director that was recently dropped and another, relating to credit-default swaps, that was dismissed by a federal judge. “What the S.E.C. is doing,” says Tom Gorman, a lawyer at Dorsey and Whitney, “is changing the law.”I met Khuzami on a Friday afternoon, when official Washington was heading out for the weekend. The son of ballroom dancers, he is 54, his hair tinged with gray, and has the kind of résumé you often see in Washington: successful prosecutor in his 30s for the Southern District of New York, then a well-paid lawyer for Deutsche Bank. His seven-year stint in the private sector coincided with the years in which securities regulation was, at least in retrospect, too lax. He returned to government in 2009, with a goal of restoring the S.E.C.’s reputation for vigilance. He has nurtured a close relationship with Preet Bharara, the United States attorney who prosecuted Rajaratnam. The S.E.C. has at times seemed out of its element while handling complex mortgage cases, though lately it has been stepping up activity in that area. But insider trading cases are closer to its ken.Khuzami scoffed at the notion, proposed to me by defense lawyers, that he is bringing “gray area” cases and noted that many of the S.E.C.’s targets took pains to hide their tracks. In other words, they knew they were doing wrong. “People claim it’s a trap for the unawares because they don’t know where the line is drawn,” Khuzami said. “From where I sit, it’s pretty clear. Insider trading requires intent.” The traders often rationalize that intent, of course, by telling themselves that cheating is normal and not really so serious. A smattering of free-marketers defend insider trading as aiding market efficiency; except in extreme cases, they question whether it should be a crime at all. Unlike with, say, Ponzi schemes, you can’t identify a victim who suffers a loss when someone profits from an illegal tip.On a little reflection, though, that rationalization doesn’t hold up. The American system of markets may get a lot wrong, but one thing it gets absolutely right is the principle of disclosure. This bedrock of U.S. markets was established in the 1933 Securities Act, and the S.E.C. was created, in 1934, largely to enforce a single proposition: that a corporation issuing securities to the public has to come clean about its financial results and outlook. Disclosure prevents corporations from duping investors. It’s worth noting that disclosure, though a technical term in the context of securities, expresses a broader and distinctly American ideal — that of openness. Governments and most institutions operate better in the sunlight; markets too. Since insiders have a duty of disclosure to people who buy their securities, the courts have ruled that executives who trade in their own stock while failing to disclose confidential information are committing fraud.The traditional theory of insider trading applies to corporate insiders and other fiduciaries (even to executives’ psychiatrists); it also covers traders who pay insiders for information or otherwise induce them to leak. Ivan Boesky, the arbitrageur who pleaded guilty to securities fraud in the 1980s, was the classic case. But the traditional theory doesn’t, by a long stretch, cover all of the behavior that the public would consider cheating. What happens, for instance, when a corporate outsider steals information? The law on that issue was, for years, unresolved. Then, in the ’90s, James O’Hagan, a partner in a Minneapolis law firm, learned that a client of the firm was planning a bid for Pillsbury. O’Hagan bought options on Pillsbury and made a quick $4 million. His conviction was reversed under the theory that since his firm had no obligation to Pillsbury, he hadn’t defrauded it. But in a 6-to-3 opinion written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1997, the Supreme Court reinstated it. Stealing information, the court reckoned, was just that: stealing. The decision validated “misappropriation theory,” which holds that outsiders are guilty of securities fraud when they misappropriate confidential information “in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information.” This seems the right result: whether an executive trades on a secret or a lawyer steals the secret and trades on it makes little difference.And without “misappropriation theory,” Khuzami’s crusade against hedge funds would scarcely be possible.Khuzami assured me he wasn’t intent on “slamming” hedge funds, but he clearly sees them as breeding grounds for potential cheaters. “People ask me, ‘Is there more inside trading going on?’ ” Khuzami said. “Developments in the market” — he meant the growth of hedge funds — “suggest there might be. People are looking for any advantage.” Hedge funds, he noted, command large sums of capital (in total, an estimated $2 trillion); many have contacts with well-placed Wall Street and corporate sources, and they operate hidden from public view (this will change somewhat as a result of the Dodd-Frank law, which will require medium- and large-size funds to register with the S.E.C.). Finally, the hedge fund business is immensely lucrative and fiercely competitive, which ratchets up managers’ incentives to cheat.In testimony to Congress, Khuzami said the S.E.C. was canvassing the industry for funds with “aberrational performance,” on the theory that above-average funds may be benefiting from tips. Khuzami went further at the hearing and declared that “anybody who is beating market indexes by 3 percent and doing it on a steady basis” could be a suspect. This pronouncement horrifies professional money managers, who rightly point out that there are plenty of ways of beating the market that don’t involve cheating.Khuzami and Bharara have advanced a theory that, for some minority of the hedge fund industry, trading on illegal tips has become a “business model” — a routine aspect of doing business. In effect, they view insider trading as a white-collar version of organized crime.This theory was years in the making. In 2005, the S.E.C. learned that, improbably, a retired seamstress in Croatia had bet big on Reebok stock just before the sneaker company announced a takeover. The seamstress turned out to be a front. The agency ultimately charged 17 people in a huge insider trading ring, prominently including Eugene Plotkin, a dashing ballroom dancer and Russian-born Goldman Sachs analyst. For Sanjay Wadhwa, a lawyer in the S.E.C.’s Manhattan bureau, the “seamstress case” was a new concept: inside trading as a group endeavor. It “whetted our appetite,” Wadhwa recalls.Then, in August 2006, the S.E.C. got a tip about a New York hedge fund, Sedna Capital Management. Wadhwa was assigned to this case, too. Sedna was a small fund, but its manager, Rengan Rajaratnam, was the younger brother of Raj Rajaratnam, the head of Galleon Group, a $7 billion fund. Born in Sri Lanka and educated at Wharton, the elder Rajaratnam kept an extensive network of business associates, many of whom were also South Asians. Since 2000, his fund outperformed its peers by a stunning eight percentage points a year. Wadhwa’s focus began to shift to Raj, a gregarious, daring trader who reminded him of Plotkin.When I met Wadhwa at a coffee bar near his office, he seemed upset by the agency’s bad press and, perhaps for that reason, eager to tell me how they caught Rajaratnam. In 2007, the S.E.C. began an examination of Galleon, issuing subpoenas for its trading, telephone and bank records, its appointment calendars and e-mail. Wadhwa’s interest was piqued by the cryptic tone of Rajaratnam’s instant messages with Roomy Khan, a former Intel employee with extensive contacts in Silicon Valley. One, from Khan to Rajaratnam, urged the hedge fund magnate not to buy Polycom stock until she got “guidance.” Sensing the potential for a criminal case, the agency briefed lawyers at the Southern District, who agreed the case looked promising. Then, in March 2007, the S.E.C. received an anonymous letter on plain white paper claiming that Galleon traded tips in exchange for prostitution and “other forms of illegal entertainment.” The author hurled a taunting challenge at the regulators: “It hurts my heart to see how these guys make monkeys out of individual investors, S.E.C. insider trading regulations and the attorney general’s office.”The S.E.C. could not identify the letter’s author, nor did prostitution figure in the eventual charges. But that June, Rajaratnam trooped downtown to the S.E.C. for a formal deposition. The agency’s lawyers asked about insider trading — which he denied. Less than a month later, Hilton Hotels revealed that it was being acquired; Finra promptly notified the S.E.C. that Galleon had invested in Hilton before the news broke. Wadhwa was stunned by Rajaratnam’s brass.Two weeks later, Rajaratnam did it again: Galleon sold Google just before it announced disappointing earnings. In November, an F.B.I. agent visited Khan and asked if she would be willing to talk about Rajaratnam. Khan replied, “What took you so long?” In a bid for a reduced sentence, she agreed to be a cooperating witness. In interviews with the S.E.C. and prosecutors, she divulged the identity of numerous tippers and sketched a broad map of inside traders. Armed with Khan’s proffer, prosecutors for the Southern District obtained the first of many wiretaps, which were crucial in winning convictions.The Rajaratnam case exposed some of the elite of American business: an Intel executive, a former McKinsey partner, a married senior vice president of I.B.M. who was tipping his lover. The trial transcripts suggest a Wall Street subculture that is, in a word, rotten. The tipped information was plainly material; much of it amounted to brazen cheating. But it’s unclear that Galleon is a template for the industry. The S.E.C. has yet to find another large hedge fund for which insider trading is a “business model.” It is known to be investigating SAC Capital Advisors, one of the country’s biggest and most successful hedge funds. Since its inception in 1992, SAC has returned 29 percent a year. Steven A. Cohen, the founder, told me that the fund comes by its results without cheating; as compared with other funds, he says, SAC has more analysts (900 traders and support staff) and more-effective incentives to discourage losses, and it has magnified its returns with leverage. This is plausible, although his returns remain eye-catching. SAC’s huge volume gives it privileged relationships with traders across Wall Street. At very least, it would be hard to argue that firms like SAC do not have an informational edge.At least three traders who worked at SAC have pleaded guilty to using inside information while employed at other hedge funds. One, Noah Freeman, a Harvard grad who traded computer-chip stocks, testified that he also cheated while at SAC. There is no evidence that SAC knew this, and in fact, Freeman testified that he took pains to circumvent SAC’s compliance policies. SAC eventually fired Freeman for poor performance.Hedge fund managers are plainly frightened of becoming the next target. McDermott, Will & Emery, an international law firm, has warned its clients, “Investment managers who outperform the market should be aware that the S.E.C. may soon come knocking.” Compliance staffs of hedge funds are warning their traders to report information sources that might be a problem. Though information is central to what they do, fund managers are becoming sensitized to thinking about whether the information gleaned by their traders is, in fact, too good to use. One New York investor, explaining why he took a loss rather than sell a stock on which he had borderline information, said, “The line on what is material is blurry.” If traders who were not engaged in illegal behavior have stepped back from the line, I sensed that that was O.K. with Khuzami.One sign of the S.E.C.’s impact is that hedge funds have sharply cut their use of so-called expert networks. These networks hire people with knowledge of specific industries to talk to traders. Networks serve a valid research function, but the potential for experts to cross the line into illegal tipping is plain. Six onetime employees at a Mountain View, Calif., network, Primary Global Research, have been indicted (Freeman was one of those). Since the scandal, business at networks is down by 40 percent, according to Integrity Research. No other network has been implicated, but if hedge funds and other traders have to be extra careful about how they do research — even if an occasional borderline trade is ruled off limits — it’s a reasonable price for ensuring that markets are fair.The real problem with the S.E.C.’s focusing on high-return funds is that it skates over the crucial distinction between short- and long-term investing. There are at least 8,000 hedge funds in the United States, and quite a few, like SAC, are engaged in rapid-fire trading — basically trying to outguess the competition with regard to disclosures that will become public in a week or two anyway. Freeman, for instance, was obsessed with trying to outguess the Wall Street “chatter” and the “whisper number” (the predisclosure estimate of earnings). Absent some tip regarding forthcoming news, he had no value added and no edge. For investors working longer horizons the picture is different. Skillful, long-term investors can make money without tips, by analyzing information that is already public. Indeed, to someone holding a stock for years, a quarterly earnings tip would be of little use.Society has an interest in genuine — hopefully intelligent — research, the kind that asks whether Google or Apple will be the more dominant business down the road or whether oil reserves will run short. But the sort of desperate hypertrading that was Freeman’s specialty does not add to economic output or jobs or anything that matters. What it does do is ratchet up market volatility, contributing to the mind-numbing daily swings that send ordinary investors to the sidelines. Lately, thanks in part to that feverish trading, triple-digit market moves have become routine. The marked increase in volatility complicates the S.E.C.’s job considerably. When stocks jump or plummet in reaction to news, the payoff for those who trade on tips ahead of the news rises as well. Ferreting out who is prescient and who is crooked becomes more important than ever.The Galleon case instilled fear in a lot of traders — just as the Boesky-era cases did — but the fear may have subsided somewhat. Especially in volatile markets, the temptation to cheat is fierce. A stiff sentence for Rajaratnam would reinvigorate the sense of a deterrent; on the other hand, a light penalty would make the lengthy, costly prosecution look like a waste. It would discourage future prosecutions and stoke the populist suspicion that no one on Wall Street ever really does time. The loser would be the public’s faith in market integrity. And, as Khuzami notes, “Who’s going to trade if they think the game is rigged?”'"
"'11-09-25,'0','“For $500 it’s a no-brainer to me,” he said.SPLIT THE COST THROUGH For travelers who can’t find an empty leg to meet their schedule, social media is opening up new avenues to private jet travel.Last month, for example, JetSuite started SuiteShare, which allows a customer to charter a four-passenger aircraft and then offer seats that won’t be needed through Facebook( ). Each time another customer joins your flight, the price everyone pays decreases, though JetSuite makes a little more.Here’s how it works: a four-passenger jet from , Calif., to starts at $1,500. If a second person joins, you pay $750. If a third joins, you pay $375. While that may not be cheaper than simply buying a one-way first-class ticket from San Francisco (such seats were going for about $285, based on a recent online search), if a fourth person joins, the person who booked the charter gets to fly free. The other passengers pay $450, $600 and $750 respectively, based on booking order, and JetSuite makes an additional $300 on the deal.Social Flights, a new collective buying company in Smyrna, Tenn., started an online service in February that uses social networking to help charter companies fill seats and travelers lower their costs by sharing a plane.  Already 57 private plane operators have signed on, offering flights on some 400 aircraft. Travelers register with the site, socialflights.com, and post messages to online groups called Travel Tribes, which are based in the same city or share similar interests — for example, football fans who want to follow their team to the . If enough people want to travel to the same place at the same time, each passenger simply pays the cost of his seat. Earlier this year, for example, Social Flights sent 91 Mississippi State fans on three 30-passenger turboprop planes from , Miss., to , Fla., for the Gator Bowl for $395 round trip each — roughly $95 less than the going rate at the time for a coach seat on a commercial flight, according to the company.SocialFlights also posts one-way empty legs. A recent search pulled up open seats from $200 between and Knoxville, Tenn., and $300 between Teterboro, N.J., and Big Flats, N.Y.USE A BROKER TO FIND YOU THE BEST DEAL If you don’t have the time or inclination to hunt online for empty legs or to organize your own charter flight, you can hire a broker to do it for you. For a commission, independent private jet brokers can act as your agent to solicit bids for the flight you want from jet companies they have vetted and negotiate the best rate.They can also help walk you through the fine print of the contract. “If something happens with your child or your health and you can’t fly, you need to have a reputable broker who can be your advocate,” said Chet Dudzik Jr., president of JetWay Private Air. “If that broker or agent has a good relationship with the charter company, the chances are good you can cancel.” In addition, he said, “We assume every aircraft won’t take off, so we have a recovery aircraft in place,” and no one is left on the ramp.Even if flying private costs more than you’d like to pay, when you factor in all the hassles of commercial travel that you can avoid — from long security lines to overcrowded airplanes to long drives to major airports — some travelers may find the splurge worth it.“Once you’ve had a taste of it, it’s really hard to go back to commercial,” said Katrina Garnett, founder of , a high-end travel site that partners with Lufthansa Private Jet, a brand of the European carrier, for connecting flights in . Being able to simply show up at the airport at the time you want, “you never have that feeling like you’re part of the cattle,” she said.CHECK SAFETY RATINGS Like commercial carriers, charter operators must adhere to government rules, called Federal Aviation Regulations. Still, it is a good idea to check the safety record of the private jet company you are considering flying on. While the number of private charters involved in crashes has dropped in recent years, accidents do occur more frequently outside the commercial mainstream of scheduled flights.To ensure the plane and crew you’re getting are up to snuff, ask for an Argus TripCHEQ or Wyvern PASS report, offered by the two largest private jet safety firms — Argus International Inc. and Wyvern Consulting Ltd. — which audit charter companies and conduct background checks on crew members, making sure pilots have the requisite number of flying hours for the specific type of aircraft. Either your broker or the private jet company itself (if you’re booking directly) should be able to provide this.'"

"'11-09-26,'1','There’s no question that yogurt is good for you. But the marketing hype that has built its reputation as a “health food” does injustice to several facts. One is that many other foods that are every bit as beneficial, like greens, don’t enjoy the same degree of public acclaim. Another is that yogurt has been sustaining people all around the world since long before the dawn of advertising.I prefer to think of yogurt as merely a wonderful food that has many healthful benefits. Recent studies have shown that the probiotic bacteria in yogurt have a salutary effect not only on the intestinal tract, but also on brain function. A study at University College Cork, in Ireland, indicated that the presence of probiotic bacteria in the gut can result in lower stress in the brain. Perhaps that’s one reason for the longevity observed in many yogurt-eating populations.In countries where yogurt is part of the culinary landscape, it’s used in many savory dishes. I love the way it contrasts with spicy foods in India and is served, spiked with pungent garlic, as a cool topping with many hot dishes in Turkey and the Middle East.To thicken yogurt, simply put it into a cheesecloth-lined strainer set over a bowl and refrigerate for several hours. Or buy already thick Greek yogurt or lebna in Middle Eastern markets. But whatever you do, buy organic yogurt that has only two ingredients on the label: milk and live active cultures.  I used plain low-fat (not nonfat) yogurt in this week’s recipes; full-fat yogurt will work too, but nonfat is too watery and often quite sour.Grilled Albacore With Yogurt-Dill Sauce on a Bed of ArugulaThis is based on a recipe for red mullet from “Classic Turkish Cooking” by Ghillie Basan. Red mullet isn’t so easy to come by in the United States, and albacore works well here. In the authentic Turkish dish, the red mullet is marinated in a mixture of onion juice and lemon juice with bay leaf. This step is optional; it tenderizes the fish and adds terrific flavor, but grilled albacore is nice enough on its own. Dill is the traditional herb for this recipe, but mint is very nice as well.'"

Muammar el-Qaddafi. Lately, he has seen an entirely different town - one cautiously coming back to life....1004 2011-09-26 The election night burning of a church became national news. A “This Land” column shared how the pastor’s father had left segregated , gathered together a congregation in Springfield, and bought an old downtown church to use as a house of worship; how his eldest son and successor, Bryant, worked for years to raise the money to build a new church on the city’s outskirts; and how, when it burned down, he just knew that racism had fueled the fire.Now, sitting in a pew, Bishop Robinson referred to another part of family history. How, in Emelle, Ala., on July 4, 1930, his grandfather and uncles found themselves in an argument with a white store owner over a car battery. How that dispute escalated into a violent, hate-filled mob scene that left several dead, white and black, including a pregnant black woman and the bishop’s Uncle Esau — who was lynched.So, you see, Bishop Robinson just knew.Two months after the fire, three white men in their 20s were charged with burning down the church to express their rage at the thought of a black president. Two pleaded guilty, and the third was convicted after trial, in a case that The Republican newspaper of Springfield described as a “blot on the whole city.”“Unfortunately, it was a confirmation of my experiences as an African-American,” Bishop Robinson said, adding: “My faith teaches me to forgive, and I forgive them. But I cannot be accepting of their behavior. I cannot be victimized by hatred. So I have to move forward.”In moving forward, he and his congregation of a few hundred found outstretched hands. Donations arrived from around the country, while volunteers cleared the debris and carted away the ruined foundation. But the journey had its peaks and valleys.For example, its leaders applied for federal assistance under the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996, which was enacted after a spate of house-of-worship burnings. They filled out a checklist that asked, with bureaucratic bluntness, what the arson had destroyed:Sanctuary (yes). Choir seating (yes). Fellowship hall (yes). Pastor’s office (yes).The Macedonia church eventually won the very last government guarantee available under the law, which was good. But it had trouble securing a loan for the government to back, which was bad.That is, until Gov. addressed the Urban League of Springfield in February 2010. He explained that the church had just learned that day that its bank was not inclined to provide a vital construction loan, even though the church had already paid off the loan related to its first attempt at a new home.“I know that in this audience tonight are people who care about Macedonia,” Mr. Patrick had said. “Are people who understand we need this church to rise as a symbol that hate doesn’t win. And I know that there are people here who are in the finance field or know people who are, who can rally to help this very, very worthy cause.”Soon the church had the $1.8 million bank loan it needed. And construction began in earnest.Along the way, a group called the National Coalition for Burned Churches offered rotating teams of volunteers. Here came some Catholics from suburban . Here came some Methodists and Jews from . Here came some students from Harvard, and some Congregationalists from the town of Millbury.A few of these volunteers left behind handwritten messages on the walls concealed by the church hallway’s dropped ceiling — a form of spiritual graffiti, you might say. “His love endures forever.” “May God dwell in this house forever.”There is still work to do; the landscaping, for example, will have to wait until spring. And the need to pay for everything remains; the church, Bishop Robinson admits, is in perpetual fund-raising mode. No matter: what has risen is a large, simple structure of wonder.A sanctuary — yes — with 60 wooden pews purchased from a business called Affordable Church Furniture. Choir seating — yes — with many of the chairs donated by a Lutheran church. A fellowship hall — yes — with more than enough room for wedding receptions and funeral repasts.And — yes— a pastor’s office, on the very spot where gasoline was poured on that hopeful, horrible November night. “The guys came from those woods,” Martin Jr., the church’s indefatigable lawyer, said as he led a tour through the building. “They busted in here. They splashed it on the outside and they splashed it on the inside.”On Saturday’s misty morning, members of the Macedonia congregation gathered in their new home for a rousing dedication. Dressed in their finest, they prayed and sang and swayed.Here was the governor of , and the mayor of Springfield, and a police officer who worked on the arson investigation, and, all the way from , Charles E. Blake Sr., the presiding bishop and chief apostle of the Church of God in Christ.And here, of course, was Bishop Robinson, steadied by his cane and giving thanks for this celebration that would not, could not, be denied.1005 2011-09-26 “I don’t want to encourage having all sorts of religious things in our public parks,” one committee member, Paul Cantor, told a community newspaper after voting against the application. Mr. Cantor did not respond to messages left on his voice mail.The entire board, Community Board 1, is scheduled to vote on the permit on Tuesday. Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, has urged the board to support the sukkah. Julie Menin, the board’s chairwoman, would not say how she would vote but said, “our community has been known as a very tolerant community.”The board played a role in the controversy over the creation of an Islamic center near ground zero when it approved a request to drop the landmark status of the building envisioned for the center.“It’s very important that no religion get preference, but every single religion needs to get fair and equal treatment,” Ms. Menin said.Controversies about religious displays in public spaces are as common before Christmas as holly wreaths. The public sukkah, though, is an autumnal phenomenon — this year the eight-day Sukkot harvest holiday begins at sundown Oct. 12 — and has its own constitutional complications.Sukkahs are fragile shacks with branches or reeds as roofing, which Jews put up because of the biblical injunction to remember the transitory shelters the ancient Israelites used while wandering in the desert. They are usually erected on synagogue grounds or rooftops or private balconies or backyards.But a request for a display in a public space raises difficult questions.Is the sukkah merely a cultural symbol, or is it unmistakably religious in character? Does the government endorse its religious significance by allowing it to occupy a big chunk of a park when symbols of other faiths are not represented?Despite several Supreme Court rulings, religious displays — whether of crèches, crosses, menorahs or the Ten Commandments — remain a subject of great ambiguity, civil liberties lawyers say. Individual municipalities must often decide the matter for themselves, relying on guidelines that the courts have clarified.Arthur Eisenberg, legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said one widely accepted principle is equality: The government cannot discriminate against groups that seek access to the park, cannot “favor some religions over others” and “cannot privilege nonreligious expression over religious expression.”Nathan Lewin, a lawyer who has successfully represented Chabad in menorah cases, said government can accommodate religious displays but cannot appear to endorse them, an impression that might be created by a nativity scene stationed inside a government building with no other religious symbols nearby.The parks department said it allowed sukkahs as long as “the applicant ensures that they are structurally safe.”“We’re content-neutral when evaluating applications for events in parks, whether they be of a religious, political or cultural nature,” Vickie Karp, a spokeswoman for the department, said.Nevertheless, the city has at times indicated that more blatant religious images might stir questions. The Department of Transportation removed a crèche last Christmas from the St. George Ferry Terminal in Staten Island, drawing protests from some priests and ministers. A department spokesman said the crèche had been removed because a staff member had put it up without authorization, but he also said that menorahs and Christmas trees were “consistent both with traditions at the ferry terminal and also with legal precedent.” Supporters of a crèche said the suggestion was that trees and menorahs were seasonal images and not as blatantly religious as a figure of the baby Jesus.Rabbi Paris, 36, director of Chabad of TriBeCa, and his wife, Chana, seem not to have had these issues in mind. He said the impetus for putting up the sukkah came from Jews in TriBeCa who wanted a convenient way to observe the custom of sitting and eating in a sukkah. TriBeCa, he said, offered few options because outdoor parking lots and large backyards were scarce.Rabbi Paris took pains to say he was mindful of the neighborhood’s sensitivities.We respect anyone in our community who might object to a sukkah in a public space,” he said, “and are actively searching everywhere for appropriate and accessible space.”1006 2011-09-26 Only after that do they seem likely to come up with a broader rescue package aimed at relieving the anxiety that has driven markets lower in recent weeks. The markets may not wait that long.Indeed, for political leaders like Mrs. Merkel, the problem now is that investors have already concluded that the 440 billion euro bailout fund, the expansion of which is being voted on this week, might not be enough to stop the contagion from spreading. On Friday, the yield on two-year Greek notes rose to 69.7 percent, suggesting that investors considered a default all but inevitable.When the initial expansion of the bailout fund was agreed to in July, worries centered on three smaller countries on the periphery of — Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Since then, however, fears have multiplied about the ability of and , the third-largest economy in the euro zone, to keep borrowing heavily, creating doubts about pools of debt from countries that right now are considered “too big to bail.”The worry is that a default by would threaten these and other sovereign borrowers, as well as in and Germany that hold tens of billions of euros in Greek debt. That, in turn, has helped push shares of American banks, which are intertwined with their European counterparts, sharply lower, dragging down the broader market.“The next three weeks are absolutely critical, and they can still stabilize the markets, but I wouldn’t tell my clients to put money to work until we see it,” said Rebecca Patterson, chief market strategist at Asset Management. “As we stand right now, European policy makers have gotten well behind the curve. It’s not about the periphery anymore; it’s about the core, too.”A fresh indicator of market confidence in European borrowers will come as Italy sells billions of euros in this week, culminating on Thursday. Weak demand at an auction on Sept. 13 brought global worries about the safety of Italian debt, which stands at a whopping $2.3 trillion, making Italy one of the world’s largest borrowers.What is more, Italy’s debt load equals 120 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. In Europe, only Greece is in worse shape, with debt totaling roughly 150 percent of G.D.P.In addition, the Greek Parliament must vote this week on a recently proposed property increase that is seen as a test of whether the country will stick to past promises to tighten its belt.Greece is also trying to show its austerity program is enough to qualify for an aid payment due in October.Last week, anxiety about Europe led to the worst week for the Dow Jones industrial average since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008, and as was the case then, it seems events are moving faster than political leaders, further narrowing their options.Besides the 6 percent drop on Wall Street last week, investors are concerned about the continuing rout in European stocks, especially bank shares, which stand at two-year lows. In another troubling echo of the events of 2008, traders abandoned former havens like gold, oil and other commodities, preferring the safety of securities or, better yet, cash.In Asia on Monday, investors remained nervous. The Nikkei 225 index in was down about 2 percent in the early afternoon, and the Hang Seng index in was down about 1.5 percent.Meanwhile, deep divisions persist, not just among political leaders in different countries but among policy makers and the heads of Europe’s biggest banks.Under a deal worked out in July, European banks agreed to take a 21 percent loss on their holdings of Greek debt as part of a restructuring that would give Greece more time to pay back what it owes, but now it appears political leaders in Germany and elsewhere want the banks to take a bigger hit.Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s finance minister, suggested as much in a tough speech delivered to international bankers at the Institute for International Finance over the weekend. He argued that because of their bad lending decisions, bankers shared the blame for Greece’s predicament and should also share in the cost.“Without a substantial contribution from financial institutions,” he said, “the legitimacy of our westernized capitalized systems will suffer.”But , chief executive of and the chairman of the Institute for International Finance, quickly rejected any effort to renegotiate what had been agreed to in July. “It is not feasible to reopen the agreement,” he said.Now, not only must the original July plan be approved, but policy makers must agree on how to augment it in the face of widening worries.“The Europeans are trying to balance the process of approval in 17 parliaments and trying to get the most firepower” from the stability fund, said , president of the .Just how to do that, including what can be purchased and how it might be leveraged, was “richly discussed,” Mr. Zoellick said at the annual meetings of the and the World Bank this weekend.On both sides of the Atlantic, there is a feeling that policy makers have few arrows left in their quiver. A announcement on Wednesday that it would buy $400 billion in long-term left the stock market unimpressed.“It gets worse before it gets better,” said Adam Parker, ’s chief equity strategist. “If you’re banking on a policy to bail you out, you will be disappointed.”1007 2011-09-26 Mr. Trumka said unions were tired of Democratic politicians taking them for granted after labor shoveled millions of dollars into Democratic campaigns. In distancing themselves, at least a bit, from the Democrats, unions are becoming part of a trend in which newly empowered outside groups build what are essentially party structures of their own — in this case, to somewhat offset the money flowing into conservative groups that are doing the same thing.Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the , voiced skepticism about labor’s declaration of political independence, noting that union leaders have often said similar things in the past, before returning to the Democratic fold.Labor leaders complain that after unions spent more than $200 million to help elect and Congressional Democrats in 2008, the Democrats did not deliver on labor’s priorities, including a large enough to reinvigorate the economy and legislation that would make it far easier to unionize workers, central to labor’s hopes of reversing its decline.In an interview, Mr. Trumka said the A.F.L.-C.I.O. would initially inject $10 million into its still unnamed Super PAC — far less than the $100 million that some conservative Super PACs have — in large part to build a year-round political structure for labor.“The way we used to do politics is we’d set up a structure six months before the election, and after Election Day we’d dismantle it,” Mr. Trumka said. “Now we’re going to have a full-time campaign, and that campaign will be able to move, hopefully, from electoral politics to issue advocacy and accountability,” meaning holding union-backed lawmakers accountable.Unions are recasting how they do politics after labor leaders reluctantly recognized their political predicament: as union membership has shrunk in recent years, it has become harder for unions — perhaps the Democrats’ most powerful ally — to elect the candidates they support.Michael A. Podhorzer, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s political director, said the need for a new strategy became evident last November. He said that even though unions conducted a huge campaign operation in Ohio, the labor-backed candidate for governor, , a Democrat, lost to the Republican, .“It became apparent that even in races where union members voted overwhelmingly in support of a pro-worker candidate, we could still lose,” Mr. Podhorzer said. “President Trumka asked, ‘How do we get programs that win elections and not just put up a good fight?’ ”Before the Citizens United ruling, unions were banned from using dues money to reach out to nonmembers in political campaigns, but now unions plan to campaign among the 89 percent of Americans who do not belong to unions. Union officials have long complained that when their foot soldiers knocked on doors in, say, or , Ohio, they wasted huge amounts of time because they could visit only union members’ homes and often had to skip 90 percent of the houses. Now they can knock on every door on a block.Many Democrats wish that money would go directly to party building or individual campaigns. Moreover, many national Democrats fear that labor will focus on state and local races — at the expense of presidential, Senate and House races — to help assure union survival after Republicans in and Ohio enacted legislation sharply limiting the power of public-sector unions.Charlie Cook, editor of the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter, said labor’s political overhaul had many national Democrats worrying that unions would not be as generous and active on their behalf.“Labor just seems to think that their challenge of survival is so great that state-by-state and ground-level fighting is more important than fighting in U.S. House and Senate races and plowing a lot of money into the presidential race,” Mr. Cook said. “But if we’re looking at a situation where the Republicans are going to hold the House and perhaps pick up a majority of the Senate and have at least a 50-50 chance of winning the presidency, I wonder whether labor will have to re-engage at the national level.”One example of labor’s more independent approach came two weeks before Mr. Obama’s jobs speech before a joint session of Congress. At a breakfast with reporters, Mr. Trumka criticized Mr. Obama as doing too little on jobs and becoming a follower, not a leader, by letting Congressional Republicans set the agenda.He also warned that union members, dismayed with the 9.1 percent jobless rate and Mr. Obama’s failure to do more about it, might not be energized enough to vote for him as many did in 2008. Union leaders like to think such words helped persuade Mr. Obama to push for a robust, $440 billion jobs program that is now before Congress.“He’s leading, and that’s exactly what we asked,” Mr. Trumka said. “I think everyone will rally around this.”The , often called the nation’s most politically potent labor group, has also revamped its political strategy in response to Citizens United. This summer it dispatched thousands of members to knock on hundreds of thousands of doors in blue-collar neighborhoods in , Milwaukee and a dozen other cities, aiming to educate and mobilize union and nonunion workers on economic issues.It also helped organize a sit-in at the office of Representative , Republican of Wisconsin, to protest his plan to make sizable cuts in spending.“We’re solely focused right now on trying to get the national debate focused on jobs and everybody paying their fair share,” said , the S.E.I.U. president.“It’s important for us to keep our eyes on who’s standing in the way of working people,” she added. “It’s not President Obama. It’s the corporations and the wealthy and the politicians they back who aren’t willing to pay their fair share and are applauding efforts to dismantle government.”Like many union leaders, she said Citizens United was far more advantageous to corporations than unions because corporations have trillions of dollars in assets at their disposal.1008 2011-09-26 The Police Department’s chief spokesman, Paul J. Browne, said the police had used the pepper spray “appropriately.”“Pepper spray was used once,” he added, “after individuals confronted officers and tried to prevent them from deploying a mesh barrier — something that was edited out or otherwise not captured in the video.”Since Sept. 17, a few hundred protesters have occupied Zuccotti Park on Liberty Street and Broadway, seeking attention for what they say is a financial system that is unjust and flawed. They have embarked on a series of daily marches near Wall Street, but their march to Union Square on Saturday was their largest and most ambitious.Returning to the financial district from Union Square, many protesters used University Place, and the demonstration spilled into the street with protesters walking against traffic. The police put up mesh nets to prevent them from going any farther down University Place, and many of the demonstrators ended up on East 12th Street.Ms. Elliott was one of several protesters on East 12th Street who had been corralled behind the plastic netting, which was being held by a line of police officers.Ms. Elliott said she spent part of the time trying to engage the police officer nearest her in a conversation about pensions.“I’m just trying to converse with them in a civilized manner, and tell them I’m a civilized human being,” Ms. Elliott said. She remembered saying, “Stop! Why are you doing this?” in response to an arrest not far away, but doing nothing else to attract attention.“A cop in a white shirt — I think he’s a superior officer — just comes along and does these quick little spritzes of pepper spray in my and these three other girls’ eyes,” she added. The officer’s identity was not provided by the police.The scene around Ms. Elliott verged on the unruly on Saturday. The police made arrests in the area on charges not only of disorderly conduct and impeding traffic, but also of inciting to riot and assaulting a police officer. About 80 people were arrested; some spent the night in jail and were arraigned on Sunday.Patrick Bruner, a spokesman for the protesters, said he believed that pepper spray was used several times on Saturday. “I think it is very fair to call it police brutality,” he said.The Police Department rarely uses pepper spray as a means of crowd control. Although the police used it during a large-scale antiwar protest in 2003, it was not used with much frequency during the protests associated with the Republican National Convention in New York in 2004, although they were some of the largest demonstrations in the city in years.“We don’t use it indiscriminately like other cities do,” said Thomas Graham, a retired deputy chief who until last year commanded the department’s Disorder Control Unit. “You’re not just spraying indiscriminately into a crowd.”Police officers, he said, “have the choice between spraying the guy or struggling with the guy with the night stick,” he said, adding, “Get poked with a nightstick good and hard and you might have a cracked rib from that.”1009 2011-09-26 ¶Bank of New York Mellon named Doremus, New York, part of the Omnicom Group, as its global agency of record. The assignment, with spending estimated at $10 million to $15 million, had been handled by the Concept Farm, New York.¶Universal Music Group has consolidated its United States media account and awarded the assignment to MediaCom, part of the GroupM unit of WPP, which already handles media planning and buying for the company in Australia, Canada and Europe. Spending was estimated at $15 million to $20 million, which could be increased significantly next year. Among the labels involved are Decca, Def Jam, Geffen, Interscope, Island, Mercury, Motown and Verve. The media duties in the United States were previously divided among a number of smaller media agencies.¶Burger King Corporation, Miami, owned by 3G Capital, chose Coyne Public Relations, Parsippany, N.J., to be its public relations agency of record in the United States. Spending for the assignment, which had been handled by Edelman, part of Daniel J. Edelman Inc., was not disclosed. Burger King has also recently changed agencies for assignments like creating ad campaigns and media services.¶Carter Murray will join Y&R, New York, part of the Young & Rubicam Brands unit of WPP, at the end of next month as president and chief executive of Y&R Advertising North America. He succeeds Tom Sebok, who recently became president and chief executive of the Y&R New York office. Mr. Murray had been chief marketing officer and worldwide account director at Publicis Worldwide, Paris, part of the Publicis Groupe, where he worked on the important Nestlé account.¶Sheri Roder, senior vice president and managing director for consumer insights at Horizon Media, New York, will head a new division, the Why Group, as chief. The division will be focused on research into consumer behavior to identify cultural and societal trends.1010 2011-09-26 As a “tidal wave” of Netflix competitors enter, said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst for Nomura, “in the short term it will probably be good for the price of content,” because more bidders mean that media companies can charge more for the rights to stream movies like “Avatar” and shows like “Modern Family.”More important, “in the long term it may accelerate changes in consumer behaviors,” Mr. Nathanson said, as more people choose to watch more video online.Access to movies and TV shows is what matters most to Netflix, and Hollywood, after helping to build up the company with generous deals, is starting to play hardball. Next February, Netflix is expected to lose the right to stream films from Walt Disney Studios and Sony Pictures Entertainment, as a result of a failed renegotiation with the premium cable channel Starz.But Netflix’s biggest challenge at the moment is self-inflicted. This summer, in an attempt to raise cash to license more streaming content, the company increased the price for its combination Internet streaming and DVD service, angering customers. On Sept. 18 it abruptly said it would split up the two services, frustrating fans of both.About one million of its 25 million customers in the United States are believed to have dropped the service in this quarter. The company has lost half of its value — about $8 billion worth — over the last two months.Mr. Katzenberg said he was confident about the direction Netflix was heading, calling the company’s decision to split streaming and DVD “a very tough and very strategic call that will ultimately prove to be the right one for long-term success.”“Could it have been handled better? Absolutely,” he added. “But there are always bumps when you’re looking around a corner.”Netflix will begin streaming DreamWorks films starting in 2013. The studio plans three releases that year: “The Croods,” a prehistoric comedy; “Turbo,” about a garden snail; and “Peabody & Sherman,” an adaptation of “Rocky and Bullwinkle” characters. Titles from the DreamWorks library, including “Kung Fu Panda” and “Antz,” will become available over time, the companies said.The so-called pay TV window is one of the entertainment industry’s most important business tools. In the past, HBO has paid steep licensing fees of about $20 million per picture for exclusive rights a few months after films arrive on DVD. But Netflix — capitalizing on a consumer shift to streaming content on computers, tablets and Internet-connected televisions — has been making similar deals, albeit mostly with smaller suppliers.With the DreamWorks deal, Netflix will be able to offer customers exclusive access to a pipeline of films that are reliably some of the year’s biggest box office successes. The opportunity to bolster its children’s and family offerings was another reason Netflix pursued a DreamWorks deal so aggressively. Netflix will also gain streaming rights to DreamWorks television specials.“This is one of the few family entertainment brands that matter,” Mr. Sarandos said. “It’s also a signal to people that we are in no way moving away from movies. Our programming is just reflecting more and more what people want.”For DreamWorks Animation, which has experienced a sharp erosion in its stock price over the last few months, the deal with Netflix comes with one major perk. HBO requires its studio partners to suspend digital sales of movies during its exclusive window, but Netflix will allow DreamWorks to keep selling digital downloads.What does the loss of DreamWorks mean for HBO? Anything that increases the marketplace clout of Netflix is damaging, but the premium television service will most likely not miss it much. HBO’s studio partners are increasingly making animated films and HBO recently brought in Summit Entertainment, the studio behind the “Twilight” films, as a new partner. HBO notably allowed DreamWorks out of its contract two years early.Meanwhile, Netflix keeps adding television content. Last week, Netflix announced a renewed content deal with Discovery, the owner of channels like TLC and Animal Planet, that will result in streams of old episodes of “Say Yes to the Dress,” “River Monsters” and others. What is more important, Netflix is soon going to make the source network of shows clearer; people who turn on “River Monsters” will know it is an Animal Planet show.Signaling support for Netflix, John Weiser, president of domestic distribution for Sony Pictures Television, called it an “important player and a great customer,” and said the two companies were “actively discussing producing original programming together.”Netflix is already spending $100 million to create a series called “House of Cards"" and acquiring the American rights to overseas properties.1011 2011-09-26 Mr. Kudrin has close ties with Mr. Putin, and he was said to be a top candidate for prime minister himself.“I do not see myself in the new government,” he said in remarks that were reported by Russian news agencies on Sunday. “It is not just that I have not been offered the job, but I think that those differences of opinion that I have, they do not allow me to join this government.”Speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington, he added, “I have differences with Medvedev on economic policy; they basically have to do with considerable spending on military goals.”His comments laid bare the tension that has been kept under wraps while Russian leaders negotiated a reshuffle at the top of the government. Some analysts and former officials said Mr. Kudrin might feel that he had been sidelined.“Kudrin is expanding his status and authority by explaining that he will only work directly with Putin,” Mikhail M. Kasyanov, who served as prime minister under Mr. Putin from 2000 until 2004, said in a telephone interview. “He is minimizing his dependence on Medvedev.”Before the announcement, “nobody knew” of the planned swap, said Mr. Kasyanov, who now leads an opposition group, the People’s Freedom Party. “Putin conducts everything as if in the framework of a special operation. He doesn’t let anybody know, and nobody knew.”A first deputy prime minister, Igor Shuvalov, confirmed in comments carried by Interfax that ministers had indeed been kept in the dark.“We didn’t know,” he said. “If you think that someone had known about what was announced yesterday, it is not so. The leaders did not share information on this issue with us, of course; they didn’t discuss it with us. They discussed it among themselves.”Mr. Kudrin’s threat injects uncertainty into the new government structure outlined Saturday. He has been an essential player on Mr. Putin’s governing team for two decades. Foreign investors consider him to be an important proponent of privatization and other reforms, as well as a hedge against financial chaos.Government officials hastened to play down the seriousness of Mr. Kudrin’s criticism of Mr. Medvedev.Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told journalists that Mr. Kudrin would “remain on Mr. Putin’s team.”Natalya Timakova, Mr. Medvedev’s spokeswoman, said it was too early to discuss the composition of the new government. “If somebody is ready to leave earlier, he always has that opportunity,” she said. “You don’t have to wait for the new government to form before signing a letter of resignation.”Mr. Kudrin explained that he objected to Mr. Medvedev’s approval of a $65 billion increase in military spending over three years. Just the increase, he said, would equal Russia’s total expenditure on education at all levels, including universities.He said the decisions pose macroeconomic as well budgetary risks.Mr. Kudrin also warned that Russia’s pension fund has a deficit of $31 billion, endangering reforms that began in 2008. The next government, he said, “will have to address these problems, including balancing the budgetary system, lowering risks in the macroeconomic sphere. In this case Medvedev’s new team will have to solve these problems.”He said it was too early to say whether he would accept a position reporting to Mr. Putin. Mr. Kudrin could also take a position at the Central Bank.Mr. Kudrin was one of the St. Petersburg officials who helped bring Mr. Putin to Moscow, setting the stage for his rise through the Russian political system. He served as Mr. Putin’s finance minister and made it his mission to steer oil revenues into a stabilization fund, creating influential enemies behind the scenes. His position was vindicated in 2008, when Russia weathered the financial crisis, leaving his position more secure than ever.1012 2011-09-26 WEISS--Ida (Berson) age 92.

The sides had been ordered to submit to mediation with Mario M. Cuomo, a former New York governor, but had clearly been awaiting Tuesday’s ruling to see what would be left of the case to mediate.The Mets’ owners had been pleased to get the case moved from federal bankruptcy court, where it was first filed, to Rakoff’s district court. But they had also held out hope that he would dismiss the case entirely. Wilpon and Katz had called the trustee’s claims that they should have known about the fraud “fiction,” and they had accused Picard of twisting or inventing evidence.Rakoff did dismiss a variety of specific claims and legal theories raised by Picard. Still, he ruled that the trustee had produced sufficient — if “less than overwhelming” — evidence that the men might have indeed been blind to warnings about Madoff for that claim to go to trial.Rakoff even cited in his ruling the trustee’s assertion of one piece of evidence that showed the men had worries about Madoff: that Wilpon and Katz, after years of investing with Madoff, “seriously considered buying fraud insurance with respect to their investments in Madoff Securities.”But the optimism of the owners about the case winding up before Rakoff was rewarded in at least two significant ways.Rakoff ruled that Picard, in his effort to recover money from Wilpon and Katz, could pick over only a sliver of time from their long years of investing with Madoff. For example, Picard had claimed that the men had to return $300 million of what he called “fictitious profits” — the difference between what they put into their Madoff accounts and what they took out over six years of investing. But Rakoff ruled that only the men’s last two years of investing were vulnerable to Picard’s claim — a figure likely to be more like $80 million.Rakoff also disallowed a claim by the trustee that would have made it much easier for him to have pursued the return of hundreds of millions of dollars.Picard had argued that he did not even have to prove that Wilpon and Katz consciously turned a blind eye to possible fraud by Madoff, only that they had been aware of enough questions about Madoff’s operation that they should have investigated its legitimacy.Rakoff ruled that, as mere investors, Wilpon and Katz were under no obligation to investigate Madoff’s operation.“A securities investor has no inherent duty to inquire about his stockbroker,” Rakoff wrote. He added that if an investor was “simply confronted with suspicious circumstances” and did not investigate “the broker’s internal practices — and how could he do so anyway? — his lack of due diligence cannot be equated with a lack of good faith.”Although the scope of the case has been narrowed, it is still just one of several financial problems facing the Mets and their owners. They had a third straight losing season at Citi Field, attendance is faltering, and losses are expected to swell to $70 million this year from $51 million last season.As well, a deal to sell a minority stake in the team for $200 million to the hedge-fund manager David Einhorn fell through recently, leaving Wilpon and Katz having to raise the money from perhaps dozens of investors willing to put up a few million to $20 million each.But the Mets would probably feel satisfied if, through a trial or mediation, they end up paying the trustee only $80 million — a sum that Wilpon and Katz would probably be able to raise by selling some of their real estate and other assets, or even a stake in SNY, the cable network they control.1015 2011-09-27 In a statement, Sterling Equities, the family-run business behind the Mets, said it was “pleased that the court today dismissed 9 of the 11 counts in the Trustee’s complaint, and that the lone remaining count in which the Trustee seeks to recover payments from the Sterling Partners is limited to a two-year period.”In some ways, the decision gave Wilpon and Katz reason to hope they could survive financially and hold on to the team they cherish as something of a family trust.But it also left them to litigate further what the men had said hurt them most: the trustee’s assertion that they knowingly ignored repeated red flags that Madoff might have been up to no good, but failed to act because they had grown so used to enriching themselves with the profits from their Madoff investments.The 18-page decision — eagerly anticipated by both sides and the wider world of the vast Madoff bankruptcy proceedings — preserves the chance of a possible settlement.

Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a small skillet and add the summer squash. Cook, stirring, until the squash is very soft and all of the liquid has evaporated from the pan. Season to taste with salt and pepper.2. Place the garlic in a mortar and pestle with a generous pinch of salt and mash to a purée. Add the cooked squash and mash to a rough purée. In a medium bowl, stir together the tahini, lemon juice, and a tablespoon of cold water until smooth. Add the yogurt and mix together. Stir in the squash and garlic and combine well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving dish and allow to sit for an hour or more before serving. Serve at room temperature, garnished with a sprinkling of ground cumin.Yield: 1 scant cup, serving 4 to 6 as a spread or dipAdvance preparation: This will keep for a day or two in the refrigerator but will become more pungent.1023 2011-09-27 The business group talks exit strategies....1024 2011-09-27 The business group talks exit strategies....1025 2011-09-27 “Silence: The Musical!” will reopen Off Broadway in a new, open-ended engagement starting Oct. 25....1026 2011-09-27 ""Silence!

The popularity of Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, who announced last year that he would not seek a third term, has plunged as the unemployment rate soared to about 21 percent, the highest in the developed world. The Socialist government has been forced to adopt unpopular austerity measures to rein in Spain’s public deficit and calm market fears that the country may need a financial bailout. If the election were to take place now, the conservative opposition Popular Party would capture an absolute majority in Parliament, according to a poll published Monday in the Catalan daily El Periódico.1045 2011-09-27 India successfully test-fired a short-range, nuclear-capable missile on Monday, the Defense Ministry said. The Prithvi missile, which has a range of 220 miles, was fired from a testing range in Chandipur in Orissa State and hit a target in the Bay of Bengal with high accuracy, said a Defense Ministry spokesman, N. Ao. India’s missiles are intended primarily for any confrontation with its regional rival, Pakistan. Both nations routinely test missiles and the launching on Monday was unlikely to aggravate tensions.1046 2011-09-27 Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate led by Warren E. Buffett, said it would begin a share buyback program that comes after months of investor complaints that the stock is undervalued.Mr. Buffett had long avoided a stock buyback, saying he preferred using spare cash to buy companies that would increase his company’s profit margins.Yet some longtime investors have said Berkshire shares were lately at their cheapest in a generation, and even analysts who were cautious on the stock acknowledged it was attractively priced.Berkshire said Monday it was now willing to pay up to 10 percent more than book value for its stock.“In the opinion of our board and management, the underlying businesses of Berkshire are worth considerably more than this amount, though any such estimate is necessarily imprecise,” Berkshire said in a statement.Berkshire class A shares closed at $108,449, up 8.1 percent, while the more actively traded class B shares rose 8.6 percent to $72.09. Last week both classes fell to their lowest point since early 2010.1047 2011-09-27 The clinic’s workers berated and even slapped her, certain she was being negligent. In reality Energy had osteogenesis imperfecta, known as brittle bone disease, but it wasn’t diagnosed until he was 5.He didn’t know there was such a thing as a wheelchair until he got one two years later at a school for disabled children where his mother, intent on his education, managed to place him. The school was far from home. Saying goodbye, his mother told him: “Make me proud.”He was at another such school, King George VI, in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, when my friend Elinor Burkett, an American journalist, happened to meet him in 2006. The school’s band, Liyana, caught her attention and deeply touched her, and she got to know its members, including three disabled boys who played marimba — Energy, Goodwell and Honest.They confessed a fantasy: college in America. It was like “an ant dreaming of becoming King of the jungle,” Energy wrote in a recent class assignment.Burkett connected them with the United States Achievers Program, administered by embassies. It helps disadvantaged foreigners apply to, and get scholarships from, American universities.Each boy was admitted to a school, and Burkett lobbied each school for as much aid as possible. She hit up friends, strangers and foundations for the additional thousands necessary for the boys’ living expenses, a process she’ll repeat until all three have diplomas.People are generous when faced with concrete situations rather than abstract causes. At Lynn University faculty members and students made sure Energy got a television and a mini-fridge. One of Burkett’s friends pays for his . His wheelchair was donated by UCP Wheels for Humanity; delivered it free. His Kindle he won in a card game.Around campus almost everyone greets him by name. He stands out, given the big chair and tiny body in it. His legs are stuck in a lotuslike position; he can’t straighten them all the way. He has no idea how tall he is.Over the years his spine has curved badly. Some of his vital organs are compressed. With painful corrective surgery he could live a long life, and he hopes to get an operation this summer, from a doctor at Johns Hopkins Medical Center whom Burkett took him to see. Now that he has medical through school, it just might happen.He studies hard and frets all the time. He can’t fail, not if he wants to realize his goal of a job as a human rights advocate — maybe with the , maybe with — and of some sort of arrangement by which he can live in America or anywhere but Zimbabwe, where there are no ramps, astronomical unemployment and unfathomable poverty.He told me that he’s surprised by the casual work habits of many of his fellow students.“Americans are so relaxed,” he told me. “So rich.”He pointed to a mop leaning against his room wall. Like most mops in this country, it can be wrung by a sliding mechanism on the handle. He thinks that’s hysterical — absurd. In Zimbabwe everyone wrings mops with their hands.He had just returned from a class in which he’d given a presentation on , a phenomenon he hasn’t thought much about. In Zimbabwe other issues, like hunger, crowd it out.I asked him if anything about his new life disappointed him. He stared blankly at me. To him, the question made no sense whatsoever.1048 2011-09-27 With few government regulations that limit the flaring, more burning is also taking place in the Eagle shale field in , and some environmentalists and industry executives say that it could happen in , and , too, as drilling expands in new fields there unlocked by techniques like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling.“North Dakota is not as bad as , but this is not what you would expect a civilized, efficient society to do: to flare off a perfectly good product just because it’s expensive to bring to market,” said Michael E. Webber, associate director of the Center for and Environmental Policy at the University of Texas at Austin.The oil companies say economic reality is driving the flaring in the Bakken, the biggest oil field discovered in the in four decades. They argue that they cannot afford to pay for pipelines and processing plants to capture and sell the gas until they actually drill oil wells and calculate how much gas will bubble out of the oil. And reinjection of the carbon dioxide, commonly done in conventional oil fields, is more difficult and expensive in less permeable shale fields.“This field covers 15,000 square miles, so it takes time to go and test what’s there and then build a gathering system and plant,” said Harold G. Hamm, chief executive of , one of the biggest oil producers in the Bakken.The widespread flaring is a step backward for a domestic energy industry. Most oil and gas fields in the United States have well-developed facilities to gather and process gas.But the recent rise of shale drilling has changed the economic calculus. Natural gas prices have plunged since 2008 as vast shale fields laden with gas are tapped through hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. Meanwhile, those same techniques have opened up other shale fields rich with oil.With oil prices high amid strong global demand and leases as short as five years for land in the Bakken, drillers have found it more profitable to just grab the oil and burn the gas. Building out the infrastructure to handle gas would substantially raise costs and slow development, and efforts so far to use the gas for electrical generation have had limited success because it contains components that burn too hot.“I’ll tell you why people flare: It’s cheap,” said Troy Anderson, lead operator of a North Dakota gas-processing plant owned by . “Pipelines are expensive: You have to maintain them. You need permits to build them. They are a pain.”Although capturing the gas is the best option, scientists say that flaring is better for the environment than venting the gas into the atmosphere. Pure natural gas is mostly methane, which has far greater heat-trapping qualities than carbon dioxide.Regulations on flaring are loose in North Dakota, as they are in most states, and there are no current federal regulations on flaring at oil and gas wells. That is largely because flaring has not been a significant concern since the 1970s, when the federal government insisted that oil companies re-inject gas into ’s North Slope rather than flare it.So far, North Dakota health officials say that flaring has not produced any serious air pollution problems. But flaring could eventually become another environmental for an industry already under attack over concerns that hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, could jeopardize water quality.The federal has recently proposed new air emissions standards for fracked wells, and it has also begun to ask oil companies to compile data on greenhouse gas emissions from drilling and other operations.“One day a regulator is going to say, ‘I’m not going to give you one more permit until you tell me what you are going to do with the gas,’ ” said Charif Souki, chief executive of , who hopes to eventually export the excess gas in liquefied form.Environmentalists are also beginning to express alarm. “It’s time for the regulators to take a hard look at the impacts of flaring and make sure that available solutions to the flaring problem are required before there is any further widespread expansion of the practice,” said Amy Mall, senior policy analyst at the . Some of the companies working in North Dakota, including Whiting, are investing $3 billion over the next three years in pipelines and several large processing plants to deliver gas to Midwest markets rather than burn it.Whiting, a company that was one of the early explorers in the Bakken, sees particular value in the gas found here because it contains large amounts of and butane that it can extract and sell at a profit in addition to the gas itself.The company is rapidly expanding oil drilling while building and expanding two plants to process its own gas as well as gas produced by others. Whiting was flaring 80 percent of the gas in its first major Bakken field in 2007, but says it has now reduced its flaring to 20 percent across all fields, which will fall further when its second gas plant comes online.“Our goal is to have zero emissions,” said James T. Brown, Whiting’s president and chief operating officer. “It’s a waste to be all of this energy.”While the projects by Whiting and others could reduce flaring over the next two years, some executives acknowledge that it will be a continuing problem as the industry increases the number of wells in the area from 5,000 to a projected 48,000 over the next 20 years.Wayde Schafer, the ’s North Dakota conservation organizer, said that the industry needed to slow down development if it could not protect the air. “You can do it fast or you can do it right,” he said.1049 2011-09-27 Eastman Kodak has been struggling to reinvent itself for decades. So when Antonio M. Perez, the chief executive, announced in July that he was confident that Kodak could transform itself into a profitable and sustainable digital company by 2012, many investors were skeptical.Kodak’s unexpected decision to tap its credit line for $160 million last Friday reinforced concerns about the viability of the company’s turnaround strategy, which relies on selling inkjet printers, commercial printing and company patents, and on Monday, its shares lost a quarter of their value, closing at $1.74.Kodak’s stock price has declined nearly 70 percent since the start of the year.“We didn’t anticipate them having to use it in the third quarter going into the fourth quarter,” said Shannon Cross, of Cross Research in Livingston, N.J. “It just shows that the core business continues to burn cash.”Chris Whitmore, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, said that Kodak had $957 million in cash at the end of its most recent quarter, and it announced that it would have as much as $1.7 billion by the end of the year. As a result, he said, investors were expecting Kodak to be selling assets to generate cash, not borrowing.“Most people didn’t expect them to be drawing down their credit facility at this point,” he said.But Kodak officials and some analysts played down the significance of the decision. One reason is that most of the company’s money is generated overseas and bringing it back into this country creates a steep tax liability.1050 2011-09-27 A court on Monday convicted three former aides of Ichiro Ozawa, the embattled Japanese political kingmaker, of charges related to political campaign financing. The convictions dealt Mr. Ozawa a setback just as his own trial in the scandal was set to begin next week. The aides were sentenced to as many as three years in prison for misreporting almost $6 million in Mr. Ozawa’s political funds. Widely credited with engineering the governing Democratic Party’s historic victory two years ago, Mr. Ozawa’s backroom-style of politics has made him the target of repeated investigations by prosecutors.1051 2011-09-27 Has Tom Brady, during a Super Bowl week, been heard talking about a lack of nerves? Has any Super Bowl player noted how easy it was to relax during the week because no matter the outcome, his team had reached the final stage and would walk away a conference champion?The FedEx Cup, a playoff format introduced in 2007 by the PGA Tour to maintain interest and excitement in golf after the last major championship, is in trouble when it can’t raise the pulses of its participants.The points system has been revised before, most notably after the 2008 playoffs when Vijay Singh, with victories in two of the first three events, mathematically clinched the FedEx Cup before the Tour Championship began.The way the system is now, it is impossible to clinch the FedEx Cup before the last event. It is, however, possible to clinch the Cup despite finishing in the back of the pack in the Tour Championship, as almost happened Sunday. Simpson, who entered the week ranked No. 1 in points, was the projected Cup winner at one point despite eventually finishing 22nd in the field of 30.The system needs tweaking, even if the players won’t come right out and say it. Phil Mickelson came close when he said, “I don’t look at the points or understand it or try to, but I do know it rewards good play.” He added, “If there’s a way to simplify it, that would be great.”One proposal that makes a lot of sense was put forth by the former PGA Tour player Brandel Chamblee, now a Golf Channel analyst. Under the current system, points are cumulative and the fields are reduced after each of the three tournaments leading to the 30-man Tour Championship. Chamblee suggested that once the four rounds of playoffs begin, each golfer starts with a blank slate every tournament.The top 125 in the points standings would compete in the first event, with cuts in subsequent tournaments at 100, 70 and 30. The 72-hole stroke-play event would begin on Wednesday and crown a winner on Saturday. On Sunday, according to Chamblee’s proposal, the top four finishers would compete in an 18-hole playoff to determine the FedEx Cup champion. His idea has the added benefit of preventing players from taking a tournament off.Or how about this tweak of his tweak: match-play semifinals on Sunday morning, followed by a match- or stroke-play final in the afternoon.“You may get a blowout every now and then, just like in the Super Bowl,” Chamblee said. “But it would stop the ridiculousness of having to go to a chalkboard to explain it to everybody.”It also would put an end to the confusion that led Haas to congratulate Donald, who finished one stroke behind him, when they had completed their final rounds.“He birdied the last,” Haas said, “and I thought that won the FedEx Cup for him.”Haas’s playoff opponent, Mahan, was under the same impression.“I thought since Luke finished so high, I thought he was going to win no matter what, but I guess he ended up not,” Mahan said.It’s time to take the guessing out of the FedEx Cup. Golf is meant to be cut and dried. There’s no scoring on a curve, no mistaking a bogey for an eagle, so why should the playoffs be any different?1052 2011-09-27 BRUSSELS (AP) — A European Union program aimed at slowing climate change will allow airlines to emit 85 percent of their carbon dioxide limits free in the hope they will use the money to modernize their fleets, an official said Monday.The European Union’s existing cap-and-trade system limits the carbon dioxide emissions of power plants and big factories in the bloc by issuing permits for each ton of carbon they can emit. Each company is allocated permits to emit a set amount of carbon dioxide. They can buy extra credits if they exceed that limit; if they emit less, they can sell credits.Next year, all airlines flying to and from Europe will be brought into the program, which is currently being challenged in court by some American carriers.Jos Delbeke, the European Union’s director general for climate action, said Monday that carriers would be allowed to emit 85 percent of their limit — or cap — free for the first year to ease the economic impact on the industry. The cap is set at 97 percent of the average aviation emissions from 2004 to 2006.For the 2013-20 period, the cap will fall to 95 percent of that number, and the free allowances will decline to 82 percent.Mr. Delbeke said airlines would be allowed to pass on to travelers the additional cost of those permits. He estimated the per ticket cost would be 2 to 12 euros ($2.70 to $16.20).1053 2011-09-27 “I don’t think one measure can solve it all, but it would make a significant difference in market sentiment,” said Mr. Véron, who testified in Washington last week before the Senate Banking Committee on the debt crisis. Meanwhile, Finland appeared to be closer to resolving an impasse that had threatened to hold up deployment of the existing bailout fund. Alexander Stubb, the Finnish minister for European affairs, said the country’s Parliament was likely to approve a plan agreed to by leaders in July.Finland is also close to resolving a dispute about its demand for collateral in return for granting more aid to Greece. The dispute illustrated how political opposition in just one of the 17 European Union countries that use the euro can block initiatives.“I’m very confident we will get the package through Parliament,” Mr. Stubb said by phone. He declined to give details of how the collateral dispute might be resolved.In Brussels, Amadeu Altafaj-Tardio, a spokesman for the European Commission, confirmed that discussions were under way on methods to extend the effectiveness of the bailout fund, called the European Financial Stability Facility.Olli Rehn, the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, had made clear at meetings in Washington that the euro zone was “contemplating further leveraging” of the stability fund, Mr. Altafaj-Tardio said. That option has been urged by United States officials.Separately, leaders tried to quash rumors that Greece and its creditors had discussed the possibility of banks’ taking a larger cut in the value of their Greek bond holdings — perhaps as much as 50 percent — to reduce the government’s debt burden to a more manageable level.Such a move remained highly controversial and was opposed by the large banks as well as the European Central Bank, which owns Greek bonds with a value of as much as 60 billion euros, or $80.8 billion. Any Greek default would probably also require a coordinated bailout of banks holding large amounts of Greek debt.As has often been the case, European leaders seemed to have different perceptions of what was being discussed and how likely it was that the proposals would find support.Martin Kotthaus, a spokesman for the German Finance Ministry, said in Berlin there was no need to expand the size of the bailout fund by giving it more money than already agreed. There is fear that pumping more money into the fund might threaten the credit rating of countries like France by increasing their liabilities.But German officials did not appear to be opposed to increasing the rescue fund’s power to leverage its government guarantees. They wanted only to avoid any discussion until Parliament votes this week on a proposal to expand the size of the fund to 780 billion euros. That plan was agreed to by European leaders on July 21. Some analysts have said that the fund needs to be two to three times as big to convince markets that it could handle a wider crisis.On Monday, a senior official in the Greek Finance Ministry, responding to persistent default rumors, said no such event was imminent. And on Sunday, Evangelos Venizelos, the Greek finance minister, said in Washington that the government’s plan to exchange some existing bonds for new, longer-term securities remained on track.The debt exchange would impose a relatively modest 21 percent loss on the face value of the affected bonds. It is regarded as a good deal for investors because they would receive more solid paper in exchange. Greek creditors must still indicate their willingness to participate.Policy makers want to put Greece on a path toward reducing its debt load to just below 100 percent of its gross domestic product within this decade so that it can wean itself off taxpayer bailouts. The hope is that much of that reduction would come through revived economic growth.But those prospects seem distant given the deep recession into which Greece has fallen and stricter belt-tightening measures being demanded by international creditors.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany rejected the idea of a Greek default, telling a television interviewer late Sunday that such an event could deliver a shock to the financial system similar to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.“We can only take steps that we can really control,” she said on ARD, a public broadcaster. If Greece touched off another financial crisis, she said, “then we politicians will be held responsible.”Under one option being discussed, the bailout fund would be able to absorb losses sustained by the European Central Bank on its purchases of Greek and other government bonds, according to an European Union official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the delicacy of the issue.There is, one official said, no preferred model and it remained unclear whether such moves would be possible without further legal changes. Some officials say they think such steps could be constitutionally difficult, particularly in Germany.“Further enhancement could require treaty reform,” said the European Union official.Resistance to new plans to strengthen the rescue fund might also be forthcoming from the central bank, which has been trying to reduce its bond-buying program.Attention will focus this week on Greece and negotiations on the release of the next portion of international aid, worth 8 billion euros. Without the money, Greece would default next month.A mission by officials of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund was expected to leave for Athens this week. Mr. Altafaj-Tardio said that a decision on the release of the next aid installment was not expected by the time euro zone finance ministers meet next Monday.Opposition to more aid to Greece remains deep in Germany among the public, mainstream economists and the president of the German central bank, Jens Weidmann.Speaking in Washington on Monday, Mr. Weidmann said that aid had already weakened incentives for countries to behave responsibly.“Contrary to what is actually needed in order to overcome the sovereign debt crisis, we risk seeing the propensity for excessive deficits rise even further in the future,” he said.1054 2011-09-27 Mr. Kudrin, looking stung, responded that he would seek the advice of Mr. Putin, who is now the prime minister, before giving an answer.“You can seek advice from whomever you want, including from the prime minister, but while I am president, I will make such decisions,” Mr. Medvedev said. “You need to decide, and quickly.”A few hours later, Mr. Medvedev’s press secretary announced that Mr. Kudrin had been dismissed on Mr. Putin’s recommendation. Under the Constitution, the prime minister must approve such dismissals.The news immediately sent tremors through economic circles, with some analysts predicting that Mr. Kudrin’s departure could rattle investors and damage Russia’s economic outlook.“The resignation or forced dismissal of Finance Minister Kudrin is a real shock, and will be taken negatively by the markets,” said Charles Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital, an bank based in Moscow. “Rather than help capital flow back to Russia, as we hoped might be encouraged by the decision on the presidency on Saturday, this will add to negative pressure.”Mr. Robertson added that though Mr. Kudrin’s stewardship of the Russian economy could blunt any initial harm, his firing would inject uncertainty into Russia’s economic prospects.The news was likely to compound rising economic stresses. Russia’s principal stock index has dipped about 20 percent this year, and the ruble has fallen to its lowest point against the dollar in the last two years. Oil prices, which more than anything define the Russian economy’s strength, have also been on the decline.Mr. Kudrin’s swift dismissal, however, appeared calculated to preserve Mr. Medvedev’s authority. On Saturday, Mr. Medvedev announced that he would cede the presidency back to Mr. Putin after the presidential election in March, which Mr. Putin is sure to win. Some analysts have predicted that Mr. Medvedev will lose the confidence of top officials as they move to align themselves with Mr. Putin after years of uncertainty over who was running the country.By criticizing Mr. Medvedev and affirming his loyalty to Mr. Putin, Mr. Kudrin exposed rifts within the ruling elite that some analysts said could undermine the so-called leadership tandem that had long been presented to the public as inviolable.“This is not a split, but it is a test of the system’s strength,” Aleksei Makarkin, a political analyst in Moscow, told the Interfax news agency. “If they end up fighting over this issue, then it will be a crisis situation of a political nature.”Mr. Kudrin made his initial criticisms of Mr. Medvedev over the weekend in comments to reporters at a meeting of the and in . He called Mr. Medvedev’s military spending irresponsible and said the prime minister had failed to address deficits in the country’s pension fund.Analysts said Mr. Kudrin had perhaps hoped to become prime minister himself after serving for more than a decade as finance minister.It is unclear why Mr. Kudrin chose this moment to level such criticism, given the stakes.He was among the officials who brought Mr. Putin to Moscow in the 1990s, and has shown a knack for navigating Russia’s political landscape. Despite pressure from politicians to free up some of Russia’s immense monetary reserves, he has adhered to a strict fiscal conservatism that is credited with helping Russia weather the financial crisis. In 2007, his deputy was arrested and jailed for almost a year, a move that was widely interpreted as an effort by the security services to hijack Russian economic policy. He survived the affront with his policies largely intact.But his confrontation with Mr. Medvedev was clearly a miscalculation. “Anyone who doubts the course of the president or the government can openly appeal to me with a proposal,” Mr. Medvedev said. “But I will put an end to any irresponsible chatter — up until May 7,” he said, referring to his last day in office.1055 2011-09-27 “Because the recovery is so painfully slow, people may begin to think of the trends established during the recovery as normal,” said Howard Wial, a fellow at the ’s Metropolitan Policy Program who recently co-wrote an economic analysis of the nation’s 100 largest metropolitan areas. “Will people think of , , and as more or less permanently depressed? Think of the as being a renaissance region? I don’t know. It’s possible.”The West has the highest unemployment in the nation. The collapse of the housing bubble left Nevada with the highest jobless rate, 13.4 percent, followed by California with 12.1 percent. has the third-highest rate, 11.2 percent, as a result of the longstanding woes of the American auto industry.Now, though, of the states with the 10 highest unemployment rates, six are in the South. The region, which relied heavily on manufacturing and construction, was hit hard by the downturn.Economists offer a variety of explanations for the South’s performance. “For a long time we tended to outpace the national average with regard to economic performance, and a lot of that was driven by, for lack of a better word, development and in-migration,” said Michael Chriszt, an assistant vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s research department. “That came to an abrupt halt, and it has not picked up.”The long cycle of “lose jobs, gain jobs, lose jobs” that kept ’s unemployment rate at 10.2 percent in August — the same as it was a year earlier — is illustrated by Union City, a small city on the outskirts of .It suffered a blow when the last store in its darkened mall, Sears, announced that it would soon close. But the city had other irons in the fire: a few big companies were hiring, and earlier this year , a biotech company that makes a drug, opened a plant there, lured in part by state and local subsidies.Then, this month, Dendreon said it would lay off more than 100 workers at the new plant as part of a national “restructuring.”Union City, with a population of 20,000, now calls itself the place “Where Business Meets the World” and has been trying to lure companies by pointing out its low business , various incentive programs and proximity to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.Steve Rapson, the city manager, said that the challenge there, as in much of America, has been to get employers to hire again. “It’s hard to get your mind around what can you do as a city to encourage future jobs and jobs growth,” he said.The reordering of the nation’s economic fortunes can be seen in the Brookings analysis, which found that many auto-producing metropolitan areas in the Great Lakes states are seeing modest gains in manufacturing that are helping them recover from their deep slump, while Sun Belt and Western states with sharp drops in home values are still suffering. The areas that have been hurt the least since the recession, the study said, rely on government, education or energy production. Places that were less buoyed by the housing bubble were less harmed when it burst.In , the analysis found, the area — which is heavily reliant on education and health care — is weathering the downturn better than the area. In New York, areas around long-struggling upstate cities like and are recovering faster by some measures than the metropolitan area. And the rate of recovery in Rust Belt areas around Youngstown and Akron, two cities that were hit hard, has outpaced that of former boomtowns like and .In a sign of how severe the downturn has been, the Brookings analysis found that only 16 of the nation’s 100 largest metropolitan areas have regained more than half of the jobs they lost during the recession.The toll on the nation’s millions of unemployed people has been harsh, with the reporting that the had more people living in poverty last year than in any year since it began keeping records half a century ago.Joblessness is taking a toll on states, too. This month, 27 states will have to pay $1.2 billion to the federal government in interest on the $37.5 billion that they borrowed in recent years to keep paying unemployment benefits.What is most striking about the high unemployment rates, several economists said in interviews, is how they continue to afflict wide parts of the country.“It just seems to be so pervasive across the country — except for the breadbasket area — that it’s hard to pick out anybody who is bouncing back,” said Randall W. Eberts, the president of the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Michigan.Dr. Eberts pointed to another feature of the downturn: people are much less likely to leave their jobs voluntarily. Before the recession, he said, about three million people voluntarily left their jobs each month. Now, around two million people do — leaving fewer openings for job seekers.So what happened in South Carolina? Richard Kaglic, a regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said the state’s lingering troubles reflect what happened when its construction and manufacturing industries were hit hard by the recession. Mr. Kaglic, who is also a pilot, used an aviation metaphor to explain what he meant.“If your nose is high, if you’re climbing faster and your engine cuts out, you fall farther and it takes you a longer time to recover,” he said. “The conditions we experienced in late 2008, 2009, are as close as you come to an engine-out situation in the economy.”But Mr. Kaglic said that the recent return of manufacturing jobs was giving him hope, and that one reason for the high unemployment rate was that more people were now seeking work.“I would look at it as our dreams are delayed,” he said, “rather than our dreams being denied.”1056 2011-09-27 Kirti Monastery was a locus of protests during the Tibetan uprising in spring 2008 that began with rallies and rioting in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. At the time, at least 10 people were shot dead in Aba by security forces, according to reports by Tibet advocacy groups and photographic evidence gathered by monks at Kirti’s sister monastery in Dharamsala, India.Tensions continued to simmer, then reached another peak when Phuntsog, 20, set himself on fire on March 16. In the weeks afterward, security forces encircled the monastery. On April 12, laypeople began gathering at the main gate to try to prevent the authorities from harming the monks or taking them away en masse, but six days later the security forces entered the monastery and took away 300 monks. Some reports said two laypeople were killed trying to stop the detentions.In late August and early September, a local court sentenced three monks, one an uncle of Phuntsog, to sentences of 10, 11 and 13 years each in prison for what the authorities said were their roles in causing or aiding Phuntsog’s death.At the time, the State Department issued a release after the sentencing of one of the monks that said, “It is unclear whether he was accorded the procedural rights to which he is entitled under China’s Constitution and laws, and under international standards.”Phuntsog was the first monk to kill himself by self-immolation to protest Chinese rule, according to historians of modern Tibet. In February 2009, another monk from Kirti, Tapey, set himself on fire, but he survived after security officials put out the flames. In 1998, a Tibetan layman living in exile in India, Thubten Ngodup, burned himself to death to protest the Chinese occupation of Tibet.Further underscoring the political tensions, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing on Monday rejected an assertion made by the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Tibetans, that he will decide how his reincarnation is chosen.The Dalai Lama, 76, said on Saturday that he would leave clear written instructions on how the reincarnation will be found. Around age 90, he said, he will consult with other Tibetan Buddhist leaders to see whether the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue.In recent years, the Dalai Lama has suffered bouts of ill health, which have stirred concerns among Tibetans about his future role. Tibetans in exile recently elected a layperson, Lobsang Sangay, as prime minister; he is in charge of the political side of the exile movement.The Chinese government, ruled by the Communist Party and officially atheist, has long asserted that it has the right to approve any reincarnations of the Dalai Lama.“I would like to point out the title of the Dalai Lama is conferred by the central government and is otherwise illegal,” Hong Lei, a foreign ministry spokesman, said at a news conference on Monday, according to The Associated Press. “There has never been a practice of the Dalai Lama identifying his own successor.”1057 2011-09-27 ''The public markets have really become like a casino.''

Those states require relatively detailed teaching about the decade and a half of historic events, roughly bookended by the Supreme Court’s 1954 school desegregation ruling and the April 1968 assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the enactment of the federal Civil Rights Act a week later.Many states have turned Dr. King’s life into a fable, said Mr. Bond, who now teaches at American University and the University of Virginia. He said his students knew that “there used to be segregation until Martin Luther King came along, that he marched and protested, that he was killed, and that then everything was all right.”Alabama, Florida and New York require teaching not only about Dr. King but also about others like James Meredith, who in 1962 became the first black student to enroll at the University of Mississippi; Medgar Evers, the rights organizer murdered the following year in Jackson, Miss.; and Malcolm X, the Muslim minister who challenged the movement’s predominantly integrationist goals.Some experts in history education criticized the report’s methodology. Fritz Fischer, a professor at the University of Northern Colorado who is chairman of the National Council for History Education, said it was unfair to give Colorado and some other states an F because of vague state history standards, when they are required by state constitutions or laws to leave curriculum up to local districts.“The grading system they came up with does a disservice in putting the focus on requirements that certain states are unable to meet and will never be able to meet,” Dr. Fischer said.Even though Colorado’s standards barely mention the civil rights movement, some Colorado schools teach the civil rights movement thoroughly, he said. “I’ve been in classrooms and watched them teach about the sit-ins and about the controversies between Martin Luther King and Malcolm,” he said.The report is by no means the first to sound an alarm about nationwide weaknesses in the teaching of American history.Over the past decade, students have performed worse on federal history tests administered by the Department of Education than on tests in any other subject. On the history test last year, only 12 percent of high school seniors showed proficiency.The law center’s report noted that on that federal test, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, seniors were asked to read a brief excerpt from the Supreme Court’s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling, including the phrase, “Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” Only 2 percent of the seniors were able to state that the ruling had been prompted by a school segregation case.“I appreciate that they are shining a light on this,” said Kathleen Porter-Magee, a senior director at the Fordham Institute, a conservative Washington research group that produced its own report card on states’ American history standards this year. “We found that U.S. history standards were generally mediocre to awful, and this report finds the same thing.”Even in schools that try to teach history rigorously, the civil rights movement may get short shrift because in the traditional chronological presentation of United States history, teachers often run out of time to cover post-World War II America, said Maureen Costello, a director at the poverty law center who oversaw and edited the report, titled “Teaching the Movement: the State of Civil Rights Education in the United States 2011.”One reason the center decided to produce the report now is that 2011 is the 50th anniversary of crucial 1961 events, including the freedom rides.1091 2011-09-28 “When we looked into the brine resource, what we found was not only lithium, but manganese, zinc and about half the periodic table of the elements,” said Mr. Erceg, referring to it as “a smorgasbord of products.”At this point, he said, the only ones that make good economic sense to recover are the lithium, manganese and zinc.Extracting lithium from brine is a standard way to produce the metal. The only American lithium producer, Chemetall Foote, in Clayton Valley, Nev., makes the material by pumping brine into ponds and waiting months for the water to evaporate. Two other companies have announced plans to produce lithium in Nevada using the more conventional method of evaporation.Simbol officials say they have developed a proprietary filtering process that takes minutes and will be located on piping that is a minor detour for brine that the geothermal energy company is pumping anyway. Costs are low enough to compete in the world market, company officials say, and environmental impacts are small since the geothermal plant is already in operation.Robert L. Jaffe, a physics professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the co-author of the American Physical Society report, said that extraction of lithium with a filtration system would be a new development, and that it remained to be seen if lithium could be captured that way at a price that would be competitive with the big producers in Chile and Argentina.The plant will process 5,000 to 6,000 gallons of water a minute, and in the same period will produce 10 to 20 gallons of salts that include the marketable metals. Since last October, Simbol has been running a modest pilot plant that filters about 20 gallons a minute, Professor Jaffe said. The brine from the Salton Sea contains lithium in a concentration of 200 to 400 parts per million, and the extraction technology is about 93 percent efficient, he said.The biggest lithium producers are Chile, Australia, China and Argentina. The element is used in metals, pharmaceuticals and, increasingly, lithium-ion batteries, which would be a major source of demand for lithium if electric cars or plug-in hybrids became popular.The future of the automotive battery market remains uncertain. President Obama set a 2015 goal of one million plug-in vehicles, which would include pure electrics as well as hybrids, but industry executives say they think the target will not be reached by then. The Chevy Volt and the Nissan Leaf went on sale this year, but sales so far are in only the low thousands. Worldwide sales could be far higher, but that is not certain yet either.At the World Energy Council, a London-based trade association of energy producers, Stuart Neil, a spokesman, said that lithium was not as critical as materials like neodymium, but that “if the amount of lithium available on the market increases, this should lower cost and therefore has the potential to increase the penetration rate of electric vehicles.”1092 2011-09-28 Manchester United collapsed at home against Basel before salvaging a 3-3 draw in its second group game in the Champions League. After throwing away a 2-0 halftime lead, the three-time champion United required Ashley Young’s 89th-minute header to recover a second successive draw in Group C. It was a worse night for its big-spending neighbor Manchester City, which lost at leader Bayern Munich, 2-0, and had its star striker Carlos Tévez refuse to come in as a substitute.Real Madrid swept aside visiting Ajax, 3-0, after goals from Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaká and Karim Benzema in the Group D meeting of two teams with 13 European Cups between them. Inter Milan picked up its first points in Group B after Mauro Zarate clinched a 3-2 win at CSKA Moscow.¶ Barcelona says it has recently met with Nike officials to complain about new shirts, which the team contends absorb so much moisture they take on added weight over the course of a game. The Spanish newspaper El Pais first reported claims from Barcelona players that the shirts more than doubled in weight by halftime. Nike said in a statement that it was “working to find a solution to the problem with the shirts along with the club.”1093 2011-09-28 Kaiser estimates that one to two percentage points of the increase this year is related to provisions of the law already in effect, like coverage for children up to 26 years old and for prevention services like .New York, along with states including , and , has been exercising its regulatory muscle to try to tamp down some of the increases. The Obama administration this month funneled a total of $109 million to many states, in part to help fight against “unreasonable” increases.The increases now under consideration in New York would affect 1.3 million of the 3 million residents in individual and small-group plans; the amounts vary considerably depending on the type of policy. The increases requested by Aetna, for example, range from 8.9 percent to 53.6 percent, while those from United Health Group/Oxford range from 13 percent to 34 percent, according to the State Insurance Department.The state’s power to deny increases does not extend to rates for large employers; the Kaiser survey included large and small company policies, which cover about 60 percent of working-age Americans with . Employers, on average, pay the bulk of premiums and absorb some of the increase each year while passing the rest onto workers.The increase in premiums was striking because in a poor economy, many people put off going to doctors, to avoid co-payments and higher deductibles. Despite a decrease in the use of medical services, companies have defended higher premiums — and their high profits — reasoning that their costs would rebound once the economy recovered.Insurers also say that the use and price of medical services have continued to rise in individual and small-group plans, in part because those policies tend to have a higher proportion of people with serious illnesses. If the survives legal challenges and goes into full effect in 2014, increased competition will make it tougher for companies to charge those customers more, the administration says.Aetna and United Health/Oxford said their requested rate increases in New York largely reflected actual hospital, physician and pharmacy costs. “Our rate requests are simply keeping pace,” said Maria Gordon Shydlo, a spokeswoman for United Health Group/Oxford, which secured rate increases of 18 to 24 percent last year.Consumer advocates contend that the latest requests exceed any documented rise in costs, with some companies enjoying three years of record profits and paying millions of dollars in dividends and .“We’re at a watershed moment,” said Elisabeth Benjamin, who represents Health Care for All New York, a group of 100 organizations advocating affordable care. “The Cuomo administration has to decide, will the Department of Insurance stand up for the little guy, John Q. Public, or let the insurance companies get away with this nonsense?”Since last year, the Insurance Department has posted more than 4,000 policyholder objections online. In one typical letter, a small businessman, citing six years of annual increases of more than 15 percent, raged, “There are no words to express how utterly greedy and unconscionable another double-digit increase in health care costs are to the world of small companies and those employed by them.”Such messages are not lost on Benjamin M. Lawsky, the state’s superintendent of financial services, who oversees the department. “We get it,” he said. “These increases are often hitting people who just can’t afford it.”“At the same time,” he added, “we have to make sure these companies stay healthy. What keeps us up at night is the need to strike a responsible balance.”Decisions are expected in October. In the first round of reviews late last year, on premiums that took effect Jan. 1, the department approved a 10 percent increase, on the average, reduced from requests averaging 14 percent. Mr. Lawsky said the result showed the system was working.But to Leslie Moran, senior vice president of the New York Health Plan Association, an industry group, the result confirms that under the new law, the process bows to political pressure, not actuarial reality.“There was an effort to somewhat artificially suppress premiums to prove that the prior approval system was working,” she said, noting that New York requires at least 82 percent of premium revenue be spent on paying medical claims. (Nationwide, under the new health care law, the minimum is 80 percent.)One company, MVP Health Care — asked about its highest rate increase requests: 40 percent, 55 percent and 56.8 percent in three plans in — said the requests had been made in error and were withdrawn last week. Gary Hughes, a company spokesman, said the plans had 805 policyholders and MVP intended to drop them at the end of the year. It was not clear what those customers would do.Such changes can leave regulators with little recourse. Allan Evans, a musicologist who was undergoing for lymphoma last year, was notified that his Emblem Health premium would increase 270 percent, to $2,293 a month for his family’s $5,000-deductible policy, provided through his wife’s business, a small Italian language school in Greenwich Village. Emblem had eliminated his family’s category and offered a more expensive plan. That kind of increase is not reviewable by the state.“We were in shock,” Mr. Evans, 55, said. What saved him, he said, was a change in his part-time contract at the that made him eligible for coverage.Ilene Margolin, a spokeswoman for Emblem, said she could not comment on an individual case, but added: “We lost tens of millions on some of those products. For some people, we reviewed if they were in the right risk pool. I’m not saying this is pretty, but there were actuarially sound reasons.”Although demand for care nationwide appears to be growing relatively slowly, insurers and benefit consultants also say prices for medical care continue to climb as drug makers and hospitals charge more. “If they’re a popular brand or anchor hospital, they’re going to negotiate a significant increase if they can,” said Edward A. Kaplan, a benefits expert with the Segal Company, which recently surveyed insurers about costs.Some analysts and companies are already questioning the high increase found through Kaiser’s survey, saying costs are slowing down and increases in premiums would probably be more moderate in 2012.Some small business say they expect their premiums not to rise as sharply, only because younger, healthier employees are keeping claims low. “Up until last year, we saw very hefty increases — double digits,” said Heather Gombos, an executive for R. M. Jones & Co. and affiliated businesses in New Britain, Conn., which insures about 50 of 80 employees.Family coverage is now running $12,000 a year, Ms. Gombos said, and she is waiting to see what increases are proposed for the coming year. “What it comes down to is good luck,” she said.1094 2011-09-28 Stiffer penalties will be imposed on British jockeys for excessive use of the whip after current rules were found to be a weak deterrent. There will now be a minimum five-day suspension for jockeys who do not adhere to whip limits. The previous minimum penalty was a warning. Use of the whip came under scrutiny after Jason Maguire struck Ballabriggs 17 times while winning the British Grand National in April. He received a five-day suspension.1095 2011-09-28 The new streetscape is the final step in a reimagining of a city icon.The Bloomberg administration banned automobiles from parts of the square in 2009 and installed pedestrian-friendly open-air plazas where traffic signals and exhaust fumes once reigned.The redesign, by the architectural firm Snohetta, would remove the final reminders that Broadway once carried vehicular traffic through the square. Curbs that still separate the sidewalks from the old path of Broadway will be flattened out, creating uniform, single-level surfaces for pedestrians that stretch from storefronts to the edge of Seventh Avenue, where cars still travel.The benches, besides offering a sturdy replacement to the flimsy furniture currently used on the plazas, would also divide the space between free-flowing walkways and a central area where visitors could congregate. In other words: tourists to one side, New Yorkers on the other.“The comment that one hears almost all the time is that New Yorkers, for the most part, don’t really like to be in Times Square,” said Craig Dykers, the principal architect at Snohetta. He hopes the design will allow for “different speeds at which people can move through Times Square.”George Haikalis, a member of the local community board, who reviewed the design this week, drew a comparison with the tongue-in-cheek cover of this week’s New Yorker, which imagines a tourist-only lane in Times Square teeming with camera-toting pedestrians and guarded by police officers. (Mr. Dykers said that in his design, the police officers would not be necessary.)The pedestrian plazas, when they opened in 2009, featured terra cotta-colored asphalt and colorful beach chairs, a look that was promptly lampooned by newspaper columnists and late-night talk show hosts. The space is currently covered with a splashy blue paint job that suggests the unfinished look of a swimming pool.“This simple, flexible design will clear obstructions and support the growing number of programs occurring in Times Square, which more than 350,000 people visit every day,” Seth Solomonow, a spokesman for the Transportation Department, wrote in an e-mail.A copy of the plan, reported by the Web site DNAinfo on Tuesday, was presented to the transportation committee of the local community board on Monday. Michael Keane, a member, called the design “subtle, a little bit understated.”“Much of the glory of Times Square is looking up at the marquees and the lights,” Mr. Keane said. “They wanted to find a way to balance that in their design, so we appreciated that.”1096 2011-09-28 The labor vote roiled the capital, where Mr. Cuomo’s aides waited barely two hours before announcing that they planned to proceed with laying off 3,500 workers. The administration said it would begin notifying most of those employees on Wednesday. The layoffs would amount to the largest wave of job cuts since the early 1990s, when Mr. Cuomo’s father, Mario M. Cuomo, was governor.“In this economic reality, rising state work force costs are unsustainable,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. Referring to federation members, he added, “I urge them to reconsider.”Mr. Cuomo’s advisers made clear that they believed Mr. Brynien and other union leaders were to blame for the rejection of the agreement. Howard B. Glaser, the director of state operations, said in a statement that the vote represented “a failure by P.E.F.’s leadership to effectively communicate the benefits of the contract to its members.”“Layoffs could still be avoided,” Mr. Glaser said, “if P.E.F. clearly articulates to its members the benefits of the contract as well as the consequences of rejection and schedules a revote.”Labor leaders spent the past several months trying to convince state workers that the concessions, including the first-ever furloughs and a requirement that workers pay a larger share of their health insurance premiums, were worth accepting in order to win some protection from layoffs. They were seeking to avoid the same fate as their union counterparts in Connecticut, where state workers in June rejected a labor deal, prompting a budget crisis.Mr. Cuomo’s budget, approved by lawmakers last winter, relied on $450 million in so-called work force savings. The governor said he would achieve those savings either through labor negotiations or broad layoffs, giving him significant leverage in his talks with workers fearful of losing their jobs.But some federation members were vocal in their criticism of the tentative agreement, which they said was overly painful and did not provide strong enough layoff protections in return for the concessions. Wages were to be frozen for the first three years of the pact, with raises of 2 percent in each of the following two years; the protections from layoffs would evaporate after the first two years.Mr. Brynien gave another example of what many union members considered an unfairness: the governor’s refusal during the legislative session this year to seek the extension of a temporary income tax surcharge on high-earning residents. That position put Mr. Cuomo at odds with other Democrats and labor.“The state should not be demanding this level of sacrifice from us while it’s not demanding those same sacrifices from the wealthiest New Yorkers,” he said.On the union’s Facebook page on Tuesday, some workers reacted to the vote by applauding their fellow union members for standing up to what they saw as mistreatment from Mr. Cuomo. Others said they were outraged that a majority had voted to reject the contract knowing that jobs were at risk.“I knew it would be close; I didn’t know which way it would go,” Kathy D’Arminio, council leader of Division 399, a branch of the federation in Binghamton, said in an interview. “I think people were unhappy with a five-year contract, people were unhappy with the furlough days. And the insurance premiums were another biggie.”“I think we need to get together and decide where we’re going to go,” she added. “We want to get back to the table as soon as possible.”Several hundred federation members were only days away from being laid off when the union reached its tentative agreement with the governor in July.But the layoff threat from Mr. Cuomo did not appear particularly intimidating to all federation members, many of whom hold white-collar jobs and tend to be more highly paid than the members of the Civil Service Employees Association.“They looked at it and said, why should I give up anything, and that’s a fairly compelling argument if you don’t care about the people losing their jobs,” said Edmund J. McMahon, senior fellow at the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a research group that favors reduced government spending.Mr. McMahon said he was not surprised that federation members rejected the contract, because state law locks in incremental pay increases after a public contract expires and before a new one is agreed upon. Preserving the status quo also locks in other aspects of the current contract, which expired at the end of March. And for the most part, he said, workers have a sense of whether their own jobs are at risk.“They all know where they are in the pecking order,” Mr. McMahon said. “They have a pretty good idea who’s going to lose their job, and most of them can say it’s not going to be me.”Mr. Brynien said he had asked Mr. Cuomo and his negotiators to return to the bargaining table and awaited their response. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, struck a note of sympathy with the union, saying that he hoped a resolution could be reached between the administration and the union.“I do not wish to see layoffs,” Mr. Silver said in an interview. “I would hope that something can be accomplished in avoiding those layoffs.”1097 2011-09-28 “Gay people have fought so long and hard to get these civil rights,” said Ms. Carmichael, 53, a filmmaker. “To have her basically telling us to get in the back of the line is just not acceptable.”Ms. Belforti is one of several town clerks who have said the state’s Marriage Equality Act, the measure approved in June that legalized same-sex marriage in New York, violates their religious beliefs. Two clerks resigned in July rather than comply with the law.Gov. , a Democrat, who made same-sex marriage a priority of his first year in office, has expressed little sympathy for clerks who object to the law. “When you enforce the laws of the state, you don’t get to pick and choose,” he said this summer. And the State Health Department issued a memorandum to clerks that refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples would be a misdemeanor.But compliance is being tested here in Ledyard, a town of 1,900 people on the shore of Cayuga Lake that has thousands of acres of corn and soybeans and not one traffic light.Ms. Belforti, a Republican, first won election as town clerk a decade ago, and thought she had a creative solution this summer to a vexing problem by agreeing to delegate the signing of marriage licenses.“For me to participate in the same-sex marriage application process I don’t feel is right,” she said. “God doesn’t want me to do this, so I can’t do what God doesn’t want me to do, just like I can’t steal, or any of the other things that God doesn’t want me to do.”The clerk’s office is open nine hours a week — Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday mornings. Ms. Belforti also does duty cleaning the town hall bathrooms. And she is a farmer, married with four grown daughters, who makes probiotic kefir cheese.A Protestant who worships at several area churches, Ms. Belforti read to a reporter a passage from the first chapter of Romans, which she says condemns homosexual activity, offering it as an explanation for her stance.“This is about religious freedom,” she said. “This is not about trashing gay people.”But Ms. DiBiaggio and Ms. Carmichael say it is discriminatory, and they are contemplating filing a lawsuit. The women, who have been together for 10 years and own a working farm in nearby Springport, declined Ms. Belforti’s request that they make an appointment and return later when they stopped by the Ledyard clerk’s office seeking a marriage license.Deborah Liu, the general counsel for the People for the American Way Foundation, which is working with a New York law firm, Proskauer Rose, on the case, said, “We totally respect everyone’s right to have their own personal beliefs.” But Ms. Belforti, Ms. Liu said, “doesn’t have the right to use them to relieve herself from doing a major part of her duties.”The issue has roiled this town, where Republicans slightly outnumber Democrats, and often on Election Day there are fewer voters than for a race for high school class president. Most of the town is farmland, but Ledyard also contains the village of Aurora, home to Wells College, an opera house and a lakeside inn where a one-night wine country getaway goes for as much as $813 per couple.In interviews last week, some residents applauded Ms. Belforti for standing up for her beliefs, while others said she should either sign all marriage licenses or find another line of work.“You get about a 50-50 split,” said Jim Wilcox, 42, who runs the white-clapboard Wilcox General Store and who got his own marriage license from Ms. Belforti a few years ago. He called the Marriage Equality Act “a long time coming” and worried that the controversy could paint Ledyard in a bad light. “We’d hate to be the ones who slowed down the wheels of change here,” he said.Another resident, Ed Easter, is now seeking to defeat Ms. Belforti in a write-in campaign when she is up for re-election in November. Mr. Easter, 40, who works in a wine tasting room, said he felt that someone needed to challenge her, rather than assuming the courts would eventually settle the matter.“The easiest way for her to go, and to settle this whole issue, is to take it to a vote — just vote her out of office,” he said.Ms. Belforti said she had no regrets. Her re-election campaign literature consists of a handout that trumpets her maintenance of nine different record-keeping computer databases and the town’s Web site. She also notes that she is facing a challenger, “because I have taken a stand on same-sex marriage.”“I’m totally at peace, because God comes first for me,” she said. “It’s not a question at all. If they want to get me out, you know, I’ve shown them what I can do for 10 years — if that’s not good enough and people want somebody else, that is their choice.”1098 2011-09-28 Speaking to reporters earlier this year, he said: “My wife was talking to me and saying: ‘Listen, get out of your comfort zone. Yeah, being governor of Texas is a great job, but sometimes you’re called to step into the fray.’ ”And now, one of the first flash points to ignite since Mr. Perry entered the Republican nominating fight is over the question of whether to vaccinate preadolescent girls against HPV, or the . The issue caught fire during a debate in Texas this month, when Mrs. Bachmann, of , and former Senator of attacked Mr. Perry, claiming that the decision to vaccinate children is best left to parents. Mr. Perry’s order was later overturned by state lawmakers.The Perry campaign would not say what role, if any, Mrs. Perry, 59, played in her husband’s actions regarding the vaccine, but her passions on the issue of combating HPV are known. In a keynote address given at a women’s health summit meeting two years before Mr. Perry’s executive order, Mrs. Perry specifically focused her comments on HPV.“There is no reason why knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer cannot be as common as information about childhood immunizations and ,” she said, according to a transcript of the speech on the governor’s Web site. “We are fighting for the well-being of women all over the nation and setting a standard for treatment that is unsurpassed. I am confident that through efforts like we’ve seen in Texas and the work at this conference, we will see the number of cervical cancer victims decrease.”Mrs. Perry’s name also surfaces as a catalyst in a cache of internal e-mails that reporters at Politico obtained last month through a Public Information Act request to the state for correspondence about the decision to vaccinate girls.Days after Mr. Perry issued the executive order, he forwarded an e-mail supportive of the vaccine to Mrs. Perry under the heading “fyi.” In a response, Mrs. Perry stated that a prominent Republican “told me at lunch today that she would help you with some conservative groups.” Mr. Perry then forwarded that e-mail to his deputy chief of staff, adding, “Fwd to the correct folks in the office.”Mr. Perry’s chief spokesman at the time, Robert Black, also indicated that Mrs. Perry’s views might have influenced the governor. “I know that they have discussed it, and it’s something they both feel very strongly about,” he told The Houston Chronicle in 2007, just after Mr. Perry issued the order and critics were calling on him to reverse it.The vaccination issue has found easy traction with social conservatives and Mr. Perry’s critics because, to them, it smacks of government meddling into private health care and taps into the suspicion that sex education promotes sex. And as Mrs. Bachmann’s comments show, some still adhere to the scientifically unfounded belief that are linked to mental disorders.Mrs. Perry, who would not be interviewed for this article, is described as a person who guards her privacy. She grew up in the small town of Haskell, near Paint Creek, where Mr. Perry was raised. Her parents still live in the area. After following her father’s footsteps into medicine, Mrs. Perry eventually became the director of nurses at Haskell Memorial Hospital, where she oversaw a crisis program.Although she no longer works as a full-time nurse as she did for 17 years — her husband’s political career came to define much of her time — she remains passionate about women’s and children’s health, associates said.And though she is described as being apolitical in her health care work, Mrs. Perry is not shy about hitting the road for Texas. She has frequently traveled as first lady to promote state tourism and on trade missions.Mrs. Perry often weaves personal stories — the Perrys have two adult children — into her material.Already, she has managed to change the skeptical mind of at least one influential conservative, Dick Bott, a radio broadcaster with 40 million listeners, who had been concerned that her stance on might not be conservative enough for his taste.“She explained that her father was a country doctor in West Texas who made house calls, and she said she’d help him,” Mr. Bott said in an interview. “She’s her own person.”She is a contract employee at the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, where she participates in fund-raising and development work. It was there that she met Ms. Mosbacher, whose husband, , who died last year, was secretary of commerce under the elder President George Bush.“I tend to be guarded, but Anita Perry was so warm and compassionate that I found myself opening up and sharing my story of my rape in during my sophomore and junior year at U.T., a secret I had kept for 30-plus years,” Ms. Mosbacher said. “She empowered me to speak out about my sexual assault and to help raise money for other victims.”The association did not take a public position on the HPV vaccine, said Annette Burrhus-Clay, the group’s executive director, although she added that she herself did support the vaccinations on a personal level.“We didn’t want to put her in a position to be advocating to the governor on policy issues,” Ms. Burrhus-Clay said of Mrs. Perry.But the HPV vaccine did come up once in Ms. Burrhus-Clay’s office in a quiet moment between the two women.“I just remember saying, ‘I’m sorry that the governor has taken so much heat on this because, as a mother, I totally agree with it,’ ” Ms. Burrhus-Clay said. “And she said, ‘Thank you, I think it was the right thing to do.’ ”1099 2011-09-28 Autumn is not only apple season, it’s also apple book season. The handsome “Apple Lover’s Cookbook” has a section covering 59 kinds of apples with a description and color portrait of each. A one-page rundown lists apples according to taste and texture; there is apple history, and summaries of apple festivals, apple products, ciders and apples by mail. The heart of the book gives savory and sweet recipes, including an adaptation of Michael Field’s chicken liver pâté with apple. And the challah baked with diced apples and raisins falls into the category of “Why didn’t I think of that?”1100 2011-09-28 In a statement, Sterling Equities, the family-run business behind the Mets, said it was “pleased that the court today dismissed 9 of the 11 counts in the Trustee’s complaint, and that the lone remaining count in which the Trustee seeks to recover payments from the Sterling Partners is limited to a two-year period.”In some ways, the decision gave Wilpon and Katz reason to hope they could survive financially and hold on to the team they cherish as something of a family trust.But it also left them to litigate further what the men had said hurt them most: the trustee’s assertion that they knowingly ignored repeated red flags that Madoff might have been up to no good, but failed to act because they had grown so used to enriching themselves with the profits from their Madoff investments.The 18-page decision — eagerly anticipated by both sides and the wider world of the vast Madoff bankruptcy proceedings — preserves the chance of a possible settlement. The sides had been ordered to submit to mediation with Mario M. Cuomo, a former New York governor, but had clearly been awaiting Tuesday’s ruling to see what would be left of the case to mediate.The Mets’ owners had been pleased to get the case moved from federal bankruptcy court, where it was first filed, to Rakoff’s district court. But they had also held out hope that he would dismiss the case entirely. Wilpon and Katz had called the trustee’s claims that they should have known about the fraud “fiction,” and they had accused Picard of twisting or inventing evidence.Rakoff did dismiss a variety of specific claims and legal theories raised by Picard. Still, he ruled that the trustee had produced sufficient — if “less than overwhelming” — evidence that the men might have indeed been blind to warnings about Madoff for that claim to go to trial.Rakoff even cited in his ruling the trustee’s assertion of one piece of evidence that showed the men had worries about Madoff: that Wilpon and Katz, after years of investing with Madoff, “seriously considered buying fraud insurance with respect to their investments in Madoff Securities.”But the optimism of the owners about the case winding up before Rakoff was rewarded in at least two significant ways.Rakoff ruled that Picard, in his effort to recover money from Wilpon and Katz, could pick over only a sliver of time from their long years of investing with Madoff. For example, Picard had claimed that the men had to return $300 million of what he called “fictitious profits” — the difference between what they put into their Madoff accounts and what they took out over six years of investing. But Rakoff ruled that only the men’s last two years of investing were vulnerable to Picard’s claim — a figure likely to be more like $80 million.Rakoff also disallowed a claim by the trustee that would have made it much easier for him to have pursued the return of hundreds of millions of dollars.Picard had argued that he did not even have to prove that Wilpon and Katz consciously turned a blind eye to possible fraud by Madoff, only that they had been aware of enough questions about Madoff’s operation that they should have investigated its legitimacy.Rakoff ruled that, as mere investors, Wilpon and Katz were under no obligation to investigate Madoff’s operation.“A securities investor has no inherent duty to inquire about his stockbroker,” Rakoff wrote. He added that if an investor was “simply confronted with suspicious circumstances” and did not investigate “the broker’s internal practices — and how could he do so anyway? — his lack of due diligence cannot be equated with a lack of good faith.”Although the scope of the case has been narrowed, it is still just one of several financial problems facing the Mets and their owners. They had a third straight losing season at Citi Field, attendance is faltering, and losses are expected to swell to $70 million this year from $51 million last season.As well, a deal to sell a minority stake in the team for $200 million to the hedge-fund manager David Einhorn fell through recently, leaving Wilpon and Katz having to raise the money from perhaps dozens of investors willing to put up a few million to $20 million each.But the Mets would probably feel satisfied if, through a trial or mediation, they end up paying the trustee only $80 million — a sum that Wilpon and Katz would probably be able to raise by selling some of their real estate and other assets, or even a stake in SNY, the cable network they control.1101 2011-09-28 The German analysis, shared by the Dutch and others in prosperous northern Europe, like the Finns, sees as the main problem the indiscipline and profligacy of others, especially in the south, like Greece, , Italy and Spain, which have run up high debts or fiscal deficits.To rebuild confidence, this analysis says, the sinners must repent, restructure their economies and fix themselves. The road to redemption requires hard work, discipline, sacrifice and pain, even punishment for previous misbehavior.Mr. Papandreou, acutely aware of this strain of thought and the threat it poses to Greece, sought on Tuesday to calm passions. “We must stop blaming each other for our different weaknesses and unite together with our different strengths,” he said in a speech to a business group in Berlin. “Even Germany depends on Europe, its biggest trading partner, for growth and jobs.”The problem with the German analysis, notes Simon Tilford, chief economist for the Center for European Reform in , is that it is not simply self-righteous, ignoring the bad German banks made to the troubled nations, but arguably wrong. It is “probably incompatible,” he added, with the survival of the euro zone, which all leaders insist is their aim.Growth is the key, the counter-argument goes, not austerity.Everyone agrees that countries like Greece need to cut their deficits. But if everyone is cutting at the same time, and in an uncoordinated way, the result may be a fierce economic for Europe as a whole. And without growth, there is very little hope of getting out of the “debt trap,” whereby more cuts in government spending result in recession, lower receipts and larger deficits.“If there is austerity everywhere, where is the engine for growth?” said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, professor of economics at the Institute of Political Studies in Paris. “If there is no consumption, no reason to invest, difficulty in accessing the market, where is the growth? The only engine that is functioning in this view is the engine of depression, and this will worsen the sovereign debt and deficit problem.”The Germans and northerners, Mr. Fitoussi said, still believe that austerity and recession eventually will lead to stability, confidence and growth. “But there is no way what the Germans are saying can be true without divine intervention or a belief in miracles,” he said. “No austerity program can lead to growth in a period of discontinuity in the global economy and slowing economic activity everywhere.”Mr. Fitoussi has just done a study of economic growth in , which is currently nearly flat, and which will have a growth rate of about 0.8 percent in 2012 if little changes, he said. “But if all the countries in Europe follow this austerity program,” Mr. Fitoussi said, France also will fall into recession, and its economy will shrink by 1 percent.Restructuring Greek debt will not solve its competitiveness problem, which could take 10 to 15 years, said Martin Kocher, a professor of economics at the University of Munich. “Greece will only be able to achieve higher levels of growth when it becomes more competitive again.”Mr. Tilford and others argue that countries like Germany, which benefit from very low interest rates given the panic about other countries’ sovereign debt, need to raise their economic activity and consumption, while the , which raised interest rates in July out of misplaced fears of inflation, should cut them again and pump more money into the euro zone.But such a policy runs against the German analysis of the problem and of the role of the central bank. And major institutional reform of the euro zone — like forming a common treasury — would require a sacrifice of sovereignty that seems to exceed the political appetites of Europe’s leaders. The German enthusiasm for further European integration seems to be waning, unless it is on German terms, which would mean no transfer of money from creditors to debtors.In recent days, European leaders have felt increasing pressure to deal effectively with the from the and , where financial markets took a beating last week on fears of contagion. Mrs. Merkel has had to expend considerable political capital to get even her own coalition and the German parliament ready to endorse the decisions of July 21, and a majority in her own coalition is not yet solid. She particularly wishes to avoid having to rely for a majority on the opposition Social Democrats and Greens, which would be a blow to her authority.But she has to get the measure passed. “Anything else would be a catastrophe for the government at this point,” said Gero Neugebauer, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin.Yet, those decisions have already been discounted by the markets and are being overrun by events. They will have to be quickly followed by others of a larger magnitude, or the crisis will return in greater force.“That such a moderate agreement is inciting and inflating so much ill feeling in Germany is very worrying,” Mr. Tilford said. “It casts doubt that in the next six to nine months Germany will move fast and far enough to keep the car on the road.”1102 2011-09-28 “Politically, Putin’s decision to return will reinstall a leader with the power to implement decisions and end an increasingly dysfunctional diarchy — if at the cost of hardening Russia’s ‘soft authoritarian’ image,” noted Cliff Kupchan, a senior analyst at the Eurasia Foundation.“Many observers have emphasized that Putin’s rule may extend longer than Brezhnev’s, and almost as long as Stalin’s,” he wrote in a research report, referring to Leonid I. Brezhnev, who ran the former Soviet Union for 18 years until his death in 1982, and Joseph Stalin, who ruled for 25 years until 1953.“Predictability will at least in the short-term reassure investors and improve market sentiment,” Mr. Kupchan wrote.Russia’s main stock index, the Micex, rose 2.5 percent Tuesday, the second day of gains after Mr. Putin’s announcement.“With less political uncertainty, the authorities may hope that capital flight eases and that some may return capital in coming months to take advantage of cheaper asset prices,” Charles Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance, wrote in a note for investors.Kingsmill Bond, an investment strategist with Citigroup in Moscow, published a research note over the weekend, “Return of the Master,” that suggested investors would be “pleased that the political uncertainty is over,” though noting that “there is little sign that Putin will adopt the radical change that some had hoped for.” In the short term, Europe’s debt crisis and oil prices will guide the market here more than domestic politics, he said.Not all economists share the view that less change is better. Laza Kekic, a former Soviet specialist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said Mr. Putin’s decision to run again for president was “a retrograde, and indeed farcical step, that is incompatible with economic and political progress in Russia” and that after this decision, the country was on the way to becoming a “third-world petrokleptocracy.”Clouding the picture somewhat of an authoritarian government able to impose its economic will, Russia’s long-serving finance minister, Aleksei L. Kudrin, resigned Monday after Mr. Putin’s announcement. Mr. Kudrin had become the symbol of Russia’s fiscal responsibility.Mikhail D. Prokhorov, a billionaire who was ousted this month as head of a right-wing political party, wrote in a blog that other economic liberals might follow Mr. Kudrin’s example and resign.“I think we are on the verge of very important, perhaps tectonic, shifts in the consciousness of the elites, including the power elites,” Mr. Prokhorov wrote.Other analysts note that companies and investors will now be able to price in political risks whose contours are not likely to change much, as Mr. Putin is poised to remain in power until 2024.“Western businesses work wonderfully with dictators,” said Mikhail G. Delyagin, an economist and director of the Institute of Globalization Problems, a research concern. “For them, it is hardly a matter of principle.”1103 2011-09-28 Mâche is a delicate green also known as lamb’s lettuce, and it’s now available in many Whole Foods stores and other supermarkets in the United States. It has a rich nutritional profile: It is very high in vitamin C, beta carotene, omega-3s and iron (it has even more than spinach). I love the contrast here between the mild, subtle mâche and the sharp, pungent garlic-spiked yogurt.1. Place the mâche in a salad bowl. Whisk together the lemon juice, salt and pepper, and olive oil. Toss with the mâche.2. Combine the garlic cloves with a generous pinch of salt in a mortar and pestle and mash to a paste. Stir in the yogurt. Add to the salad and toss. Top with any of the optional ingredients, and serve at once.Advance preparation: Serve this right after you toss it.Nutritional information per serving (4 servings): 73 calories; 1 gram saturated fat; 1 gram polyunsaturated fat; 5 grams monounsaturated fat; 1 milligram cholesterol; 2 grams carbohydrates; 1 gram dietary fiber; 13 milligrams sodium (does not include salt to taste); 1 gram protein1104 2011-09-28 ATHENS — The Greek Parliament voted late Tuesday to back a hugely unpopular new property tax, one of a series of new austerity measures, clearing the way for crucial international funding and staving off a looming default.The Socialist Party of Prime Minister George Papandreou won the vote, which was conducted by roll call, with all 154 ruling party lawmakers in the 300-seat Parliament expressing their support and one independent member backing the measure. A total of 142 members voted against the tax; three members were absent.The tax, which is to be applied annually through 2014 and will be added to electricity bills to ease its collection, is expected to raise 2 billion euros this year alone, according to government calculations. It will affect 5.5 million homeowners and cost the average family 800 to 1,500 euros, depending on the location and size of their property.The vote was widely seen as a test for Mr. Papandreou’s embattled Socialist party, which must in coming weeks pass bills for similarly controversial measures, like a plan to put 30,000 public workers on heavily reduced wages for the next 12 months. The plan has been condemned by Greek opposition parties as a back door to layoffs.The successful vote on Tuesday was a sign that the premier managed to rally Socialist lawmakers despite earlier protests by some and enduring rifts within the party over the government’s austerity drive.But public opposition to the new tax was clear Tuesday as a small but vehement group of demonstrators clashed with police outside Parliament during the vote.Opposition to other measures was also clear earlier Tuesday as thousands of public transport workers walked off the job in the latest in a series of 24-hour strikes protesting salary cuts and feared layoffs as state bodies are merged and abolished.1105 2011-09-28 In Act I, when the king’s hunting party gathers, complete with two impressively large dogs, a bit of abstraction is introduced through some sculptural gray trees. Jenny Tiramani’s costumes are colorful, detailed and true to the period. Too true. This Henry could have come from the set of almost any of the innumerable films and television shows that have been made about the Tudors.But the bigger problem was Marco Armiliato’s routine conducting. Mr. Armiliato has been valuable to the Met’s Italian repertory wing since his 1998 house debut. In “Anna Bolena” he conveyed an understanding of bel canto style, in which arching lines must be given room to spin and cast their spell, and accompaniment patterns have to be flexible.The singers seemed to feel supported by Mr. Armiliato, who was always there when they took liberties. That was the problem. This performance needed a conductor to instill some intensity into the , to keep the cast more on edge, especially in the early scenes. Much of the action occurs in highly charged bursts of dramatic recitative. But too often here the orchestra chords that buttress the vocal lines were listless. And the orchestra’s playing lacked character.Previously, Ms. Netrebko had sung the role of Anna only at the Vienna State Opera this spring. She started tentatively on Monday, perhaps settling in for the long, hard night of singing that awaited her. She looked regal and splendid. And in a nice directorial touch, Anna first appeared with a little red-haired girl, clearly her daughter, the future Queen Elizabeth.At 40, Ms. Netrebko may be in her vocal prime. Her sound is meltingly rich yet focused. Sustained tones have body and depth. Her contained vibrato exposed every slight slip from the center of a pitch, especially in midrange, but I’m not complaining. This remains a major voice, with resplendent colorings and built-in expressivity.Bel canto purists have long debated whether Ms. Netrebko is a natural to the style, especially in her execution of coloratura passagework. She may not have the nimble precision exemplified by (who was criticized by some for that very accuracy). Ms. Netrebko’s approach is to sing coloratura as a lyrical elaboration of the vocal line, which she did affectingly as Anna. And she exudes vocal charisma.Still, at moments throughout the evening her singing seemed cautious. She was at her best when sparring with other singers, especially the mezzo-soprano Ekaterina Gubanova, who was Giovanna (the queen’s lady-in-waiting Jane Seymour, though it’s best to stick to the Italian names, since “Anna Bolena,” with a libretto by Felice Romani, plays very loose with history). Ms. Gubanova has an ample, dark voice with a slightly hard-edged quality that takes some adjusting to. She sang Giovanna with incisive delivery, folding embellishments and runs into impassioned vocal lines.Her character was a bundle of nerves in Donizetti’s inspired Act II scene in which Giovanna finally confesses to the queen that she has been the king’s mistress and will become his new wife. Again the orchestra under Mr. Armiliato seemed to hold back, rather than empower, the intensity these two artists were trying to summon onstage.The bass Ildar Abdrazakov brought his earthy, muscular voice to the role of Enrico (Henry VIII). Though his passagework was muffled by his gravelly tones at times, he was an imposing presence, and he did not overplay the king’s brutishness.The tenor Stephen Costello won a hearty ovation for his Riccardo (Lord Percy, Anna’s former lover). This was a big assignment for the gifted and game young tenor. Mr. Costello captured the character’s consuming adoration for Anna through his impetuous and anguished singing.The role includes a touchstone tenor aria, “Vivi tu,” in which the condemned Riccardo implores his friend Lord Rocheford (Anna’s brother, here the solid bass-baritone Keith Miller) to evade the king’s wrath and go on living. Mr. Costello mostly navigated the music’s demanding passagework and exposed high notes. To hear this rising artist stretching himself was part of the excitement.The mezzo-soprano Tamara Mumford took on the trouser role of Mark Smeaton, a court musician with a fatal crush on Anna. Her singing was sometimes shaky but always honest and ardent. The able tenor Eduardo Valdes as the court official Hervey rounded out the cast. Every role is significant in an opera so rich with ensembles, including a climactic Act I sextet almost as memorable as the enduring sextet from Donizetti’s and more contrapuntally intricate.Mr. Gelb has said that ideally the Met should make an artistic statement by presenting an ambitious new production every opening night. Two years ago he took a chance on Luc Bondy’s ill-conceived staging of Puccini’s “Tosca.” Last season came the premiere of ’s production of Wagner’s “Rheingold,” which is still being argued over, as audiences await the last two installments of the complete cycle this season.“Anna Bolena” represented a different sort of risk. To make a case for this great, overlooked opera, a company must have a stellar soprano in the title role. Ms. Netrebko is that artist. If only she and her colleagues onstage had received more help from Mr. McVicar and Mr. Armiliato.The gala evening performance was relayed to Times Square and to Plaza, where there was seating for some 3,000 people who had scooped up free tickets earlier. After the curtain calls onstage, the “Anna Bolena” cast appeared on the Met’s outdoor balcony to the cheers of the crowd. This is becoming a welcome tradition under Mr. Gelb.1106 2011-09-28 Meanwhile, lawmakers in voted Tuesday to approve their share of the rescue fund’s guarantees. ’s Parliament is expected to reluctantly approve the fund measure in a vote on Wednesday, despite formidable domestic opposition. All 17 members of the euro zone must ratify the expanded fund, a process that has delayed its adoption.The Greek vote on the property tax was widely seen as a crash test for Mr. Papandreou’s embattled Socialist Party, which must in coming weeks pass bills for similarly controversial measures, like a plan to place 30,000 public workers on reserve status with reduced wages for the next 12 months. Greek opposition parties say the reserve-status plan is a prelude to layoffs.The vote indicated that Mr. Papandreou had managed to rally Socialist lawmakers despite enduring party rifts over the government’s austerity drive.But public opposition to the new tax was clear Tuesday as a small but vehement group of demonstrators clashed with police outside Parliament as lawmakers voted. In addition, thousands of public transport workers walked off the job in the latest in a series of 24-hour strikes protesting salary cuts and feared layoffs as state bodies are merged and abolished.The tax, which will apply to 5.5 million homeowners — or about 80 percent of Greek households — will cost the average family 800 to 1,500 euros (about $1,045 to $2,041) a year, depending on the location and size of their property. With unemployment at 16 percent, and average income only about 26,000 euros, it is unclear how many households will be willing or able to pay.Greek leaders, though, moved to assure their foreign creditors that they would keep promises to address the economic and political shortcomings that are the underlying reason the country cannot pay its debts without help.The Greek finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, said that auditors from the and the were due to return to Athens this week. Earlier this month, they left the country in what was viewed as a display of dissatisfaction with Greece’s progress on cutting the size of government and removing barriers to economic growth.Mr. Venizelos confirmed that the I.M.F.’s managing director, , whom he met with in last weekend, had requested written guarantees from the government on the timetable for the new measures and projected revenue. The measures include additional wage and pension cuts.Speaking to the in on Tuesday, Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the group of euro zone finance ministers, said talks had broken off this month because of difficulties “in finding common ground between what the Greek government was expected to do and what it was able to do.”Since then, the situation had improved, Mr. Juncker added, though he said it was too soon to determine whether Greece had met the conditions for its next round of emergency financing.Mrs. Merkel, meanwhile, said she was confident Greece would fulfill conditions set by international lenders, and promised that would be supportive.But she tempered her remarks by insisting that Germany was “not available” for further steps like jointly issued guaranteed by all euro zone members — an idea that Germany has staunchly resisted. And the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, ruled out an increase in the size of the euro zone bailout fund, though not necessarily an increase in its ability to borrow.The fund will have the power to buy European government bonds and recapitalize struggling . But some analysts have said the fund needs to be two or three times bigger to remove any doubts about its impregnability.Mr. Schäuble also said Tuesday that it was likely that the rescue mechanism would be further “enhanced,” though he would not give details. He said that any improvements to the fund would have to be done in an “efficient way” that did not overburden Germany and the six other countries with top ratings that are essential to giving the rescue fund a credit rating of AAA.Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the executive board of the , also seemed to offer cautious support for increasing the fund’s ability to borrow on open markets.“Markets want more,” Mr. Bini Smaghi said at a conference in New York. “We need to look at possible leverage.”In , the Japanese finance minister, Jun Azumi, suggested that his government might contribute toward a bailout effort for Greece if European leaders were able to devise a reasonable plan to calm market fears.Mr. Azumi said that he would “not rule out the possibility that would bear some of the burden” in a bailout, provided there was a plan “that involves a steady process and a reasonable amount of funds that would bring markets a sense of security over the Greek bailout.” He did not comment on how big a possible Japanese contribution might be.The German Confederation of Trade Unions took out advertisements in several big newspapers urging lawmakers to vote yes on the rescue package. “Our mothers and fathers built a peaceful from the rubble of the second world war,” the unions wrote. “It is our responsibility that we maintain a united Europe for our children and our grandchildren.”1107 2011-09-28 SYDNEY, Australia — Australia’s female soldiers will soon be able to serve in all front-line combat roles, the government announced on Tuesday.The move will make Australia one of a handful of countries that allow women to serve alongside their male counterparts in some of the most dangerous roles in modern warfare, including Special Forces units in Afghanistan.The announcement by Defense Minister Stephen Smith that the last positions that had remained closed to women — including the Special Forces, infantry and some army artillery roles — would be opened is the biggest shakeup of the country’s armed forces in more than a decade.Mr. Smith proposed dropping the restrictions in April amid the fallout from a series of military scandals at home and abroad. In the most notorious case, a male cadet at the elite Australian Defense Force Academy was caught streaming video of himself having sex with a female cadet to his friends via Skype without her knowledge.The move is supported by Prime Minster Julia Gillard, the country’s first female leader.“We have an Australian Army that’s been going for 110 years, an Australian Navy that’s been going formally for 100 years, and an Australian Air Force that’s been going for 90 years, and last night, we resolved to remove the final restrictions on the capacity of women to serve in front-line combat roles,” Mr. Smith said in the capital, Canberra. “In the future, your role in the defense force will be determined on your ability, not on the basis of your sex.”Women already play a significant role in the Australian military, which sent more than 2,000 troops to fight in Iraq and currently makes up the largest contingent of any non-NATO member fighting in Afghanistan. As of August, 335 women were serving on overseas operations, accounting for more than 10 percent of Australia’s fighting forces deployed overseas, according to the military.But while the military says that about 93 percent of positions are open to women under the current policy, many combat roles have remained closed. Under the new plan, which Mr. Smith said had been agreed upon during a cabinet meeting on Monday and which will be carried out over a five-year period, those remaining restrictions will be dropped. Australia will now join Canada, Israel and New Zealand as the only developed countries with no restrictions on women serving in front-line capacities.1108 2011-09-28 The pinot noirs from New Zealand threw acidity, sweetness, spice, mint and some funk at our palates. With this dish we are throwing those very same elements back at the wine.Red bell peppers filled with merguez, a musky, spicy, lamb sausage, are baked. A mix of mint, sweet currants, dusky cumin and pine nuts ramps up the seasoning. The peppers are finished with a yogurt sauce.The wines will not know where to turn, and they will be fairly matched.The peppers are fine served hot or at room temperature, though straight out of the oven they should rest about five minutes first. If your peppers are small, the recipe will give you enough filling for about nine, and you will have a platter that’s suitable for an autumn buffet.1. Slice the top half-inch off each pepper, discard the stems and finely chop the flesh of the tops. Remove and discard the cores and seeds. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet. Sauté the onion and chopped peppers on low until soft and starting to color, about 10 minutes.2. Meanwhile, place the rice in a small saucepan with 3/4 cup water. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook on low heat for 8 minutes. Stir the rice into the skillet along with the pine nuts, currants and 1 teaspoon cumin. Sauté briefly. Add the mint and season with salt. Remove from heat and add the wine.1109 2011-09-28 Fewer tap-dancing lambs? Less cannibalism? The creators of ''Silence!

Gruesome photographs taken at past festivals that show canine carcasses, some bloody and others cooked, circulated on Chinese microblogs, creating popular pressure against the festival, which was set for October.Pet ownership has grown rapidly among the Chinese, as has a greater consciousness of animal rights. In the Mao era, the Communist Party condemned pets as a byproduct of bourgeois decadence. But these days, dogs and cats (and all manner of creatures, including rabbits and birds) have become accouterments of Chinese middle-class living. What was once slated for the pantry is now housed in a playpen.“I once had a pet dog, and I’m not a huge fan of dog meat,” said a 36-year-old man in Guangdong Province who is credited by a Chinese journalist with helping start the campaign against the festival on Sina Weibo, a popular microblog platform. The blogger declined to give his name and agreed to chat only over the Internet. “The reason why I posted that message online is very simple — that is, I don’t want to see dog lovers’ feelings get hurt,” he said.Other grass-roots animal-rescue efforts have also gotten results. Last April, a man spotted a truck on a Beijing highway that was packed with more than 500 dogs being shipped to slaughterhouses that supply restaurants in northern China. The man put out a call on the Internet to stop the vehicle, and soon it was blocked by more than 200 people; the crowd rescued the dogs after paying $17,000.1121 2011-09-29 Animals Are Outside Today...1122 2011-09-29 Leland Bobbé spent many hours observing the streets of New York in the 1970s, and he captured the city’s grit on film....1123 2011-09-29 Leland Bobbé spent many hours observing the streets of New York in the 1970s, and he captured the city's grit on film....1124 2011-09-29 The government threatens to suspend production at factories that cannot resolve problems....1125 2011-09-29 The government threatens to suspend production at factories that cannot resolve problems....1126 2011-09-29 A student group at the University of California, Berkeley, protested affirmative action with a campus bake sale on Tuesday....1127 2011-09-29 A student group at the University of California, Berkeley, protested affirmative action with a campus bake sale on Tuesday....1128 2011-09-29 Nationwide Mutual Insurance agreed to pay a 90 percent premium for the Harleysville Group, an insurance provider for small and midsize businesses....1129 2011-09-29 Nationwide Mutual Insurance agreed to pay a 90 percent premium for the Harleysville Group, an insurance provider for small and midsize businesses....1130 2011-09-29 Redfin has added a tool that provides performance data on real estate agents....1131 2011-09-29 The car, campaigned in 2008 by Giancarlo Fisichella, had its engine removed and its body painted by Dexter Brown....1132 2011-09-29 Mr. Cuomo’s office said the first layoffs would take effect in three weeks. The hardest-hit agencies would be the Office of Mental Health, with 643 layoffs; the Department of Correctional Services, with 446; and the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities, with 386.Federation members around the state reacted with strong opinions to the contract results, which were announced on Tuesday after voting took place by mail over the last few weeks.On the union’s Facebook page and in the comment sections of political blogs, union members debated the worthiness of the contract and, now that it has failed, whether there should be a revote. The outpouring of comments was so vast, and so impassioned, that The Times Union of Albany posted on its political blog what it described as a “Post-P.E.F. comment civility guidelines reminder.”In Albany, A. J. Khan, a research scientist, said in an interview that he was worried for one of his colleagues who was likely to be laid off. “She has two kids, and she has a house and a mortgage,” he said. “It’s tough.”But Charla Anderson, 43, a public health representative in Albany who has worked for the state for 17 years, said she was glad union members rejected the contract. She blamed the union’s leaders for agreeing to a proposed deal that demanded workers make what she viewed as overly harsh financial sacrifices, like paying higher health insurance costs.“I mean, it’s sad — I don’t want to say I’m hardened against people who are going to lose their jobs,” she said. “By the same token, I have kids to feed, and when you have kids to feed, and I can’t bring my child to a doctor because the co-pays are too expensive, what do you choose? I need to take care of my family.”Another union member who opposed the contract, Simon Kourounis, 44, a civil engineer for the Department of Transportation, said he faulted the governor for not seeking to extend a temporary income tax surcharge on high-earning New Yorkers.“I’m glad that we stood up to him, 100 percent,” said Mr. Kourounis, who lives in Flushing, Queens. “I feel bad for anybody who’s going to lose their jobs because of his tactics. But it’s not our fault; it’s his tactics.”He added: “We all know he wants to run for president. You start laying off union people, who do you think is the backbone of this country? It’s unionized workers.”Federation officials said they believed that under a law governing public employee labor negotiations, Mr. Cuomo had no choice but to return to the bargaining table.But labor experts said Mr. Cuomo would be hard-pressed to make significant changes to his agreement with the federation, given that the largest union of state workers, the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents 66,000 state workers, had already accepted the proposed wage and benefits concessions.“If one deal is clearly more valuable than the others, that’s probably untenable,” said Rebecca Givan, a professor of labor relations at Cornell. “We would expect C.S.E.A. to ask for something equivalent.”1133 2011-09-29 Interest rates must eventually rise, to prevent inflation and the decapitalization of the United States through low savings and capital outflow. This will raise the cost of capital compared with labor, which would put millions back to work. Normalization need not cause a recession, although it may slow growth in some emerging economies.But the return to conventional monetary policy would deflate the asset bubble and reduce corporate profits. That’s almost bound to cause a major bear market in stocks, with the Dow heading toward 3,600. Investors, both individual and institutional, will squawk, but those newly restored to employment may rejoice to see, in Churchill’s words, “finance less proud and industry more content.”Spring is in the air in Santiago, but the Chilean winter is still in season. Huge street protests over education are expected to resume on Thursday. As easy as it may seem to lump these with unrest elsewhere, Chile’s unrest is different. Fundamentally, it is a test of the economic model that has made the nation Latin America’s shining star.Chile’s educational system reflects the country’s philosophical preference for private, market-based — rather than public — solutions to social and economic problems. After the brutal dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Chile embarked on a free-market path unlike any of its neighbors’.This has mostly served Chile well. In 1990, per capita G.D.P. stood at $5,000 a year, on a purchasing power parity basis, in line with the rest of Latin America. Today it’s close to $20,000, some 50 percent ahead of the region, calculates Banchile, a brokerage firm. In that sense, the education debate is a developed world problem. The question isn’t whether Chileans go to school, but rather the quality of instruction they receive.Yet here the Chilean model hasn’t delivered, in ways that could hamper future growth. The country ranks well below the average of members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in reading, math and science scores, despite households shouldering more of the cost of education than in any other nation. Growth in productivity has been declining for years. Anecdotally, employers complain of a work force unsuited to their needs.It’s hard not to see Chile’s application of free-market principles to learning as part of the problem. It has created a stratified system where fewer than half of high school students attend public schools because of their low quality. And despite Chile’s financial gains in the post-Pinochet era, the government has been slow to add new public universities.As a result, protesters want to abolish the profit motive entirely from education. For the center-right government of Sebastián Piñera, the country’s billionaire president, that would be a repudiation of the laissez faire principles on which Chile’s success is based.But polls show most Chileans favor educational overhaul — and that Mr. Piñera is the least popular Chilean leader since Pinochet. Put it all together, and the price of thawing the Chilean winter looks evident: sacrificing a wee bit of free-market ideology.1134 2011-09-29 “Ex-A.I.G. Chief Hosts Perry Fund-Raiser” (The Caucus blog, The New York Times on the Web, Sept. 20) suggests that Maurice R. Greenberg was somehow responsible for the federal government’s bailout of A.I.G. in 2008. It also suggests that the bailout was somehow related to accusations the New York attorney general leveled against Mr. Greenberg a few years earlier.Mr. Greenberg retired as chief executive of A.I.G. in 2005 after Eliot Spitzer, then attorney general of New York, threatened to indict the company unless A.I.G.’s board of directors forced out Mr. Greenberg. No financial services company — especially one in a heavily regulated sector such as insurance — can survive a corporate indictment.At the time of his retirement in March 2005, Mr. Greenberg had led A.I.G. for more than 35 years. A.I.G. operated in over 130 countries and employed approximately 92,000 people. It had a market capitalization of $170 billion, and its stock traded at $64 a share.It was the successor management that destroyed A.I.G. and made it a ward of the state by abandoning successful risk management procedures and increasing A.I.G.’s writing of credit default swaps on toxic subprime-linked mortgage securities.A.I.G.’s extensive subprime-linked mortgage exposure led directly to its near collapse in September 2008, and the Bush administration’s decision to provide to A.I.G. billions of dollars of support. None of the allegations leveled against Mr. Greenberg in 2005 related in any way to those reckless business practices.Most of Mr. Spitzer’s unrelated allegations from 2005 have been dismissed or abandoned. The remaining two issues — relating mostly to A.I.G.’s reinsurance businesses — concern unrelated transactions in 2000 and 2001 and are still in litigation.1135 2011-09-29 Iran announced the mass production of a new cruise missile on Wednesday, the latest in a series of belligerent-sounding proclamations from that country in the face of its increased isolation by a Western-led group of nations worried about Iran’s nuclear program and avowed hostility toward Israel. Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi, Iran’s defense minister, said the new missile, first unveiled a month ago and known as the Qader, which means able in Persian, had been mass-produced “as quickly as possible,” the country’s state-run media reported. The missile, designed to destroy warships and coastal targets, has a range of about 125 miles, the news media said.1136 2011-09-29 “I think students should have unfettered access to the library,” said William Fitzhugh, editor of The Concord Review, which publishes history papers written by high school students, adding that many children already spend too much time on the Internet.Phil Goerner, a Silver Creek librarian, said the focus on banned Web sites encouraged students to wrestle with the thornier issues of censorship. He asked his students to consider whether schools should block sites espousing neo-Nazi or racist ideas. “It makes them think about it in deeper ways than if they were just to say, ‘No, don’t block it,’ ” he said.Mr. Goerner said he decided to organize the graffiti debate as a reminder to students that censorship takes away a person’s voice or, in this case, online privileges. Silver Creek unblocked many social media sites, including Facebook and Twitter, two years ago after recognizing that they could provide learning opportunities, he said.Similarly, New Trier High School stopped blocking many sites this year after teachers voiced concerns that the filtering had grown oppressive.Entire categories of Web sites had been blocked, including those that involved games, violence, weapons, even swimsuits, said Judy Gressel, a librarian. “It just got to the point that it became hard to conduct research,” she said, adding that students could not read sites about, say, military weapons for a history paper.Deven Black, a librarian at Middle School 127 in the Bronx, also said that filters had blocked a range of useful Web sites. YouTube and personal blogs where educators share resources can have value, he said. “Our job is to teach students the safe use of the Internet. And it’s hard to do that if we can’t get to the sites.”New Canaan High School, in Connecticut, cut off all access to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter just for the day to show solidarity with schools without access.“It’s not even lunchtime, and I’m already dying,” said Michael DeMattia, 17, a senior, who carries a laptop to school.In his Advanced Placement Biology class, where lab groups have created a Facebook thread to collaborate and share data, he could not log in. In honors comparative literature, his classmates were unable to show a YouTube video during a presentation.The Internet, Michael said, has “made cooperation and collaboration inside and outside of class much better and faster,” adding, “It’s really has become an integral part of education.”1137 2011-09-29 IT has been three years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the start of a financial crisis that still casts a dark cloud over the global economy.Governments, both rich and poor, urgently need a way to calm speculation in the financial markets and to raise revenue. On Wednesday, the European Commission president, José Manuel Barroso, proposed a tax on financial transactions. Such a measure, already supported by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is long overdue.Indeed, a tax of just 0.05 percent levied on each stock, bond, derivative or currency transaction would be aimed at financial institutions’ casino-style trading, which helped precipitate the economic crisis. Because these markets are so vast, the tax could raise hundreds of billions of dollars a year globally for cash-strapped governments and could increase development aid.The global economic storm may have sprung from the high-pressure trading rooms and overheating economies of developed countries, but its effects have also been felt far away. Any additional revenue raised by a financial transaction tax should therefore be devoted not only to shoring up slumping economies in rich nations but also to helping the world’s poorest countries.While the rich world remains preoccupied with its own economic problems, the World Bank estimated last year that 64 million people in low- and middle-income countries had been forced into extreme poverty — living on less than $1.25 a day — as a result of the food, fuel and financial crises. And poor countries have been hit by their own budgetary pressures. Cuts to life-saving health services, schools and support for poor farmers are already taking place. Research for Oxfam last year suggested that 56 low-income countries faced a combined budget shortfall of $65 billion as a result of lower domestic tax revenues, export earnings and aid. If the world economy dips for a second time, the consequences are likely to be devastating.1138 2011-09-29 Arne Svenson and Ron Warren’s 2002 book, “Sock Monkeys,” effectively elevated the status of a simple toy, showcasing 200 portraits of sock monkeys. Their new book aims to do the same thing for dog toys.“Chewed” (Ideal World Books, $24.95) features 140 color photographs taken by Mr. Svenson of lovingly destroyed canine playthings. There was just one criterion: every item had to have — or have had — a face.“They still have personalities, despite being transformed by the dog,” said Mr. Warren, who is the director of and a partner in Mary Boone Gallery. (There were a few exceptions, like a plastic hot dog and a shoe, Mr. Svenson said, but all the items were things that were loved but had been discarded. “And they had such importance at one time,” he added.)Neither Mr. Svenson nor Mr. Warren have dogs, so the toys were contributed by friends like William Wegman (a bear that belonged to his first dog, Man Ray, and now has more duct tape than fur) and Todd Oldham (whose dog Ann “takes the eyes off everything,” Mr. Svenson said). The book also includes essays and stories by Isaac Mizrahi, Roz Chast, Augusten Burroughs, Maira Kalman and others.

As a team, we’ve been together so long that we trust each other’s skills and have full confidence in one another, so going into the game we just didn’t worry about what they do, but focused on ourselves, as that is all we can control.Q. Did the team focus on or prepare more for the games against Russia and Italy, where winning was more realistic?MACDONALD Not at all. We had a plan of taking every match one game at a time. From our outcome after the Ireland match, you can see we prepared for it like we were going to win, and our performance reflected that. As the games went on, we showed that we prepared for every team to the best of our ability, as in this competition you have to respect every team.Q. Do you find representing the United States at the World Cup to be a positive experience, despite possibly being on the wrong end of a blowout?HAWLEY Australia is ranked in the top 3 teams in the world, and the U.S.A. is currently 17th. There is a bit of realism that comes to play when we talk about competing with these kinds of teams. All their players are full-time paid professional rugby players, while more than half of ours still have day jobs in some other field.Like most athletes, you play for moments, doesn’t matter how short or long they are, but a great moment will last forever. And doing that on a stage while representing your country has no better feeling.MACDONALD Massively positive. At any point in time that you get to represent your country, it’s a great honor and achievement. Luckily for us we were able to represent the U.S.A. on such an historic day, 9/11.  The fact that we are also on the world stage makes it feel that more special.Q. Would you like to see the number of teams at the World Cup reduced to improve the overall quality?MACDONALD Not at all, due to the fact that the so-called minnows have done well throughout the tournament, giving the top teams a real go. One to two World Cups ago, the lower teams were getting blown out close to triple digits, and this time round shows the progression that these teams have made, and that no team can be taken lightly.Q. What do you see as the main benefits from the United States participating at the World Cup?DALLEN STANFORD, TEAM MEDIA MANAGER The R.W.C. is the third largest sporting event in the world, with the Eagles given an opportunity to represent the United States on the biggest rugby stage. The team may not be ranked inside the top 15 teams in the world, but played with so much passion and spirit that they have won over thousands of supporters. The tremendous growth of rugby in America is aided by competing at the R.W.C., with this increased exposure helping our goal of “inspiring America to fall in love with rugby.” These are exciting times for rugby in this country, especially with rugby’s inclusion in the Olympics, the success of the USA 7’s team in the Sevens World Series, and 350,000 youth kids starting to play the game.1140 2011-09-29 South Africa’s failure to issue a visa to the Dalai Lama, or even respond to his repeated requests for one, was sharply criticized on Wednesday by the Dalai Lama and by Desmond Tutu, the former Archbishop of Capetown. The two men called the failure disrespectful.The Dalai Lama wants to travel to South Africa to attend an 80th birthday party on Oct. 7 for Archbishop Tutu, a fellow Nobel laureate and anti-apartheid champion.The criticism — made in unusually blunt language by two icons of peaceful dialogue — did not address the reason for the official inaction. But it has been clear for some time that the South African government is reluctant to grant the visa for fear of angering China, one of the country’s most important trading partners and an increasingly prominent investor in the country.China says the Dalai Lama, the 76-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader in exile, is a subversive agent of independence for Tibet, which China regards as part of its territory. Though he fled Tibet more than 50 years ago when the Chinese military suppressed an uprising there, Tibetans still idolize the Dalai Lama as their leader, an allegiance that infuriates Beijing. The Dalai Lama, who lives in India, has said he does not favor Tibetan independence, but he has criticized what he has called China’s suppression of Tibetan culture.In their joint statement, reported by Agence France-Press, Archbishop Tutu and the Dalai Lama said South Africa’s handling of the visa request was “profoundly disrespectful of two Nobel Peace laureates who are among the most revered spiritual leaders on earth.”1141 2011-09-29 Despite this expository device, you have to know the story (Cocteau’s scenario is based on the Racine play) to understand the incestuous love of Phèdre (Agnès Letestu) for her stepson Hippolyte (Josua Hoffalt) and its tragic consequences. The movement is stiff and static, full of Greek-vase profile poses. Even the big jumps and turns in the male solos seem mired in Auric’s often-bombastic music. Phèdre and her confidante Oenone (Sabrina Mallem) pose dramatically; one bizarrely costumed set of corps de ballet groups follows another.It’s all very distracting. Perhaps Tamara Toumanova and Lifar, who danced the lead roles in the original production, achieved the pitch of dramatic intensity that you would need to make the ballet convincing. But neither Ms. Letestu nor her fellow dancers looked as if they remotely believed in what they were doing. Instead, they postured histrionically, they silently declaimed, all with an odd distance that could almost have been irony, but wasn’t. History was presented, nothing more.If “Phèdre” represents the past, “Psyché” doesn’t loudly announce its entry to the 21st century. Mr. Ratmansky, the American Ballet Theater’s Russian-born artist in residence, is perhaps ballet’s great hope. But those who were expecting high contemporaneity from his Paris commission were probably disappointed. “Psyché ” is a delicately wrought, traditional-looking piece that alludes to a romantic era of nymphs and cherubs, dancing flowers and animals, gods and mortals cavorting in enchanted places.But in the first moments of the piece — when diagonal lines of dancers, in peachy wisps of fabric, begin to move with a surprising, quick, upper-body twist as they open out their arms — Mr. Ratmansky shows the way he is able to use classical technique to his own remarkable ends. Throughout the 50-minute ballet, set to César Franck’s beautiful choral symphony (the Île-de-France National Orchestra and the Radio France choir, conducted by Koen Kessels, did it full justice), there is the through-the-body fullness of movement, the plasticity of the torso, and deep, weighted bending with which Mr. Ratmansky alters the dynamics of classical dance. Perhaps this is the future after all.Following Franck’s libretto, the choreography shows us episodes from the myth of Psyché rather than the full story. We first see the heroine (Aurélie Dupont) cast into a deep sleep by Venus (Alice Renavand), who is jealous of her beauty and whose son, Cupid (Stéphane Bullion), falls in love with her, but may not let her see his face. True love prevails, and along the way we get solos, pas de deux and ensemble dances of captivating charm and consistent invention.Ms. Dupont is a revelation, a poetic vision of beauty and fluid grace that renders invisible her technical strength. Also remarkable is Ms. Renavand, whose intensity and brilliance ring out, and the four Winds (Mallory Gaudion, Daniel Stokes, Simon Valastro, Adrien Couvez), who infuse their aerial, bounding dances with wit and humor. The costumes (by Adeline André) and sets (by Karen Kilimnik) are of a love-it-or-hate-it prettiness and expensiveness. Backdrops of enchanted forests, a castle, animals and flowers go up and down; a huge tree appears; flower petals fall. It verges on kitsch, but retains a sense of the fantastical and the marvelous. As does Mr. Ratmansky’s ballet, a distant cousin of the wonderfully whimsical “Namouna” that he created in 2010 for New York City Ballet and a coup de théâtre of the subtlest, most beguiling kind.1142 2011-09-29 Iran announced the mass production of a new cruise missile on Wednesday, the latest in a series of belligerent-sounding proclamations from that country in the face of its increased isolation by a Western-led group of nations worried about Iran’s nuclear program and avowed hostility toward Israel.Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi, Iran’s defense minister, said the new missile, first unveiled a month ago and known as the Qader, which means Able in Farsi, had been mass-produced “as quickly as possible,” the country’s state-run media reported. The missile, designed to destroy warships and coastal targets, has a range of about 125 miles, the media said.The announcement coincided with front-page headlines in a number of Iranian newspapers quoting the head of Iran’s navy, Rear Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, as saying he intended to deploy Iranian warships close to the Atlantic coast of the United States to reciprocate for the patrols in the Persian Gulf by the United States Navy’s Fifth Fleet. The patrols are a constant source of irritation to Iran.“Like the arrogant powers that are present near our marine borders, we will also have a powerful presence close to American marine borders,” the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying.The admiral gave no indication when such deployments might happen or how many ships he intended to dispatch. Nor was there any explanation of how the vessels, thousands of miles from home in unfriendly territory, might refuel or replenish supplies.1143 2011-09-29 “Everyone knows this was a good deal for the banks,” said Otmar Issing, a top German economist who served on the executive board of the European Central Bank. “It will not help Greece at all.”According to a person with direct knowledge of the debt swap, about 30 percent of the investors who are expected to participate in the exchange bought their bonds after July 21. They are not the original debt holders — mostly large European banks — but more speculative investors looking to cash in on the steep fall in Greek bond prices.The debt swap is expected to cover about 135 billion euros ($183 billion) in existing bonds, suggesting that various hedge funds and other investors have bought as much as 40 billion euros worth of Greek debt since July 21.The behind-the-scenes deal-making may be obscure but it helps explain why Chancellor Angela Merkel is having such a hard time persuading crucial German lawmakers to vote for the Greek bailout on Thursday.With people like Mr. Issing arguing that banks and other creditors have not been forced to contribute a larger share of Europe’s ever-rising bailout bill, it’s no surprise that politicians are worried about a harsh public reaction to the bailout. Mr. Issing contends that the owners of Greece’s debt should be required to take a roughly 50 percent write-down on their holdings as part of an “orderly” default that would reduce Greece’s overall debt burden, allowing it to meet its obligations without further borrowing.Under the current deal, Greece’s debt burden would be reduced to 122 percent of gross domestic product by 2015 — still leaving Greece with the highest debt load in Europe. Speaking Tuesday at a conference in Berlin that discussed the future of the euro zone, Mr. Issing shook his head in frustration, pointing out that in light of the recent collapse in Greek bond prices, some banks might even be able to book a loss that is significantly less than the advertised 21 percent.While not a member of the government, Mr. Issing is in many ways the leading voice of Germany’s economic establishment.But supporters of the Greek bailout say it is too late to change the terms and that any effort to alter the equation between Athens and its creditors could scuttle the whole carefully constructed deal. They also argue that many European banks holding Greek debt, particularly those based in Greece itself, are too thinly capitalized to absorb any larger losses now.Analysts say that further debt write-offs are likely to be delayed well into next year, after Europe has put in place a new financing system that could bolster the region’s banks.“You need to equip yourself with sufficient firepower — then you can talk about restructuring,” said Jean Pisani-Ferry, the director of Bruegel, a nonprofit economic research organization in Brussels.That the deal is a good one for banks should not come as a surprise.Greece had little input in setting the transaction terms, which were largely put together by representatives from the Institute of International Finance, a trade group for global bankers whose chairman is Josef Ackermann, the departing chief executive of Deutsche Bank.Defenders of the swap say that while it may not be ideal, it was the best deal that could be reached at the time. If hedge funds make some money along the way, they say, that is a small price to pay for securing a contribution from the private sector.Now that analysts are actually calculating the effect of the debt swap, that contribution is looking even more modest than originally advertised. Some estimate that most participating banks will experience losses closer to 10 percent or even less on bonds that are currently trading at a discount of around 60 percent.“It is a relatively attractive deal for the private sector,” said Cagdas Aksu, a credit analyst at Barclays Capital who has published a number of research notes on the exchange.That was well known among policy makers. Less understood, though, is how hedge funds stand to make out if the deal is completed and they swap the bonds they bought at 40 cents and below for bonds that, depending on several variables, could be worth 60 to 80 cents.Those speculating in Greek bonds are taking on well-documented risks, not the least of which is the possibility that the country will fail to reach a final agreement with the I.M.F. and the European Union and will not get the next portion of money needed to avoid default. But expectations are growing that Greece has done enough to secure the 8 billion euros ($11 billion) it needs next month and that the bailout mechanism to back up a longer-term rescue plan will win approval by the end of October as well.In that case, it will not be just officials from Washington, Brussels and Athens celebrating their success in staving off a Greek bankruptcy for a while longer. So will a lot of well-heeled hedge fund investors.1144 2011-09-29 American businesses stepped up investment spending in August despite the upheaval caused by bitter political fighting in Washington, and some economists raised their forecast for economic growth for this quarter.The Commerce Department said Wednesday that orders for capital goods outside of the military sector and excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending, increased 1.1 percent after falling 0.2 percent in July.That was well above economists’ expectations for a 0.3 percent rise and suggested that businesses, sitting on about $2 trillion in cash, had not responded to the recent financial market volatility by curtailing investment.“If we were in a recession we would expect to see business orders for capital goods plummeting and they are not,” said Richard DeKaser, an economist at the Parthenon Group in Boston.The solid rise in investment spending, which was accompanied by a 2.8 percent rise in shipments of capital goods, prompted some economists to raise forecasts for third-quarter economic growth.1145 2011-09-29 “We are today faced with the greatest challenge our union has known in all its history,” Mr. Barroso said in his annual at the in , . “If we don’t move forward with more integration, we will suffer more fragmentation. This will be a baptism of fire for a whole generation.”Leaders in and elsewhere played down speculation that they were working on bolder responses to the crisis, like a mechanism that would multiply the borrowing power of the bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility. Officials said they were preoccupied with gaining parliamentary approval for existing measures.But the euro zone countries face intense pressure from the , and other countries to more forcefully address the sovereign debt problem before the meeting of the leading economies that begins Nov. 3 in , France.“The euro area has been given an ultimatum to put its crisis once and for all behind its back over the coming six weeks,” Cailloux, chief European economist at , wrote in a note to clients.In an initial effort to impose more spending discipline on euro zone members and to prevent future crises, members of the European Parliament voted Wednesday in favor of rules that would impose fines on countries that broke budget and deficit rules.Members of the euro zone are supposed to hold their budget deficits below 3 percent of gross domestic product, and total debt below 60 percent of G.D.P., but few do.Under the new rules, countries that exceed those limits will be pressed to make a cash deposit — in an account that pays no interest — equal to 0.2 percent of G.D.P. If they still fail to rein in spending, they will forfeit the deposit.While finance ministers would still need to agree to punish countries, the voting system has been adjusted to make it significantly more difficult to block sanctions.In addition, national budget plans will come under greater scrutiny, and there will be an alert system to try to detect looming problems like the housing bubbles that helped create the debt crises in and .The German Parliament is scheduled to vote Thursday on the bailout fund, in what is seen as a crucial test for Chancellor .is scheduled to vote Friday. Still to vote are , , , the and Slovakia.There were indications that Slovakia’s Parliament might not vote until Oct. 25, although Beata Skyvova, a spokeswoman for the Slovak Parliament, said that one party in the governing coalition was pressing for an earlier vote and that more negotiations would take place before a final date was decided.That would be about three months after euro zone representatives agreed to give the rescue fund more money and power. The expanded fund will be able to lend up to 440 billion euros, or about $600 billion, and issue guarantees for 780 billion euros.Mr. Cailloux said that the fund needed about 2 trillion euros to be effective.Finland continues to demand that it receive collateral from Greece in return for aid to that country. But Finnish leaders argued that approval for the rescue fund, which will also provide aid to Ireland, and other countries, was a separate issue.That reasoning cleared the way for the to approve the bill Wednesday.Finland is still negotiating with its European partners on the collateral issue, and officials in have expressed optimism that a solution will be found to address Finnish sensibilities without undermining the aid package.Meanwhile, Greece moved closer to receiving the next installment of aid it needs to avoid bankruptcy.Officials from the , the European Commission and the were traveling to to assess whether to recommend release of the aid, said Amadeu Altafaj Tardio, a European Commission spokesman.During his speech to the European Parliament, Mr. Barroso said that changes needed to secure the euro’s future might require reopening the Union’s governing treaty. He reiterated that Greece would stay in the euro zone.Mr. Barroso confirmed that the European Commission, the union’s executive branch, would speed up a feasibility study on issuing euro — common debt that would be guaranteed by all members of the euro zone. He gave his clearest support to the idea yet.“Once the euro area is fully equipped with the instruments necessary to ensure both integration and discipline, the issuance of joint debt will be seen as a natural and advantageous step for all,” he said.“We need to complete our monetary union with an economic union,” Mr. Barroso argued. “It is an illusion to think we could have a single currency and a single market with national economic approaches.”Mr. Barroso also announced a proposal for a European on financial transactions, a move that Germany and France support strongly but that countries like , the Netherlands and say they would back only if it were agreed to at a global level. That is unlikely, given opposition from the United States.1146 2011-09-29 A vegetarian version of moussaka, this gratin has a tangy topping that’s much lighter than béchamel....1147 2011-09-29 Sensing - or at least fervently hoping - that it has a hit on its hands, Starz Entertainment, the premium cable service, announced Tuesday that it would renew the drama series, ''Boss,'' starring Kelsey Grammer, for a second season even before the...1148 2011-09-29 Iran announced the mass production of a new cruise missile on Wednesday, the latest in a series of belligerent-sounding proclamations from that country in the face of its increased isolation by a Western-led group of nations worried about Iran's n...1149 2011-09-29 South Africa's failure to issue a visa to the Dalai Lama, or even respond to his repeated requests for one, was sharply criticized on Wednesday by the Dalai Lama and by Desmond Tutu, the former Archbishop of Capetown.

The effects are said to last up to 15 minutes (depending on individual activity and playing style), which means the average player will need to apply it three or four times a game.The Court Grip formula is based on the same technology used on racecar tires and sticky notes, said Mark French, the product’s inventor and the president of Mission Basketball. The quick-drying solution does not make the shoe sticky but merely increases adhesion with the floor, allowing for better traction.The company has a licensing arrangement with the N.B.A. and intends to have Court Grip available in every arena this season (providing, of course, there is one). It will be up to individual trainers and players to decide whether to use it. Company executives are also trying to attract college programs.In doing so, Athletecare is challenging the virtual monopoly of another company, Slipp-Nott, whose sticky yellow pads have been a staple of N.B.A. sidelines for more than a decade. It is rare that anyone takes the court without first stamping on the Slipp-Nott pad. But Wade said the effects are short-lived (“a couple of seconds”), frustrating players.The other most common solution — which can also be seen every game — is players licking or spitting into their hands, then rubbing their soles. “It’s disgusting,” Wade said. “And this is like: You know what, we need to come up with something different.”Wade believes Athletecare found the answer. And executives at Athletecare boldly predict that Court Grip will push Slipp-Nott out of N.B.A. arenas.“My opinion: it will take probably six to 12 months for people to realize that it’s obsolete,” said Josh Shaw, Athletecare’s founder and president. “And I think spitting will be obsolete as well.”Jorge Julian, the president of Slipp-Nott, politely disagreed, saying, “The only way Slipp-Nott can become obsolete is if you get rid of dirt.” As for Wade’s contention that Slipp-Nott lasts for only a few seconds, Julian said it can last from 3 to 20 minutes depending on the court’s condition.Julian said his adhesive pads remained a player’s best option — they are placed near the scorer’s table, right in a player’s path to the court — and do not require any forethought.“You have to clean the bottom of the shoe one way or another,” Julian said. “The name of the game is to be able to do it quickly.”The battle for the soles of the N.B.A. is on.1181 2011-09-30 A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco refused Thursday to decide the constitutionality of the now-repealed “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, saying the issue has been resolved since gay men and women can serve openly in the armed forces. The court tossed out a lawsuit that had challenged the ban as a violation of civil rights. In doing so, it also dismissed a trial judge’s year-old ruling that the policy was unconstitutional. Dan Woods, a lawyer for the gay rights group Log Cabin Republicans, which filed the lawsuit in 2004, said he would ask the full Ninth Circuit to review the decision. The group recently argued that the lower court ruling, which also barred enforcement of “don’t ask, don’t tell,” should remain in effect despite this month’s repeal because future administrations and lawmakers could reintroduce a ban. The three judges disagreed, saying the case is moot because there is nothing left to challenge. The panel rejected the group’s assertion that it should decide the underlying constitutional issues to prevent future limits or bans.1182 2011-09-30 Kendall Square, the high-I.Q. neighborhood bordering the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, bears no resemblance to Hollywood. But a close look reveals one common element: a star-paved Walk of Fame, not for screen legends but for legendary innovators.Bill Gates has one; so do Thomas Edison, Steve Jobs and Mitchell Kapor, the creator of Lotus software. So far there are seven granite stars on the new Entrepreneur Walk of Fame — nothing close to the 2,000-plus on Hollywood Boulevard, but just wait.The creators of this Walk of Fame claim that the neighborhood — densely packed with biotech and information technology firms — has “nearly five times more start-ups per square mile than any other place on the planet today.”The celebrities spotted here tend to be of the Nobel laureate variety. Bill Aulet, who conceived the walk as managing director of the M.I.T. Entrepreneurship Center, said the point was to promote the culture of entrepreneurship.“It’s about the person who took an idea, risked it all, went out and created a company and in fact that company changed the world,” he said. “Society has to support and cherish these people.”There will be lesser-known honorees, like Robert Swanson, a co-founder of Genentech, an early biotech company. “He’s like the Babe Ruth, the Ty Cobb, the Cy Young of the biotech industry,” Mr. Aulet said. “People should know that story.”1183 2011-09-30 Loosely based on the fate of Errol Flynn’s only son, Sean (woodenly portrayed by Joshua Fredric Smith), a photojournalist who disappeared in Cambodia in 1970, “The Road to Freedom” is a bona-fide howler.Right from the get-go maintaining a straight face is impossible. Sean “had sex with countless beeyooootifool wimmin,” a grizzled fellow journalist (Tom Proctor) informs us in a weirdly accented (Clouseau? Kim Jong-il?), blessedly brief narration, while our hero prepares to comb the countryside for shots of the marauding Khmer Rouge. Soft-focus flashbacks to bedroom bliss with a Cambodian honey support this assessment, suggesting that Sean shared his father’s libido, if not his swashbuckling charm.No matter: “The Road to Freedom” adores him anyway. Clogged with grandiose pronouncements (“Whatever is going on here is bigger than you and me both”) and bleeding-heart speeches, this telling of Sean’s ill-fated journey drags us through miles of jungle and reams of stilted, soul-sucking dialogue. Idyllic brown families frolic in his path, and a sit-down with a Buddhist monk facilitates an orgy of clunky platitudes. Even after Sean and his colleague, Dana Stone (Scott Maguire), are captured by the Khmer Rouge, the film refuses resuscitation; instead, the prisoners go fishing — and, sadly, continue to talk.Shot in 2009 on location in Cambodia (where the then-20-year-old director, Brendan Moriarty, grew up), this starry-eyed, leaden-tongued film fizzles. David Mun’s photography is lush and lucid, but the script (by Margie Rogers and Thomas Schade) is nothing short of an embarrassment. “We came here to tell a story, and no matter what, that story needs to be told,” Sean lectures Dana in their jungle prison. Sheesh.“The Road to Freedom” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Angry guerrillas and lofty subordinate clauses.Opens on Friday in New York; Los Angeles; San Francisco; Boston; Chicago; and Austin, Tex.Directed by Brendan Moriarty; written by Margie Rogers and Thomas Schade; director of photography, David Mun; edited by Sean Halloran and Ms. Rogers; music by Austin Creek; production design by David Sandeep Robert; costumes by Nop Sophorn; produced by Tom Proctor and Blu de Goyler; released by Creative Freedom. Running time: 1 hour 33 minutes.1184 2011-09-30 The commissioner could have called in Inspector Bologna and sent him home as a captain, his last civil service rank; on the other hand, Mr. Kelly knows full well that there is surely more to Inspector Bologna’s life and work than five ugly minutes on 12th Street. (He ran a deli on , tried to become a schoolteacher during the fiscal crisis, and was a cop in the 72nd Precinct in during the years when buildings burned but he discovered, after a while, “that it wasn’t nearly as bad as it looked,” according to a profile in Downtown Express.)Before saying that the episode, which took place on Saturday at the end of a march against financial injustice, would be investigated by the complaint board, Mr. Kelly implied that the people who were sprayed had it coming because of earlier “tumultuous” behavior unseen by the video cameras.Mr. Kelly rarely strikes a note so badly off-key — but did so by seeming indifferent to what anyone could see on any computer. For all its contact with the public, his department has moved into new terrain.On “60 Minutes” this week, Mr. Kelly said that the Police Department had the capability to shoot down certain unspecified aircraft. In collaboration with the , the department has conducted wide-ranging surveillance on Muslims and specifically Moroccans in the metropolitan area, at times with no indication of a threat, according to reports by The Associated Press and by the blogger Len Levitt on NYPDConfidential.com.For more than a year before the 2004 in New York, undercover police officers infiltrated many law-abiding groups that were planning to demonstrate during the convention, creating thousands of pages of reports. The intelligence division filed reports on elected officials who were participating in “anti-R.N.C.” activities.Under David Cohen, a former C.I.A. official, the division created a database of the political views of people arrested during protests against the war in 2003.TO date, there has been virtually no scrutiny of this expansion of police powers, and Mr. Kelly and Mr. Cohen have said that the information is too delicate to make public.It may be highly prudent for the police to have the ability to shoot down aircraft, but who, for instance, would give the order?Until 2003, the Police Department had a small panel that included individuals from outside government to review plans for surveillance of people engaged in activities protected by the First Amendment. Today the only people on the panel work for the Police Department.Over the last decade, the number of police officers has shrunk about 15 percent, and crime has continued to drop. Working from scratch, Mr. Kelly created a counterterrorism force and an intelligence division to do for the city what the federal government was incapable of in September 2001: provide protection.Yet it has done so in a bubble of isolation from ordinary democratic processes. It exists in a world apart.Perhaps that is why no one in the department — even Mr. Kelly — has grasped that many decent people who support the police have been shocked by the videos of the pepper-spraying.Maybe that’s why neither Mr. Kelly nor his boss, Mayor , realizes that this is just the kind of thing that you say you’re sorry for.1185 2011-09-30 Kerim Yildiz, a leading human rights advocate for the Kurdish people, was for two decades a frequent visitor to the United States. A British citizen living in London, he regularly lectured at American universities, caucused with other human rights advocates and briefed government officials in Washington.But something changed. Where before he was admitted to the country without a problem, he has now waited nearly a year for the Obama administration to approve a visa. Officials have not explained the delay to him.“It’s a surprise,” Mr. Yildiz said this week in a telephone interview from London, where he is executive director of the Kurdish Human Rights Project. “I know no reason why my application is still pending.”Civil libertarians and human rights advocates in the United States have taken up his cause, and some suspect the government may be stalling for political reasons.The case echoes those involving Tariq Ramadan, a prominent scholar of the Islamic world from Switzerland, and Adam Habib, a Muslim academic from South Africa, who were barred from entry by the Bush administration under the Patriot Act. Their advocates contended that the men had been singled out because of their political views and criticism of American foreign policy.1186 2011-09-30 WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The federal government’s bank bailout program paid more than $9 million in legal fees to law firms that submitted questionable bills with little or no details on services provided, the agency’s watchdog said in a report released on Thursday.The special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program said auditors questioned $8.1 million of a sampling of $9.1 million in bills from four law firms paid by Treasury’s Office of Financial Stability.The firms submitted bills with either no descriptions or vague descriptions of the work performed, unsupported expense charges and administrative charges that were not allowed under their contract, the inspector general’s report said.The most striking examples of problematic bills were from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, the report said.“Simpson Thacher billed O.F.S. $5.8 million in fees and expenses with bills that provided no detail whatsoever as to the work performed,” the report said.1187 2011-09-30 “For me, I was still optimistic a year ago,” said Ali Sumari, a newspaper editor and film director who returned to Iraq in 2003 from Jordan and was a close friend of Mr. Mahdi’s. “Even during the sectarian war, I thought things would settle down. Nowadays, I am starting to fear that Iraq will never become a stable country.”In Iraq, where there is sometimes little distinction between a journalist, an artist and an activist, Mr. Mahdi, 45 when he was killed, hosted a popular radio show, becoming a powerful voice for those disenchanted with their government, often criticizing officials by name and receiving frequent death threats. He also produced films and wrote plays and columns, and became a leader of a small band of protesters who since February have gathered most Fridays at Baghdad’s Tahrir Square to protest against the government.Just as former political opponents of the government followed American tanks into Iraq, intellectuals did too, hoping to shape an architecture of ideas to buttress their new democracy. Their experience has been starkly different. The politicians returned to preside over a state, the journalists to suffer under tactics that they, and human rights activists, say mimic those wielded by the former government.In February, Mr. Sumari was arrested alongside Mr. Mahdi after a protest against the government in Baghdad. The two were beaten and interrogated and accused of being sympathetic to the Baath Party — the worst kind of insult in Iraq, especially for two men who had fled the country under Mr. Hussein’s Baathist government.“You can accuse me of anything, even of being a terrorist, but don’t call me a Baathist,” said Mr. Sumari. “You humiliate my humanity.”Those thinkers and writers who returned represented a powerful counternarrative to the exodus of this country’s educated middle class, many of whom have yet to come back, leaving a fissure in Iraq’s social structure between an often corrupt political elite and a vast underclass.Mr. Mahdi had fled to Syria and then Denmark, where his children remain. Mr. Sumari had been in Jordan. Another close friend, Ahmed Hussein, a newspaper editor, lived in Syria, Lebanon and Canada before the American invasion. He was a college mate of Mr. Mahdi’s in Baghdad, and introduced him to his first wife.When he returned, Mr. Hussein said: “I was very optimistic. I thought Americans were smarter than they turned out to be.”He had communicated on Facebook with Mr. Mahdi just hours before he was killed, discussing an upcoming protest. “Hadi was not only optimistic, but a dreamer,” he said. “He thought Iraq would become liberal and secular. Even until his last days he was dreaming this dream.”Other friends of Mr. Mahdi’s never left, and recalled jubilant scenes of reunion after the fall of the government on Mutanabbi Street, a bustling pedestrian thoroughfare of booksellers’ stalls that is a hub of intellectual life in the old quarter of the capital.“We were so happy to have him back in Iraq,” said Karema Hashim, a friend of his since the 1980s when they both worked in cinema and media in Baghdad. “And he was happy to be back because he thought it was liberated.”Ms. Hashim, who manages a fine arts high school in Baghdad, spoke recently outside a mosque during Mr. Mahdi’s funeral, near a table where men were setting out plates of fruit for the mourners. She was dressed in black, a tissue in her hand to blot out the tears. “I was so happy because all of my friends came back to Iraq,” she said. “We were full of power and ambition.”Now, she said, “Iraq is in its worst time. I know I’m going to get killed one day.”Another friend, Satar Muhsin, came to intellectual life after the fall of the government. “The best years of my life I wasted in the army under Saddam,” said Mr. Muhsin, now a bookseller on Mutanabbi Street. “It was war, it was killing, it was hunger and fear.”He met Mr. Mahdi in Najaf at a conference featuring the liberal Iraqi writer and cleric Ahmed al-Qabbanji, and the two bonded over Mr. Qabbanji’s message. “His idea is that Islam is not the solution,” he said. “The modern state of technocrats and secularism is.”For some, Mr. Mahdi’s murder has elevated the level of fear so high that they are even reconsidering their work as journalists. Mr. Sumari said he might stop writing temporarily.“We’ve become so afraid of what we do and what we write,” he said. “We’re changing where we meet, we’re not sleeping at home.”Mr. Mahdi was the 93rd journalist murdered in the last decade — many more died from indiscriminate acts of war — and in not a single case has anyone been brought to justice, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.1188 2011-09-30 This magical little sepia-toned show of work by three unknown photographers from the country of Georgia echoes in miniature the point made by the New Museum’s excellent “Ostalgia” exhibition: Western art capitals have much to learn about the visual culture of the countries that once formed the Soviet Union.The three photographers here are from different generations with distinct, almost paradigmatic photographic sensibilities. The self-taught Shalva Alkhanaidze (1927-1978) worked in a classic mode, making somber three-quarter portraits of people seated before a stretched tarp. They were usually cropped for use as passport pictures, but the four here, taken in the mid-1960s, are presented uncropped and printed large (a little too large, perhaps). They form striking meditations on dignified, hardscrabble perseverance, a bit like updates on Arshile Gorky’s well-known painting, “The Artist and His Mother.” In photomontages from his “Definitions” series of 1997, Guram Tsibakhashvili (born 1960) prints combinations of his own photographs and found images on vintage X-ray paper that he turns into odd diagrams with additional marks in pencil and red gouache. They make a ghostly, gorgeous if slightly antique impression, reminiscent of Rauschenberg and Beuys.The strongest works are in some ways the most old-fashioned. Taken around 1990 by Natela Grigalashvili (born 1965), they record the rural side of life in Georgia, sometimes zeroing in on shepherds or farmers, sometimes pulling back to show figures or animals in broader landscape views. Effortlessly composed, rendered in small, exquisite prints, the images both document and romanticize a harsh life lived close to nature with a memorably strange and lyric realism.1189 2011-09-30 The speaker of Parliament in Slovakia, Richard Sulik, has said he will do whatever he can to stop the bailout fund from coming to a vote, even as advocates have desperately sought a compromise.But the combined pressure of the euro zone members will probably be more than Mr. Sulik and other opponents can bear. A spokeswoman for Parliament, Beata Skyvova, said that the speaker and the prime minister met on Thursday, but that no deal had been announced.Analysts have already said that the fund, even if it passes in all 17 countries, will probably be too small to defend against speculative attacks on deeply indebted European nations. Nevertheless, although the German vote perhaps offered nothing more than momentary relief, it was the crucial step to move the fight forward to the next stage.“Without Germany’s participation, nothing would have been possible,” Mr. Horn said. “This project would have been dead.”For the beleaguered German leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel, Thursday’s vote represented a sorely needed victory. Mrs. Merkel has been sharply criticized for her opposition to economic stimulus and disparaged over her slow reaction to the crisis. Under her stewardship, the project of European integration seems to move forward only when forced by circumstances and specifically by financial markets. Yet step by tentative step, move forward it has.In the historic Reichstag building, graffiti from Red Army soldiers who conquered the capital of Nazi Germany still adorn the walls. Outside the Reichstag, the home of the German Parliament, a protester held a sign reading “Europe Finance Suicide Fund,” a play on the name of the bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility.“The chancellor’s path is extremely contentious, with the public plainly opposed because it is unclear what limit there is to how far Germany has to jump in to cover Greece’s debt,” said Werner J. Patzelt, a political scientist at Technical University in Dresden.The German public is staunchly against paying the debts of other Europeans, stereotyped in the news media here as spendthrifts compared with the virtuously frugal Germans. But as Europe’s largest economy, Germany is the only nation with the fiscal wherewithal to pull fellow countries in the euro zone out of trouble.Government statistics on Thursday showed that even as economic growth has stalled, unemployment has continued to fall in Germany, defying the trend that has pushed joblessness higher across Europe, particularly in recession-stricken economies like Greece and Spain. The Federal Labor Agency reported that the unemployment rate dropped to 6.6 percent in September from 7 percent in August.Germany continues to preach savings over stimulus to contain the debt crisis, withstanding sustained pressure from American policy makers and opting for the path of fiscal discipline supported by the Netherlands and Finland.“We here in Germany are now on the right path, and the rest of Europe has recognized that,” said Joachim Pfeiffer, a member of Parliament from Mrs. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union. “Just a year ago we were still fiercely criticized, including by the Americans. Today, Germany is the model for Europe.”When asked whether Mrs. Merkel could win a further expansion of the rescue fund, Mr. Pfeiffer said it was impossible to predict. “No one knows what the future will bring,” he said.The vote in Parliament on Thursday was 523 to 85 in favor of the expanded bailout fund, with three abstentions. The result was lopsided because the left-leaning Social Democrats and Greens joined Mrs. Merkel’s coalition in voting for its passage. More closely watched were the rebels in her ranks.The vote evolved into a test for Mrs. Merkel’s government. While a similar victory in the United States would be hailed as a bipartisan success story, in the German parliamentary system, power rests on the ability to hold together the members of the coalition that make up what is called the chancellor’s majority.Without a reliable majority to push though legislation, Mrs. Merkel might have been reduced to a toothless and ineffective figurehead. Opposition politicians in Parliament had argued that the vocal disagreement within her ranks meant that Mrs. Merkel had lost control of her coalition and needed to dissolve the government.“You and your government, Madam Chancellor, lack the most important political quality in times of danger: confidence,” said Peer Steinbrück, a leading Social Democrat and Mrs. Merkel’s finance minister during the financial crisis under her previous government. The Social Democrats are hardly an alternative for voters frustrated with Europe, advocating the kind of deeper integration of fiscal policies among the countries of the euro zone that Mrs. Merkel has resisted.Within her coalition, Mrs. Merkel received 315 votes Thursday, four more than needed for the chancellor’s majority. The question now is how much more room her government has to maneuver as the debt crisis continues.During the debate on the floor of Parliament, Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s finance minister, was forced to assure members of Parliament that a vote in favor of the measure did not represent a blank check, and that any additional money would have to be approved by the legislature. “That is not up for debate,” Mr. Schäuble said.1190 2011-09-30 This week, in a speech at the Reagan Presidential Library that stoked speculation of a run for president, Mr. Christie, a Republican, spoke of “bipartisan accomplishments in New Jersey that have helped to set a tone that has taken hold across many other states.” Though he has made occasional deals across party lines in Trenton, there has been no such cooperation between him and the senators.Aides to the three men talk regularly, but all sides agree that when Mr. Christie wants things from Washington, he is much less likely than his predecessors to seek the senators’ help. Governors and members of Congress from the same state, even when they come from opposing parties, often join forces in asking the federal government for money, or relief from regulations, and the tension between New Jersey’s officials could make it harder to present that kind of united front.Some conflict can be expected; besides the party differences, all three are known as brawlers. But their refusal to pick up the phone, along with a willingness to fling insults publicly, goes far beyond the norm.“Like nothing I’ve seen, and it’s certainly not helpful to the state,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. “The governor’s best conduit to Washington, with a Democratic Senate and a Democratic administration, should be the state’s two Democratic senators.”In the last year, the relationship between Mr. Christie and Mr. Lautenberg, in particular, has deteriorated into a series of insults, accusations and playground taunts.Mr. Christie has called the senator “so out of touch and so partisan,” someone who can only “blow hot air.” More recently, Mr. Lautenberg has called the governor “the king of liars” and a bully.Last month, Mr. Christie criticized Mr. Lautenberg’s conduct in the federal debt ceiling debate. “The tone is awful,” the governor said. “I don’t know why he’s so angry, you know? He’s in his 80s and in good health.”Mr. Lautenberg, 87, said, “If the governor wants to challenge my age, I am ready for a foot race whenever he chooses.”Depending on whose partisans are interpreting the exchange, that was a crack about the senator’s age followed by a dig at the governor’s obesity. Or not.Thomas H. Kean, a Republican governor in the 1980s, had good relationships with two Democratic senators, Mr. Lautenberg and Bill Bradley. With each one, he said in an interview, “every two or three months we’d have a real conversation, and more often if we had something going on.”When told of Mr. Lautenberg’s statement that he had never had a meaningful talk with Mr. Christie, Mr. Kean said: “Wow. It’s unfortunate. Yeah, I’m surprised.”Adept members of Congress can steer billions of dollars to their home states, and there is no way to know whether more cooperation would have brought the state more money. Mr. Christie’s advisers say he has good enough relations with the Obama administration to largely bypass the senators’ usual role as emissaries.The enmity between Mr. Christie and Mr. Menendez dates at least to 2006, when Mr. Menendez was running for Senate and Mr. Christie was the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey. Mr. Christie’s office started an investigation that touched on Mr. Menendez’s dealings with a community group. Mr. Menendez charged that the inquiry was politically motivated — nothing came of it — and people close to the senator say he still resents it.More recently, Mr. Menendez has avoided direct confrontation with the governor; his advisers say there is no advantage in it. Mr. Christie has made it clear that he would love to unseat Mr. Menendez and that he will play a leading role in picking his party’s candidate to oppose Mr. Menendez next year. The senator declined to be interviewed about the relationship, and none of his aides would discuss it on the record.Mr. Drewniak said that the governor “was highly laudatory” of the senators’ roles after Tropical Storm Irene, and added that the three men shared a stage for the first time this month, at the unveiling of the state’s Sept. 11 memorial.But the tension between the governor and Mr. Lautenberg has often been on display. Mr. Lautenberg even made light of it in February, when Mr. Christie met in Washington with the state’s entire Congressional delegation and, according to several people there, the senator called out: “Governor, haven’t heard from you. Do you have my number?”When New Jersey lost a $400 million federal education grant last year because of a clerical error by the state, Mr. Christie responded by attacking the Obama administration. At a news conference, the governor said the senators should solve the problem by calling the president and the education secretary, and he questioned their commitment to the state’s well-being.“This will be a good test: you know, do you want to be partisan or do you want to be pro-New Jersey?” he said.But Mr. Lautenberg’s ire at the governor is primarily about a planned rail tunnel under the Hudson River, one of the senator’s cherished projects. He had secured billions of federal dollars for the project, which Mr. Christie endorsed after taking office in January 2010. But Lautenberg aides say that at a meeting with the New Jersey delegation that summer, the governor did not discuss the tunnel, despite the senator’s request to put it on the agenda.Last October, Mr. Christie killed the project, citing billions of dollars in potential cost overruns. According to the senator and his staff, the governor’s office did not warn them of the pending cancellation.A courtesy call, Mr. Lautenberg said, “strikes me as an ordinary piece of business that has to be conducted: you don’t always like your customers, but you still treat them nicely.”At the time, the senator called for an investigation to “root out the falsehoods and potential conflicts of interest” in the decision, questioning not just the governor’s judgment, but also his intentions.Soon after, Mr. Christie told New York magazine, “All he knows how to do is blow hot air,” adding, “So I don’t really care what Frank Lautenberg has to say about much of anything.”When the two senators drafted a cheaper tunnel plan, Mr. Christie irked them by taking credit, saying he had forced them to consider alternatives.The governor refused the federal government’s demand that the state repay $271 million already spent on the tunnel project. Rather than enlist the senators’ help directly, he hired a lobbying firm, Patton Boggs, which then asked members of Congress to sign a letter supporting the state’s case.In April, the federal Transportation Department allocated $38.5 million for a rail bridge across the Hackensack River, but Mr. Christie said of the senators, “obviously they failed” to win more.In the interview, Mr. Lautenberg sounded less angry than dispirited.“Ideas that come about should be discussed between us, but we don’t have any of that easy conversation,” he said. “We don’t have conversations, period. It’s unpleasant.”1191 2011-09-30 Grilled Albacore With Yogurt-Dill Sauce on a Bed of Arugula1192 2011-09-30 In the 1970s, when photography became a serious hobby for Leland Bobbé, he was the drummer in a band called City Lights that played the downtown scene, where he eventually photographed the Ramones, Mink DeVille, Patti Smith, Television and others...1193 2011-09-30 Boaz Weinstein's opening move on Wall Street came as a result of chess.
