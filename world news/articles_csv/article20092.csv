"'09-02-01,'0','“See that, that’s Loge 13; that’s were we used to sit,” said Tom Groppe, 40, looking with his three sons at what was left of the seats they used to occupy with their season tickets.Mr. Groppe, an editor for a financial Web site, grew up in Queens. “Shea had things that were uniquely Queens, like the architecture that came right out of the World’s Fair era,” he said. “Everything was so imperfect, like the bad plumbing, the lack of parking or the lousy train service. You kind of had to earn your way out here.”Indeed, Shea Stadium’s demise has occurred in the shadow of the replacement of the more hallowed Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, where a new Yankee Stadium next door is also set to host its first games this spring. Unlike Shea Stadium, which is being torn down to make way for a parking lot for 2,000 cars, the razing of the old Yankee Stadium — to make room for a new park — has yet to begin.Several of those in Flushing on Saturday brought their children for a final glimpse.“Fan Appreciation Day ’92 was his first game,” said David Pecoraro, 48, pointing to his 16-year-old son, Daniel, who was wearing a Mets hat, like his dad.“My first game was Camera Day, 1970,” added Mr. Pecoraro, a teacher from Rosedale, Queens.Jim Kirkikis, who was standing nearby, interjected: “Camera Day, I was there, ’74. Camera Day was a big deal because they let you go field level. I wanted a picture of the bullpen car; it was shaped like a baseball with a big hat on it.”Mr. Kirkikis, 42, who had traveled from Cranford, N.J., with his two children, Judith, 8, and Nicholas, 6, said he was sad to see the stadium closing — no matter how unsightly it might have been, or how poorly the team fared.“I have a lot of memories here, some good, some bad,” he said. “A piece of my childhood is gone.”Demolition workers outside the stadium said they were aiming to have the rest of Shea Stadium torn down by Feb. 14.Chris Swann, 25, a construction manager from Huntington, Long Island, who helped organize the event by using blogs and Facebook, was thrilled to be surrounded by so many diehard fans.“These are the real Mets fans,” said Mr. Swann, wearing a Mets jacket with patches representing the team’s World Series championships in 1969 and 1986. “It’s 25 degrees and we’re standing out here, I’m loving it. I’m cold and I’m smiling. Everybody coming together and telling stories and being Mets fans together.”After a boisterous rendition of “Meet the Mets,” the team’s fight song, and a chant of “Let’s go Mets,” they marched along the perimeter of the demolition site, taking more photos.“First game I went to I was 10 years old,” said Peter Manzari, 50, a computer programmer from Bayside, Queens. “I went with my father, it was 1968, a doubleheader, they dropped two to the Phillies — not surprising.”'"
"'09-02-01,'0','DAVOS, Switzerland — The European Central Bank is working on guidelines to prevent bailout plans from one country from being significantly more generous than plans from another, a central bank official said Saturday.The central bank official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the guidelines have not been completed.The new guidelines are an attempt to prevent countries from carrying out rescue plans that favor their banks over others, a tactic the British prime minister, Gordon Brown, called “financial protectionism” at the World Economic Forum here Saturday.European officials are considering more capital injections into banks in addition to buying bad assets from banks and issuing guarantees of their value. Buying or guaranteeing these assets would remove worries that the banks would be hurt further if the assets continued to lose value. But it would also raise issues of fairness if the prices paid for the assets, or the value guaranteed, appeared to be too high.The difficulty of determining the value of such assets was one reason the Bush administration changed course after Congress passed the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which had the government buying distressed assets from banks. Instead, the administration began investing directly in financial institutions. Now the Obama administration is considering whether to return to the original plan.'"

"'09-02-01,'0','“It’s totally shocking,” an aide to a Democratic senator said Saturday. “Why do we have to continue to have the same story over and over again with these nominees?”Mr. Daschle, who has paid the back taxes with interest, is the latest of Mr. Obama’s cabinet choices who have run into trouble, and the revelations about his finances — which include more than $300,000 in income from health-related companies that he might regulate as secretary — raise questions about the presidential vetting process, as well as Mr. Obama’s ability to keep his pledge to run an administration free of outside influence.“One of the problems here is what they set up as expectations,” said Martha Joynt Kumar, an expert in presidential transitions at Towson University. “If you have talked about the importance of ethics and set up the kind of rules they did on lobbying, then I think it sets expectations that yours is going to be an administration that is not going to have problems that others might have had.”Privately, some Democrats on Saturday were scratching their heads at how Mr. Daschle, a Washington insider with a reputation as a sophisticated thinker, could have made such a mistake.A spokeswoman for Mr. Daschle, Jenny Backus, said Mr. Daschle became concerned last June that he might owe taxes on the car and driver, and instructed his accountant to investigate. Mr. Obama named Mr. Daschle to the health secretary’s post on Dec. 11. But it was not until late December or early January, after the accountant came back to Mr. Daschle with a report on the back taxes owed, that the former senator informed the White House transition team. Ms. Backus said Mr. Daschle did not think to mention it earlier, in part because “he thought his accountant was taking care of it,” and in part because he had no idea the amount owed would be so high.“He took responsibility for his mistake as soon as he figured it out,” Ms. Backus said. “That’s about all you can do. People who know him and respect him are putting that mistake in context.”On Capitol Hill, Senate Democrats rallied around Mr. Daschle, a former senator from South Dakota who lost his seat in 2004 while serving as the minority leader. Mr. Daschle is a close ally of the president’s — he marshaled his staff on behalf of the Obama campaign, and at least five former Daschle aides now have top White House jobs — and Democrats vowed to go to bat for him.“We wish this didn’t happen,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who is on the Finance Committee, “but he’s chosen such quality people that nobody minds taking a bit of an extra step to help get them in.”But already, Mr. Daschle is becoming the butt of Republican jokes, as was the case at the House Republican retreat this weekend. According to one person who was there, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the party whip, had this to say after hearing the news about Mr. Daschle: “It is easy for the other side to advocate for higher taxes because — you know what? — they don’t pay them.”When Mr. Obama was elected, official Washington marveled at the speed of his transition and the rigorous vetting process. But Paul C. Light, a professor at New York University who studies the federal bureaucracy, said that “speed may have been the enemy of thoroughness” in the Obama process. The White House, though, insisted that was not the case.“In terms of the vetting,” Mr. Gibbs said Saturday, “we’re comfortable with the process.”The information about Mr. Daschle has come to light in different ways. He disclosed some to the transition team, including the taxes owed on the car and driver. The transition team spotted a problem with his charitable tax deductions, and the Senate Finance Committee discovered the failure to pay Medicare tax on the use of the car.If Mr. Daschle’s confirmation is derailed, it would undoubtedly hurt one of Mr. Obama’s major domestic priorities: revamping the health care system. Mr. Daschle has been asked by the president to serve in a dual role spearheading that effort as the White House “health czar.”As a politician, Mr. Daschle often struck a populist note, but his financial disclosure report shows that in the last two years, he received $2.1 million from a law firm, Alston & Bird; $2 million in consulting fees from a private equity firm run by a major Democratic fundraiser, Leo Hindery Jr. (which provided him with the car and driver); and at least $220,000 for speeches to health care, pharmaceutical and insurance companies. He also received nearly $100,000 from health-related companies affected by federal regulation.Mr. Obama has instituted rules requiring former lobbyists in his administration to pledge not to deal with former clients, though he has made exceptions for two nominees, one at the Pentagon and one at the health agency. As a strategic adviser to companies, Mr. Daschle did not have to register as a lobbyist, and is not technically covered by those rules.“He’s never lobbied, therefore he’s not in violation of the pledge,” Mr. Gibbs said. “The president is comfortable with Senator Daschle’s variety of experiences and backgrounds. It’s why he believes he’s best suited to the efforts to reform our health care system.”'"
"'09-02-01,'0','And so some small businesses are finding a silver lining in the recessionary clouds: they suddenly have leverage with their landlords.Six months ago, for instance, the landlord of the Holland Bar in Hell’s Kitchen terminated the lease because he was confident of finding a higher-paying tenant or developing luxury condos. But when he found no takers, he offered the space back to the bar, at a 20 percent increase in rent. The Holland reopened last week.“Everyone is afraid of losing revenue stream,” said Faith Hope Consolo, the chairwoman of retail leasing and sales for Prudential Douglas Elliman, who is representing retailers and landlords on six lease renewals. At least two of the landlords have been fearful enough about losing tenants that they agreed to rent cuts of more than 10 percent.Ms. Consolo added that “2009 is going to be the year leases were negotiated more than ever before.”Jeff Gural, who owns 40 Manhattan buildings, said that he has been reworking lease agreements with struggling shop owners to help them stay in business. He typically asks for their financial statements as evidence, then tries to cut deals that can include deferring rent payments.“If someone can show us that they’re in trouble and they’ve been a good tenant over the years, we try to help,” he said.The rental market has become weak enough that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg acknowledged the problem in his annual budget address on Friday.“There are an awful lot of empty stores, but what is more damaging for the landlords is that most of the other stores are empty — not empty physically, but people aren’t shopping,” Mr. Bloomberg said.That does not mean that all of the city’s landlords, whether in upscale Manhattan districts or shopping strips in Brooklyn and Queens, are cutting their tenants a break; many shops are still facing sharply rising rents as leases come due.Indeed, many landlords find themselves in a bind because they paid stiff prices for property in recent years and need to cover hefty mortgage payments. On average, Manhattan landlords paid $3,348 per square foot for retail properties in 2008, compared with $538 per square foot in 2004, according to the brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.“If a landlord bought a building over the past decade or longer, they have more flexibility,” said Jeffrey D. Roseman, executive vice president with Newmark Knight Frank Retail, who has been representing both tenants and landlords on these negotiations. “If they bought in the last year, they can’t afford to be creative.”So even now, amid the deepest recession in decades, many landlords are trying to raise rents on tenants who may have negotiated leases a decade ago. Rising rents caused the restaurant Ruby Foo’s Upper West Side location to close on Jan. 14. And the Knitting Factory nightclub and Cendrillon, a pan-Asian restaurant, are moving to Brooklyn in search of lower rents. (Cendrillon will reopen under a new name, Purple Yam.)But as more small businesses close, the pressure on landlords to strike deals is growing. While New York City’s retail vacancy rate has remained relatively low at 4.7 percent, it grew faster than in any other major city between the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2008, according to Marcus & Millichap Research Services.And rents have started to drop even on busier shopping districts like Madison Avenue, where a Grubb & Ellis report issued last month predicted that rents could fall by as much as 30 percent this year.The slowdown is hitting small businesses especially hard in places like the Lower East Side, where real estate values quadrupled in recent years to more than $400 per square foot, said Michael F. DeCheser, a Massey Knakal Realty Services broker.Ms. Gillis feared she might be forced out after watching a neighboring business move when the retailer could not pay his rising rent.Since 2001, the retailer, Arjan Khiani, had owned a clothing shop at 174 Ludlow called Bodyworship, where the customers included celebrities like Britney Spears. In December 2007, Arwen Properties, the building’s management company, sent Mr. Khiani an eviction notice saying that he owed about $45,000 in real estate taxes and that his rent would double to $6,900 a month.So Mr. Khiani moved out in January 2008 and opened a new shop five blocks away. But that shop did not draw enough business and he closed it in December. Now his new landlord is suing him because he cannot find a new tenant for the space.Ms. Gillis was determined not to let that happen to her.She started her boutique in her apartment in 1992 and attracted attention from neighbors by holding fashion shows in her front windows. She nurtured young fashion designers, including some who have moved to big retailers like American Apparel. Today, three loyal Westie terriers trail at her heels as she moves around her shop, with its whitewashed floors and chandeliers.In the current slowdown, she says she has kept her business running in part by using her retirement savings to pay bills. With many of her neighbors struggling, she considers herself fortunate that the downturn has helped her keep her space.“They definitely wanted me out of there,” she said of her landlord. “But I’m sure because of the economy it would definitely be harder to get someone else in there.”Other shop owners are finding that if their landlords will not negotiate, there are others who will.Last year, the new owner of a building down the block from Ms. Gillis told his tenant, Ludlow Guitars, that the monthly rent could more than triple, to $24,000 from $7,100.The landlord, Michael Forrest, calls the block the “highest retail rent district of the Lower East Side” and points to two hotel projects and a condo project on the block — all three are currently stalled — as evidence the neighborhood will pick up.“I’m an optimist,” said Mr. Forrest. “Successful restaurants are still succeeding. I still see people shopping.”The owner of Ludlow Guitars, Jan Howell, began looking elsewhere for space, and found a landlord a couple of blocks away willing to charge him only slightly more than he pays now in rent. He plans to move by April and he believes that his customers will follow. For now, he is savoring that he found a deal that might have seemed unthinkable six months ago.“It would have been absolutely impossible,” Mr. Howell said. “There’s an upside. Business is bad. But rents have come down as well.”'"

The list is based on individual player performance and team records during the first half of the season.Connecticut — with the sophomore Maya Moore, the junior Tina Charles and the senior Renee Montgomery — is the only team with more than one player. Joining them are Angel McCoughtry of Louisville, Shavonte Zellous of Pittsburgh and Epiphanny Prince of Rutgers.MILLER CALLS IT QUITS North Carolina’s Alex Miller has decided to end her playing career.Miller, who tore a patellar tendon in a game against Coppin State on Nov. 16, 2007, underwent an extensive rehabilitation process and returned to play in 18 games this season.“I had to think about my life after basketball,” Miller, a senior guard, said, adding that she had talked with her family and with the athletic trainer Terri Jo Rucinski, and decided that it would be better to end her season “than to keep going through the pain.”Miller said, “I will still be around to support my teammates with whatever they need, but everyone agreed that this was the best decision for me to make.”The injury, which resulted in a rupture of the tendon, is considered more severe than a torn anterior cruciate ligament. It usually spells the end of an athlete’s career.“It was the worst injury I think I’ve ever seen in all my years of coaching,” North Carolina’s Sylvia Hatchell said. “And for her to go through rehab and come back and play again was truly amazing.”Miller will remain with the team through the end of the season as a student assistant.BEST AND WORST With Auburn losing to Georgia on Thursday night, Connecticut (20-0) was the last of the unbeaten teams entering the weekend and was trying to become the first undefeated team since the 2002 Huskies went 39-0.UConn had not won by fewer than 11 points and was winning by an average of nearly 35.At the other end of the spectrum, Nicholls State of the Southland Conference and Norfolk State of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference were the last winless teams.“It’s not abnormal for MEAC records to be a little lopsided in preconference play,” Norfolk State Coach Tara Owens said, “because we’re playing top-notch teams, and a lot of us play guarantee games to assist our budgets. But there’s some winnable games out there that we haven’t taken advantage of.”Winston-Salem was winless until beating Norfolk State, 69-67 in overtime, on Monday.Fordham set the N.C.A.A. single-season futility record by going 0-29 last season. The Rams broke their losing streak this season.'"
"'09-02-01,'0','For decades, the capital scoured state dinner invitation lists and Camp David visitor logs for clues to who was in and who was out.Former President Bill Clinton established a new class of insider with his Lincoln Bedroom sleepovers, although those usually came with an implicit price tag as he tried to raise campaign money. Former President George W. Bush provided fewer opportunities for the elite to demonstrate their eliteness by virtually abandoning state dinners, but there were invitations to his Texas ranch to clear brush, a dubious distinction, perhaps, during 100-degree Crawford summers.Now there is President Obama’s e-mail, the first used by a commander in chief while in office. “This is the 21st-century version of the same special access that certain people are always granted to the president,” said Joel P. Johnson, a senior White House adviser under Mr. Clinton. “In F.D.R.’s White House, it was Harry Hopkins and Harold Ickes. There will be a similar select few in this White House.”Those select few who have Mr. Obama’s e-mail address, say people informed about the matter, include Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff; David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett, both senior advisers; and Robert Gibbs, the press secretary. But cabinet members like the interior secretary, Ken Salazar, said they did not have it. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is a frequent BlackBerry user, but a spokesman said he did not know whether she had the president’s address.Mr. Gates does not use e-mail for work, said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, and besides, he sees the president often enough that he does not need it to communicate with him by e-mail. “If you are secretary of agriculture, interior or something like that, it may prove more useful,” Mr. Morrell said. “But face time is not an issue for him.”Mr. Obama joked about the exclusive nature of his e-mail list at the annual Alfalfa Club dinner in Washington on Saturday night. “How exclusive?” the president asked. “Everyone look at the person sitting on your left. Now look at the person sitting on your right. None of you have my e-mail address.”The exclusivity is not just a matter of safeguarding the president’s scarce time or even protecting him from spam. Mr. Obama presumably knows not to send his bank account information to those ubiquitous Nigerian businessmen who clog e-mail inboxes. But security personnel worry that the more available his address, the more vulnerable it may be to hacking pranksters or, worse, to cyber-attackers from, say, Russia or China.After all, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska found her e-mail account broken into and her messages posted online last year when she was running for vice president. Imagine a president’s e-mail put on display for the whole world to see — or perhaps just for the head of a hostile foreign intelligence service.To minimize the risk, the government technology gurus have made it impossible to forward e-mail messages from the president or to send him attachments, people informed about the precautions say. His address is likely to be changed regularly as well. And the president’s friends and staff members are being lectured about security.So Mr. Obama’s e-mail pals are largely keeping mum. Phone calls and e-mail messages to more than 40 of his top aides, relatives, friends and political associates last week yielded few who openly acknowledged having the address.“I’m unable to confirm it,” a publicist said when asked if Oprah Winfrey sends e-mail to the president.“I have no answer,” a top White House official said when asked the same question, refusing to be named saying even just that.And there are many who might be expected to have it who do not. Former Vice President Al Gore, an early e-mail aficionado, does not exchange messages with the president. “To date, I have not known them to e-mail each other,” said his spokeswoman, Kalee Kreider.John D. Podesta ran Mr. Obama’s transition and exchanged e-mail with him virtually every day from the election to the inauguration. But he did not join the administration and does not have the new address. “Some things are secret,” Mr. Podesta said, although he added, “My guess is the list will grow.”This is the first time the issue has arisen, because Mr. Clinton never became interested in e-mail while he was president and Mr. Bush gave it up in the Oval Office on the advice of lawyers, who consider e-mail subject to the Presidential Records Act. (After eight years off the grid, Mr. Bush signed back on after leaving office last month, according to his former aide, Karen Hughes, who received a message from him the other day.)Past presidents have found other ways of keeping in touch with the outside world.Mr. Clinton and the first President Bush had a dedicated fax line, although the secret number sometimes leaked out. At least once during Mr. Clinton’s first term, a lobbying organization got hold of it and flooded the Oval Office with unwelcome propaganda, forcing the White House to change the number.Mr. Clinton received 100 to 500 faxes a week, and they sometimes prompted him to rethink a speech or a policy approach. Aides came to dread them. “It was useful to him,” said Mr. Lake, a national security adviser to Mr. Clinton. “It was a pain to us because he would send them to us in indecipherable handwriting asking, ‘What do you think?’ ”But Mr. Lake said Mr. Obama’s decision to keep using e-mail as president made sense, even though he himself was no longer a recipient. “You can become a captive of the bureaucracy, and this is one of the ways you avoid that,” Mr. Lake said.Mr. Podesta said he strongly urged Mr. Obama to keep his BlackBerry. “He needs to stay connected to people,” Mr. Podesta said. “There is absolutely no reason not to do it.”He dismissed the concerns of the security team: “They’d keep you in a lead container in the basement if you let them.”The challenge for those privileged few with the address will be when to use it. What is the etiquette on sending e-mail to the president? Several friends and aides said they would hit the “reply” button but not the “new message” button — in other words, send messages only when messaged first.“Rarely will I bother him for anything serious or nonserious,” said Alexi Giannoulias, the state treasurer of Illinois and a friend.“I figure if he needs me or wants to talk to me on any social level, he can get me very, very quickly. His friends need to have a shift in mentality. He’s no longer Barack. He’s an institution.”'"
"'09-02-01,'0','The conflict has flared again because an article detailing the charges against Mr. Kutler has been submitted to the American Historical Review, the profession’s premier journal.“Are you aware under what conditions I worked in 1996?” he said by telephone from Mexico. “It’s only because of my lawsuit that you or anybody else can pick up a tape. In those days, I could not leave the archives with that material. I used state-of-the-lost-art equipment. I brought in a team of court reporters to help me with the first drafts.“I am responsible for whatever was transcribed,” said Mr. Kutler, recently a plaintiff in a lawsuit to compel former Vice President Dick Cheney to preserve his records. “Did I make any mistakes? Of course. Did I ever make a deliberate mistake, did I ever deliberately transform a negative into a positive?Other experts who have listened to the tapes, a painstaking and difficult task, note significant disparities between some transcripts in the Kutler book and the recordings, but say there is no reason to think they are anything but accidental.Questions about Mr. Kutler’s transcripts have rattled around for a decade, and many people currently involved have previously battled over his editing as well as interpretations of Watergate. The lack of a complete or official and publicly available record of the tapes has helped keep the dispute simmering.Peter Klingman, the historian who submitted the article, has been trying to call attention to Mr. Kutler’s editing in recent months. He has not yet heard from the American Historical Review on whether it will publish his essay, and because of pre-publication rules he would not comment.About Mr. Klingman, Mr. Kutler said: “I’ve tried to deal with this man in a very professional, patient way. I don’t know what he wanted — for me to get in my sackcloth and my ashes?”To anyone besides Watergate buffs, the dispute may seem trivial. “On one level it looks very petty,” said Joan Hoff, a historian at Montana State University and the author of two books on Nixon. “But because the book is used authoritatively as the official transcript of the event, it becomes very important.”At issue are a week’s worth of recordings beginning March 13, 1973, a few days before Mr. Dean’s cancer-on-the-presidency declaration and the sentencing of the burglars who broke into the Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate complex.In one conversation from that first day that is not included in “Abuse of Power,” Mr. Dean tells Nixon that Gordon Strachan, a White House aide, knew about the break-in before it happened. During hearings of the Senate committee investigating Watergate in the months to come, Mr. Dean would testify that there had been no prior White House knowledge of the break-in.To Mr. Kutler’s scholarly critics, though, the most serious failing is that excerpts from two separate conversations that took place on March 16 — one made during a face-to-face meeting in the morning, and a second over the telephone in the evening — were reversed in order and presented as part of one continuous meeting. Most of the evening conversation between Mr. Dean and Nixon was eliminated, as were any references to it.“If you look back at the conversations that Stanley didn’t include what you see is Nixon and Dean closely involved in a joint obstruction of justice,” said Frederick J. Graboske, who was the supervising archivist in charge of processing the Nixon tapes at the National Archives. (Mr. Dean pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and served four months, most of which was spent working with Watergate prosecutors.)In their March 16 evening telephone conversation, Mr. Dean and Nixon discussed what the president might tell the public. Mr. Dean says, “A lot of my conclusions were based on the fact that there was not a scintilla of evidence in the investigation that led anywhere to the White House.”Mr. Graboske maintains that Mr. Dean, who had discussed Mr. Strachan’s participation a few days earlier with the president, was emphasizing that they could hoodwink the public because no one could prove the White House had previous knowledge of the break-in.“In the history profession, you never change the original evidence; Dr. Kutler has changed the original evidence,” said Mr. Graboske, who learned of the disparities six months ago.“I spent 12 years listening to the tapes,” he said, contending that no one could mistake the evening and morning recordings as being part of the same conversation. “I don’t know why he did it, but what he did was deliberate.”He added: “I did work with Stanley. I’m sorry that it has come to this.”Yet Ken Hughes, a senior fellow at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center for Public Affairs, who has studied the tapes since 2000 as part of the Presidential Digital Recordings project, said the attacks on Mr. Kutler were “misguided.”“I was very critical of errors in the transcripts and I thought he had left out some important conversations,” Mr. Hughes said of Mr. Kutler’s book, “but they are entirely honest and predictable mistakes that anyone who would try to make a transcript from extremely difficult tapes could make.”Also left out of Mr. Kutler’s book is a 35-minute conversation from March 17, 1973, in which Mr. Dean and Nixon discuss the vulnerabilities of various administration officials. Mr. Dean adds himself to the list.Dean: “Well, because I’ve been all over this thing like a blanket.”To some ears, the most dramatic section not included in “Abuse of Power” is a conversation in the Oval Office from March 20, 1973, among Nixon, Mr. Dean and Richard Moore, a White House adviser, as they tap out a possible public statement on a manual typewriter.In it, Mr. Dean refers to a meeting with G. Gordon Liddy, who planned the break-in, during which establishing an intelligence operation for the president’s 1972 re-election committee was discussed.Nixon replies, “I’d be inclined just to knock that out. I’d just say there were limited problems involving campaign law compliance. And then I would——then I would say never at any time were there any discussions that had anything to do with intelligence gathering operations ——on the order of something like that.”Mr. Dean says, “I see what you mean.”Mr. Kutler’s critics include Mr. Klingman and Ms. Hoff, as well as the authors Len Colodny and Russ Baker, whose books about Watergate have advanced controversial conspiracy theories involving Mr. Dean. They all argue that Mr. Kutler was protecting Mr. Dean, his friend, and avoiding having to revise his previously published accounts of Watergate.Mr. Dean, now an author and commentator, said in a telephone interview from Washington that the accusers are part of a fringe group of revisionists.“It’s amazing these guys have the credibility to be covered,” he said. “Hopefully the American Historical Association can figure out fact from fiction, and Klingman doesn’t represent fact.”Without going into a point-by-point rebuttal, Mr. Kutler said that at the time he prepared the book, his overriding priority was to look for evidence of the president’s guilt: “My concern in 1996 was to see what Richard Nixon had to say.” He added that he is now friends with Mr. Dean but was not at the start of his work on the tapes.Another well-known presidential historian, Herbert S. Parmet, who wrote a biography of Nixon, said he was not certain the disparities were that important: “I’m not convinced that it does all that much to change the history.”There are no official government transcripts. These tapes from 1973 were released as the result of a lawsuit in the 1990s by Mr. Dean against Mr. Colodny and excerpts can be heard at nytimes.com/arts. The National Archives and Records Administration is releasing the entire 3,700-plus hours of recordings in chronological order; they are now up to December 1972. One archives estimate figured it takes 100 hours of staff time to process a single hour of tape.In the end, Ms. Hoff of Montana State said, the dispute underscores the importance of an official, comprehensive record: “If there is this kind of distortion of that one crucial week, it does raise the question of what else is missing in the transcripts.”'"
"'09-02-01,'0','“We wouldn’t be having the party if it didn’t make economic sense for us,” Glenn Rosenbloom, Alpha Media’s co-chief executive, said.Magazines like Playboy and Sports Illustrated canceled their annual Super Bowl affairs, and other signs of economic malaise were everywhere. On Friday afternoon, hotel rooms could be had for $100 a night not far from Raymond James Stadium. And during his state-of-the-league address, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell discussed the era’s “tremendous amount of uncertainty” — so unsettled that the league and several of its teams have dismissed employees, as if they were no different from Microsoft or Home Depot.But this was Super Bowl week, and some people were determined not to forget that, provided they could remember anything in the morning. They were not going to let a recession get in the way of tradition.Around him swirled the live-action version of his magazine — pages worth of women and drinks and more women and music and celebrities delivered in party form to an attentive core audience of 20-something men wearing untucked dress shirts and generous portions of hair gel. Maxim brought in about 350 women from area talent and modeling agencies to assist the male-to-female ratio, which is common at parties during the testosterone-rich Super Bowl week.“If you deliver the fantasy a little bit, it makes everybody feel a little bit better about their lives,” Kaminsky said.Maxim was not alone in its defiance to the economy. ESPN the Magazine gave a competing party on Friday night, inside a huge tent that somehow managed to capture Little Steven Van Zandt and Lil’ Wayne, Lindsay Lohan, Vinny Testaverde and Jared of Subway sandwich fame simultaneously under one canopy, as if popular culture had just coughed up something unimaginable.Like everyone else accustomed to past Super Bowl excesses, executives at ESPN pondered the best way to face a scrambled new order. Do you give the party? If so, do you tone it down? What kind of message should be sent?“How do you change, or can you change, the psychology of such a downturn?” said Gary Hoenig, general manager of ESPN Publishing, with admitted ambivalence. “Is the positive thing to do something like this, or is there anything you can do that sort of changes the framework? Or are you sort of stuck with this: ‘Gee, lots of people are losing their jobs. I’ve got to stay below the surface, I can’t overmarket, I can’t visibly do anything that disturbs the funereal mood we’re in?’ ”ESPN answered with a pulsating party. Sprinkled through the scene were women dancing tirelessly, alone on pedestals. They wore referee socks, short shorts, eye black and cropped football jerseys — a Saint here, a Patriot there. Soon, they danced to Wyclef Jean, performing onstage.But little comes these days without compromise. Hoenig said that ESPN the Magazine’s annual parties at the N.B.A. All-Star Game and to mark the release of an “athletes” special issue would not take place this year.The remnants of the Super Bowl party scene were not all that stiffly faced up to uncertainty. Tampa was awarded Super Bowl XLIII in 2005, when no one imagined the soured environment in which the game would be played.Yet the Tampa Bay Super Bowl Host Committee raised $7 million in private donations to meet its $11 million budget — more than twice its budget when the city last hosted the Super Bowl eight years ago.It was not about to let the economy water down its Super Bowl plans or diminish Tampa’s chance to sell itself. Sure, it was tough timing for the host. Or maybe it was perfect timing, a booster shot at the neediest moment.“We are in a recession,” Mayor Pam Iorio said. “We’re either in a recession getting to host the Super Bowl, or in a recession without a Super Bowl. Those are the two options. Which would you rather have?”Still, the recession dealt an unusually difficult hand to the Super Bowl, which has long seemed immune to anything more serious than a halftime-show wardrobe-malfunction controversy.NBC, the game’s broadcaster, struggled to sell its 30-second commercial spots. The number of credentialed news representatives fell from the previous year, maybe for the first time. The N.F.L. dropped the price of 1,000 tickets to $500, from $800.The annual Friday night Commissioner’s Party, which has featured circus performers and wild animals, had two sand-sculpture artists instead. The previous three parties had taken place at the Henry Ford Museum in suburban Detroit, at Jungle Island in Miami and at an airplane hangar and museum outside Phoenix. Last year’s party had the feel of a 1940s-era U.S.O. celebration featuring the swing band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. This year, the party was in the Tampa Convention Center, with a cover band.As Maxim’s Kaminsky said, “2009 is the wrong time for idiotic excess.” So even the Maxim party was limited to 1,400 guests, half the usual number. But that, along with fewer parties taking place, only served to make it more exclusive.It meant more people were left standing on the outside, beyond the velvet rope, shivering in the unusually cool air and the stiff breeze of recession. They just wanted to come in from the elements, if only for a little while.'"

"'09-02-01,'0','Her seven unforced errors might well have been a career low for Williams, who likes to take big swings and risks. “I don’t think I’ve ever played a match with so few,” she said. “I saw that stat in the end and I was like, ‘Whoa.’ I think the key is doing what my dad tells me to do in practice: just technical things.”The victory means that Williams, not Safina, will replace Jelena Jankovic at No. 1 when the rankings are released Monday.“She played too good today,” Safina said in her postmatch remarks to the not-quite-sellout crowd in Rod Laver Arena. “I was just a ball boy on the court.”If Williams is going to be challenged in a major tournament, it is best to send a strong signal early. Since the 2004 United States Open, she is an astonishing 45-0 at Grand Slam events when she wins the first set.Safina, a 22-year-old Russian who is the younger sister of the 2005 Australian Open men’s champion, Marat Safin, has earned a reputation as a battler. She fought back from match points in early rounds of last year’s French Open to reach the final and did the same to reach the final here.But from the start on Saturday, she seemed edgy and confused. Though she flirted with holding her serve at 0-1, she double-faulted three times in the game, with the third coming on break point. There would be precious little suspense after that. Safina won eight points in the first set while Williams won 26, many with huge returns or well-measured forehands.Although Safina broke Williams in the first game of the second set, Williams immediately returned the favor and rolled to a 4-1 lead. Safina bounced her racket off the court in frustration, which was a more measured approach than her combustible older brother would have adopted in comparably dire circumstances. (Safin is prone to smashing rackets.)“I was feeling good, you know, but then, of course, once you step in the court, it’s a different situation,” said the third-seeded Safina, who added that she felt the pressure of playing for No. 1. “But I was not nervous, not even close like before the French Open final. I couldn’t even sleep the night. But today I slept good and everything was fine. But just pity.”There was certainly some of that for her in the stands. In just 59 minutes, the first women’s night final in Melbourne was history. Williams finished it off by holding serve at love after Safina hit a backhand drop shot wide. Williams thrust her arms overhead, but the celebration that followed was nowhere near as exuberant as when she beat Jankovic to win last year’s United States Open. But then the big challenges came earlier in this hardcourt tournament.Williams said she felt she played her “B and C level” for much of it. She was near tears after her difficult second-round victory over Gisela Dulko of Argentina. In the fourth round, Williams was down a set against a big-hitting Belarussian teenager, Victoria Azarenka, who then retired in the second set because of illness.In the quarterfinals, Williams lost the first set against the Russian veteran Svetlana Kuznetsova and was struggling on one of the many suffocatingly hot days in Melbourne this year. But Open organizers invoked their extreme-heat policy and closed the retractable roof in Laver Arena before the second set. Kuznetsova was angry, and Williams went on to play the rest of the match (and tournament) in more comfortable conditions. Saturday’s final was played outdoors in mild temperatures, the record-setting heat wave having finally broken.Williams’s four singles titles here have come in odd-numbered years: 2003, 2005, 2007 and now 2009.“I really wasn’t feeling like it was destiny this year,” she said. “I thought, ‘O.K., I don’t want this in my brain.’ I just want to win; just want to win seven matches. I wasn’t thinking about, ‘This is it, because it’s the odd year.’ But it happened again, which is really kind of weird.”Williams is not the only American with a habit of winning in Melbourne. The Bryan twins, Mike and Bob, won their third Australian Open and seventh Grand Slam doubles title on Saturday night, defeating the veterans Mahesh Bhupathi of India and Mark Knowles of the Bahamas, 2-6, 7-5, 6-0.The Bryans, 30, recommitted themselves in the off-season after finishing second in the world rankings last year, when Bob injured his left shoulder. Like Williams, they will regain the No. 1 spot Monday, and the three planned to celebrate together at a Melbourne nightclub, as they did in 2007 after the Bryans won in doubles and Williams in singles.“All I know is Serena usually picks up the bill,” Mike Bryan said.As in 2007, when she struggled early, then routed Maria Sharapova in the final, Williams saved her most dominant display for last. This was the most lopsided full-length women’s final in Melbourne since Arantxa Sánchez Vicario lost, 6-0, 6-2 , to Steffi Graf in 1994.Only six women in tennis history have won more Grand Slam singles titles than Serena: a list led by Margaret Smith Court with 24 and Graf with 22. But Williams, who also won the doubles here with older sister Venus, is clearly on the short list of the sport’s greatest at age 27.“She looks deep inside and is just determined not to lose,” said her mother and coach, Oracene Price. “She really hates to lose; it’s just in her, and I think she’s really taking advantage of the situation right now, because you just have so much time in a sports career, so you want to get the best out of it.”Adrift, injured and ranked in the 100s three seasons ago, Williams has regained her former place in the game, and has now won consecutive Grand Slam singles titles for the first time since she won the 2002 United States Open and 2003 Australian Open.'"
"'09-02-01,'0','At Accolo, the other executives and I decided we’d hold a teleconference and announce the news at all three locations simultaneously. On Tuesday of that week in November, we called an all-hands meeting for Thursday. I flew from San Francisco to our New York office on Thursday morning because I wanted to be the one to tell the New York employees who reported directly to me, and I wanted to do it in person.When I walked in the door, the whole office got quiet. One or two people sighed. Another person broke the tension by saying, “It’s good to see you, Matt.” A few employees laughed at that. They knew what was coming. We discuss our revenue and projects at weekly status meetings, so they were aware of the problems.We all went to the conference room, and John, our C.E.O., spoke first. He said the market had continued to deteriorate and that we had to get our expenses in line with our revenue if we were going to survive.Then I spoke and told everyone that our biggest expense was headcount and that we had to lay a few people off. I said that the executives were going to leave the room, call people out one by one, and help those whose jobs were being eliminated to pack. We hoped to save them from embarrassment.I called the two employees to be laid off in that office out of the room first. When I told them, one by one, that they were on the list, I was amazed at the responses. You never know how people will react. Some might get angry.The first person I told was the last to be hired, so he half-expected it. But he had just been laid off from another job three months earlier, so I felt doubly bad. The other employee felt bad for me. She said she was so sorry I had to do this. I couldn’t believe she was so selfless. I’d like to think it says a lot about the culture we’ve tried to develop.Then I returned to the conference room and told the others that we were done, that no one else was affected. I said I would still meet with each of them to discuss any concerns they might have.I may have sounded calm, but I was shell-shocked like everyone else. I kept thinking, “How could this be happening to us?” We weren’t cutting low performers, and it felt as if the company was weaker for it, even though it was necessary to keep going.We offered as much severance as we could, and the other executives and I told the remaining employees that we didn’t want to close the door on those who lost their jobs.. We encouraged them to reach out to their ex-colleagues and keep in touch. Then we all got on LinkedIn and wrote endorsements for those who were laid off. Our clients are midsize businesses. John called a company similar to ours whose clients are large businesses. He told them that we’d had to let employees go and recommended the people. That company hired two from the Larkspur office.AS an executive, the hard part for me is looking back.We had to lay people off to keep the company healthy, but you start second-guessing yourself. You wonder what you might have missed. It’s easy in a market like this to tell yourself it’s not your fault. Some of the best-known companies and managers are making the same decision. That might be true, but it seems like a flimsy excuse.'"
"'09-02-01,'0','The shift has been documented by Jonathan A. Parker and Annette Vissing-Jorgenson, finance professors at Northwestern University, in their recent paper, “Who Bears Aggregate Fluctuations and How? Estimates and Implications for Consumption Inequality.” Of course, people who held much wealth in real estate or stocks have taken heavy losses. But most important, the paper says, the labor incomes of high earners have declined more than in past recessions, as seen in the financial sector.Popular culture’s catering to the wealthy may also decline in this downturn. We can expect a shift away from the lionizing of fancy restaurants, for example, and toward more use of public libraries. Such changes tend to occur in downturns, but this time they may be especially pronounced.Recessions and depressions, of course, are not good for mental health. But it is less widely known that in the United States and other affluent countries, physical health seems to improve, on average, during a downturn. Sure, it’s stressful to miss a paycheck, but eliminating the stresses of a job may have some beneficial effects. Perhaps more important, people may take fewer car trips, thus lowering the risk of accidents, and spend less on alcohol and tobacco. They also have more time for exercise and sleep, and tend to choose home cooking over fast food.In a 2003 paper, “Healthy Living in Hard Times,” Christopher J. Ruhm, an economist at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, found that the death rate falls as unemployment rises. In the United States, he found, a 1 percent increase in the unemployment rate, on average, decreases the death rate by 0.5 percent.David Potts studied the social history of Australia in the 1930s in his 2006 book, “The Myth of the Great Depression.” Australia’s suicide rate spiked in 1930, but overall health improved and death rates declined; after 1930, suicide rates declined as well.While he found in interviews that many people reminisced fondly about those depression years, we shouldn’t rush to conclude that depressions are happy times.Many of their reports are likely illusory, as documented by the Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert in his best-selling book “Stumbling on Happiness.” According to Professor Gilbert, people often have rosy memories of very trying periods, which may include extreme poverty or fighting in a war.In today’s context, we are also suffering fear and anxiety for the rather dubious consolation of having some interesting memories for the distant future.But this downturn will likely mean a more prudent generation to come. That is implied by the work of two professors, Ulrike Malmendier of the University of California, Berkeley, and Stefan Nagel of the Stanford Business School, in a 2007 paper, “Depression Babies: Do Macroeconomic Experiences Affect Risk-Taking?”A generation that grows up in a period of low stock returns is likely to take an unusually cautious approach to investing, even decades later, the paper found. Similarly, a generation that grows up with high inflation will be more cautious about buying bonds decades later.IN other words, today’s teenagers stand less chance of making foolish decisions in the stock market down the road. They are likely to forgo some good business opportunities, but also to make fewer mistakes.When all is said and done, something terrible has happened in the United States economy, and no one should wish for such an event. But a deeper look at the downturn, and the social changes it is bringing, shows a more complex picture.In addition to trying to get out of the recession — our first priority — many of us will be making do with less and relying more on ourselves and our families. The social changes may well be the next big story of this recession.'"

"'09-02-01,'0','EFRAIN RODRIGUEZ, a 42-year-old father of two who lives in Bedford Park in the Bronx, has a routine five days a week involving his 6-year-old daughter, Lauren, his 11-year-old son, Sam, and the Bx34 bus. Every morning, Mr. Rodriguez gets the children to Public School 8, on Briggs Avenue, by 8 a.m., and he picks them up there every afternoon.“I use it a lot,” he said of the Bx34, after exiting the bus near 194th Street on Thursday afternoon. “Sometimes three to four times a day, if I have to go to the hospital.”Mr. Rodriguez worked as a superintendent on the Upper West Side until he lost his job after suffering a stroke last March and moved his family to the Bronx to live with his mother-in-law. He sees a neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center, along the bus’s route, and will soon begin weekly physical therapy.“It’s a very important line for me and my kids,” he said of the Bx34.But Mr. Rodriguez may soon need to find another ride. The Bx34 is one of 21 buses throughout the city that are candidates for elimination this spring because of a projected deficit in the budget of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of well over $1 billion.“The M.T.A. is very numbers- orientated,” said Gene Russianoff, a lawyer with the Straphangers Campaign, which advocates for improvements in transit. “You get a sense of how little a feel for the neighborhoods they serve. For them it’s an abstract line along the map, whereas for residents, it’s their supermarket, their church, the school or the park.”'"
"'09-02-01,'0','A FEW weeks ago I was sorting through a box of old papers and came across a group of letters from my late grandfather. Grandpa Bill, who lived in Texas, was a faithful correspondent. The letters, dozens of them, are almost all typewritten on a thin, delicate onionskin paper. Sometimes he wrote to all four of his grandchildren at once, making copies by sticking shiny sheets of carbon paper between each piece of stationery. How old-fashioned it seems today.The letters were affectionate and newsy and would update us on my grandparents’ health and travels, which rarely took them farther than the Texas hill country, about an hour from their home in Austin. I have only one handwritten epistle from my grandfather, and it begins with this: “Ordinarily I would use a typewriter for legibility if for nothing else, but Grandmother Lawson is asleep and the clatter of the typewriter would disturb her. I don’t like to do that as she needs all the rest she can get.”Even in mundane descriptions, my Grandpa Bill’s manner of speaking came through on the page. “The weather down here right now is awful,” he wrote one July. “It is Texas-hot. And I’ve heard it said that is hotter than the hinges of hell.” Or this, when he heard I had broken a bone: “I know a lot of sorry old people that I would not care a whit if they broke their arms, but you are certainly not in that class nor one of them.”I don’t know if he meant to make me laugh with this line of comfort, but he did, because it sounded so much like his irreverent self. Or there was this, after a lengthy description of someone he was worried about: “If I were a religious man I would pray for him. But I’m not.”When I got married in New York, my grandparents were not well enough to travel to our wedding. But I so wanted my new husband to meet them that not long after returning from our honeymoon, we traveled to Texas to see them. Austin in August, while it might not be quite “the hinges of hell” that my grandfather described, was not for the faint-hearted. It was unbearably humid, yet my husband insisted on wearing a tie and jacket on the plane ride down. He wanted to make a good impression. And sure enough, there was my grandpa at the gate, himself in a suit and tie, but with the addition of a Stetson. He shook my husband’s hand vigorously, announcing, “I like the look of you, boy!”There were moments on that trip when I thought we would have the shortest marriage on record, and I am referring specifically to those times when my grandfather was driving us around Texas to show us the countryside. He was about 84 then, and his vision and reflexes had deteriorated considerably. Once, when we were careening down the highway, he commented randomly, “I love those red cars,” and after a pause added, “ ’cause you can see them.” After that, either my husband or I would pipe up: “Look, Grandpa! A blue car!” or “Here comes a green one!”'"
"'09-02-01,'0','Beyond this, however, the two men generally parted company. Darwin was a scientist and a ruthlessly inductive thinker who formulated his hypotheses over 25 years of painstaking observation of plants, animals and fossils. Spencer, by contrast, was a deductive polymath who prided himself on his ability to spin all-encompassing theories out of limited information. Spencer believed that his “universal law of evolution” could apply to everything in the cosmos, including human psychology, language, morality, race, government and society.Perhaps their biggest difference, however, was the issue of teleology, or ­whether evolutionary development implied a design or purpose. “The forces behind Darwinian evolution were random, mindless, blind, but for Spencer survival of the fittest also meant survival of the best, suggesting a cosmic value system,” Werth writes. “Progress wasn’t accidental; it was imperative, even programmed.” As Andrew Carnegie, the steel baron, philanthropist and Spencer acolyte, liked to say, “All is well since all grows better.” Or in the sharper tones of the Yale political economist William Graham Sumner, “A drunkard in the gutter is just where he ought to be.”It was Spencer’s wide-ranging attempts to apply the concept of organic evolution to society, rather than Darwin’s more cautious and narrow theories of biological change, that caught fire in the competitive, by-your-own bootstraps atmosphere of post-Civil War America. As Edward Livingston Youmans, the founder of The Popular Science Monthly and Spencer’s main American promoter, often observed, much of what was called Darwinism in the United States should actually be called Spencerism. This was especially true of what has become known, often pejoratively, as “social Darwinism,” or “the anti-philanthropic, anti-meddling side” of Spencer’s legacy, in Youmans’s words. Even so, by 1880 Spencer’s American followers had declared victory over Darwin in the race for popular influence.I am hesitant to complain of any book that could make the abstruse debates of a dozen dyspeptic eggheads read like an intellectual thriller. Werth is a gifted writer, and his subject is especially important in our current economic crisis, as Americans are reassessing their belief that social progress will grow naturally out of unfettered free-market competition.Yet complain I will. By keeping such tight hold on one portion of intellectual history — the thinkers thinking — Werth lets the other two aspects slip from his grasp: why and how average people absorbed these ideas into their lives and the worth of the ideas themselves. As a narrator, Werth never pauses the action long enough to step back, sum up and compare the barrage of complex and contradictory ideas. We never get the benefit of the historian’s broader perspective. This absence is especially odd because Werth is terrific at explaining on the fly. He nimbly leads us through many historical thickets, including the causes of the economic depression of the 1870s, the switchbacks of federal Indian policy, three thorny presidential elections and one presidential assassination.The lack of extended asides matters less when discussing the relatively straightforward conflict between Darwinism and religion. The Deistic Darwinians state their position thus: “We know of old that God was so wise that he could make all things; but behold he is so much wiser than even that, that he can make all things make themselves.” To which the atheists and the Biblical literalists reply: “Well, I just don’t see it.” Another stalemate in the eternal battle between belief and unbelief.But this lack of wider perspective matters a great deal as we get to the social and political implications of Spencerism. It quickly becomes clear that the concept of “the survival of the fittest” gives license to a multitude of contradictory views and schemes. It could be (and was) used to argue for both the extermination and the assimilation of the Native American population; it was the rhetorical weapon of both the imperialist and the pacifist, the government regulator and the laissez-faire businessman, the eugenicist and the caregiver.As Worth’s book reaches its climax, this lack of perspective weakens the suspense he works so hard to create. Without occasional authorial guidance, it is difficult to decide which ideas — and thus which thinkers — to root for. We don’t feel the intellectual noose tightening, because we never tally up which logic falls apart, which theories are discredited by closer observation and which are disastrous in actual application. Werth closes with a stirring account of a famous banquet in New York in late November 1882. Scores of America’s leading men jammed into Delmonico’s Restaurant to officially declare Herbert Spencer the greatest thinker of the 19th century. Darwin had been dead only six months, but in the panegyric he prepared for the evening Edward Youmans placed the flag of Spencer’s victory squarely on Darwin’s grave. Charles Darwin, Youmans proclaimed, will remain “the most distinguished naturalist of the age, but Mr. Spencer will abide the honor of complete originality in developing this greatest conception of modern times, if not, indeed, of all time.” Yet Werth never even gestures to the historical irony that it is Darwin whose reputation lives on, while Spencer has been almost entirely forgotten. After all, it was Spencer himself who insisted that survival is prima facie proof of superiority.'"
"'09-02-01,'0','But there were not enough takers, said Mr. Getman, adding that soon after, the stock market crashed, sapping the endowment of the club, which has 14,000 members, who need a nod from existing members to get in. Almost all do.Historically, they paid $40 for four years, if they were students, and $275 a year, if they were recent alumni living in the area. But older alums — those who graduated before 1973 and who make up the bulk of the membership — could pay just $15 and be set for life, a policy that Mr. Getman said had kept the club’s coffers empty.If a rescue fund were to be created, Mory’s, located in a two-story Greek Revival building with peeling paint, might get a makeover.At the top of the list is a plan to build a bar where people can just drop in for a casual drink, Mr. Getman said, if they don’t feel like swilling from a silver-plated loving cup filled with orange juice and Champagne, which is one of Mory’s signature beverages, and one that’s usually enjoyed communally.And rarebit, however enduring, might vanish.“No one’s wanted to talk about the elephant in the room here, and that’s the quality of the food,” said Mr. Getman, adding that hiring a new chef “could improve the quality of the product.”But the menu may only be partly to blame for Mory’s demise. Indeed, the list of explanations can seem as voluminous as the number of names carved in the club’s wooden tabletops.One is that students don’t like the tie-and-jacket dinner dress code, though that was relaxed a decade ago so guests could wear collared shirts to dinner, Mr. Getman said. Another complaint is that when Connecticut raised the drinking age to 21 from 18 in the 1980s, a huge portion of Yale’s undergraduates could no longer legally imbibe at Mory’s, which hurt business.In the last few years, Mory’s has faced competition from the growing number of eating and drinking establishments that have cropped up in the downtown. “If they had kept up with the times, they would probably still be here,” said James Cuticello, a clerk at J. Press, a clothing store that has been in the city since 1902. “It was just hard to keep up with the diversity of restaurants.”Yet the push to improve downtown New Haven may come at the expense of mainstay businesses, said Kate Hay, who works at Labyrinth Books.“It’s another New Haven institution down the tubes,” said Ms. Hay, citing the closing of the Yankee Doodle coffee shop a year ago and before that, the Yale Co-op bookstore.Yalies looking for an off-campus club experience don’t have to panic just yet.Eight other member-based organizations have offered to welcome displaced Mory’s members into their dining rooms, including the Graduate Club on Elm Street, where patrons can eat prime rib under the gaze of former Yale presidents, whose portraits hang there.And at a school where secret societies are still a draw, interest in exclusive organizations may not be dead, according to Aaron Voloj, 22, a first-year law student who enjoyed a steak salad at Mory’s just days before it closed.“I’m disappointed,” Mr. Voloj said, “because I was planning on spending more time there next semester.”'"

"'09-02-02,'0','Americans know by now that intelligence experts had a lot on Osama bin Laden and didn’t do enough to stop him. This documentary focuses on the N.S.A.’s sins of omission in particular, citing examples from the time when this agency would not let even the C.I.A. see the raw data it gleaned from intercepted phone calls and e-mail messages. But the film doesn’t explain why the information was withheld, which is the more important lesson.Mark Rossini, a former F.B.I. supervisory agent who, before 9/11, was assigned to a C.I.A. task force investigating Al Qaeda, describes how his boss at the C.I.A. did not allow him to share information with his superiors at the bureau about two terrorist suspects roaming around San Diego. Mr. Rossini blames himself for not disregarding those orders, but neither he nor the filmmakers try to piece together why the C.I.A. didn’t trust the F.B.I. with the information in the first place.The film’s main focus is the National Security Agency itself, a huge, shadowy bureaucracy headquartered near Baltimore that is charged, as the narrator puts it, with “making and breaking codes; tapping in to foreign signals — sifting through the international phone calls, e-mails, text and instant messages that blanket the modern world.”Mr. Bamford, who is interviewed in the film seated at a computer next to a crackling fireplace, makes the case that the government’s decision after 9/11 to extend the agency’s surveillance to American citizens without a court warrant violates a citizen’s “reasonable expectation of privacy.”But his strongest argument is that the agency is already so overwhelmed by the flood of raw data that comes in daily that broadening its surveillance mandate will not make it any more effective in detecting terrorist activity.At one point Mr. Bamford seems intent on single-handedly testing the N.S.A.’s entire counterterrorism system: from an Internet cafe in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, he sends an e-mail message to a “Nova” producer larded with a few of the key phrases that the agency’s supercomputers are programmed to detect. They aren’t exactly cryptic: “Blow up the White House” is one, another is “Destroy the Capitol Building.”“Nova” does an excellent job of illustrating how that message — and thousands of others — is turned into pulses of light and sent via fiber-optic cables across Asia and the Pacific Ocean, through San Luis Obispo, Calif., and into an AT&T office in San Francisco. It turns out that the only way to catch huge masses of digital data is to tap into the cables directly — the film says that the agency has a secret office in the same building where it can examine all messages, domestic and foreign. (Those, according to the narrator, include “cries and laughter, hopes and dreams, e-mails, faxes, bank statements, hotel reservations, love poems and death notices.”)But Mr. Bamford does not answer his own question, namely, whether the Kuala Lumpur test message was ever picked up by an N.S.A. supercomputer. Of course, if the agency did pick it up, it wouldn’t say. If history is any guide, it might not even share it with the C.I.A. or the F.B.I.On most PBS stations on Tuesday night (check local listings).Directed and produced by C.

"'09-02-02,'0','And this prejudice in favor of private control, even when the government is putting up all the money, seems to be warping the administration’s response to the .Now, something must be done to shore up the financial system. The chaos after failed showed that letting major financial institutions collapse can be very bad for the economy’s health. And a number of major institutions are dangerously close to the edge.So need more capital. In normal times, banks raise capital by selling stock to private investors, who receive a share in the bank’s ownership in return. You might think, then, that if banks currently can’t or won’t raise enough capital from private investors, the government should do what a private investor would: provide capital in return for partial ownership.But bank are worth so little these days — and have a combined market value of only $52 billion — that the ownership wouldn’t be partial: pumping in enough taxpayer money to make the banks sound would, in effect, turn them into publicly owned enterprises.My response to this prospect is: so? If taxpayers are footing the bill for rescuing the banks, why shouldn’t they get ownership, at least until private buyers can be found? But the Obama administration appears to be tying itself in knots to avoid this outcome.If news reports are right, the bank rescue plan will contain two main elements: government purchases of some troubled bank assets and guarantees against losses on other assets. The guarantees would represent a big gift to bank stockholders; the purchases might not, if the price was fair — but prices would, The Financial Times reports, probably be based on “valuation models” rather than market prices, suggesting that the government would be making a big gift here, too.And in return for what is likely to be a huge subsidy to stockholders, taxpayers will get, well, nothing.Will there at least be limits on , to prevent more of the rip-offs that have enraged the public? President Obama denounced Wall Street bonuses in his latest weekly address — but according to The Washington Post, “the administration is likely to refrain from imposing tougher restrictions on executive compensation at most firms receiving government aid” because “harsh limits could discourage some firms from asking for aid.” This suggests that Mr. Obama’s tough talk is just for show.Meanwhile, Wall Street’s culture of excess seems to have been barely dented by the crisis. “Say I’m a banker and I created $30 million. I should get a part of that,” one banker told The . And if you’re a banker and you destroyed $30 billion? Uncle Sam to the rescue!There’s more at stake here than fairness, although that matters too. Saving the economy is going to be very expensive: that $800 billion is probably just a down payment, and rescuing the financial system, even if it’s done right, is going to cost hundreds of billions more. We can’t afford to squander money giving huge windfalls to banks and their executives, merely to preserve the illusion of private ownership.'"
"'09-02-02,'0','Also lost in the wrangling over the huge House economic measure were two programs for the poor that are in urgent need of Congressional attention: legal services and access to family planning.The proven national program of civil legal aid for impoverished Americans, created in the 1960s, is suffering from multiple blows in funding. While the poor are caught increasingly by foreclosure, eviction and food-stamp fights for their daily bread, deficit-bedeviled statehouses across the country are cutting support for legal services or dropping the programs outright.Creative funding that taps lawyers’ escrow accounts has evaporated because it is tied to the Fed’s fading interest rate. Local governments, charities and pro bono law firms are similarly tight-pursed. Scores of legal aid societies are cutting their staffs just as requests for help are booming, according to The Times’s Erik Eckholm.Bar associations continue to help, and even in these tough times probably could do more. But federal funding is the ultimate hope in a dire situation. In 2008, Congress chipped in $350 million for the nonprofit Legal Services Corporation, which then distributed the money throughout the country. Given the tough times — underfunded programs and ever more desperate clients — more money is needed. Congress still has the opportunity to renew the regular appropriation in a coming omnibus budget bill, but it must bolster that with extra support for the program.At the same time, it was distressing to see President Obama strip Medicaid coverage of family planning services out of the House economic package at the last minute in what turned out to be a futile effort to secure Republican support for the huge recovery bill.Under current law, states wanting to use Medicaid money for family planning services, including cancer screenings, must obtain a waiver from Washington, as some 27 states have done. The modest provision that was cut would have done away with the cumbersome process. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the measure would provide coverage to 2.3 million women by 2014 and save $200 million over five years.'"
"'09-02-02,'0','The Senate will debate its version of the mammoth stimulus and recovery package this week. As with last week’s version, passed by the House, there will be considerable argument between Democrats and Republicans over what belongs in the bill.One serious disagreement has already taken place — between Senate leaders and the Obama administration — and it has been decided in a way that can only weaken the overall package. The senators had planned to make foreclosure relief part of the bill, by including a measure to let bankrupt homeowners have their modified under court protection.But administration officials — who say they support the bankruptcy fix — rejected the idea of putting it in the bill out of fear that it would cause Republicans to delay or reject the package. So barring a free-for-all rewrite of the bill on the Senate floor, the fix is out and the relief will be postponed at least until the spring, when the measure could be attached to other legislation.The delay is a shame. made concessions to Republicans in the House — and not one voted for urgent economic stimulus and recovery programs.This economic crisis started with bad mortgage , and the resulting defaults and foreclosures have only worsened as house prices have plunged. The bankruptcy fix is the linchpin of effective foreclosure relief. Unless foreclosures are stanched, the economy will deteriorate further and faster than any stimulus can hope to overcome. That is because foreclosures are flooding the already glutted market with homes for sale at rock bottom prices, driving prices down virtually everywhere. The more prices fall, the more defaults rise, because homeowners with little or no equity have no cushion to fall back on if — for any reason — they have trouble making their payments.'"
"'09-02-02,'0','Just as millions of Americans saved copies of newspapers on the day after President Obama’s election, television executives are hoping that consumers will want digital memories of Inauguration Day. ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC are all selling DVDs of the day’s festivities through online stores.So far, there is little evidence that they are being bought with the same fervor that drove up newsstand sales on Nov. 5. Although executives say they have modest expectations for sales, they predict some people will want a visual record of the day.Val Nicholas, a vice president for the NBC Agency, recalled that his father had owned records of John F. Kennedy’s speeches. “He played those until the grooves wore out,” Mr. Nicholas said, adding that “we felt there would be that same sort of feeling around this inauguration.”The lines at newsstands on Nov. 5, the day after Election Day, were an indication that media companies could capitalize on the public fascination with Mr. Obama’s election.To meet expected demand, newspapers printed extra copies the day after the inauguration as well. USA Today, which reports a normal circulation of 2.3 million, said it sold an additional 600,000 copies on Jan. 21.'"
"'09-02-02,'0','The idea is that, free from the burden of carrying these bad assets, banks would start lending again and bolster the faltering economy. The bad bank set up by the government would, over time, sell the assets and recover some or most of what it had paid.While the government is considering several approaches to helping the banks, including more capital injections, buying or insuring toxic assets is likely to be a centerpiece. Determining the right price for these assets is crucial to success. Placing too low a value would force institutions selling and others holding similar investments to register crushing losses that could deplete their capital and make it harder for them to increase lending.But inflated values would bail out the companies, their shareholders and executives at the expense of taxpayers, who would swallow the losses if the government could not recoup what it had paid.Some critics of the plan warn that the government should not buy the assets, because banks will try to get too high a price and leave taxpayers holding the bag.“To date, the banks have stuck their heads in the sand,” said Lynn E. Turner, a former chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission, “and demanded that they be paid the price of good apples for bad apples.”But many believe that, given the depth of the problem and the fact that it keeps getting worse, the government has little choice.Finance experts from Wall Street and academia are advising the administration on other options. To sidestep the thorny valuation problem, some have suggested that the bad bank acquire only assets that have already been marked down significantly and guarantee other assets, but officials would have just as difficult a task in determining how much to charge for insuring risky assets.Economists predict that the cost of the program will most likely exceed the $350 billion remaining in the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program that Congress approved in October.They say the Obama administration may need upwards of $1 trillion in additional aid for banks — on top of the more than $800 billion the administration is seeking in an economic stimulus measure moving through Congress.Many in Washington question whether the rescue has achieved its goal of stabilizing the financial markets. A report by the Government Accountability Office on Friday concluded that whether the bailout program had been effective might never be known.“While the package helped avoid a financial collapse, many are frustrated by the results — and rightfully so,” President Obama said in his weekly address on Saturday. “Too often taxpayer dollars have been spent without transparency or accountability. Banks have been extended a hand, but homeowners, students, and small businesses that need loans have been left to fend on their own.”Mr. Obama and many lawmakers have expressed anger that banks that received the first batch of aid money do not appear to have increased their lending significantly, even as some firms have spent billions on bonuses, corporate jets and other perks. In two weeks the House will hold a hearing to ask chief executives of the eight largest banks about their spending controls.As early as this week, the Treasury Department may impose new limits on the executive pay of companies receiving financial assistance. The Oversight Panel created by Congress to monitor the program is also expected to publish a report this week looking at whether the government paid too much to the large banks that they have provided with assistance.A frequent refrain in Washington and on Wall Street is that there are no current market prices for toxic securities. But people who buy and sell these investments say that is a simplistic reading of the problem. They say most kinds of securities can be valued and are being traded, but trading has slowed as sellers and buyers disagree about what that the price should be.The value of these securities is based on the future cash flow they provide to investors. To determine that, traders have to make assumptions about the housing market and the economy: How high will the unemployment rate go in the coming years? How many borrowers will default? What will homes be worth?The Standard & Poor’s group, Market, Credit and Risk Strategies, which operates independently from the company’s credit ratings business, has been studying troubled securities for investors and banks. The bond that is trading at 38 cents provides a vivid illustration of the dilemma in valuing these assets.The bond is backed by 9,000 second mortgages used by borrowers who put down little or no money to buy homes. Nearly a quarter of the loans are delinquent, and losses on defaulted mortgages are averaging 40 percent. The security once had a top rating, triple-A.Michael G. Thompson, a managing director at the S.& P. group, says his computer models can easily calculate what the bond is worth under different situations. “This is not rocket science, this is straight bond math,” he said. But determining what the future holds is much harder. “We are not masters of the universe who can predict the macroeconomic environment,” he addedSome would-be buyers of these assets fear that a deep recession could drive up default rates and push down home prices much further. They also worry that a cataclysm like the failure of a big bank could send prices tumbling again, just as the collapse of Lehman Brothers did in September. Others see no reason to bid up prices because those who need to sell are desperate.Big banks and other owners of mortgage investments have argued that the low market prices reflect fire sales. Many have classified such securities as level-three assets, for which accounting rules allow them to determine values using computer models rather than the marketplace. Mr. Thompson estimates that at the end of September financial firms had $600 billion in such hard-to-value assets.But critics like Mr. Turner say that the banks’ accounting for these assets cannot be trusted because they have an incentive to use optimistic assumptions.In some instances, the government has guaranteed losses on certain assets for big, systemically important companies like Citigroup and Bank of America.Policy makers have found such arrangements appealing because they do not require upfront payments and they can be customized for each bank, Douglas J. Elliott, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a recent paper.Still, government guarantees need to be based on sound valuations, Mr. Elliott and others say. If the government underestimates the risks of default, taxpayers could eventually lose tens of billions of dollars. The cost of insuring such assets in the private market is often several times greater than the price the government is charging banks.Whatever approach the Obama administration takes, investors and policy makers say it should provide more and clearer information about the health of banks and the risks that the government is taking.Many analysts do not trust what they are told about the quality of the securities and loans held by banks and other financial firms. Most banks provide only a very general description of their holdings, because they consider the information privileged.But the government, using its power as a big investor, could compel the banks to divulge more specific data, without giving away the names of individual bonds or loans, analysts said. The market could then do its own analysis on what the assets are worth.“At least it would give the government one objective measure of the value of these assets,” said Anthony Lembke, co-head of investments at MKP Capital Management, a hedge fund firm that is a big investor in mortgages. “In the absence of transparency and clarity, investors are going to assume a value that will be conservative and then add a risk premium.”'"
"'09-02-02,'0','SANTA , Calif. (AP) — Border Patrol agents working about 100 miles north of the Mexican border say they have been given arrest quotas at odds with agency practices and threatened with punishment if they failed to meet the number.Agents stationed in Riverside reported being ordered to make at least 150 arrests of suspected illegal immigrants in January, two of which must lead to prosecutions, said Lombardo Amaya, president of Local 2554 of the National Border Patrol Council.“They were told if you don’t produce this, we will have to change your weekends off,” Mr. Amaya said, adding that he would discuss the matter Monday with the sector chief. “Sometimes, like in politics, this agency is about looking good.”An agency spokesman in Washington, Lloyd Easterling, said quotas ran counter to agency practice, which does not set a minimum number of arrests.“If we had quotas to fill and met those quotas,” Mr. Easterling said, “then would that mean we would be able to stop doing our job? No. Our job is to secure the border and detect, deter and apprehend anyone who is involved in illegal activity between the ports of entry.”Jeffrey Calhoon, chief patrol agent for the El Centro sector, which covers Imperial and Riverside Counties, said he was not aware of any quotas.'"
"'09-02-02,'0','There was something about hearing John Adams conduct young artists at the Juilliard School in a concert performance on Saturday night of his opera “The Death of Klinghoffer” that allowed this searing, mystical and ambitious work to come through without the doctrinaire baggage that has attached to it over the years.With a libretto by Alice Goodman, the opera tells of the 1985 hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro by Palestinian terrorists, including the ruthless murder of Leon Klinghoffer, a Jewish American passenger in a wheelchair. At its American premiere in September 1991 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, six months after the world premiere in Brussels, “The Death of Klinghoffer” was attacked by those who felt that the creators had allowed the hijackers to vent perceived injustices in their own sympathetic voices, and that Klinghoffer, his wife Marilyn and several European passengers were depicted as stereotypical self-absorbed Westerners.Bad timing contributed to the controversy. The American premiere came in the wake of the Persian Gulf war. Given its contentious and tragic subject matter, the opera is probably doomed to provoke controversy, as Michael Steinberg suggested in liner notes for the 1992 recording. Evoking the ancient religious and territorial conflicts that drove this hijacking, Mr. Steinberg, in a chilling prediction, wrote, “We can read about them in the Old Testament, and guaranteed, on whichever day you read these words, there will be some new installment in the morning paper.”The performance, by the Juilliard Opera Center, the Juilliard Orchestra and the Concert Chorale of New York, was attended by Peter Sellars, who directed the original production and was involved in the work from its inception. It concluded Juilliard’s 2009 Focus! festival, which explored new music from California over the last century. Somehow the performers here, too young to have been aware of the polemics the opera initially incited, brought unjaded involvement and affecting commitment to their work.It must have been inspiring for the orchestra players to perform this multilayered, complex and elusive score under Mr. Adams’s direction. And seeing these real-life, hard-bitten characters portrayed by singers so full of talent and promise brought a humanizing poignancy to the drama: the steadfast baritone Brian Leerhuber as the ship’s beleaguered captain, who struggles to end the siege peacefully; the youthful baritone Nicholas Pallesen as the paralyzed Klinghoffer, who courageously denounces the terrorists from his wheelchair; the earthy mezzo-soprano Jennifer Hines as Marilyn Klinghoffer, afflicted with cancer yet tirelessly devoted to caring for her husband; and especially the charismatic baritone Kelly Markgraf as Mamoud, the most conflicted of the Palestinian hijackers though a young man steeped in ancient hatreds.The creators have long maintained that “The Death of Klinghoffer” is as much a dramatic oratorio, like a Bach Passion, as an opera. Much of the action, including the killing of Klinghoffer, takes place offstage and is reported in conversations between the captain and his crew. Presenting the work in concert emphasized the reflective nature of the opera, which begins with a pair of somber, brooding, agitated choruses, giving voice first to exiled Palestinians, then to exiled Jews.As the Palestinians tell of their suffering, the vocal lines in the chorus are set with elegiac lyricism, rich with melismas that extend the phrases exotically. The orchestra churns quietly yet nervously beneath, as a lacy, restless violin line threads through the music until the last phrases, when the Palestinians vent their anger, and the music erupts with jagged, pummeling, harmonically piercing fury. The choral writing for the exiled Jews is thickly textured, enshrouded with luminous yet pointedly astringent harmonies.One scene seemed especially timely in the face of the roiling Gaza war. Mamoud tells the captain of the brutality his family has faced, his mother driven away during a raid, his brother decapitated. In poignantly earnest music the captain tells Mamoud, “I think if you could talk like this/Sitting among your enemies/Peace would come.” With chilly resignation, Mamoud answers that the day that he and his enemies sit together, each “putting his case” and working toward peace, “That day our hope dies/And I shall die too.” Mamoud is a man whose identity is bound up with endless struggle and hatred.People will always react to this opera with strong feelings and partisanship. The creators understand this. They claim no special insights into the issues and the history.

"'09-02-02,'0','The turnout appeared to reflect confusion over voting procedures as well as voter apathy. There were complaints across the country from Iraqis who had tried to vote but were unable to do so. Most were prevented either because a strict curfew prevented them from reaching their polling center or because their names were not on the center’s voter roll when they got there.Part of the problem was caused by the large number of internally displaced Iraqis who no longer live in the province where they are registered to vote. About one million Iraqis were displaced as a result of sectarian and ethnic fighting over the past five years, and while some have returned the majority are living outside their home province.It was too early to tell whether those people who were unable to vote would seek redress or resort to violence — or simply resign themselves to not having a voice.Most parties said they were not planning to contest the results, at least for now, though a few, including the Iraqi Front for National Dialogue, said they had not ruled it out.While official results of how many seats each party won are still several days off, interviews with election officials in a number of provinces as well as independent observers and representatives of political parties indicated that Mr. Maliki’s Dawa Party gained electoral support in most provinces. The party’s television channel said it had won in Baghdad and Basra.However, that seemed to mean that the party received more votes than other parties but not necessarily a majority.The Dawa Party’s claim was corroborated by its strongest competitor in the south, the , which previously controlled Baghdad. Its television network said it had not won Baghdad or Basra.Maithem Hussein, the head of an nongovernment organization tracking the election in Basra, said Mr. Maliki’s victory there was expected. “Maliki has saved Basra from militias,” he said. “Basra owes him.”Although the Supreme Council, which relied on its Shiite religious identity during the campaign, lost seats in several provinces, it was still among the top three or four vote-getters in most provinces south of Baghdad.Other incumbent parties also had strong showings in multiple provinces, including the secular Iraqi National List led by , a former interim prime minister; the Iraqi Islamic Party led by Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, a Sunni; and the nominally independent parties backed by the Shiite cleric .Several politicians said the strong showing by Mr. Allawi’s party was notable. “This really reflects that Iraqi society is looking for alternatives — they do not necessarily believe that the Islamists should lead the country,” said Qassim Daoud, a member of Parliament and one of the leaders of an independent, secular-leaning party. “The public are interested in services, and this election has shown them that they can change anything by democratic means if they are not satisfied.”Members of another independent party, the National Reformation Movement, expressed similar views. “At least we will get some seats and we will make alliances with other blocs,” said Moad al-Obaidi, a party member.Some party officials blamed the electoral commission for failing to make the registration system simpler. The commission defended its procedure and said it was a trade-off between a completely accessible system and one with integrity, said Ayad Hillal al-Kinani, a commission member. He said people had 45 days to change their registration. An effort was made to direct people to the correct voting center by posting signs near the offices of local food-ration agents explaining the location of voting centers. All Iraqis receive a basket of monthly food rations, a holdover from the era of .Frustrated with the government and disillusioned with its performance over the past four years, a number of people appeared to have decided to skip voting altogether. “I did not vote because I could not find a qualified candidate that I can trust — all those candidates came for their personal benefits,” said Maher Naji, 37, a day laborer in Falluja.The Falluja area of Anbar Province had one of the lowest turnouts in the country, with some estimates that only 25 percent of eligible voters went to the polls. Over all, the province had extremely low turnout and the new tribal parties that believed they would do well were furious that their main competitor, the religious Iraqi Islamic Party, appeared to have once again won a large number of seats.Ahmed Abu Risha, a powerful tribesman in Anbar Province and the brother of one of the founders of the Awakening councils, which joined the Americans to fight Islamic insurgents, said he believed that the turnout was lower than the 40 percent announced by the election commission and that the numbers were being manipulated by the Iraqi Islamic Party. “If the Islamic Party wins, it will be another ,” he said.'"

"'09-02-03,'1','CAMBRIDGE, England — A protester threw an athletic shoe at the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, during his speech at Cambridge University’s concert hall on Monday, seven weeks after a similar incident involving President Bush in Iraq. The shoe missed Mr. Wen by at least 30 feet, but security officials promptly escorted the protester from the hall.The police arrested the man on suspicion of a public order offense. Witnesses described him as a goateed European in his 20s or 30s speaking foreign-accented English. They said he blew a whistle as Mr. Wen spoke, causing him to pause and look up. “You should be ashamed of yourselves,” the man said, according to witnesses. “How can you listen to the lies he’s telling?” he shouted, in a video of the incident shown on Sky News television.Mr. Wen appeared unruffled. Some in the audience said he called the protest “despicable.” Others said that when he resumed the speech, to an audience of Chinese government ministers, university officials and students, he assured them that “the relations between Britain and China” would not be affected by the protest. A police spokeswoman gave no other details about the protester, Reuters reported.The incident occurred on the last day of a three-day trip to Britain by Mr. Wen focusing on talks with Prime Minister Gordon Brown aimed at increasing trade between the nations.Human rights groups gathered outside the hall before the speech, protesting Chinese policies in Tibet and other suspected abuses. University officials said that those allowed into the hall had been carefully vetted, and that most were students or professors at the university.“Cambridge is a place where ideas are put into play, not shoes,” the vice chancellor, Alison Richard, told the BBC.'"

"'09-02-03,'1','Saying he feared a riot, a police officer at least twice asked Mr. Feiner to get down from the box. Mr. Feiner refused and was arrested on the misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct, found guilty by a judge and sentenced to 30 days in jail.The conviction was upheld by two New York State appellate courts, and on Jan. 15, 1951, the United States Supreme Court followed suit by a 6-to-3 vote. Writing for the majority in Feiner v. New York, Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson said that he had no objection to the content of Mr. Feiner’s remarks, but that the reaction they engendered justified his arrest and conviction.A dissenting opinion by Justice Hugo Black said that Mr. Feiner’s arrest resulted from his “deliberate defiance” of an arbitrary command and nothing else.“I understand that people in totalitarian countries must obey arbitrary orders,” Justice Black wrote. “I had hoped that there was no such duty in the United States.”The legal principle involved came to be known as the “heckler’s veto,” meaning that a disruptive listener could effectively stop a controversial speaker by threatening havoc. Over time, the Supreme Court’s 1951 decision, which put public peace ahead of freedom of expression, was superseded by nearly opposite judgments in later cases.“The court abandoned the approach that the expression of mere ideas themselves could be punished as fighting words leading to breaches of the peace,” Jack Levin and Gordana Rabrenovic wrote in the journal American Behavioral Scientist in 2001.Irving Hyman Feiner was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 23, 1924, to immigrants from Poland who ran a candy store. He grew up in Harlem and the Bronx and dropped out of high school to serve in the Army in Europe in World War II. After the war, he attended Syracuse University on the G.I. Bill.He was a junior, and active in a leftist organization called the Young Progressives of America, when the group invited O. John Rogge, a former United States assistant attorney general, to speak. Mr. Rogge was part of the defense team for a group of black men accused of killing an elderly white shopkeeper in Trenton.Called the Trenton Six, they were first sentenced to death by an all-white jury on the basis of confessions that later proved to be false. They became a celebrated cause of the left and civil rights groups. Eventually, four were acquitted, and two were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.Mr. Rogge and the folk singer Pete Seeger were scheduled to appear in a public school auditorium in Syracuse, but at the last moment Mayor Frank J. Costello revoked the permit. Mr. Feiner and others took to the streets with loudspeakers to promote attendance at the new location, the Hotel Syracuse.After his arrest, Mr. Feiner was expelled from Syracuse University, and his admission to several law schools was revoked. He went on to success in the printing, movie exhibition and tropical-fish businesses. He ran unsuccessfully for offices that included Rockland County executive, state assemblyman and mayor of Nyack, N.Y., where he lived. He wrote more than one cantankerous letter to newspapers.Mr. Feiner is survived by his wife of 58 years, the former Trudi Kramer; his daughters Susan Feiner and Emily Feiner; and five grandchildren. Another daughter, Rachael, died in 1971.He returned to Syracuse and finished the work for his undergraduate degree, which he received in 1984. In 2007, the university invited him back to lecture on free speech.'"
"'09-02-03,'1','“That’s what Sasha eats for lunch probably three times a week,” Mr. Obama said. “And, you know, I don’t want to have to worry about whether she’s going to get sick as a consequence to having her lunch.”The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said Friday that Mr. Obama would soon announce a new F.D.A. commissioner and other officials. Mr. Gibbs said they would put in place a “stricter regulatory structure” to prevent breakdowns in food-safety inspections.Part of the review is sure to examine whether the requirement for the peanut company’s approval caused delays in warnings about its products once public health officials became aware of significant problems at its plant in Blakely, Ga. The warning also covered products from the company’s customers that manufacture food, including Kellogg.A representative for the peanut company would not comment. Kris Charles, a Kellogg spokeswoman, said “Kellogg acted quickly and recalled potentially impacted products within hours” of the peanut company’s second recall announcement.More than 500 people have been sick in the outbreak of salmonella poisoning, and 8 have died. More than 430 product brands have been recalled.The delays meant Sarah Kirchner of Belle Plaine, Minn., whose two young children became ill from the outbreak, for weeks had no idea how to prevent a recurrence. Her 3-year-old son, Michael, was hospitalized for four days with intense pain in his head, neck and shoulders, she said.“He had a spinal tap, bone scan, M.R.I. and a CT scan,” Ms. Kirchner said. “I’m still so worried about him.”Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, said she had been asking top food and drug officials for years if they needed authority for ordering mandatory recalls.But the officials said companies cooperated when recalls were needed.“They can’t even get a press release out on this stuff without industry approval. It’s just unbelievable,” said Ms. DeLauro, who promised to offer legislation on Wednesday that would split the agency’s food oversight into a separate entity with mandatory recall authority and other powers.Public health officials pinpointed the Blakely plant as the source of the salmonella outbreak on Jan. 9. The peanut company announced a limited recall on Jan. 13 and expanded it on Jan. 16. The company waited until Jan. 28 before recalling all products made at the plant in 2007 and 2008, even though it had known since 2007 that tests of products showed contamination with salmonella.Food buyers and some top public health officials say they knew before any public announcement that the company’s products and those of its customers were the likeliest source of the outbreak.Craig Wilson, an assistant vice president at Costco, said he pulled Kellogg’s Keebler and Austin peanut butter crackers off shelves a day before Kellogg’s first announcement and nearly a week before the Peanut company and Kellogg issued a nationwide recall that covered those cookies.Mr. Wilson said he could not wait for the F.D.A. to make announcements about food problems that are widely known among food safety officials.“I don’t want to say that you can’t rely on the F.D.A.,” Mr. Wilson said, “but we certainly can move quicker than they do.”The F.D.A. can seize a product that it suspects is contaminated, and it can ask a federal judge for authority to recall products if a maker refuses to do so. The agency can also announce that it suspects problems with a product before the company agrees to a recall. But it rarely does any of these.Bill Marler, a food safety lawyer in Seattle, said the agency had neither the authority nor the courage it needed to keep the food supply safe.Michael R. Taylor, a former top official at the food agency, said change was needed.“F.D.A. negotiates communications about recalls with companies,” Mr. Taylor said, “and that sometimes leads to delays. Changing that dynamic when people are getting seriously ill and dying is something that ought to happen.”'"
"'09-02-03,'1','So maybe regulators should embrace the bonus culture too — for themselves. As crazy as that might sound, the idea came up here last week at the annual corporate schmooze-fest in Davos.Tony Tan Keng Yam, deputy chairman and executive director of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, suggested that one reason American regulators fell down on the job was that they were paid too little.“You must have as good people working in the government in the regulatory authorities as those that are working in the private sector,” Mr. Tan said. “You do need, particularly in these very difficult times, capable people in central banks, in government, in the Treasury who can effectively supervise.”Mr. Tan knows about this firsthand. He is a former regulator himself, and Singapore has a different view about compensation.“We pay our politicians and our government servants very well,” he said. “We lock remuneration to the market.”While Singapore’s watchdogs aren’t paid enough to afford private planes, some in top positions make seven-figure salaries.Granted, not everyone is motivated by money alone. People become teachers, doctors, engineers and, yes, financial regulators for all sorts of reasons.In the United States, many senior bankers move seamlessly between Wall Street and Washington. But in recent years, with Wall Street so flush, many young people didn’t give much thought to working for the government. The potential rewards on Wall Street were too good to pass up.Paying regulators a lot of money may not go down well with taxpayers, particularly given the outcry over bonuses on Wall Street. But while bankers are taking the brunt of the heat for the financial crisis, regulators may soon be taking blame, too.“God knows, some really stupid things were done by American banks,” Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said. “To policy makers, I say where were they? They approved all these banks.” His comment may seem self-serving, but many regulators privately acknowledged that they didn’t see the economic crisis coming.Other Wall Street denizens said the problem wasn’t regulators, but the misalignment of interests in their industry. “The government has gotten some very good people,” said Henry Kravis, the private equity king, “to work and do a very good job.”Perhaps the most controversial idea over how to fix the regulatory system was suggested over a private Shabbat dinner hosted by the Israeli president, Shimon Peres, on Friday: why not pay bonuses to regulators for ferreting out frauds like Mr. Madoff’s? The bonuses could be paid with the bounty of fines.Some at Davos thought the bonus idea could work. But anxiety over that approach was palpable. “They already treat us like criminals,” one hedge fund manager said.A few said giving bonuses to regulators would be like giving bonuses to the police for issuing speeding tickets. Maybe the regulators, like Wall Streeters, would start thinking about the money, rather than what is right. But maybe that’s exactly what Wall Street needs to slow down.'"
"'09-02-03,'1','Mayor Eddie Perez of Hartford, a Democrat, was arrested on Jan. 27 on bribery and other charges. For the good of the city, Mr. Perez should step aside while his case unfolds. Hartford, Connecticut’s capital, is the poorest city in the state and one of the poorest in the nation. It cannot afford a chief executive who has three years left on a four-year term and who is sure to be deeply distracted by the need to lodge a protracted legal defense.Mr. Perez says that he has done nothing wrong. He deserves a fair trial. Yet the well-being of his city is also at stake. Hartford is unlikely to attract the private investment or public help it so desperately needs while its chief executive is accused of corruption.Mr. Perez is the latest in a string of Connecticut officials — among them a governor, a state senator, a state treasurer and several mayors — who have been arrested for corruption in the last decade. Mr. Perez is alleged to have hired a city contractor to do thousands of dollars worth of home renovations in 2005 and not paid him until the authorities started asking questions two years later.The 25-page arrest affidavit quotes the contractor as saying he never expected payment for work on the mayor’s house, calling it the price of doing business with the city. The allegations, which surfaced in 2007, didn’t prevent Mr. Perez’s re-election to a third term.The charges are serious, and no matter the outcome, will take months or even years to resolve. In the mean time, Hartford deserves unblemished, undistracted leadership.One encouraging sign is that state, not federal officials, investigated Mr. Perez and brought the charges against him. For too long, Connecticut has failed to vigorously pursue homegrown corruption, leaving it to federal officials to investigate most serious allegations. More aggressive state enforcement would almost certainly lead to cleaner government.'"
"'09-02-03,'1','The reason to seize this particular moment to move with a laserlike focus on the infrastructure is because of the desperate need to stop the advancing rot, and because rebuilding the infrastructure is a phenomenal source of employment.The American Society of Civil Engineers, in a report released last week, essentially described the state of American infrastructure as dreadful. More than a quarter of the nation’s bridges were rated structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Public transportation systems and the nation’s dams and levees are generally in sorry shape, many of them more than a half-century old.Listen to what the report had to say about the water we drink:“America’s drinking water systems face an annual shortfall of at least $11 billion to replace aging facilities that are near the end of their useful life and to comply with existing and future federal water regulations. This does not account for growth in the demand for drinking water over the next 20 years. Leaking pipes lose an estimated seven billion gallons of clean drinking water a day.”The society gave the nation’s infrastructure an overall grade of D and said it would require an investment of $2.2 trillion over five years to get it back into decent shape.When you juxtapose this tremendous national need with the wholesale destruction of employment that has occurred over the past several months (and that is expected to continue for some time), you have to wonder why and Congressional leaders are not moving with extraordinary quickness to put together an infrastructure investment program that is both vast and visionary.Instead, we have infrastructure spending in the Democrats’ proposed that, while admirable, is far too meager to have much of an impact on the nation’s overall infrastructure requirements or the demand for the creation of jobs.Among those who have expressed their concerns publicly is Gov. Ed Rendell of , a Democrat and persistent advocate of infrastructure investment. Just prior to President Obama’s , Mr. Rendell said of the stimulus package being considered by the House: “Anybody who thinks — if the president-elect thinks, or the team thinks — that this is the answer to America’s infrastructure needs is in a different universe.”The big danger is that some variation of the currently proposed stimulus package will pass, another enormous bailout for the bankers will be authorized, and then the trillion-dollar-plus budget deficits will make their appearance, looming like unholy monsters over everything else, and will suddenly lose its nerve.The mantra (I can hear it now) will be that we can’t afford to spend any more money on the infrastructure, or on a big health care initiative, or any of the nation’s other crying needs. Suddenly fiscal discipline will be the order of the day and the people who are suffering now will suffer more, and the nation’s long-term prospects will be further damaged as its long-term needs continue to be neglected.We no longer seem to learn much from history. Time and again an economic boom has followed a period of sustained infrastructure investment. Think of the building of the Erie Canal, which connected the to the Atlantic Ocean. Think of the rural electrification program, the interstate highway system, the creation of the Internet.We’re suffering now from both a failure of will and of imagination. I remember the financier telling me, “A modern economy needs a modern platform, and that’s the infrastructure.”History tells us the same thing.'"
"'09-02-03,'1','A recent political cartoon in The Record, a newspaper in Hackensack, N.J., shows rats fleeing a sinking ship, labeled with treasure chests held aloft tagged and “Bonus.” There are “I Hate Investment Banking” T-shirts for sale online. Last week on “The Daily Show,” rolled a clip of , ’s chief executive, defending bonuses as a way to keep “your best people.”“You don’t have ‘best people’!” Mr. Stewart shouted. “You lost $27 billion! Do you live in Bizarro World?”All of this has taken a toll on the few industry veterans willing to discuss the subject.“I’d almost rather say I’m a pornographer,” said a retired Wall Street executive who, for self-evident reasons, asked not to be identified. “At least that’s a business that people understand.”Financiers tell their not-for-attribution account of the crisis like this: Americans undersaved and overspent for decades, relying on rising property values to bankroll their lifestyles. But nobody on Wall Street forced homeowners to take out on houses they couldn’t afford, or refinance mortgages to spend money on cars they shouldn’t have bought.The esoteric securities underneath the current mess are, to the people who invented and marketed them, analogous to . Used correctly, they can enhance your life. Abused, they are lethal.Of course, mistakes were made on Wall Street, says Emanuel Pleitez, a 26-year-old former employee who resigned from his job a few months ago to run for Congress in his hometown, . But to a great extent, he says, those mistakes were born of misplaced trust.“Look, you can talk about collateralized debt obligations all day long,” he said, referring to a type of asset-backed security that has turned famously toxic. “But there were ratings agencies that were supposed to tell us how risky these securities were. We essentially closed our eyes and said, ‘O.K., you say this is rated triple-A, fine, I believe you.’ ” In hindsight, he said, “Everyone should have been more skeptical.”You hear a lot about the failure of regulators, too. But it’s difficult to find anyone in the financial trenches who thinks the problem is Wall Street itself. Difficult, but not impossible.“People say ‘Well, the Fed is to blame because there was all this loose money,’ ” said Luis E. Rinaldini, a former partner at the investment banking firm Lazard Frères, now at the merchant bank Groton Partners. “But guys who run are paid to be cautious when there’s loose money around.”“I mean, if you had a bus driver who went 100 miles an hour on an icy road, you’d think he was crazy,” he adds. “But if his boss said, ‘It’s our policy to drive faster as the roads get icier,’ you wouldn’t be surprised if the boss ended up in jail.”By historical standards, this is not Wall Street’s worst bout of infamy, though it might come pretty close. Last week, branded Wall Street bankers “shameful” for giving themselves nearly $20 billion in bonuses, even though the average bonus, $112,000, was down by 36.7 percent from the prior year.That criticism isn’t quite the buggy whippings that routinely gave “unscrupulous money changers.” And the recent rallies in front of the — with chants of “You bought it, you broke it” — are downright peaceful compared to the 1920 bombing of J.P. Morgan’s offices, which killed more than 30 people.Still, if your business card bears the name of an investment bank — or did before you were laid off — odds are good you’ve endured some very awkward moments of late. Stephen Chen, a former vice president in equity research at , heard a lot of sarcastic comments when he went home to the for Christmas, where his family of 36 gather each year. When the story of another bank closing was broadcast on a TV, a cousin muttered, “Good riddance.”“A lot of my family are small-businessmen who own restaurants and Laundromats,” Mr. Chen said. “They just see Wall Street as overpaid and they don’t have a very clear idea of what it does. I try to explain that there’s this intimate connection between Main Street and Wall Street, that banks were created to provide liquidity for small businesses, so they can expand.” His relatives listen, but seem unconvinced, Mr. Chen said. “It’s kind of tiring having the same conversation over and over again.”The irony is that despite public perceptions, the outcry over Wall Street greed is happening just as the firms are getting stingy. At JPMorgan, Ms. Chau said, management clamped down on office supplies to the point where employees now need to ask a secretary for the key to the supply room for pens.At the branch of Goldman Sachs, the days of free soy milk and Cokes are over, and one day, the water cooler was wheeled right out of the office. “Word went around pretty quickly,” says Mr. Pleitez. “Bring your own water.”And for all the talk about taxpayer-financed bonuses, a lot of junior and midlevel executives have been told that they shouldn’t expect anything but their salaries this year. In a business where your bonus is often five times your base pay, that’s devastating news. And we’re talking about a line of work in which virtually all satisfaction is paycheck-dependent.“Fact is that this is a terrible way to make a living — except for the money,” Ken Miller, a former vice chairman at Credit Suisse First Boston and now a private investor, said. “The lifestyle is terrible — the hours, the sucking up. These guys must feel like they’re the victims of a capricious god.”That’s especially galling to the many in investment banks who had nothing to do with the mortgage end of their company’s business. Maria Anguiano, who works in ’ municipal finance department, has yet to hear if she is getting a bonus this year, but she thinks she deserves one, given the millions her department earned.“If you just take your base home, the question becomes, why not just work at a nonprofit from 8 to 4 instead of a bank where you’re expected to work weekends and every night till 10 or 11?” she said.Ms. Anguiano isn’t the only one asking that question. As money and prestige drain out of Wall Street, and as layoffs mount, other careers are starting to seem more appealing. Mr. Chen has helped start a retail company, GreenSoul Shoes, that sells sandals made by Cambodian villagers out of discarded rubber tires. He calls it a for-profit business with a social mission. Ms. Chau, a friend, is going to be joining him soon.To some longtimers in the industry, this reordering of priorities is overdue. Robert J. Birnbaum, the former president of the New York Stock Exchange, sees an upside to Wall Street’s diminished reputation.“It’s taken a hit, but so what?” he said. “We don’t need all the bright people going to Wall Street, chasing money. There’s a lot of things bright people can do. Like find a cure for .”'"

That’s true for people, and it’s true for that trusted laboratory worm, C. elegans, as well.But a tiny fraction of a group of these nematodes can survive after nearly a day in an extremely hypoxic, or low-oxygen, environment, and researchers at Washington University in St. Louis have discovered the molecular basis for how they do it.Lori L. Anderson, C. Michael Crowder and colleagues report in the journal Science that C. elegans specimens that survived hypoxia past 22 hours have a mutation in a gene that encodes an enzyme used in translation, a step in the making of proteins. Introducing this mutation in other worms made them better able to survive low-oxygen conditions.On a basic level, the finding shows that reduced protein synthesis increases a cell’s resistance to hypoxia. But additional experiments suggested there was more to it than that.To function properly, protein chains must be folded in the right way, with the proper sequence of twists and turns. When they become unfolded bad things can happen, and lack of oxygen is one way they can become unfolded.The researchers’ work suggests that in the worms with the genetic mutation, it’s not just that there are fewer proteins around, but that there are fewer of the unfolded ones.The findings hint at the possibility that someday a cell’s sensitivity to lack of oxygen could be manipulated, which could lead to treatments for conditions like stroke or heart attack, in which lack of oxygen leads to cell death.'"
"'09-02-03,'1','Macy’s, one of the nation’s largest department stores, said Monday that it would cut 7,000 jobs, or 4 percent of its work force, making it the latest retailer to streamline operations. The steps will save cash, but like other companies, Macy’s is also using the economic downturn as a moment to make broad changes.“Our history has been regional department stores with regional names and regional managements,” Terry J. Lundgren, chairman, president and chief executive of Macy’s, said in a telephone interview on Monday.No more. Macy’s four hulking divisions — East, Central, West and Florida — will be consolidated into a single organization for the first time in the company’s history.It is a radical move, but one Mr. Lundgren said would position Macy’s for 2010, or whenever the consumer feels good enough to reach for her wallet again.“We want to be in place, we want to have our people trained, we want to have our structure set, we want to have the right brands in the store,” Mr. Lundgren said. “Now I think is the time to address all of those structural changes that are required.”'"
"'09-02-03,'1','Though small Palestinian militant groups have taken responsibility for the recent fire, even in defiance of Hamas, Israel has said it will hold Hamas responsible for any violations of the calm.Palestinian officials are gathered in Cairo for talks with Egyptian officials who are trying to broker a more durable cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza.Senior Israeli officials have expressed ambivalence about entering into immediate understandings with the militant Islamic group, and the prospects for an imminent cease-fire agreement remained unclear.Fawzi Barhum, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, told Agence France-Presse that his group would agree “in principle” to a one-year truce, but added that Hamas had not ruled out an 18-month truce proposed by the Egyptian mediators.The rockets and mortar shells fired into Israel on Sunday lightly wounded two soldiers and a civilian, the military said. Palestinian militants also opened fire on an army patrol along the border, causing no injuries. One of the rockets landed, but failed to explode, near a kindergarten in an Israeli village east of Gaza.The Israeli Air Force raid on Sunday was aimed at a police station in Gaza City and six suspected smuggling tunnels on the Egyptian border, the military said. There were no immediate reports of casualties.Israel and Hamas began unilateral cease-fires on Jan. 18. The fragility of the cease-fires was first tested last Tuesday, when Palestinian militants detonated a bomb that killed an Israeli soldier patrolling the border.Resumed rocket fire from Gaza presents a particular challenge to the centrist-led Israeli government before elections on Feb. 10.Israel’s leaders said a central aim of the 22-day military offensive was to deter the militants from shooting rockets. But many Israelis said they felt the military operation did not go far enough, a sentiment that has so far benefited the political hawks.“The fact that there are still rockets means that the operation did not succeed,” Danny Ayalon, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States and a candidate of the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party, told foreign reporters here on Sunday. The party has climbed to third place behind the right-wing Likud and centrist Kadima parties, overtaking the once-dominant, center-left Labor Party in several recent polls.Taher al-Nunu, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, called the Israeli threats of sharp retaliation a “campaign stunt.” In a statement released Sunday, he said Israel was trying “to find a false excuse to escalate the aggression against the Palestinians” and “to destroy the Egyptian efforts to improve the calm.”Hamas demands the opening of commercial and passenger crossings on the Gaza borders and the lifting of Israel’s 18-month economic embargo as a prerequisite for a lasting cease-fire. Israel seeks internationally guaranteed mechanisms to prevent weapons smuggling into Gaza through tunnels that run beneath the Egyptian border.An Egyptian security official at the Gaza border said that United States Army engineers had arrived at the frontier to set up ground-penetrating radar to detect smuggling tunnels, The Associated Press reported Sunday.'"
"'09-02-03,'1','Mr. Huang was detained on June 10 after posting an article on his center’s Web site, 64tianwang.com, relating the demands of five parents whose children had died in the collapse of Dongqi Middle School in the town of Hanwang. The parents wanted compensation, an investigation into the school’s construction and the responsible parties to be held accountable if fault was found.Thousands of rooms in school buildings and dormitories collapsed across Sichuan and surrounding provinces during the May 12 quake. The government estimated soon after the quake that as many as 10,000 children might have been killed in the schools. In many cases, school buildings collapsed as buildings around them remained standing, raising questions about the possibility of shoddy construction.Parents took to the streets demanding that the government investigate, presenting a sustained political challenge to local officials. Local officials ordered the police to tamp down the protests. In some cases, police officers in riot gear dragged away crying mothers who were clutching framed photos of their dead children. Later, officials offered parents money in exchange for their agreeing in writing to drop any demands for investigations.Mr. Huang has been held without being indicted. Ms. Zeng said that plainclothes policemen had bundled him into a car. The police later told her he was being held on suspicion of illegally possessing state secrets.On Monday, she said in a telephone interview that the Wuhou District People’s Court in Chengdu called her to tell her of the formal charge and an imminent trial, which she said she was told could start Tuesday. But one of his lawyers, Mo Shaoping, a prominent human rights attorney, argued that the sudden announcement of the trial date gave him too little time to prepare.Ms. Zeng, who was not allowed to see her husband for nearly four months, said that the judge who had called her at 6 p.m. to tell her about the delay of the trial had said that the purpose of the postponement was to “safeguard Huang Qi’s legal rights.”On Monday morning, she said the court had asked her for a telephone number to reach a lawyer. “I argued with them because I didn’t believe they didn’t have the lawyer’s contact information,” she said. Calls made to the chief judge of the court were not answered on Monday.Illegal possession of state secrets, which carries a sentence of three years in prison, is difficult to defend against because lawyers, family members and witnesses all have limited access to the evidence in the case. If the bureaucracy that oversees state secrets certifies that information or a document in possession of the accused amounts to a secret, a conviction is generally a foregone conclusion unless higher authorities intervene to quash the case.“There’s an expansive definition of state secrets, and the problem is it cannot be challenged, and very often the courts don’t see the documents that are allegedly state secrets,” said Nicholas Bequelin, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch.Mr. Huang and Ms. Zeng started their human rights organization in 1998 to focus on human trafficking. In 2000, after Mr. Huang wrote on his Web site about a member of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement who had been beaten to death in police custody, the local police blocked his site. Mr. Huang then moved his content to a server in the United States. He later wrote about a 15-year-old boy who was detained in Chengdu during the 1989 student-led protests in Beijing and died in police custody.The police detained Mr. Huang after that, and a court eventually found him guilty of inciting subversion. He was sentenced to five years in prison. When he got out, he restarted his Web site and asked human rights advocates to contribute articles.'"

"'09-02-04,'0',', the president’s senior adviser, said the White House would “quickly put someone in place” but acknowledged it had no stand-in ready for Mr. Daschle, a former Senate majority leader and a co-author of a book on health care. “There was no Plan B,” Mr. Axelrod said. “Our intent was that he would serve. But there’s a wellspring of talent and particularly people who are interested in this issue.”The White House is considering replacing Mr. Daschle with two people. Mr. Daschle had negotiated a special arrangement to serve in the cabinet while also serving as director of a new White House Office of Health Reform, empowering him to pull together the disparate elements of government.Instead, Mr. Obama’s advisers said the president might appoint someone other than the next secretary to lead the White House office, possibly Jeanne M. Lambrew, Mr. Daschle’s co-author, who had already started working as the office’s deputy director. If the president elevated her, she could push forward with policy development even while a new nominee for health secretary is chosen, vetted and confirmed.“She’s a strong talent in her own right,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a health policy expert at . “There’s every reason to believe that her skills and abilities will be of value to the White House regardless of who is secretary of health and human services.”Health care advocates lamented Mr. Daschle’s departure. “This is a very real setback for the administration because Daschle has unique qualifications,” said Drew E. Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which focuses on health policy. “His withdrawal might result in a loss of momentum, but I don’t think it’s a fatal blow.”William A. Galston, a former policy adviser to President who is now at the , said Mr. Daschle combined political, policy and legislative experience. “I’ve been trying to wrack my brain to think of another person who could bring those three things together,” Mr. Galston said. “I’m not getting very far.”Others played down Mr. Daschle’s importance, pointing to Mr. Obama’s commitment to the issue. “That’s not dependent on Tom Daschle or any one person other than ,” said Richard J. Kirsch, the national campaign manager of Health Care for America Now, a grass-roots coalition.Skeptics of Mr. Obama’s approach to health care were relieved. “We had some serious concern about Daschle’s desire to rush health care reform and push something through as quickly as possible,” said James P. Gelfand, senior manager of health policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce. “The administration could come up with a better consensus-builder.”While the administration looks, Congressional Democrats may have more running room to shape a health care plan to their liking. Senator of , chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator of , chairman of the health committee, have been pushing forward on legislation for weeks.“Max Baucus and Ted Kennedy put the gauntlet down even before the that they want to work with the president and his proposal but they weren’t just going to accept what they were given,” said Howard Paster, who was a Capitol Hill liaison for Mr. Clinton.Mr. Baucus said Tuesday that he had spoken with Mr. Kennedy and planned to take up a health bill by summer. He dismissed the importance of the Daschle withdrawal. “It’s barely a little ripple in the water,” he said. “It’s not a wave, just a ripple.”'"
"'09-02-04,'0','Crucial details remained unclear on Tuesday night, including whether the restrictions would apply to all companies that receive money under the so-called , or TARP, or whether they would apply only to the “exceptional” companies that were being rescued from collapse.Under the Treasury’s $700 billion rescue program, most companies that have received money so far have been considered “healthy” rather than on the brink of collapse.But five of the biggest companies to get help — , and the , and — were all facing acute problems. And top executives at those companies made far more than $500,000 in recent years., the chief executive of Bank of America, took home more than $20 million in 2007. Of that, $5.75 million was in salary and bonuses., who became chief executive of Citigroup in December of 2007 and previously held other senior positions at the bank, made $3.1 million.Richard Wagoner, the chief executive of General Motors, made $14.4 million, much of it in stock, options and other non-cash benefits. He earned a $1.6 million salary.“That is pretty draconian — $500,000 is not a lot of money, particularly if there is no bonus,” said James F. Reda, founder and managing director of James F. Reda & Associates, a compensation consulting firm. “And you know these companies that are in trouble are not going to pay much of an annual dividend.”Mr. Reda said only a handful of big companies pay chief executives and other senior executives $500,000 or less in total compensation. He said such limits will make it hard for the companies to recruit and keep executives, most of whom could earn more money at other firms.“It would be really tough to get people to staff” companies that are forced to impose these limits, he said. “I don’t think this will work.”President Obama last week branded Wall Street bankers “shameful” for giving themselves nearly $20 billion in bonuses as the economy was deteriorating and the government was spending billions to bail out some of the nation’s most prominent financial institutions.“If the taxpayers are helping you, then you have certain responsibilities to not be living high on the hog,” Mr. Obama said Tuesday, in an interview with “ Nightly News.”Mr. Obama’s new rules are coming just as he is expected to ask for additional sums of money, beyond the $700 billion already authorized, to prop up the financial system, even as he pushes Congress to move quickly on a separate economic that could cost taxpayers as much as $900 billion.If the new pay limit applies to all companies that receive Treasury money, it would be almost as tough as a $400,000 limit proposed last week by Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of .Senator McCaskill, reacting to reports of extravagant perks and bonuses at companies like and Citigroup, had blasted Wall Street executives as “a bunch of idiots” who were “kicking sand in the face of the American taxpayer.”The that have received bailout funds already are subject to limits on compensation, but the Bush administration intentionally left them lax. The top five executives at banks that get an equity infusion from the government are restricted from offering golden parachutes, as rich severance packages are called, and any compensation above $500,000 is not tax deductible to the company.Companies that received emergency money, like Citigroup, faced somewhat tougher restrictions, including a requirement to reduce the bonus pool for the top 50 executives by 40 percent. But even those restrictions come nowhere near the $500,000 cap.In a letter to Congress last month, , director of Mr. Obama’s National Economic Council, suggested that the new pay restrictions would apply to all companies that get Federal help.Without mentioning a particular dollar limit, Mr. Summers wrote that “executive compensation above a specified threshold amount be paid in restricted stock or similar form that cannot be liquidated or sold until the government has been repaid.”'"

"'09-02-04,'0','Saudi officials have issued lists of wanted militants before, but the list of 85 — all but two of them Saudi — was the largest so far. As in the past, the authorities appealed for the men to return and turn themselves in.“They will, of course, be interviewed and investigated and prosecuted for any crimes they may have committed,” said Gen. Mansour al-Turki, the chief spokesman of the Interior Ministry. “But by turning themselves in before committing any crime, they will have a better chance to be returned to their families.”Although the Saudi authorities have mounted a fierce campaign against domestic terrorists in recent years, there is strong public sympathy for those who go abroad to fight in Muslim countries believed to be under occupation by foreigners. Accordingly, the government is more careful in dealing with them.It is not clear why the Saudi authorities chose to identify the 11 former Guantánamo detainees or how long they have known about them. Muhammad bin Nayef, the Saudi minister who oversees the counterterrorism program, traveled to Yemen after the video showing the two Saudi jihadists appeared. Mr. Nayef has strong relationships with American and British intelligence officials, and he may have decided that more transparency would be helpful, said Bernard Haykel, a professor at Princeton University and an expert on Saudi Arabia.In addition to releasing the list of 85 terrorism suspects, Saudi officials made a striking accusation: one of the men on it, Abdullah al-Qarawi, is a Saudi who has been operating from Iran for three years.Mr. Qarawi, 35, is believed to have been behind some of the terrorist attacks in recent years inside Saudi Arabia, said a Saudi security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he was not authorized to discuss the matter in public.Known to followers as “the Star,” Mr. Qarawi is in charge of leading Al Qaeda’s operations in the Persian Gulf and Iran, and of bringing new members into Afghanistan, the official said. He is believed to have more than 100 Saudis working for him in Iran, where they move about freely, the official added.Saudi Arabia and the United States have accused Iran in the past of harboring Qaeda members, and Iran has denied it. Saudi Arabia, which sees itself as the leader of the Muslim world, views Iran’s revolutionary Shiite regime with hostility, especially in light of its nuclear ambitions.The list of 85 suspects also included Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the leader of the Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda, which recently announced that it was merging with the Saudi branch. Over the past year or so, the Yemeni group appears to have expanded and brought in a number of Saudis, experts say. Its leaders say they will use Yemen, which shares a border with Saudi Arabia, as a base to launch ambitious attacks throughout the region, including in Saudi Arabia and East Africa.“I think Saudi Arabia is now taking very seriously the threat coming from Yemen,” said Gregory Johnsen, a terrorism analyst with experience in Yemen.Yemen, long viewed as a haven for jihadists, began cooperating with the United States on counterterrorism in 2001, and it has had some notable successes. But its tribal structure, weak state and mountainous terrain have proven to be obstacles. Yemen’s unusually flexible policies — in which convicted terrorists are sometimes paroled in exchange for pledges of passivity and help in negotiating with other militants — have also drawn criticism from American officials.All this has complicated the task of repatriating the Yemenis in Guantánamo. In recent months, their return seemed imminent, in part because of an agreement to create a rehabilitation program based on the Saudi one. Yemen briefly ran its own program for former jihadists. Saudi Arabia created a more ambitious prison-based program in 2004 and expanded it in 2007 to include a more therapeutic segment after release.Last year, Saudi officials said none of the program’s graduates had returned to violence. That appears to have changed with the news about the former Guantánamo detainees, who went through the program before fleeing the country.'"
"'09-02-04,'0','There is good reason for Apple’s chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, and its longtime ad agency, TBWA/Chiat/Day, to be drawing these pointed contrasts: Microsoft, Apple’s longtime nemesis, is more vulnerable than it has been in years.Microsoft’s current operating system, Windows Vista, is a well-known disappointment. And the replacement, Windows 7, will not be ready for regular users for at least six months, analysts say. Last month, Microsoft reported poor financial results and said it would lay off as many as 5,000 employees.“Apple is trying to take as much advantage as they can during this period where there is a lot of confusion on the Windows side,” said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies and a longtime Apple watcher. “It wants to bring people into its retail stores and to contrast it to what they already know.”Microsoft, for its part, said that Apple gave the attack ads a short rest late last year after Microsoft unveiled its counterattack. Microsoft’s campaign, devised by the agency Crispin, Porter & Bogusky, initially featured the comedian Jerry Seinfeld and Microsoft’s co-founder, Bill Gates, and then a diverse collection of normal people proudly proclaiming, “I am a PC.”“I think we confused them a little bit by embracing the stigma they put on our brand and then taking it in a different direction,” said David Webster, a general manager at Microsoft.An Apple spokesman declined to comment about either company’s advertising.So far, Apple seems to be winning the fight. The Macintosh gained more than 2 percentage points of market share in the last year and now controls nearly 10 percent of the overall market for personal computers, according to the research firm Net Applications.Apple’s ads have also fared better than Microsoft’s in the war for consumers’ hearts. In the last two months, Brand Keys, a market research company based in New York, queried 400 Apple and Microsoft users and measured their perceptions of Apple’s and Microsoft’s brand equity before and after seeing examples of the companies’ advertising.Among the ads the firm showed were “Bean Counter,” an Apple spot that poked fun at Microsoft’s spending money on advertising instead of fixing product flaws. Brand Keys also surveyed responses to Microsoft’s first Seinfeld commercial, “Shoe Circus,” and the first “I am a PC” spot.“Off the Air,” an ad that promised Apple stores would help customers switch from Windows to Apple’s Mac platform, was highly successful in lifting the brand equity that Apple users felt around the concept of “innovation, design and added value” — a factor that drives loyalty. The spot also improved PC users’ perception of Macs for their “trouble-free performance, service and support.”On the other hand, Microsoft’s “Shoe Circus,” in which Mr. Seinfeld helped Mr. Gates buy shoes, failed miserably with consumers. After seeing the ad, both Apple and Microsoft users had a more negative perception of Microsoft in the areas of innovation, technology, trouble-free design, and warranty and pricing. “When you see an ad perform this poorly,” said Amy Shea, the executive vice president at Brand Keys who conducted the research, “you’ve got a real problem.”The news was not all bad for Microsoft, though. “I am a PC” — the egalitarian response to Apple that Microsoft has settled on for its ongoing campaign — has worked well to lift PC users’ perception of the brand as technologically and environmentally advanced.The message of the survey, Ms. Shea said, is that companies should play to their strengths, which in Microsoft’s case is the sheer ubiquity of its software around the world.“Everyone who has a PC feels that they are very plugged in and that the world speaks almost one language,” she said. “Microsoft’s ability to tell that story visually by going around the world made that ad successful and positioned them as green and even cool.”Apple, for its part, has played to its reputation as a hip, creative company, personified by Mr. Long’s straight-man performance as Mac Guy. The ads also fit with Apple’s 25-year history as a company willing to draw colorful juxtapositions against its larger, more powerful rivals.'"
"'09-02-04,'0','Many of the trades take place between banks rather than on formal exchanges, and regulators are concerned that there is no oversight or way to monitor where risks could be developing.European officials declined to identify which industry players pulled out of the agreement. But one group, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, has lobbied strongly for a single global clearinghouse to settle derivative trades. It says that the establishment of regional houses would be more costly and create other risks.On Tuesday, Eraj Shirvani, the chairman of derivatives group and the head of European credit at Credit Suisse, said the association favored “global dialogue with all concerned regulators as a matter or priority.”Guido Ravoet, the secretary general of the European Banking Federation, which represents national banking associations in Europe with member banks that buy and sell derivatives, said in a statement that he favored creating an oversight system based in Europe.A European Commission official said Mr. McCreevy was not taking a prescriptive approach to how many clearinghouses were needed. Instead, the official said, Mr. McCreevy was seeking to ensure oversight of credit derivatives markets was put in place as quickly as possible.“The bone of contention here is that the biggest part of the market is in the United States, and the Europeans are saying that the clearinghouse must be based in Europe,” said Karel Lannoo, the chief executive of the Center for European Policy studies, a research organization in Brussels.Mr. Lannoo said costs probably would increase if there were multiple clearinghouses. On the other hand, he said, it could make more sense to have more than one clearinghouse to avoid a complete breakdown in trading in case of one of them failed, perhaps as a result of a terrorist attack.The most probable outcome, he said, was that at least two clearinghouses would be established, one in Europe and another in the United States.“It’s the mood of the times,” Mr. Lannoo said. “We are drifting apart more than we are coming together when it comes to financial regulation.”'"
"'09-02-04,'0','It is not an accident.“It’s built right into the system,” said Lon Babby, an agent whose client list includes Tim Duncan, Grant Hill and Ray Allen. “They don’t want guys to leave.”By “they,” Babby means N.B.A. officials, whose quest for parity and cost control has created a market that rewards superstars for staying put and punishes them for leaving.Under the N.B.A.’s collective bargaining agreement, a player who stays with his team can sign a six-year contract with 10.5 percent raises.If he leaves, he is limited to five years and 8 percent raises. In real terms, a player like James would have to forgo about $31 million in guaranteed money to sign a so-called max contract with a team other than the Cavaliers, who will be in New York on Wednesday to face the Knicks.In theory, a player can recoup the money in his next contract or through endorsement deals. Yet the fact remains that players seldom leave guaranteed money on the table, and superstars almost never leave home.In the last 12 off-seasons only three franchise players changed teams as free agents while in their prime: Hill, Tracy McGrady and Steve Nash. Hill and McGrady joined Orlando in 2000. Nash joined Phoenix in 2004.Now consider the list of in-their-prime franchise players who stayed put in that time: Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Allen Iverson, Kevin Garnett, Chris Webber, Jason Kidd, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, Reggie Miller, Gary Payton, Ray Allen, Amare Stoudemire, John Stockton, Karl Malone and David Robinson. (Malone and Payton signed with the Lakers in 2003, but they were nearing retirement.)James, Wade and Bosh — the stars of the 2003 draft — could be added to that list. Like most elite players, they signed lucrative extensions to their rookie deals as soon as they were eligible, in 2006. All of them followed entrenched wisdom: that long-term financial security trumps career flexibility.Combine financial self-interest with the N.B.A.’s complex salary-cap rules, and a result is a market in which superstars have little incentive to move.“This succession of agreements has resulted in a hard salary cap,” said Arn Tellem, one of the N.B.A.’s most influential agents, “and has really, I think, eliminated for the most part free agency for the high-end players.”The most critical element at work is the cap on individual salaries. Those limits did not exist in 1996, when the Lakers outbid the Magic and signed O’Neal to a $121 million contract.Today, no team can be outbid for its own free agent unless it wants to be.The best example is Nash, who in 2004 left Dallas to sign a five-year, $60 million deal with Phoenix. The Mavericks could have matched or exceeded the offer, but they were worried about Nash’s age (he was 30), health and breakneck style.If the system is a burden to elite players, it is a boon for the league, which prizes franchise stability, and for fans, who almost never have to say goodbye to their heroes.Malone and Stockton played together for nearly two decades with the Utah Jazz, in one of the N.B.A.’s smallest markets. Miller spent his entire 18-year career with the Indiana Pacers. Duncan will almost certainly finish his career in San Antonio. All are almost certain Hall of Famers. If they played baseball, they would probably have become Yankees, Mets or Dodgers.“It’s pretty consistent with what we had hoped the rules would produce,” said Joel Litvin, the N.B.A.’s president for league and basketball operations.When the system fails, the N.B.A. fixes it. Earlier this decade, the Golden State Warriors lost Gilbert Arenas to Washington and the Cavaliers lost Carlos Boozer to Utah because of a cap loophole involving second-round picks. The N.B.A. closed the loophole in 2005.Litvin said the N.B.A. aimed to balance franchise stability with player freedom. Yet a combination of money and human inertia tends to keep players in place.“It’s hard to leave,” Babby said. “Often, the home team has the advantage because the player is comfortable. He’s successful there, his marketing is there, his family is there, his house is there.”Sometimes, the best-laid plans for franchise revival are destroyed by human frailty.Ten years ago Orlando purged its payroll for the last great free-agent class. The Magic snared Hill and McGrady and seemed close to landing Duncan, too. Hill’s career was derailed by injuries, but as free-agent signings go, the Magic pulled off one of the great modern coups.Then consider the plight of the Chicago Bulls, a big-market team with a rich history. After Michael Jordan’s retirement in 1998, Chicago conserved cap space for years in hopes of landing a new star. None came.In the N.B.A., the best way to obtain superstars is to trade for them. The Celtics drafted Pierce in 1998 but did not become champions until they obtained Garnett and Allen in a pair of 2007 trades. Kidd has been traded three times. Iverson and O’Neal have been traded twice each. Payton, Webber and Carter were also traded in their prime.Of course, it only takes one adventurous superstar in 2010 to render the historical trends irrelevant.But Donnie Walsh, the Knicks’ president, is mindful of the odds and the history.“Their own teams still have the advantages,” he said. “It’s not an easy deal two years from now to just say, ‘Oh, yeah, let’s go get one of these guys.’ ”There are shiny consolation prizes for the teams that miss on James. Stoudemire, Nowitzki, Joe Johnson and Michael Redd could also be free agents in 2010.“By the way,” Walsh added coyly, “there’s a next year too after this famous year you’re talking about.”In the game of cap-space roulette, the champion is the one who spends the most money on the best players. But there is more than one way to win the game.'"
"'09-02-04,'0','Did you ever wonder why Freud decided to have his patients lie on a couch during their analyses?“I got tired of looking at them,” he reveals in “Freudian Slips,” an uneven little comedy from the Abingdon Theater Company. “Staring anguish in the face can be pretty repulsive.”Clearly this is not an exercise in hero worship. It’s probably relevant that the playwright, Marvin Lifschitz, is a practicing psychotherapist. Talk about a subconscious desire to kill the father. And it’s worrisome that one credit in his program biography is that he wrote “dramatic and comedic stories for friends and relatives” as a boy.Yet there is something admirable about “Freudian Slips.” The story has Freud (Joel Leffert) become a patient, while an analyst, Thomas Buxton (Warren Kelley), listens and watches Freud’s flashbacks. That calls for a complex structure and complicated staging. Both the writer and the director, Tom Bloom, pull it off, even when the action threatens to spill into the front row.It’s the premise that’s off base. Freud has become obsessed with an attractive patient. When the patient, Madeline Shumsky (Margi Sharp), reveals that she rebels against her controlling husband (David Smilow) by wearing no undergarments, Freud is entranced.As written and as rawly played, Freud has the air of a desperate, pathetic old man. That seems to be the revelation that audiences are meant to take home. Freud grows even more overwrought when another of his patients, the younger and more handsome Sidney Layman (Jason Marr), falls for Madeline.There is a flimsy subplot about a competing analyst, Otto Brotto (Allen Lewis Rickman), which allows a character to refer to “Dr. Otto Brotto’s motto.” The play’s humor relies heavily on that sort of setup and on the use of Yiddish words that are treated like punch lines. The production’s greatest comedic strength is Sue Brady, who steals most of her scenes, playing a variety of patients and relatives. Ms. Brady even does well by the oddest character: a woman suffering from “hysterical tongue paralysis.”'"
"'09-02-04,'0','The billions of dollars that Congress plans to spend on mass transit as part of the stimulus bill will also do little to help these systems with their current problems. That is because the new federal money — $12 billion was included in the version passed last week by the House, while the Senate originally proposed less — is devoted to big capital projects, like buying train cars and buses and building or repairing tracks and stations. Money that some lawmakers had proposed to help transit systems pay operating costs, and avoid layoffs and service cuts, was not included in the latest version.The Washington Metro set a record on Inauguration Day last month when people made 1.5 million trips on it to see the swearing-in of President Obama, but its $176 million budget gap means that it is planning to cut service and eliminate 900 jobs. Chicago had its biggest gain in riders in three decades last year, but was forced to raise fares. Charlotte, N.C., whose new light-rail system is the envy of transit planners around the country, and which is enjoying its biggest ridership levels since “the days of streetcars,” according to Keith Parker, the transit system’s chief executive, will be running its new trains less frequently, raising fares and cutting back on bus service.In New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is considering steep fare increases and its deepest service cuts in years to help close a $1.2 billion deficit. In addition to considering a 23 percent increase in fares and tolls, the authority is weighing plans to eliminate more than two dozen city bus routes and two subway lines, reduce off-peak service and even close some subway stations at night.The nation’s transit woes threaten to deal another blow to the weak economy, keeping some workers from jobs they commute to and forcing some systems to lay off administrators, bus drivers, train operators and mechanics. And while the economic stimulus package being considered on Capitol Hill includes tax cuts intended to put more spending money in people’s pockets, fare increases promise to take a big bite for many commuters.Big systems in Boston, Atlanta and San Francisco, and smaller ones across the nation, find themselves weighing cuts or fare increases that they fear could erode the gains they have made in attracting new riders. Beverly A. Scott, general manger of Marta, the Atlanta system, said as the sales tax revenue continued to drop, she was weighing everything from fare increases to service cuts to even selling the naming rights to stations — but she still hopes for more state support.William W. Millar, president of the American Public Transportation Association, an industry group, wrote to the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, last month urging her to include money for operating costs in the stimulus bill.“Public transportation ridership is surging across the country,” he wrote, “increasing 6.5 percent in the third quarter of 2008 — the largest quarterly increase in the past 25 years, but transit systems are cutting service, increasing fares and laying off employees as a result of increased transit fuel costs in the past year and declining state and local revenue sources that support transit.”So even as the federal government plans to buy new train cars and buses for some transit systems, places like St. Louis find themselves without enough money to pay the bus drivers and light-rail train operators that they have now.“I have 165 buses that I’m going to have to put in mothballs,” said Ray Friem, the chief operating officer at Metro, the St. Louis system. “There’s a ton of federal money tied up in those assets.”Money is so tight that the agency is not planning to rip out the bus stop signs that dot the roads, though they will soon be misleading. Instead, at the transit system’s headquarters upriver from the Gateway Arch, officials last week put the final touches on a model of a vinyl hood they plan to drape over each sign. “We regret due to a lack of funding, service to this stop is suspended,” the prototype said.St. Louis is in some respects unique. It was in the minority of transit systems that lost a ballot measure in November seeking more money; voters rejected a proposal to raise the local sales tax to help pay for more public transportation. Transit officials said they believed their efforts had been hurt by lingering public resentment over a light-rail expansion project that was delayed and went over budget, devolving into messy litigation with contractors that ended up costing the transit system even more.Faced with a yawning shortfall, despite an 8 percent increase in ridership last year, the system reluctantly decided to cut nearly half of its bus service; lay off nearly 600 of its workers, or a quarter of its work force, and reduce service on its red, white and blue MetroLink light-rail cars — the modern successors of the clanging trolleys that Judy Garland sang about in “Meet Me in St. Louis.” Absent a windfall, the cuts are scheduled to take effect at the end of March.Some people who worked on the failed campaign to raise the sales tax said their efforts were complicated because most local voters do not regularly take public transportation. But in the leafy suburbs west of Interstate 270, which are scheduled to lose almost all of their bus service, many people will soon discover that even if they do not take buses themselves, they rely on them to bring workers to their shopping malls, office parks, hospitals and nursing homes.The Garden View Care Center, in Chesterfield, is part of a cluster of a dozen facilities sometimes called nursing home row. Rhonda Uhlenbrock, the center’s administrator, has been working with agencies that set up car pools and trying to coordinate with other businesses that will be affected to see if she can find other ways for her employees, many of whom do not have cars, to get to work.“This place could survive without me,” Ms. Uhlenbrock said in her office recently, where she was assembling a collage to honor employees who have been at the center more than 10 years. “But not without them. They are the people who do the work.”Ms. Nacoste, who rises at 3:45 a.m. for her two-hour commute to work in the housekeeping and laundry department, said employers closer to home either paid less or were not hiring. She shook her head at the thought that the weak economy was leading to cuts in bus service.“They’re going to make the economy worse if they cut the bus,” Ms. Nacoste said. “There’s going to be unemployment, people running out of money. What are we going to do?”'"
"'09-02-04,'0','The disease, the cause of which is unknown, is a progressive scarring of the lungs that interferes with the transfer of oxygen into the blood. There are about 30,000 new cases a year in the United States, and only 20 percent of patients live longer than five years from diagnosis, Mr. Welch said.Dr. Paul W. Noble, a professor at Duke and co-chairman of the committee that designed InterMune’s trials, said in the company’s conference call Tuesday that he was encouraged. “I think you can make a strong case that this is the first step — hopefully, there will be many steps — for this horrible disease,” said Dr. Noble, who is a consultant to InterMune.Other drugs now being tested as treatments for pulmonary fibrosis include Tracleer from Actelion, Letairis from Gilead Sciences, and Pfizer’s sildenafil, the ingredient in the impotence pill Viagra. Pirfenidone was approved in Japan last year, where it is sold by Shionogi. InterMune said that results from Shionogi’s trial would also be used to help it gain approval in the United States and Europe.InterMune said that when the results of its own two trials were pooled, pirfenidone reduced the risk of disease progression by about 25 percent. About 7.8 percent of those who got the drug died, less than the 9.8 percent who got the placebo, but that difference was not statistically significant.The main side effects were nausea, a rash, dizziness, fatigue, indigestion and diarrhea.InterMune has a troubled history in treating pulmonary fibrosis. Its first drug candidate, Actimmune, had mixed results in a trial in 2002. Nevertheless, sales of the drug, which was already on the market for two rare genetic conditions, soared to $141 million in 2003, virtually all of it off-label use for pulmonary fibrosis.After a federal investigation into illegal off-label promotion, the company paid nearly $37 million in 2006 to settle the matter, but its former chief executive, W. Scott Harkonen, still faces related federal charges.A second clinical trial conducted by InterMune showed in 2007 that Actimmune did not prolong life in less severely ill patients after all, and sales have rapidly diminished.“This isn’t the perfect drug, but the bottom line is we need a treatment,” said Teresa Barnes of the Coalition for Pulmonary Fibrosis, a patient advocacy group that receives some financing from InterMune.Ms. Barnes said she watched her father and all four of his siblings die from an inherited form of the disease. “When you have absolutely nothing and you’re suffocating,” she said, “it’s excruciating to watch.”'"
"'09-02-04,'0','Many market analysts expect lots of market volatility over the next six months as the economy struggles to find the bottom of a long recession.“The bears are still in the driver’s seat,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor’s. “The thought is, ‘We’ve priced in a very, very bad recession if not a depression. Now let’s sit back and wait.’ ”Investors are also anxious for the government to release new unemployment figures on Friday, which will offer a window into how the economy fared in January. The economy shed more than a million jobs in November and December, and economists expect the January unemployment rate to rise to 7.5 percent from 7.2 percent.“At this point, we just want to know who’s going to survive, who’s going to fail, and whether banks are going to start to lend again,” said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.In a positive note for the housing market, the National Association of Realtors reported that the number of homes with signed contracts rose in December, beating expectations. The group’s pending home sales index rose 6.3 percent in December, a sign that buyers were taking advantage of tumbling home prices.But a separate report from the Commerce Department showed that vacancies of for-sale homes were still at high levels.Shares of the drug maker Merck & Company rose 6.4 percent to close at $30.24 after it reported a fourth-quarter profit. The home builder D. R. Horton rose 21.4 percent to $7.42 after reporting narrower-than-expected losses, and the drug maker Schering-Plough rose 8.2 percent to $18.91 a share after reporting profits that beat expectations.Shares of Ford Motor rose slightly to $1.96 a share after the automaker reported that its sales fell 39 percent in January, but said its share of the retail market had increased.

"'09-02-04,'0','SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has been moving what appear to be components of a long-range missile to a launching site, a South Korean official and news reports said Tuesday, raising fears that it might test-fire a missile.The North Korean move, first reported by the South Korean news agency Yonhap and the Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun, came amid concern among political analysts in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, that the North might also try some sort of military provocation to help make its nuclear program a foreign policy priority for the Obama administration.North Korea has launched missiles in the past to win political or economic concessions. In recent weeks, it has said that its military had assumed an “all-out confrontational posture” and that it had scrapped all nonaggression pacts with South Korea.In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Robert A. Wood, said he could not comment on the reports, calling them “an intelligence matter.”But he added: “North Korea’s missile activities and missile programs are of concern to the region.

"'09-02-05,'1','Representative Charles B. Rangel’s financial disclosure forms had at least 28 omissions in the past 30 years and failed to account for what became of more than $239,000 in assets, according to a report issued Wednesday by a private government-ethics group.Despite Congressional rules that require members to list the purchase or sale of any assets, Mr. Rangel accumulated from $239,026 to $831,000 in assets that were not listed in subsequent reports, according to the report by the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group that advocates greater transparency by elected officials.Lawyers for Mr. Rangel, a Democrat from Harlem whose personal finances and fund-raising are being investigated by the House ethics committee, or Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, have said that sloppy bookkeeping led him to file incomplete or inaccurate financial disclosure forms.When asked about the report on Wednesday, Mr. Rangel’s spokesman, Emil Milne, said the congressman had already acknowledged the errors and was seeking to correct them.But the analyst who prepared the private group’s report said that the assortment of inconsistencies was serious enough for the ethics committee to make Mr. Rangel’s filing history a part of its investigation.“Although he predicted on Sunday that his multitude of ethics woes would soon disappear, these new findings show that the ethics committee clearly needs to take a close look at Rangel’s filings,” said the analyst, Bill Allison, senior fellow of the Sunlight Foundation. “Congress needs to revisit its entire financial disclosure-reporting procedure to ensure that filings provide accurate, understandable and complete information about lawmakers’ wealth.”In some cases, Mr. Rangel listed assets without stating when he acquired them. For instance, his disclosure form for calendar year 2006 lists 13 mutual funds with values from $54,013 to $286,000 but omits any acquisition date.In other instances, assets disappear from his disclosures, with no suggestion of whether they were sold or exchanged. Investments he had valued in 2004 at $95,004 to $250,000 were omitted in a later filing with no indication of whether they had been sold or at what price.The Sunlight Foundation report also noted that Mr. Rangel did not list any royalties or advances he may have received from his book “And I Haven’t Had a Bad Day Since” (MacMillan 2007). Mr. Milne said Mr. Rangel received no proceeds.The questions about Mr. Rangel’s personal disclosures come as the congressman, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has been saying that at least two critical stories about him published in The New York Post were based on information supplied by a group financed by conservative Republicans. In an interview on C-SPAN on Sunday and in a letter mailed to supporters released Tuesday, Mr. Rangel said the conservative-oriented National Legal Policy Center had sent an investigator to examine the finances of a villa he owns in the Dominican Republic, then passed along critical information to a reporter from The Post. The newspaper subsequently printed an article questioning whether Mr. Rangel had reported all the rental income he received from the villa on his financial disclosure forms and tax returns.“Newspapers forwent actual, independent reporting, and instead relied on this organization to do the dirty work for them,” Mr. Rangel wrote.The chairman of the organization, Kenneth Boehm, acknowledged that he had assisted the Post reporter but denied that the help was part of any orchestrated campaign to attack Mr. Rangel. Mr. Boehm said he began poring over Mr. Rangel’s disclosure forms after The New York Times published an article in July about Mr. Rangel accepting four rent-stabilized apartments from a Manhattan developer.Mr. Boehm said that after he became concerned that the congressman may not have reported all the rental income from the Dominican villa, he discussed the matter with a Post reporter. Mr. Boehm said he helped the reporter later with articles about Mr. Rangel’s joining an overseas trip that had been underwritten by corporate donors and about his use of a homestead tax credit in the District of Columbia that members of Congress are expressly forbidden from claiming.“All we have asked of the congressman is to tell the truth,” Col Allan, editor of The Post, said on Wednesday. “We stand by our reporting.”Several days after The Post story about the Dominican villa appeared, The Times reported that Mr. Rangel had failed to declare more than $75,000 in rental income on the property and owed more than $9,000 in back taxes.'"
"'09-02-05,'1','WASHINGTON — Leon E. Panetta, the White House nominee to take over the Central Intelligence Agency, earned more than $1 million last year serving on corporate boards, consulting and delivering speeches, including some given to imploding banks at the height of the financial crisis.Merrill Lynch gave Mr. Panetta $56,000 for two speeches in 2008, and Wachovia paid his standard fee of $28,000 for an appearance last October, according to financial disclosure forms Mr. Panetta submitted to the Office of Government Ethics.Both financial institutions are now owned by other banks.Mr. Panetta, who will appear Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee for his confirmation hearing, also received a $28,000 speaking fee last September from the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm that owns a number of companies doing business with the Pentagon and other national security agencies.The finances of President Obama’s aides are under particular scrutiny after two White House nominees had to withdraw this week amid revelations that they had failed to pay income tax.Tommy Vietor, a White House spokesman, said Mr. Panetta had no similar tax problems and had not had to pay any back taxes since being tapped by the White House to lead the C.I.A.“We anticipate that tomorrow’s hearing will focus on the substance of Mr. Panetta’s views about how to strengthen our intelligence gathering and keep our nation safe, as all of Mr. Panetta’s income and investments have been thoroughly reviewed by the Office of Government Ethics,” Mr. Vietor said.'"
"'09-02-05,'1','He is not the only bishop considered a front-runner, and even the best-informed church experts say nothing is certain until the Vatican makes its announcement.Other bishops frequently mentioned as under consideration include Archbishop Timothy P. Broglio, a Spanish-speaker who served in the Dominican Republic and now ministers to Catholics in the American military; Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory of Atlanta, an African-American who was president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and its public face at the height of the church sexual-abuse scandal; Archbishop John J. Myers of Newark; and Bishop William E. Lori of Bridgeport, Conn.Despite the active speculation, officials at the archdiocesan offices in New York said they had no knowledge of an imminent transition.In Milwaukee, Jerry Topczewski, chief of staff to Archbishop Dolan, said, “I’m very comfortable saying that the archbishop has no knowledge of any announcement or pending announcement or anything else.”He added: “We’ve been plagued by these rumors every two, three or four years — whenever there’s a diocese open. He was going to Boston, to Baltimore, then to D.C. But he’s still here and happy to be here.”Still, church insiders in Rome and in the United States said Pope Benedict XVI had already settled on his selection. The process is secretive, but involves a wide circle of people.Every bishop is required to submit his resignation at age 75, but the pope does not have to accept it. The apostolic nuncio, the papal representative in Washington — who is currently Pietro Sambi — consults widely with church officials and then advances the names of three candidates to the Vatican, making a note of his preference. There, the Congregation for Bishops votes and sends its choice to the pope, who is free to accept the selection or choose someone himself.Four American cardinals serve on that body — three of them based in Rome, including Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned as archbishop of Boston at the height of the sexual-abuse scandal. The only one still leading an American diocese is Cardinal Justin Rigali of Philadelphia, who came to know Archbishop Dolan well when Cardinal Rigali served as archbishop of St. Louis and Archbishop Dolan was his auxiliary bishop.If Archbishop Dolan succeeds Cardinal Egan, he would continue a chain of Irish-Americans in the post that has been interrupted only once, in the 19th century, by a native Parisian who had fled the French Revolution. Archbishop Dolan, who turns 59 on Friday, would also be the first in the archdiocese’s 200-year history to replace a living predecessor.Recent rumors about Cardinal Egan’s imminent departure have focused on the one household possession he is known to treasure: a baby grand piano. A classically trained pianist who plays every day, the cardinal brought the piano with him from Bridgeport, where he was bishop, and is certain to take it with him to his next residence. In recent weeks, several priests and other officials who had been to the cardinal’s residence on Madison Avenue reported that the piano was gone.On Wednesday, Joseph Zwilling, the cardinal’s spokesman, said there was no truth to the rumor.“The piano is in the cardinal’s residence, where it has always been,” he said.'"
"'09-02-05,'1','Federal officials have begun a criminal inquiry of the peanut company after learning that it knowingly shipped products that had tested positive for salmonella. The outbreak has caused more than 500 illnesses and eight deaths. More than 1,000 products have been recalled, including pet food, ice cream and brownies.Kellogg, one of the companies that recalled peanut products, received reports of third-party independent audits of Peanut Corporation of America in 2007 and 2008. The audits, paid for by the peanut company to meet food manufacturers’ requirements, were intended to assess its compliance with federally mandated manufacturing practices, including the condition of the plant and equipment and cleanliness, said Kris Charles, a spokeswoman for Kellogg.Audits are also supposed to review the supplier’s food safety program, microbial test results and internal audit results.Each audit, conducted by AIB International, gave the Blakely plant a “superior” rating. “We are looking into whether the third-party auditor reviewed state inspection reports or the plant’s test results,” Ms. Charles said by e-mail. “It is certainly something we would have expected them to do because it is an audit requirement.” Kellogg also received written test results from Peanut Corporation of America that the peanut paste it had supplied Kellogg showed no positive salmonella results, she said.Had Kellogg known of the problems at the plant that the Food and Drug Administration detailed recently, “we would have discontinued the relationship with P.C.A. immediately and would not have accepted any ingredients from them,” she said.Jim Munyon, president of AIB International, based in Manhattan, Kan., said he could not release details of the peanut company’s audit because of confidentiality agreements. He said the company would not have received a superior rating if his auditors had seen the filth the federal government described.“It would mean that we didn’t see it on the day we were there,” he said of the rating. “What goes on the rest of the time, we don’t know.”He said his company relies on his customers to provide details of internal microbial tests. Had the peanut company divulged the presence of salmonella, he said, “We would have had a discussion about those failures.”Doug Powell, an associate professor of food safety at Kansas State University, said the salmonella outbreak at Peanut Corporation of America showed the “fallacy” of independent audits, which are commonly used to verify food safety, animal welfare claims and organic production methods. While the intent might be good, he said, the results are usually withheld from the public.“Companies say they do all this testing. Great. Show us the data. They won’t,” Mr. Powell said. “Given all the outbreaks, why should we believe them?”'"
"'09-02-05,'1','WASHINGTON — A former legislative aide to President Obama’s designated commerce secretary, Senator Judd Gregg, accepted thousands of dollars in free meals, drinks and sports tickets from a lobbyist for whom he placed items in spending bills, according to court papers.The aide, Kevin H. Koonce, was identified in court papers only as Staffer F. They detail his interactions with Todd A. Boulanger, the lobbyist who pleaded guilty last week to charges that he had provided gifts to public officials in return for help for his clients.Mr. Koonce had been Mr. Gregg’s legislative director from 2002 through 2004 and went on to become a lobbyist himself.But court papers in the case of Mr. Boulanger, who was a deputy to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, say Mr. Koonce took legislative actions in Mr. Gregg’s name at the behest of a lobbyist providing him with gifts.Documents submitted as part of Mr. Boulanger’s plea agreement included excerpts from e-mail in which Mr. Koonce asked for hockey tickets that he later received from Mr. Boulanger, who also provided tickets to baseball games and other events. In an exchange with Mr. Abramoff over whether Mr. Koonce would provide a favor, Mr. Boulanger boasted, “Easy money,” adding that he “practically lives in our various suites.”'"

"'09-02-05,'1','Landlines are going the way of the dinosaur, so what is a telecommunications company to do? If you are Verizon, your wireless division puts out the Verizon Hub. The desktop phone is a revamped home-phone system that uses Voice over Internet Protocol and high-speed fiber optic service from Verizon, DSL or another broadband connection to make calls.The Hub consists of a cordless handset and a 7-inch touch-screen display. Included in the phone are widgets for a calendar, contact lists, movie listings (with the option to view trailers), and traffic and weather information. The Hub is intended to serve as the central home unit, so you can post events to the family calendar and send out appointments and other messages to your contacts’ cellphones. You can also check up on your children using the Chaperone child location service from Verizon Wireless.The system, which is now available, requires Verizon Wireless service and costs $200 (after a $50 mail-in rebate) with a two-year contract and a $35 monthly unlimited Verizon voice plan.

"'09-02-05,'1','Q. My digital camera can take short video clips, but the files are huge. Is there a way to slim these movies down so I can send them around to friends and family by e-mail?A. Try importing the video clips into a movie-editing program first. Even if you don’t have a fancy third-party video editing program on your computer, odds are the machine came with one, like Windows MovieMaker on the PC or iMovie on the Macintosh. Windows users can also try out Pinnacle VideoSpin (videospin.com); it’s free to use, but you may need to buy additional software from the site to save finished movies in certain formats.If the camera uses a video format that your program doesn’t import, you can find video-format converter programs at most shareware sites, like download.com, that can translate the clip into a form your video editing program can accept.Once a video clip is imported into a movie program, it can be edited as needed. When the clip is ready, check the program’s menu for output or export options. Many programs offer an “e-mail” option; choosing it converts the clip to a size that is acceptable to most e-mail systems.If you find the video quality suffers too much from the conversion process, try saving the clip as a “Web quality” file and uploading it to a video-sharing site that offers password-protection for better privacy, like Vimeo (vimeo.com). Then you need only send a link by e-mail to your friends and family.'"
"'09-02-05,'1','Visa Inc., the credit card company, said Wednesday that its first-quarter profit rose 35 percent as consumers continued their shift away from cash toward electronic payments.The results beat Wall Street expectations. Visa also reiterated its earnings outlook for the year, despite expectations of tougher economic conditions in coming months.Visa, the world’s largest electronic payment network, reported net income of $574 million, or 74 cents a share, for the three months that ended Dec. 31. That was up from $424 million a year earlier, when Visa was privately held before its initial public offering last March.Excluding one-time charges and gains, Visa earned $599 million, or 78 cents a share, in the latest quarter.Visa, based in San Francisco, said its revenue rose 17 percent, to $1.74 billion from $1.49 billion, while operating expenses fell 5 percent to $773 million from $810 million.Total cards carrying the Visa brand rose 10 percent globally to 1.7 billion over the previous year, and total payment transactions jumped 13 percent to 14.5 billion.The chief executive, Joseph W. Saunders, told analysts that he expected recent cost-cutting efforts to help the company meet its previously stated goal of increasing its 2009 full-year profit by 20 percent.'"
"'09-02-05,'1','Mr. Anwyl said the program, called Hyundai Assurance, would probably lead to similar deals from some rivals after they see that Hyundai’s offer is resonating with consumers.“It gives them a whole new audience — people for whom it would have never popped up on their shopping list,” he said.Sales of the Hyundai Sonata, a full-size sedan that costs less than $20,000, surged 85 percent in January, making it one of the country’s top-selling vehicles. And Hyundai sold more passenger cars last month than Chrysler, which has four times as many dealers.“Hyundai is the right franchise for the times right now,” said Rick Case, who in February 1986 opened the first two Hyundai dealerships in the country and now owns six Hyundai stores, in Florida, Georgia and Ohio. “With this economy, a lot of people don’t want to be seen in Mercedeses and BMWs and Lexuses.”While 2009 has started well for Hyundai, the final months of 2008 were rather turbulent. The company named its fifth American chief executive in five years. And from September to December, sales at Hyundai and its Kia subsidiary plunged 37 percent, more than any other mass-market automaker except Chrysler.The company lost many potential buyers when most banks stopped approving loans for customers with subprime credit.“It really wasn’t something that we had faced before, and I don’t want to live through another fourth quarter like that again,” said David L. Zuchowski, Hyundai’s vice president for sales.Last fall Hyundai began testing the idea of a return policy rather than simply piling more discounts onto its already low-price vehicles. The program covers every buyer of a leased or financed vehicle who involuntarily loses a job; becomes physically disabled; loses a driver’s license for medical reasons; is transferred to another country; is self-employed and files for bankruptcy; or dies in an accident.The guarantee covers the difference between the value of the car and the amount the buyer owes, or negative equity, up to a maximum of $7,500.“It doesn’t matter how many zillion dollars you put in rebates, or what A.P.R. you give them,” Mr. Zuchowski said. “If people are worried about their job, they don’t really care and they’re just not going to get off the fence. But we had to walk a really fine line. We wanted to make sure we didn’t come off as panicked or distressed.”Mr. Zuchowski declined to reveal the cost of the program but said it was negligible, especially weighed against the expected increase in sales.In mid-January, Hyundai had another boost when its first luxury sedan, the Genesis, which costs $15,000 to $20,000 less than many competing models, was named North American car of the year at the Detroit auto show.Mr. Zuchowski said Hyundai can benefit from merely putting itself in front of American consumers, hence the Super Bowl ads and its sponsorship of the Academy Awards this month — after General Motors backed out.The company has 7 percent of the market in the United States, where it has one plant, but last year it became the world’s fifth-largest automaker, ahead of Honda, Nissan and Chrysler.“A lot of people still think we’re this little import that builds cars in corrugated tin shacks in South Korea,” Mr. Zuchowski said.'"
"'09-02-05,'1','In some cases there is strong political pressure on banks to favor lending at home, making it “more difficult for bank headquarters to transfer funds to overseas subsidiaries and extend credit overseas,” Mr. Dallara said.This has been especially hard on lenders in Central and Eastern Europe, he said, many of which are subsidiaries of larger banks based in Western Europe.Analysts agree that difficulties have been building. “The problems at the parent banks means they have halted offering credit to their subsidiaries in this region,” said Piotr Bujak, an economist at Bank Zachodni WBK in Warsaw.Walter Demel, a senior analyst for Central and Eastern Europe at the Austrian bank Raiffeisen, said, “There is a risk to the economic advances that the region has made if there is not more support for the region.”The institute intends to press its case at the meetings in London in mid-March, which will prepare the ground for a summit of G-20 leaders, also in London, on April 2. The institute is based in Washington and comprises more than 380 banks, asset management firms and insurance companies. Its chairman, Josef Ackermann, is also chief executive of Deutsche Bank.The institute has just issued a report warning that the outlook for private capital flows to emerging markets has deteriorated significantly. Those flows are projected to fall to $165 billion this year, from $466 billion last year. The largest component of the decline would be bank lending, which would shift to a net outflow from emerging markets of $61 billion this year from a net inflow of $167 billion in 2008.Mr. Dallara said there was “an urgent case” for better coordination among the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and major central banks to provide more liquidity to emerging markets through existing facilities or the establishment of credit lines between central banks. One template for such help could be a plan, announced by the Federal Reserve in October, to establish temporary reciprocal currency arrangements to support dollar liquidity with the central banks of Brazil, Mexico, Singapore and South Korea.Europe has announced similar pacts with its partners. In the fall, the European Central Bank announced agreements with the central banks of Hungary and Poland to support liquidity in those countries.Mr. Dallara said he hoped that the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank would announce similar, expanded arrangements for Central and Eastern Europe soon.Another issue is that the International Monetary Fund was provided with a short-term lending facility in autumn for members facing temporary liquidity problems, but it has yet to be used.“We need to explore the liberalization and improvement of this facility and to increase funds for the I.M.F. from surplus countries,” Mr. Dallara said. Countries that might benefit include Brazil, Chile, the Czech Republic, Mexico and Poland.In November, the fund approved more money in loans to governments than in any other month in its history, committing nearly $50 billion. In addition to Iceland, it has also come to the aid of Ukraine, Latvia, Hungary and other Eastern European countries.'"

"'09-02-05,'1','Last year’s sales were down about 23 percent from 2007, said Warren Knight, one of the owners. “In challenging times, the history is what keeps you going,” Mr. Knight said. “You don’t want to be the generation that failed,” adding, “Our father, Roger Knight, always says the last crop we raise will be asphalt.”Mr. Knight’s father recently took each sibling aside to relate cautionary Great Depression stories that his father and grandfather had told him. “At first I listened politely and told my father he was watching too much television,” Mr. Knight recalled. “But he was doing what we all are — drawing on accumulated knowledge and experience.”As Mr. Miller sees it, people who have always existed with a family business seeing to their needs sometimes relate to it as a living entity.Penny Murphy, the third-generation owner of Pioneer Linens — a luxury linen retailer in West Palm Beach, Fla., that she operates with her son, daughter, and 25 employees — said that she considered the company an “imaginary friend.”At the El Dorado Furniture chain in South Florida, nearly 20 members of the Capó family work with about 700 nonfamily employees. Six Capó brothers, 39 to 60, own and manage the company started by their father, with whom they fled Cuba. Any family member who wants furniture for personal use must pay wholesale costs plus shipping and delivery, the chain’s chief information officer, Jesús Capó, said. “We consider the business a niña linda — we don’t touch it,” he said, using the Spanish phrase for pretty little girl.Alan L. Carsrud, executive director of the Global Entrepreneurship Center at Florida International University in Miami, described family ventures as “the totem pole that the family dances around.” And in hard times, he said, they often have the advantage of minimal debt because they shunned borrowing in good times. “It’s the family wealth,” he said. “You’ve put everything at risk if you borrow against it.”With sales of $140 million last year, down from $167 million in 2007, the Capós will soon open an 11th store that they believe will position El Dorado for a real estate upturn. The construction costs exceed $10 million — all coming from the company’s savings, not loans, Mr. Capó said. “We’ve always had the refugee mentality that you don’t know if everything will be taken away tomorrow.”At Smiling Hill Farm, the Knights have a line of credit, but hope not to tap it. “When business was good, we were salting money away and waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Mr. Knight said. “Our parents instilled in us the perspective that good times don’t last forever.”And while their intent is to not lay off workers or cut their pay, the Knight siblings are all now deferring some of their own compensation, Mr. Knight said.In tough times, family businesses can pull together in ways that ventures with unrelated workers may not do as easily. “A family business can become like a turtle that pulls inward under its shell,” said Patricia M. Cole, an associate professor of family business and family therapy at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.Tom Juenemann, executive director of the Institute for Family-Owned Business in Portland, Me., agreed. “In addition to reducing their pay, they can work more, or bring aboard family members with a vested interest in the business,” he said.In Washington, Pietro Polles is depending on his wife and children to help sustain his dream of running an Italian-style trattoria called Sorriso.After retiring as an information manager at the World Bank, Mr. Polles said he studied cooking in Italy and opened Sorriso in 2004. Sales grew from the start, reaching $1.2 million in 2007.But sales began to level off last March. After sales dropped sharply last fall, the family took action.A departing assistant chef was not replaced, and Mr. Polles began working 12-hour days, cooking lunch and dinner seven days a week. Mr. Polles’s son, Stefano, and daughter, Isabella, who had worked in Sorriso part time, deferred their education and careers to work full time — she waits tables, he trained in Italy to make pizza. Their mother, Rose Marie Polles, a retired office manager at the International Monetary Fund, also began working full time as a hostess and fresh pasta maker.At a meeting in October, the family and the restaurant’s 11 nonfamily employees agreed that Mr. Polles and his son would work longer hours while the workers cut their workday by about an hour. “I haven’t let anyone go, which would only aggravate the bad economy, and everyone is equally important here,” Mr. Polles said.In some ventures, leadership can be complicated when family members assert themselves in ways that ordinary employees wouldn’t. Kit Johnson, a family business consultant in Boca Raton, Fla., said that she counsels families in such situations to “clarify their communication and make their conflict constructive.”Ms. Murphy, president of Pioneer Linens, hired Ms. Johnson to meet regularly with her and her 28-year-old son, Alan Murphy Jr., the company’s vice president. They were disagreeing about issues including marketing and promotion expenditures for the yacht division that Mr. Murphy supervises.And there are generational differences. “Alan is a child of the ’80s and ’90s, completely computer-driven,” Ms. Murphy said. “He wants to get things done quickly, while I have to think them over. We work at different speeds.”The counseling is helping, Ms. Murphy said. “We are learning to listen to each other.”'"
"'09-02-05,'1','Here are the 12 stars who changed teams: Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Steve Nash, Tracy McGrady, Ben Wallace, Peja Stojakovic, Antonio McDyess, Chauncey Billups, Gilbert Arenas, Carlos Boozer, Brand and Davis.And here are the asterisks.¶Although Nash became a two-time most valuable player after joining Phoenix in 2004, he was never considered an M.V.P.-caliber player in Dallas. In fact, Nash was named all-N.B.A. just twice in his Mavericks tenure, making the third team in 2002 and 2003.¶Billups was named the 2004 finals M.V.P. after leading Detroit to the championship. But when he signed with the Pistons in 2002, he was a journeyman who had never made an All-Star team.¶Hardaway joined the Suns in 1999, but his departure from Orlando was spurred by tensions between him and the Magic. Had he been happier there, Hardaway probably would have stayed. Money was not an issue.¶Wallace and Stojakovic are marginal stars. Wallace, who left Detroit for Chicago in 2006, is a defensive specialist with a career scoring average of 6.3 points. He had a few great seasons for the Pistons, but he was not an elite player before he came to Detroit and has been unremarkable since he left. Stojakovic is one of the league’s top 3-point shooters, but has made the all-N.B.A. roster just once (as a second-team selection).¶Arenas and Boozer left their teams through a loophole, which has since been closed. As second-round picks, they were not subject to the five-year rookie contract, which binds first-round picks. Nor did they have their “Bird rights,” which allow over-the-cap teams to offer maximum contracts. So Golden State was helpless when Arenas received a big offer from Washington, as was Cleveland when Boozer signed with Utah. The N.B.A. eliminated the loophole in 2005.¶Davis and Brand fall into their own category. They initially planned to play together in Los Angeles, but Brand left for Philadelphia after the communication lines got crossed between him and Clippers officials. A reported conflict in the Warriors’ front office allowed Davis to slip away.That leaves McGrady, Hill and McDyess as the only star players who left their teams as free agents while in their prime, without qualifiers or hazy front-office politics. It is also worth noting that McGrady, Hill, Stojakovic and Hardaway changed teams via sign-and-trade deals, which are rare and complicated.Of those three, only Hill ever finished in the top three in most valuable player voting. And O’Neal is the only modern free-agent superstar to lead his new team to the title.The bottom line is that an N.B.A. franchise almost never loses a star that it wants to keep. And championships are more often the product of great draft picks and great trades than of cap space.'"
"'09-02-05,'1','Outside Seminario Nuestra Señora Corredentora, the bishop’s bucolic seminary with its own farm in La Reja, Argentina, a small town near Buenos Aires, a priest who came to the door said that Bishop Williamson would not comment until he had spoken with his superiors.Pope Benedict has stumbled before in his nearly four-year papacy, most notably when he offended Muslims in 2006 by citing a medieval scholar who said Islam brought things “evil and inhuman.” But the internal controversy created by Bishop Williamson’s rehabilitation is unlike anything the Vatican has faced in recent decades.Wednesday’s unsigned statement — a rare case of the Vatican’s diplomatic arm furthering earlier remarks by the pope himself — not only showed an age-old institution grappling with the 24-hour news cycle. It also seemed to be a clear indication that the Vatican was facing nothing less than an internal and external political crisis.The day before, in a rare criticism from the head of a government, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany called on the pope to clarify his position on the Holocaust, saying his previous remarks had not been sufficient.Several prominent figures in the German Catholic Church joined in the criticism, and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops also issued a statement condemning Bishop Williamson.But the statement from the Vatican Secretariat of State seemed to go a long way toward calming the uproar. The chairman of the German Bishops’ Conference, Archbishop Robert Zollitsch, praised it, saying Wednesday that the Vatican had “clarified in an unequivocal way that every form of anti-Semitism should be condemned.”The Vatican statement noted Benedict’s remarks last week in which he expressed his “full and unequivocal solidarity” with Jews and condemned all attempts to deny the Holocaust. But it went far beyond the pope’s earlier remarks, which had never mentioned Bishop Williamson by name.The four bishops are from the traditionalist Society of St. Pius X, founded in 1970 by a French archbishop, Marcel Lefebvre, to protest the liberalizing reforms of the Second Vatican Council, or Vatican II, including liturgical changes, a commitment to ecumenism and religious liberty.The society’s 600 priests and estimated 400,000 followers are on the far right of the world’s one billion Catholics. They are particularly opposed to a Vatican II document that absolved contemporary Jews of responsibility for the crucifixion of Jesus.The four bishops were excommunicated by Pope John Paul II in 1988 after Archbishop Lefebvre consecrated them without a papal mandate. The schismatic society has no legal standing within the Catholic Church.Benedict has said he revoked the excommunications in an effort to heal a rift within the church. Last week, he called them a gesture of “compassion” and a first step on a longer path toward the society’s full reconciliation with the church.The statement from the Vatican on Wednesday also addressed questions about what conditions the society would have to meet before being fully welcomed back into the fold, saying it would have to offer its “full recognition of the Second Vatican Council” to receive “recognition” by the church.Jewish groups on Wednesday welcomed the statement by the Secretariat of State.“This was the sign the Jewish world has been waiting for,” Ronald S. Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, said in a statement.He noted that Bishop Williamson’s anti-Semitism was not “an isolated case” in the Society of St. Pius X, and he called on the pope “to ensure that the achievements of four decades of Catholic-Jewish dialogue are not being damaged by a small minority of people who want to divide rather than unite.”Rabbi David Rosen, the American Jewish Committee’s international director of interreligious affairs, said the Vatican’s “clear reiteration” that the Society of St. Pius X would be allowed back into the church only if it accepted the teachings of Vatican II was “most reassuring.”“Had all this been expressed at the outset,” he added, “we could have avoided the unnecessary damage and distress.”An internal doctrinal issue exploded into a firestorm after a Swedish television channel broadcast an interview days before the revocations were announced on Jan. 24, in which Bishop Williamson said he believed that no more than 300,000 Jews died in the Holocaust and that “there were no gas chambers.”Nowhere was outrage at the pope’s decision to rehabilitate Bishop Williamson stronger than in Germany, where Holocaust denial is a crime.Mrs. Merkel’s remarks on Tuesday tapped into a growing well of German discontent with the Vatican, including within the German Catholic Church.In a broadcast on German television on Monday, the bishop of Mainz, Cardinal Karl Lehmann, a former chairman of the German bishops’ conference and an influential and respected figure, said that the pope’s decision to rehabilitate Bishop Williamson had been “a disaster for all Holocaust survivors.”Cardinal Lehmann singled out Cardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos, the president of the Vatican commission in charge of relations with the Society of St. Pius X, who said last week that the commission had not been aware of Bishop Williamson’s comments before revoking the excommunications. Cardinal Lehmann said that there “had to be consequences for those who are responsible here.”On Wednesday, the archbishop of Berlin, Cardinal Georg Sterzinsky, called for a review of Bishop Williamson’s reinstatement. “My sense is that a different outcome would be reached,” he told the newspaper Bild. “And if it is determined that mistakes were made, no matter on what level, then an apology has to be issued.”In a public declaration issued last weekend, Bishop Gebhard Fuerst of Rottenburg-Stuttgart in southern Germany said that revoking the excommunications had led to “external and internal alienation from the church on the part of many believers, to a betrayal of trust especially among Jewish sisters and brothers in their relationship to the church and to a considerable disturbance in the Christian-Jewish dialogue.”That the revocation of an excommunication could erupt into such a crisis speaks to what some see as a failure of leadership within the Vatican.Conversations with a variety of people inside and outside the Vatican portray an intellectual pope increasingly isolated from the Vatican administration. Many point to a lack of communication between the handful of cardinals responsible for revoking the excommunications and other members of the curia who might have opposed the move.Writing on his blog, Sandro Magister, a correspondent for the weekly magazine L’Espresso and one of Italy’s most highly respected Vatican experts, pointed to a “double disaster” of “governance and communication” within the church.Cardinal Walter Kasper, a German who directs the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and who is the liaison for Vatican-Jewish relations, has said he was not consulted before the pope’s decision.“There were certainly management errors on the part of the curia, I want to be clear about that,” Cardinal Kasper said in an unusually direct interview with Vatican Radio’s German service on Monday.In the statement from the Secretariat of State on Wednesday, the pope asked the clergy and all the faithful “to support the very delicate and weighty mission of the successor of the Apostle Peter, who is custodian of the unity of the church.”'"
"'09-02-05,'1','Shares of other major financial companies were mixed on Wednesday, with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs posting strong gains while Wells Fargo closed lower.Bank stocks were battered last year as the financial system suffered a crisis of confidence, and shares of major financial companies and regional banks have continued to slide since the start of the year. Bank of America is down more than 50 percent since Jan. 1, while Citigroup is more than 45 percent lower.In credit markets, the price of government debt fell after the Treasury Department announced plans to sell $67 billion of notes and bonds and to reintroduce seven-year notes. The benchmark 10-year note fell 14/32, to 106 28/32 and the yield, which moves opposite its price, rose to 2.94 percent, from 2.89 percent late Tuesday.Rates on Treasury notes dropped to record lows as investors sought a safe haven for their money, but they have rebounded recently as the government prepares to issue a flood of new debt to combat the economic downturn.Shares of Kraft, which makes macaroni, Oreo cookies and dozens of other foods, fell 9.2 percent, to end at $26.11 after the company cut its outlook for 2009 because of the stronger dollar.A warning from the wholesale club Costco upset the consumer sector on Wednesday, signaling that even discount retailers are suffering as the economy weathers one of its worst downturns since the Depression. Shares of Costco fell 6.8 percent after it said that its January sales fell slightly and warned that its fiscal second-quarter earnings would be “substantially below” expectations.Other discounters, including Wal-Mart Stores, BJ’s Wholesale Club, Target and Family Dollar Stores, were all lower.Consumer spending fell at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the last three months of 2008 as the recession dragged on and Americans worried about joining the ranks of the unemployed.Investors took some heart from a report from the Institute for Supply Management, which showed that contraction in the service sector slowed slightly in January.

"'09-02-05,'1','SYDNEY, Australia — A sharp drop in commodities prices triggered a 56.5 percent decrease in first-half profit at BHP Billiton, the world’s largest mining company, which warned Wednesday of tougher times ahead.The British-Australian mining giant cited “unprecedented” falls in the price of metals and said it expected weak and volatile conditions to persist.“As the global economy continues to deteriorate, we are witnessing further demand contraction for our products,” the company said in a statement. “We believe it is likely that uncertainty will extend to the medium term.”The chief executive, Marius Kloppers, said prices for BHP’s portfolio of resources dropped by up to 60 percent last year during a rapid deceleration of the world economy that was “unlike anything anyone has seen.” The company’s profit for the six months to Dec. 31 fell to $2.62 billion from $6 billion the year before. BHP booked huge losses on its Ravensthorpe and Yabulu nickel mines and wrote down $386 million in costs associated with its aborted bid for a rival Rio Tinto.Excluding these one-off items, the company’s profits rose 2.2 percent to $6.13 billion from $5.995 billion a year earlier, which was “broadly in line” with analysts’ expectations, according to Rick Ronge, an analyst at Pengana Capital in Sydney.'"

The company said plans were still being completed.The company said it would also freeze pension plans and suspend matches to its 401(k) retirement plans beginning March 31.McClatchy said it planned to reduce costs by 7 percent over the next 12 months.McClatchy took a $59.6 million pretax charge to account for the reduced value of its newspapers, whose revenue prospects have declined as the worsening recession compounds losses resulting from the migration of readers and advertisers to the Internet.The loss amounted to 26 cents a share for the quarter. It compares with a loss of $1.43 billion, or $17.46 a share, in the same period a year ago, which included accounting charges.Excluding one-time charges, McClatchy earned 26 cents a share in the latest quarter, short of the 30 cents a share expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.'"
"'09-02-06,'1','Mr. Panetta would inherit a spy agency governed by rules somewhat more restrictive than under President George W. Bush, because of the executive orders issued by Mr. Obama last month that would shut agency prisons and require agency interrogators, for the time being, to abide by the same noncoercive interrogation techniques as those used by the military.Some critics of the new administration, including former Vice President Dick Cheney, have said that limiting the agency’s role in counterterrorism could backfire and leave the United States more open to a terrorist attack.In his testimony, Mr. Panetta said that under the rules issued by Mr. Obama, the C.I.A. is still allowed to detain and question terrorism suspects before transferring them to a military jail. But he said that unlike during the Bush administration, the International Committee of the Red Cross would be granted access to C.I.A. prisoners.Mr. Panetta also said the agency would continue the Bush administration practice of “rendition” — picking terrorism suspects off the street and sending them to a third country. But he said the agency would refuse to deliver a suspect into the hands of a country known for torture or other actions “that violate our human values.”A task force appointed by Mr. Obama is to investigate whether any interrogation methods beyond those currently allowed ought to be approved. Mr. Panetta did not hesitate Thursday to label as torture the interrogation technique known as waterboarding, which C.I.A. interrogators used on three terrorism suspects in 2002 and 2003 and has since prohibited.But Mr. Panetta said no agency operatives should be prosecuted for waterboarding — which induces the feeling of drowning — or any other interrogation method that had been authorized by the Justice Department.Before the same Senate panel last month, Dennis C. Blair, who is now the director of national intelligence, declined to say that waterboarding is torture, telling senators that it would be awkward for him to lead intelligence operatives he had accused of carrying out an illegal act.For years, C.I.A. officials have argued that the agency’s detention and interrogation program not only helped thwart terrorist attacks, but also was the government’s most valuable resource for gaining insight into Al Qaeda.Mr. Panetta pledged to examine the harsh interrogation techniques used by the spy agency after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to determine whether any damage done to America’s reputation abroad “counterbalanced” the intelligence gained during the interrogations.Although the C.I.A. can no longer hold prisoners indefinitely, and can no longer hide prisoners from the Red Cross, the exact rules governing agency detention operations remain murky. For instance, Mr. Obama has yet to spell out exactly how long the C.I.A. can detain a prisoner, and how long a detainee can be in C.I.A. custody before the agency notifies the Red Cross.Obama administration officials said the agency was likely to follow a Pentagon rule that requires Red Cross notification within a few weeks of a prisoner’s capture.Mr. Panetta is scheduled to testify further on Friday, but is expected to be easily confirmed by the Senate, which would make him the final member of Mr. Obama’s national security team to join the administration. Mr. Obama did not choose him for the job until early January, after other candidates for the job were passed over because of their association with controversial Bush administration counterterrorism policies.'"
"'09-02-06,'1','If a similar allowance is provided today for Chapter 13 filings, which let homeowners keep their property while working out their debts, bankruptcy courts could help a few million homeowners. But millions more would still face foreclosure, especially if unemployment continued to rise. Credit Suisse, for example, estimates that about 20 percent of an expected eight million foreclosures could be avoided by letting judges alter the terms of home loans.“We are making the best of a lousy situation,” said Joseph A. Peiffer, a bankruptcy lawyer in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who has represented both farmers and lenders and favors giving bankruptcy courts power to modify home loans. But, he added, “there will still be people losing their homes.”One of his clients, a farm family in eastern Iowa, sought Chapter 12 bankruptcy in late 1986. The family had borrowed when times were good to pay medical bills, but struggled to keep up with payments when interest rates jumped and crop prices fell. The day before the family filed its case, a lender seized half of its 350 cows. “It was sort of like a perfect storm of bad things,” Mr. Peiffer said.The bankruptcy court eventually wrote down about 40 percent of the family’s $1.5 million debt, and today, they are still farming, according to Mr. Peiffer.That type of resolution may help troubled homeowners avoid foreclosure, advocates say. Having a bankruptcy judge change loan terms can solve disputes that bankers and borrowers might be unable to tackle on their own, they say. And some loans could become more profitable for banks in bankruptcy than in foreclosure, where losses can be 50 percent or higher after legal and home repair costs, according to Rod Dubitsky, a Credit Suisse analyst.Perhaps more important, a bankruptcy judge can also cut through a thicket of legal complications for mortgages packaged into securities and sold to investors, which some banks say they have no authority to modify. Some investors have threatened to sue banks if those mortgages are altered.But the banking industry fiercely opposes the proposal to amend bankruptcy law. Officials warn that they would have to raise the price of credit to offset the cost of having to wait years to see whether borrowers successfully pay off modified loans — or slide back into default. Only a third to 40 percent of Chapter 13 personal bankruptcy filings are successful, experts say, often because people lose jobs again, become sick or get divorced.Foreclosure might bring them less, but banks and investors would get some money right away if they seized homes.In Chapter 12, judges could change interest rates and reduce, or “cram down,” debts secured by farmland, which suffered a boom-bust cycle in the 1970s and 1980s. The amount written down was added to other unsecured debts, like credit card balances, which are repaid cents on the dollar from money left over after living expenses and secured debt payments. Congress made Chapter 12 a permanent part of the Bankruptcy Code in 2005.Neil E. Harl, an agriculture and economics professor at Iowa State University, found that 85 percent of the first 150 farmers in Iowa who filed bankruptcy under Chapter 12 were still farming in 1995.But many farmers who encountered distress did not seek bankruptcy protection: from 1986 to 1997, farmers filed 19,216 Chapter 12 cases, according to the Agriculture Department — less than 1 percent of the two million family farms that existed in 1995. “As soon as everybody knew it was there,” Mr. Harl said about cram-downs, “they did the next best thing, which is to sit down and negotiate.”Nonetheless, bankers say that Chapter 12 resulted in higher interest rates, as lenders passed on the costs of bankruptcy. The Agriculture Department estimated in 1997 that rates on farm loans increased by 0.25 of a percentage point to 1 percentage point as a result of the law.The Financial Services Roundtable, an industry lobbying group, calculates that cram-downs may increase the cost of mortgages by up to 2 percentage points either through higher rates or bigger down payments. The restrictions on cram-downs “keeps the cost of homes low, and this bill will unravel that,” said Scott E. Talbott, its chief lobbyist.But other experts say such estimates are inflated. Adam J. Levitin, an associate professor of law at Georgetown University who favors changing the law, said rates may only rise by 0.15 of a percentage point.Lawmakers and lobbyists in Washington are deeply divided on cram-downs. The opposition includes Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who helped create Chapter 12. Banks, with the exception of Citigroup, have vowed to fight cram-downs, though some lobbyists have been pushing for amendments that would limit them to certain loans and would let lenders recoup losses if home prices rebound.The Obama administration and Democrats, including Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, hope to pass the measure either on its own or as part of another bill.The measure is eagerly awaited by households like the Benitez family in Palm Coast, Fla., which hopes bankruptcy will help them keep their three-bedroom house.Rosa Benitez, a real estate agent, and her husband, Carlos, who works in construction, have been unable to pay their mortgage since payments on their adjustable rate loan shot up in early 2008. At the same time, given the housing crash, they are making a lot less money.“Everything started going down when the mortgage payments went up,” Ms. Benitez said. The couple owes $227,000 on their mortgage and $31,000 on a home equity line of credit, but their home is worth only $175,000. Ms. Benitez said the couple could catch up if their debt was reduced to the current value of the home.Still, the couple, like many others, is vulnerable to falling behind again as home prices decline further. But Robert M. Lawless, a law professor at the University of Illinois who favors cram-downs, said success should not be viewed simply “in terms of dollars and cents.”“We forget the human side of the bankruptcy case,” he said. “Sometimes bankruptcy is about the soft landing.”'"
"'09-02-06,'1','“Why are they so aggressive? Why have they spent so much money, and to what end? I don’t know what the point is anymore.”At a time when the nation is in one of the deepest recessions in its history, when hundreds of thousands of Americans are barely surviving, the government is spending millions of dollars to prosecute Barry Bonds.On Thursday, the federal court in San Francisco dealt the government’s case a potential setback when United States District Judge Susan Illston said she would most likely throw out doping calendars and ledgers that prosecutors contended Anderson used to monitor Bonds’s use of performance-enhancing drugs. She also said she would very likely throw out the results from three positive tests for steroids in 2000 and 2001 as evidence at the trial.Significantly, Illston said that the government needed someone to state that the test samples came directly from Bonds. Without that, Illston said, “the documentation is not hooked up to this case.” She called the claims that the test results were from Bonds “classic hearsay.”That someone would presumably be Anderson.After all the pages are read, all the smoke is cleared, the case against Bonds may come down to loyalty. As long as Anderson is willing to choose prison over testifying against his friend and client, the government’s case may well depend on hearsay.The trial is scheduled to begin March 2, but is there anyone in the San Francisco jury pool who has not heard about the perjury charges against Bonds and formed an opinion?“Maybe the case can’t even be heard in San Francisco,” Tobias said.Where can it be moved? To Mars?The larger question is, why does the government persist?During the presidential campaign, then-Senator Obama suggested that having the government spend inordinate resources on steroids-related issues was not a prudent use of time or resources and suggested that the topic should not be a high priority for Congress or the federal government.Appearing on the ESPN radio show “Mike and Mike in the Morning” last October, Obama, when asked about how much the government should be involved in the steroids issue, said that “seeing a lot of Congressional hearings around steroid use is not probably the best use of Congressional time.”While Obama acknowledged that young people are drawn to sports and many make sports stars their heroes, he said that the nation had far greater priorities. “We’ve got nuclear weapons and a financial meltdown to worry about,” he said. “We shouldn’t be worrying about steroids as much as I think sometimes we do.”Nor should the government, with potentially thinning evidence, be spending millions of dollars in pursuit of Bonds.There are, of course, legitimate concerns that the judicial system will be corrupted if people get away with lying to grand juries. So why, then, as Tobias pointed out, is Scooter Libby free?“The one case that I think is similar is the Scooter Libby case in the sense that it was all about perjury,” Tobias said.Libby was indicted on federal charges of perjury and obstruction of justice resulting from the grand jury investigation into the leaking of the identity of the C.I.A. operative Valerie Plame. He was convicted on one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury and one count of making false statements to federal investigators. The prison sentence was commuted by President Bush.It was under the Bush administration that the Olympic sprinter Marion Jones was jailed after she admitted to making false statements about her use of performance-enhancing drugs, the N.F.L. quarterback Michael Vick was sent to prison on a dogfighting conspiracy charge and the rigorous pursuit of Bonds began.The new administration should step in and instruct the United States attorney’s office to end this fool’s mission against Bonds. His reputation has been destroyed and his hopes of reaching the Hall of Fame have probably been dashed. And the United States is out of millions of dollars in taxpayer money.And to what end?So prosecutors can say, “We struck out Barry Bonds.”Let it go, Lt. Gerard.'"
"'09-02-06,'1','WASHINGTON — The Agriculture Department on Thursday banned the company implicated in the nationwide contamination of peanut products from doing business with the federal government. At least eight people have died and hundreds have been sickened after eating tainted products.The order, which affects the Peanut Corporation of America and a subsidiary, will remain in force for one year. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack also stripped the company’s chief executive of his seat on a board that advises the government on peanut quality standards.David Shipman, an acting administrator at the Agriculture Department, said, “The actions of P.C.A. indicate that the company lacks business integrity and business honesty, which seriously and directly hinders its ability to do business with the federal government.”The department’s actions came on a day when senators heard testimony from health experts and a Food and Drug Administration official, who acknowledged that gaps in the food safety system had contributed to delays in catching the outbreak of salmonella in peanut butter and other products that spread to 43 states. The problem has been traced to a peanut processing facility in Blakely, Ga.Dr. Stephen Sundlof, the director of food safety programs at the F.D.A., told the Senate Agriculture Committee that the agency’s investigation was hindered in part by the absence of laws requiring companies to report contamination at processing facilities. Dr. Sundlof said food makers were required to tell the agency about safety issues only after shipping products.'"
"'09-02-06,'1','WASHINGTON (AP) — A Senate panel postponed a scheduled vote Thursday on President Obama’s nomination of Representative Hilda L. Solis as labor secretary, a day after questions were raised about tax liens against her husband’s business.White House officials say they do not believe her confirmation has been jeopardized by a news report that Ms. Solis’s husband paid about $6,400 this week to settle tax liens on his auto repair business that had been outstanding for as long as 16 years.The discovery posed another political headache for a White House already chafing after tax problems and other controversies derailed some administration appointments, including Tom Daschle’s nomination as health secretary. Mr. Obama said in television interviews this week that he would “make sure that we’re not screwing up again” in the vetting process.Mr. Obama’s press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said Ms. Solis’s own tax returns “are in order.”“She’s not a partner in that business,” Mr. Gibbs said of the auto repair company. “So we’re not going to penalize her for her husband’s business mistakes.”Asked if the Solis nomination was in trouble, Mr. Gibbs said, “I don’t believe it is at all.”USA Today first reported on Thursday that Los Angeles County records showed 15 outstanding state and county tax liens totaling $7,630 against Ms. Solis’s husband, Sam Sayyad, and his business.A White House spokesman, Tommy Vietor, said Ms. Solis and Mr. Sayyad were unaware of the liens until asked about them this week. Mr. Vietor said that Mr. Sayyad paid about $6,400 to Los Angeles County on Wednesday to settle the liens, but that he planned to appeal.'"
"'09-02-06,'1','In its latest triple bill at the David H. Koch Theater, New York City Ballet honors Leonard Bernstein by placing his music (“West Side Story Suite”) alongside two of the foremost composers of the last century, Stravinsky (“Stravinsky Violin Concerto”) and Ravel (“La Valse”). The program is called “20th Century Music Masters,” and certainly the score of “West Side Story” is Bernstein’s truest classic. Though full of wisdom he learned from earlier masters, its rhythms, harmonies, melodies all grab us entirely on their own terms.Jerome Robbins, director-choreographer of the original “West Side Story” (1957), staged the suite for New York City Ballet in 1995, five years after Bernstein’s death. The peril of the production is obvious: It threatens to turn both audience and dancers into tourists revisiting the “West Side Story” experience. It’s good to be reminded of a show that’s been in everybody’s nervous system for decades, but will the reminder prove serious or merely inconsequential?When Nikolaj Hübbe and Damian Woetzel led the suite’s cast — both retired last year — they provided the realism, the in-the-moment timing, that Robbins insisted on. Some dancers today have the same quality: Robert Fairchild showed it last spring as Tony, and he has the role again on Saturday afternoon. On Wednesday, Benjamin Millepied played the part with spontaneity of manner and seriousness of feeling, but his phrasing was a little after the beat, and his physicality seemed more lightweight than it is. (By contrast, he looms large in the role Alexei Ratmansky made for him in “Concerto DSCH,” where his charm becomes gripping.) Andrew Veyette (Riff) and Georgina Pazcoguin (Anita — fresher this year than last) had more immediacy, but the ballet is still in danger of slipping into heritage-memento status, nowhere more than in the opening clash between Jets and Sharks.The same problem hangs over City Ballet’s current account of a very different work, Balanchine’s 1972 “Stravinsky Violin Concerto.” Interestingly, it was Mr. Fairchild, making his debut on Wednesday in the role originated by Peter Martins, who, again, made every movement alert, full-bodied, pingingly musical. The other principals — Albert Evans and Wendy Whelan in the Aria I pas de deux, Yvonne Borree as Mr. Fairchild’s partner in Aria II, all very much more experienced — were relatively sketchy.The choreography remains extraordinary as architecture. The two central duets are both unlike each other and unlike any other duets. (At one point Ms. Whelan makes a backbend shape. She does it again in another duet in the current repertory, Christopher Wheeldon’s “After the Rain.” But the difference between the passive, manipulated role she plays there and the striking autonomy she shows in “Stravinsky Violin Concerto” is obvious.) Only with Mr. Fairchild, however, did the ballet again start to become encompassing; we need more like him.Between these two ballets came Balanchine’s “Valse” (1951). If you saw this work at New York City Center two weeks ago with Miami City Ballet, then you know the power and detail this Gothic drama can exert in a more intimate theater; and the supporting roles at Miami were very well coached. The ballet begins with three women who are easy to think of as the three fates. They introduce a strange and sardonic language of flourished arm gestures — later taken up by the ballet’s heroine and her partner — that the Florida dancers, unlike City Ballet’s, made newly astonishing.'"

"'09-02-06,'1','DAKAR, Senegal — A bizarre swarm of caterpillars is munching its way through the forests, cocoa and coffee fields of Liberia, threatening crops and forcing thousands to leave their homes because the bugs have contaminated the drinking water from rivers and lakes.Entomologists have identified the pests as a moth usually found in the forests of West Africa, but normally not in the huge numbers that appeared last month in Bong County, a lush northern region of Liberia, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.The infestation threatens crucial crops in a patch of West Africa that includes several impoverished, war-torn countries. The caterpillars have already been found in Guinea, and could appear in Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa producer, which borders the region of the outbreak in Liberia, and Sierra Leone, United Nations officials said.The outbreak was first reported in mid-January, when the black wormlike creatures set upon farms in northern Liberia.The caterpillars seemed to appear out of thin air, said Winfred Hammond, representative of the Food and Agriculture Organization office in Liberia. “They were eating the forest trees, vegetation around homes and crops,” he said. “It caused a lot of panic. People were fleeing their homes.”Initially scientists thought that the caterpillars were army worms, which are hard to differentiate from the current pest when in the caterpillar form but look different when they turn into moths. Army worms are dreaded because they eat food crops and bury their larvae deep under the soil, which makes them tougher to attack with pesticides, United Nations officials said.'"
"'09-02-06,'1','In a bit of genetic sleuthing, a team of researchers has determined that black wolves and coyotes in North America got their distinctive color from dogs that carried a gene mutation to the New World.The finding presents a rare instance in which a genetic mutation from a domesticated animal has benefited wild animals by enriching their “genetic legacy,” the scientists write in Thursday’s Science Express, the online edition of the journal Science. Because black wolves are more common in forested areas than on the tundra, the researchers concluded that melanism  the pigmentation that resulted from the mutation  must give those animals an adaptive advantage.Although common in many species, melanism in dogs follows a unique genetic pathway, said Dr. Gregory S. Barsh, a professor of genetics and pediatrics at the Stanford University School of Medicine and the senior author of the paper.Last year, Dr. Barsh and his laboratory identified a gene mutation responsible for the protein beta-defensin 3, which regulates melanism in dogs. After finding that the same mutation was responsible for black wolves and black coyotes in North America, and for black wolves from the Italian Apennines where wolves have recently hybridized with free-ranging dogs, the researchers set out to discover where and when the mutation evolved.Comparing large sections of wolf, dog and coyote genomes, Dr. Barsh and his colleagues concluded that the mutation arose in dogs 12,779 to 121,182 years ago, with a preferred date of 46,886 years ago. Because the first domesticated dogs are estimated to date back just 15,000 to 40,000 years ago in East Asia, the researchers said that they could not determine with certainty whether the mutation arose first in wolves that predate that time, or in dogs at an early date in their domestication.Robert K. Wayne, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies canine evolution and is a co-author on the Science paper, said in an interview that he believed the mutation occurred first in dogs. But even if it arose first in wolves, he said, it was passed on to dogs who brought it to the New World and then passed it to wolves and coyotes soon after their arrival.Dr. Wayne and his colleagues have dated the presence of dogs in Alaska to about 14,000 years ago and are now checking ancient dog remains from across the Americas for the mutation.The researchers concluded that the mutation is subject to positive selection, meaning that it serves some adaptive purpose. Cross-breeding produces offspring with one set of genes from each parent, in this case a dog and a wolf. If all subsequent breeding takes place among wolves, the dog genes eventually vanish, unless one or more of them helps the organism survive.Scientists have not yet identified the mutation’s purpose, but they suggested that its association with forested habitats meant the prevalence of melanism should increase as forests expand northward.In an interview, Dr. Barsh observed that beta-defensin is involved in providing immunity to viral and bacterial skin infections, which might be more common in forested, warmer environments.Marc Bekoff, a behavioral ethologist from the University of Colorado, who was not involved in the project, said more work was needed to show what adaptive advantage black coats might provide.

Barofsky, another watchdog for the program, told the Senate committee his office was turning to criminal investigations. “That’s going to be a large focus of my office,” he said.On projections by some analysts that TARP may need more money soon, Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, said, “There will be no additional funding for this program without airtight assurances that it will be better managed.”The Obama administration plans to unveil a strategy on Monday aimed at reviving the credit markets, helping struggling homeowners and lifting the economy out of recession.Tighter TARP management is expected to be a part of that package. A preview of that came Wednesday when the White House announced a $500,000 annual cap on executive pay at companies receiving TARP money.The Bush administration began TARP in response to an alarming slowdown in global capital markets set off by a housing slump that undermined mortgage-backed bonds carried on the books of major financial institutions.Congress approved the $700 billion program after Mr. Paulson said it would be used to buy broken bonds and clean off banks’ balance sheets. But days after that approval, Mr. Paulson changed the focus to buying preferred shares in banks.Ms. Warren, head of TARP’s Congressional oversight panel, told the banking committee that after three months on the job, her panel was still not getting enough answers from Treasury. She described the bailout as “an opaque process at best.”Ms. Warren said she plans to release a report on Friday that calculates Treasury put about $254 billion into financial institutions in 2008, but got only $176 billion in value.“That’s a shortfall of about $78 billion,” she said, adding that Mr. Paulson “was not entirely candid” in his description of TARP’s bank capital injection program.Mr. Barofsky, the independent TARP inspector general at Treasury, raised concerns about potential fraud in one of several programs financed by bailout money, the Federal Reserve’s Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility. “Treasury should consider requiring that some baseline fraud prevention standards be imposed,” Mr. Barofsky said in his first report to Congress.He told the committee the government had collected more than $271 million in dividends from its TARP-financed bank shares and said the department needed a strategy for administering its holdings.A Treasury spokesman said the department would adopt many of Mr. Barofsky’s recommendations.Treasury holds $279.2 billion in preferred shares from 319 financial institutions, paying dividends of 5 to 10 percent, according to Mr. Barofsky’s report.The government also received common stock warrants from 230 institutions, most of which are now out of the money. The largest positions in warrants include the American International Group, Bank of America, Citigroup and General Motors.'"
"'09-02-06,'1','¶ on his Fox News Channel talk show: “I guess the reason Democrats want to raise taxes, use class warfare, attack corporations is because they take everyone else’s money and redistribute it. But they themselves don’t pay taxes, so there’s no reason for them to worry about tax increases, right?”The chorus underscores the reversal of fortunes for Mr. Obama and the Democrats on the tax issue. Mr. Obama spent much of last year’s campaign promoting his plan to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans, promising to raise them only on those Americans who make more than $250,000 a year. Surveys during his general-election contest with Senator , the Republican nominee, suggested that Mr. Obama had erased some of the traditional Republican edge on taxes.A CNN survey a few weeks before the election showed that more Americans trusted Mr. Obama on tax policy than trusted Mr. McCain, by a margin of 50 percent to 44 percent. Exit polls on Election Day found that 71 percent of voters thought their taxes would go up under Mr. Obama — but that was not much more than the 61 percent who thought they would go up under Mr. McCain.After his victory, Mr. Obama moved quickly to reinforce his intention to be a tax-cutter, not a tax-raiser. The economic recovery plan he put forward originally devoted 40 percent of the money to tax breaks, although that proportion has since fallen to one-third or less in the version later passed by the House. Republicans are pushing for deeper tax cuts in the package, but no one is pushing for tax increases at the moment.Even so, the series of nominees with tax problems could redefine the political dynamics. First there was , who as treasury secretary now oversees the collection of taxes, but failed to pay $34,000 he owed until the offer of a cabinet job materialized. Then there was , nominated for secretary of health and human services, even though he neglected to pay $128,000 in taxes until he was selected. And then there was , chosen to be the White House chief performance officer, who once had a $900 lien placed on her house for failing to pay unemployment taxes on household help.Mr. Geithner managed to win confirmation anyway; Ms. Killefer and then Mr. Daschle withdrew their nominations this week. Either way, the three cases, on top of the tax troubles of Representative Charlie B. Rangel of New York, the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, provide ammunition for the opposition.“The challenge for Democrats is that Obama did a good job during the general of convincing voters that his party wasn’t just about raising taxes and spending more money,” said Sara M. Taylor, who was White House political director under President . “Between the stimulus and now the Daschle-Geithner tax problem, all that ground is gone.”Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster, said Mr. Geithner’s confirmation ensures that the issue will be lasting, because his past will come up whenever the issue of tax increases comes up. “It doesn’t help for the late-night comedians to have a ready target on Dems and taxes,” he said. “If they are laughing at you instead of with you, that has a corrosive effect.”Some Democrats argued that this, too, shall pass, and that the imbroglio will not affect the more fundamental shift in the politics of taxes. “That line would work better if Obama weren’t about to enact one of the largest middle-class tax cuts in history,” said Bruce Reed, president of the Democratic Leadership Council and a former domestic policy adviser to President . “Republicans found out in the 2008 campaign that it’s hard to tar Democrats as a high-tax party when Democrats aren’t for raising taxes.”But in a way they will be for raising taxes next year, at least on the wealthiest Americans, when Mr. Bush’s tax cuts are due to expire. Mr. Obama and leading Democrats want to make those tax cuts permanent for most Americans, but repeal them or let them lapse for the rich. Republicans are already arguing that Democrats will not stop there, and it is not hard to imagine television ads featuring the faces of Mr. Geithner and Mr. Daschle.Given the fiscal strain the government will face by then — Mr. Bush left a deficit topping $1 trillion, the largest in proportion to the economy since World War II, and Mr. Obama and Congress are on the verge of adding hundreds of billions of dollars more to it — the pressure to consider broader tax increases may change the debate. And Mr. Obama’s policy goals of expanding health care and curbing could lead to more pressure for tax increases to pay the costs.Joe Andrew, a former chairman of the , said that the nominees’ tax problems, along with questions about Mr. Obama’s vetting process and his decision to nominate a Republican senator for secretary of commerce, have all combined to undermine the Democrats’ reputation.“The reason that these are all related is that it is the pro-growth Democrats who have spent decades trying to change the image of the as high-tax and unfriendly to business,” said Mr. Andrew. “So to look like we don’t pay our taxes and don’t have a Democratic C.E.O. to be America’s business and commerce representative is a double whammy to the image.”The consolation, as he sees it, was Mr. Obama’s decision to take the blame and admit a mistake in the handling of the Daschle nomination. “What is positive about it,” Mr. Andrew said, “is we have a president who gets it, took responsibility for half the problem and moved on.”Now the question is whether the country will move on as well.'"
"'09-02-06,'1','PARIS — Swiss Re, the insurance giant, said Thursday that it was turning to Warren E. Buffett for a capital infusion, while Deutsche Bank and Banco Santander announced sobering forecasts, reminders that the credit crisis had yet to run its course.Swiss Re, based in Zurich, said it would receive 3 billion Swiss francs, or about $2.6 billion, from Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett’s holding company, and would consider raising another 2 billion francs in equity if the market would bear it. The company also reported a 2008 net loss of about 1 billion francs.Mr. Buffett has moved opportunistically since the onset of the financial crisis, wrapping up deals to invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs and $3 billion in General Electric, receiving lucrative terms in both cases.In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Buffett said he was “delighted” with the Swiss Re deal, and was “very impressed” by the company chief executive, Jacques Aigrain, and his management team.Berkshire already has significant business ties with Swiss Re. In January 2008, it entered a quota share arrangement with Swiss Re through which it acquired 20 percent of its new and renewed property and casualty business in exchange and acquired 3 percent of its shares at the same time.Berkshire “is a very strong source of capital and liquidity and there are not many of those around right now,” said Mark Nicholson, an analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research in London.'"
"'09-02-06,'1','HONG KONG — When McDonald’s sharply lowers the price of the Filet-O-Fish sandwich and double cheeseburger in China, one thing is clear: the global slowdown has truly arrived in the once-sizzling Asian economy.McDonald’s announced Thursday that residents of China, the world’s most populous nation, would now be able to feast on four new combo McDonald’s meals — the other two feature a chicken filet sandwich and a pork burger — for 16.50 yuan, or $2.41, a cut of up to one-third from the former price.The promotion, McDonald’s said, is “in line with the government’s direction to stimulate domestic demand” and “help build a stronger economy.” As the economy slows, “we can do our part by helping stimulate domestic demand in the restaurant sector,” said Jeff Schwartz, chief executive of McDonald’s China.McDonald’s is not the only food retailer to have lowered prices in China Others, like KFC, also have started promotions as consumers in China begin to fret about slowing growth and rising unemployment. But the price reduction by one of the world’s best-known companies highlights how the downturn that began in the United States has changed shopping and selling patterns as far away as China.Just a year ago, the prices of staples like pork, rice and cooking oil were soaring, lifting inflation and threatening to overheat the Chinese economy, which had recorded double-digit growth for half a decade. Now, with growth slowing to 9 percent in 2008, and expected to be even lower this year, the pressure is on for retailers to entice shoppers with special deals.Standard and Poor’s, the ratings agency, said on Thursday that it expected China to grow about 6.5 to 7 percent this year and to pick up steam slightly next year, with a pace of 7.8 to 8.3 percent in 2010. And S.& P.’s chief economist for the Asia Pacific region, Subir Gokarn, said he expected consumer price inflation to slow to 1.7 to 2.2 percent this year, from 5.9 percent in 2008.'"

"'09-02-07,'0','The SEC has just four teams ranked in the top 65 by collegerpi.com, which lists the SEC as sixth best among the Division I conferences. In addition, the SEC has a 6-16 record against teams ranked in the top 25 by collegerpi.com.“People sure seem to want to make a big deal about it right now,” Vanderbilt Coach Kevin Stallings said. “But that’s O.K. They need to take their shots while they can because we won’t stay young forever.”Projections for the N.C.A.A. tournament have only five SEC teams making the field. The conference has had that few in the tournament just twice in the last 10 years.Tennessee was expected to lead the SEC this season, ranked 14th in the preseason. But the Volunteers are 13-7 and are no longer in the top 25. Part of the reason is a schedule that has been judged the seventh toughest by the Sagarin ratings, but it is also because of uneven play in the backcourt.“We knew the league wasn’t going to be as strong at the top because Tennessee was picked at the top and I knew we weren’t nearly as good as we were last year,” Tennessee Coach Bruce Pearl said.Pearl said the strength of other conferences was pushing the SEC down the rankings, especially the Big East and the Atlantic Coast Conference, which are regarded as the top Division I conferences this season.The SEC is waiting for Kentucky, the conference’s bellwether for decades, to make a comeback after three disappointing seasons. The Wildcats are 16-7 over all and 5-3 in the conference. They have lost three in a row.Kentucky seems to share a characteristic with several other teams in the SEC: a lack of scoring depth. Jodie Meeks, a junior, averages 25 points a game, and Patrick Patterson, a sophomore, averages 18 points, but no other players are in double figures.Louisiana State gets the majority of its offense from guard Marcus Thornton, who is averaging 19 points a game, and forward Tasmin Mitchell, who is averaging 15. Tennessee gets 13 points a game from center Wayne Chism and 17 from Tyler Smith, and the Volunteers are waiting for a third scorer to emerge.The lack of scoring depth could be a reflection of the conference’s inability to draw the best players. Bob Gibbons, a recruiting analyst based in North Carolina, said the SEC lagged behind the other, so-called basketball conferences.“The A.C.C., the Big East, the Big Ten, the Big 12 are all getting more marquee high school kids than the SEC,” Gibbons said. “With the exception of a few schools — Florida, Tennessee, and Kentucky — it is such a football-dominated conference. They are the sixth-best conference among B.C.S. conferences in recruiting and getting prospects.”Of the top 150 prospects rated by Gibbons, 12 have signed with SEC teams for next season.Pete Herrmann, the interim coach at Georgia, shrugged when asked about the perception that the SEC is down.“I was watching the South Carolina-Florida game the other night and somebody on the air said the SEC was down, and then they ticked off the name of six schools from our conference that are going to get in the N.C.A.A. tournament,” Herrmann said. “Isn’t that what we usually get? Six?”L.S.U. guard Garrett Temple pointed out Wednesday that the conferences’ two best teams, L.S.U. (18-4) and Florida (19-4), could be highly ranked if they had not lost key players to the N.B.A. draft, the Tigers’ Anthony Randolph and the Gators’ Marreese Speights.“Everybody is looking down on the SEC right now,” Tennessee forward Tyler Smith said Thursday night while he watched the Lady Volunteers play Georgia. “Just wait, though. Florida will be ranked soon and L.S.U., too. And we’ll be there. We’ve played one of the hardest schedules in the country.'"
"'09-02-07,'0','At the Myrtle-Wyckoff station in Bushwick, Brooklyn, there are three 21st-century ways to tell when the train is coming. An electronic sign indicates the number of minutes before the next train. A public-address system conveys the same information. Finally, as part of a bold new experiment by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a pair of 42-inch video screens on the platform specify the locations of the trains and their distance from the station.Still, on Friday, a fair number of passengers were sticking with the old-fashioned way: Stand close to the edge of the platform. Crane your head and neck over the edge. Look down the tunnel.The electronic screens  formally, they are known as train locator consoles  were unveiled Thursday at the station for a test run, and may be installed later at other stations. On Friday, they had a captive audience, small crowds that watched, some with mouths agape, as an animated depiction of the L train hopped along its route in short, jerky movements.While most of the passengers expressed interest in the new technology, some thought the layout of the screen was cluttered and confusing; most had to look at it for a few minutes before they understood how it worked.The bottom half of each screen displays the locations of all trains moving along the entire L line; the top half has magnified views of the station and of the adjacent stations in both directions. In addition to the two 42-inch screens on the platform, a third is near the station booth.“It looks to be helpful,” Karl Brown, 21, a city transportation worker on his day off, said optimistically. “It’s surprising, I’ve never seen it in New York before. You know where the trains are, and that’s definitely something everybody wants to know. The graphics could be a lot better; I’m used to playing video games. But it’s a work in progress.”Steve Holmgren, 24, a freelance film producer on his way to a meeting in Williamsburg, called the new screens a “nice start,” but said the graphics should be bigger and clearer.Less enthusiastic was Anthony Atkinson, 22, a New York University student on his way home to Canarsie. “I think they should use the money to improve the running times of the trains,” he said, before peering out from the platform to see if a train was coming.With a chuckle, Victor Rosario, 60, who was heading toward Manhattan, joked, “I guess that’s why the fares are going up, huh?”Marilyn Morel, 31, a Borough Park resident who went back and forth between looking down the tunnel and at the video screen, described the former activity as a familiar habit. Margarita Guzman, 25, who sat on a bench underneath the new video screen, said, “Usually I look in the tunnel, but it’s dangerous to do that.”Others expressed distaste for the new technology. “I don’t care for it,” said Chris Southward, 37, who studies classics and was holding a book by Cicero. “It’s not going to make the train come any faster.”The new technology is possible on the L line, which runs from Eighth Avenue and 14th Street in Manhattan to Rockaway Parkway in Canarsie, Brooklyn, because the line is the first to be part of computer-based train control, a new signaling system.The system is linked to a new public address and customer information system.The line’s general manager, Greg Lombardi, requested the screens, which were developed within the agency.'"
"'09-02-07,'0','For now, Larry Ellison, the billionaire owner of BMW Oracle, is in Auckland and sailing with his team. Ernesto Bertarelli, the billionaire owner of Alinghi, is not expected to arrive until this weekend, if at all.Neither Ellison nor Bertarelli played a definitive role in the Pacific Series. Organized in just four months, it is the brainchild of Dalton and Bruno Troublé, a silver-haired Frenchman and former skipper who has long represented Louis Vuitton’s stake in the gilded lily of the America’s Cup.Like Yves Carcelle, chairman and chief executive at Louis Vuitton, Troublé was frustrated at being relegated to the role of mere sponsor at the 2007 America’s Cup in Valencia, Spain. In previous editions, Vuitton had been the organizational and financial impetus behind the challenger series. But for 2007, Bertarelli, whose team held the Cup, restructured the regatta to bring the challenger series and America’s Cup match under the same management. “We were just signing checks last time,” he said.Dalton, whose team depends on public good will and, to a degree, public financing, was eager to re-energize the base.“We haven’t lost the Kiwi public, but they don’t know what’s going on,” he said.To cut costs and promote close racing, the matches in Auckland are being conducted with similar, evenly matched pairs of yachts, an important change from the design differences that typically define Cup competition.Team New Zealand supplied its pair of boats from the last Cup. BMW Oracle then offered its pair, which Salvatore Sarno, the South African shipping magnate who owns Team Shosholoza, arranged to transport from Spain to New Zealand at a preferential rate.Economic forces whittled an initial pool of 17 serious candidates down to 10 teams, including Alinghi, which agreed to compete after Team New Zealand dropped its lawsuits against the Swiss team, Société Nautique de Genève, in New York.BMW Oracle, however, did not follow suit, continuing to dispute the legal right of a new Spanish yacht club, Club Náutico Español de Vela, to be Alinghi’s challenger of record for the next Cup. Whatever bonhomie is in evidence here between the teams’ sailors is not yet being reflected by the teams’ lawyers.“Obviously, this isn’t the ideal situation we’re in, and it’s just good to get some racing going again,” said Russell Coutts, the BMW Oracle skipper. “The court case, that’s coming up soon, and so it’s going to get a result one way or the other, so I think that will be a good thing. Obviously, if we win, we want to negotiate a multi-challenger event.”Bertarelli has disputed that, accusing Ellison and Coutts of trying to find a backdoor approach to racing for the Cup instead of going through the rigors of a true challenger series before facing the defender. If BMW Oracle wins in court and negotiations with Alinghi break down again, there is still a chance the two teams will contest the Cup in a one-on-one match later this year in huge multi-hulls.BMW Oracle’s trimaran, a 90-square-foot leviathan nicknamed Dogzilla, was launched last year, and the team has been training with it in San Diego. Although Alinghi has also been building a multi-hull, team officials confirmed that it had not yet been completed.“Obviously, we’re still getting ready for either eventuality,” Coutts said. “There are a lot of people who certainly want things settled, and we’re definitely in that category.”With the court case unresolved, Alinghi has moved ahead with planning for an America’s Cup in 2010, signing up 18 challengers — all the significant teams from 2007 except BMW Oracle — and agreeing on a revised set of rules as well as a new class of yachts in cooperation with other entered syndicates.With Club Náutico Español de Vela unable to pay for the trip to Auckland, the British challenger Team Origin has emerged as Alinghi’s most significant ally.“We really tried to sit on the fence and share blame between both teams,” Mike Sanderson, Team Origin’s team director, said. “However, now that the new protocol is out and the new class rule is out, it is in our opinion an incredibly fair event and quite possibly the most fair America’s Cup we’ve ever seen. It’s definitely time to get on with it.”Dalton has read the protocol and calls it “improved.” But though Team New Zealand has signed on, he has deeply mixed emotions. “It’s as simple as this: Morally, we agree with Oracle; financially, we need to survive, and so we want a Cup.”The Pacific Series has brought the yachts back to Auckland, where the Cup was contested in 2000 and 2003. For those accustomed to the Cup’s edginess, it is a refreshing change, with teams mingling easily.“It’s an easy event,” Troublé said. “We’re not talking about money. Everyone is tired of lawyers. I was a lawyer for 10 years, and I’m tired of lawyers, too.”Two preliminary round robins will eventually lead to a challenger final in which one team will advance to face Team New Zealand on Feb. 13 and Feb. 14. Crowds and spectator fleets should be significant, even if the impact on Auckland’s economy should be relatively small, at an estimated $7 million.Troublé is already talking about doing it again soon somewhere else, but the sailors are not confusing this pleasant, low-stress regatta in familiar waters with the main event.“The sailors all get on really well, so there’s no problem there,” Sanderson said. “But let’s not be under any illusion: these teams are all here in the hope of an America’s Cup. I’m sure Louis Vuitton would love to think this is standing on its own two feet, but we’re all here because we’re trying to get our foot in the door.”'"
"'09-02-07,'0','MOSCOW — Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin responded Friday to a European official’s criticism of what appeared to be several contract killings here by saying rights abuses occurred in Western Europe, too, citing the ill treatment of migrant workers.With that, Mr. Putin told the official, the president of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, that the “hockey puck” was back in Europe’s zone on the issue of human rights abuses.Even as Russia and Europe work toward better understandings on trade and energy, European Union officials say lapses in the rule of law and democratic norms remain major stumbling blocks to improving relations.At a joint news conference with Mr. Putin late on Friday, Mr. Barroso said he had raised the issue of contract murders during a meeting that day with the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev. At that point, Mr. Putin interjected his comments about Europe’s human rights problems.Two recent deaths have drawn wide attention. Stanislav Y.

"'09-02-07,'0','In fact, energy experts say that simply building a better grid is not enough, because that would make the cheap electricity that comes from burning coal available in more parts of the country. That could squeeze out generators that are more expensive but cleaner, like those running on natural gas. The solution is to put a price on emissions from dirtier fuels and incorporate that into the price of electricity, or find some other way to limit power generation from coal, these experts say.The stimulus bill passed by the House includes $6.5 billion in credit to federal agencies for building power lines, presumably in remote areas where renewable energy sources are best placed, and $2 billion in loan guarantees to companies for power lines and renewable energy projects. The bill also includes $4.4 billion for the installation of smart meters — which, administration officials say, in combination with other investments in a smart grid, would cut energy use by 2 percent to 4 percent — and $100 million to train workers to maintain the grid.About 527,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines stretch across the United States, most installed many decades ago.Everyone agrees that more lines are needed. But some industry experts argue that the problem of making the grid greener goes well beyond upgrading and expanding the existing power lines. The grid, they say, was set up primarily to draw energy from nearby plants and to provide a steady flow of electricity to customers. It was not intended to incorporate power from remote sources like solar panels and windmills, whose output fluctuates with weather conditions — variability that demands a far more flexible operation.The experts say that the grid must therefore be designed to moderate demand at times when there is less wind or sun available — for example, by allowing businesses or residential customers to volunteer to let the local utility turn down air-conditioners in office buildings or houses, when hourly prices rise.An even more significant problem is that utilities increasingly face opposition to expansion and must fight for years for permits.José M. Delgado, president and chief executive of the American Transmission Company, which operates in four Midwestern states, said his firm’s last major project, a line of about 220 miles from Duluth, Minn., to Wausau, Wis., took two years to build but eight years before that to win the permits. The federal Interior Department took a year to approve the line crossing a wild river and required a $5 million contribution to a national park, but the one-year delay raised costs by an additional $12 million, for a total of $440 million, Mr. Delgado said.Loan guarantees will not help this problem, he said. “We have had wonderful access to the private bond market,” he added.The International Transmission Company, a Michigan company, is trying to build a 26-mile line that, had it been in place, would have prevented the great Eastern blackout of 2003, said Joseph L. Welch, president and chief executive. The State of Michigan has approved it, but a homeowner is challenging it in court, Mr. Welch said.“We burn up three years on a line that will take two months to build,” he said.But, he added, “We absolutely have no problem — underscore, no problem — financing our transmission grid.”Other companies said the same, although a few said the loan guarantees in the House bill would be helpful.As power lines lengthen, the number of approvals they require increases, the complications of dividing the costs become greater and the difference among national interests and local interests becomes starker, said Dan W. Reicher, a former assistant secretary of energy who was a member of President Obama’s transition team.Policy makers have looked at various models to resolve the conflicting interests in power-line disputes. In the 1930s, the federal government assumed sole responsibility for approving natural gas pipelines, and as a result, gas moves freely from wells in the Gulf Coast states to other areas of the country, with much of it used to make electricity. Gas pipelines are somewhat less objectionable, though, because they are buried.Another model is the one used to build the Interstate Highway System, with the states using their powers of eminent domain in a system that was centrally planned with state input. But highways were more attractive to many states than power lines would be, electricity officials say, especially if the lines are simply crossing a state without adding much local benefit. A third possibility is a national commission that would present a master plan for thousands of miles of new transmission lines that Congress could approve for the whole country in spite of local objections for individual pieces.Congress tried to solve the problem in 2005 with a law that gave the Energy Department authority to intervene if states did not approve new lines deemed to be in the national interest, but that has not worked well, said Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Energy Committee. It was criticized as an assault on the traditional control by the states of land-use decisions.The electric industry is at least planning to better integrate different parts of the grid so that if power is needed in Baltimore it can be imported from Chicago. A group of technical experts, mostly from the Midwest, have been meeting for months to map out new lines, in an effort that industry veterans say is unprecedented in its breadth. But the group’s aim is simply a map of what such a system would look like; it will not seek permission for such lines, or try to finance them or actually build them. The group is scheduled to make an announcement next week.“We’ve got a real political confrontation that’s going to take place,” said Glenn L. English Jr., chief executive of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, who had served as a congressman from Oklahoma for 20 years. “It basically comes down to the question of prioritization. What’s more important to you? Do you truly want to maximize the use of renewable energy?”'"
"'09-02-07,'0','The year has barely begun, and already it’s been a particularly unlucky one for fictitious first-time female presidents of the United States. As Allison Taylor on “24,” Cherry Jones is in the White House, fighting terrorist threats from an African revolutionary who wants to blow things up unless the president, with her nation-building visions, removes troops from his made-up-for-television country. Her family is in jeopardy, and Jack Bauer, no longer on the federal payroll, is going double rogue to save innocent lives and further reveal the incompetence of bureaucratic intelligence. The series that was once devoutly statist has now swung libertarian: the government isn’t good for much; it is the archenemy.A similar if less contained sense of Bush-era paranoia pervades “XIII,” a two-part Canadian and French mini-series (beginning on Sunday on NBC). Within seconds, President Sally Sheridan is gunned down in the middle of a speech in which she is promising to withdraw troops from Iraq and Afghanistan.

"'09-02-07,'0','Job creation is a hot-button topic for the stimulus package. In January, employment among businesses with fewer than 50 workers declined 175,000, the third consecutive monthly decline, according to the ADP Small Business Report released Wednesday. Businesses with fewer than 500 employees lost 430,000 jobs in the month, ADP said, indicating that the recession was hitting the sector hard.Companies like MCM Composites in Manitowoc, Wis., a maker of composite molding parts for military contractors and aerospace companies as well as houseware and cookware manufacturers, have drastically reduced operations.This month, said Michael J. Fredrich, the owner, there are only enough orders to keep operations running two- to two-and-a-half days a week. “That’s it. That’s all we can do.”What is not included in the stimulus plan, but could help, is a reduction of the highest tax rate, Mr. Fredrich said. Many owners pay income tax at the personal level, as he does, so it would be money in their pockets to reinvest.“That would have an immediate effect,” Mr. Fredrich said, as would a payroll tax holiday, which is also not included.Terry McGill, who owns a commercial and industrial painting operation in Omaha, would welcome a six-month payroll tax holiday, something advocated by the National Federation of Independent Business. Mr. McGill said his remaining 30 employees — down from 60 — would have extra money in their pockets each week to spend.If the amount equaled 6 percent of a payroll, and a worker made $500 a week, for example, that’s $30 more. “That doesn’t sound like much,” he said, “but that’s $1,560 a year, that’s without including any overtime.”“I just think it’s a real fair way to do things,” Mr. McGill added. “It wouldn’t be money hidden away; it wouldn’t be a lump sum. If you had 30 bucks more a week, it might be your gas for the week, but as a stimulus, it would get spent. I would certainly spend it, both at home and in my business.”To put it in perspective, he said, the profit margin in his industry runs 3.5 percent to 7 percent. “You’re really talking about a break that would exceed what we would consider a good year,” Mr. McGill said. “Boy, would that make life better.”Meanwhile, banks are still not extending credit readily, eliminating a vital cash outlet for businesses.The Federal Reserve’s quarterly report on bank lending, issued on Monday, found that the number of banks that tightened their lending policies on all major loan categories over the previous three months “stayed very elevated.”The current climate has made owners even more pessimistic than they were last fall, according to the Small Business Research Board in Buffalo Grove, Ill., which is finishing up its latest confidence survey.What is needed is access to capital, said Gregg Steinberg, president of the board. Not only has lending ceased, but the value of business owners’ homes is falling, meaning owners cannot tap into home equity for their businesses.Mr. Steinberg is advocating that the stimulus bill include an emergency lending vehicle similar to the disaster relief loan program after Hurricane Katrina.Local banks could provide the loans with government backing and built-in technical expertise, he suggested, to ensure the program was efficient and effective.Paul G. Merski, chief economist at the Independent Bankers Association, said that the House and Senate had tried to address inadequate lending in their bills. On the appropriation side, the House allocated $500 million to the Small Business Administration’s guaranteed loan program to decrease or eliminate fees. The Senate version bumps that up to $615 million.The provision, coupled with a two-year increase in the guaranteed level of loans to 95 percent, from 75 percent to 85 percent, would “kick-start” lending, Mr. Merski said.The ripple effect could be far and wide, he said. Community banks, which represent about 12 percent of all bank assets, but make 20 percent of all small-business loans and about half of the loans that are less than $100,000, would churn out new loans to small businesses and franchises. Those companies in turn could buy equipment and hire back employees, who could then spend more money as consumers.While President Obama wants Congress to move quickly, Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, said more time should be spent examining other ideas. “I think more than expediency,” she said, “it has to be a good bill.”“If small-business owners are to shoulder the responsibility for getting our nation back on sound economic footing,” Ms. Kerrigan said, “they need something from this package that will encourage them to invest, hire and prepare for growth.”'"
"'09-02-07,'0','Crude oil prices fell a dollar to settle at $40.17 a barrel in New York.Analysts said they were cheered that financial markets seemed to shrug off a government report showing that unemployment climbed to 7.6 percent in January as the recession deepened, a sign the job market was still far from hitting bottom.“It’s a good sign that we’re trading up in the face of bad news,” said Ed Hyland, global investment specialist at JPMorgan Private Bank. “That’s one of the signs that you look for in the bottoming of a bear market.”Although the statistics were grim, the so-called whisper numbers representing the most pessimistic estimates on Wall Street guessed that unemployment could have spiked to 8 percent last month, given the mass layoffs announced by employers.“It’s this paradigm: not as bad as it could’ve been is the new good,” said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company.Analysts pointed to another positive signal: Congress appears to be making progress toward passing an economic stimulus package after Senate negotiators pared down a nearly $900 billion package to about $780 billion.Investors snapped up distressed bank stocks like they were items on a bargain table and bid up basic-materials companies and shares of General Electric, Home Depot and Caterpillar. Retailers, whose shares have been hit by falling profits and reduced outlooks for 2009, rebounded on Friday.Depressed bank stocks surged. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase each posted double-digit gains, and Bank of America rose nearly 30 percent, rebounding to $6.13 a share in regular trading.The broad rally lifted even companies that reported pessimistic earnings forecasts. In New York, shares of Toyota rose slightly to $69.38 after the automaker said it expected to post a loss for the fiscal year ending March 31, its first ever.Shares of the Ford Motor Company and General Motors were flat.Carmakers in the United States and abroad have been hammered by plummeting sales as financing becomes more difficult and consumers curtail their spending. This week, the Big Three automakers reported that new-vehicle sales fell 37 percent in January, their worst month in decades.The price of Treasury debt fell as investors looked for higher returns on their money and stormed back into equities. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 22/32, to 106 12/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.99 percent, up from 2.91 percent late Thursday, well above its December low of 2.06 percent.Treasury yields plunged last year as losses mounted in the stock and bond markets and shaken investors rushed to find safe investments, but interest rates on short-term and long-term Treasury debt have crept higher in the last few weeks as the credit markets recover and on anticipation of huge government spending and borrowing.Other barometers of the credit market were stable.The London interbank offered rate, a measure of how much banks charge each other to borrow money, was little changed at 1.2 percent. The so-called TED spread, which increases as investors become more cautious about lending money, was 0.97 points, unchanged from Thursday.“It doesn’t sound like a lot, but that’s the beginning of a very significant shift in investor appetites,” said Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer of the Bessemer Trust. “We’re seeing money flow into areas entailing more risk. There’s fear out there, but I think it’s increasingly being mitigated by the sense that there’s money to be made.”'"
"'09-02-07,'0','In fact, energy experts say that simply building a better grid is not enough, because that would make the cheap electricity that comes from burning coal available in more parts of the country. That could squeeze out generators that are more expensive but cleaner, like those running on natural gas. The solution is to put a price on emissions from dirtier fuels and incorporate that into the price of electricity, or find some other way to limit power generation from coal, these experts say.The stimulus bill passed by the House includes $6.5 billion in credit to federal agencies for building power lines, presumably in remote areas where renewable energy sources are best placed, and $2 billion in loan guarantees to companies for power lines and renewable energy projects. The bill also includes $4.4 billion for the installation of smart meters — which, administration officials say, in combination with other investments in a smart grid, would cut energy use by 2 percent to 4 percent — and $100 million to train workers to maintain the grid.About 527,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines stretch across the United States, most installed many decades ago.Everyone agrees that more lines are needed. But some industry experts argue that the problem of making the grid greener goes well beyond upgrading and expanding the existing power lines. The grid, they say, was set up primarily to draw energy from nearby plants and to provide a steady flow of electricity to customers. It was not intended to incorporate power from remote sources like solar panels and windmills, whose output fluctuates with weather conditions — variability that demands a far more flexible operation.The experts say that the grid must therefore be designed to moderate demand at times when there is less wind or sun available — for example, by allowing businesses or residential customers to volunteer to let the local utility turn down air-conditioners in office buildings or houses, when hourly prices rise.An even more significant problem is that utilities increasingly face opposition to expansion and must fight for years for permits.José M. Delgado, president and chief executive of the American Transmission Company, which operates in four Midwestern states, said his firm’s last major project, a line of about 220 miles from Duluth, Minn., to Wausau, Wis., took two years to build but eight years before that to win the permits. The federal Interior Department took a year to approve the line crossing a wild river and required a $5 million contribution to a national park, but the one-year delay raised costs by an additional $12 million, for a total of $440 million, Mr. Delgado said.Loan guarantees will not help this problem, he said. “We have had wonderful access to the private bond market,” he added.The International Transmission Company, a Michigan company, is trying to build a 26-mile line that, had it been in place, would have prevented the great Eastern blackout of 2003, said Joseph L. Welch, president and chief executive. The State of Michigan has approved it, but a homeowner is challenging it in court, Mr. Welch said.“We burn up three years on a line that will take two months to build,” he said.But, he added, “We absolutely have no problem — underscore, no problem — financing our transmission grid.”Other companies said the same, although a few said the loan guarantees in the House bill would be helpful.As power lines lengthen, the number of approvals they require increases, the complications of dividing the costs become greater and the difference among national interests and local interests becomes starker, said Dan W. Reicher, a former assistant secretary of energy who was a member of President Obama’s transition team.Policy makers have looked at various models to resolve the conflicting interests in power-line disputes. In the 1930s, the federal government assumed sole responsibility for approving natural gas pipelines, and as a result, gas moves freely from wells in the Gulf Coast states to other areas of the country, with much of it used to make electricity. Gas pipelines are somewhat less objectionable, though, because they are buried.Another model is the one used to build the Interstate Highway System, with the states using their powers of eminent domain in a system that was centrally planned with state input. But highways were more attractive to many states than power lines would be, electricity officials say, especially if the lines are simply crossing a state without adding much local benefit. A third possibility is a national commission that would present a master plan for thousands of miles of new transmission lines that Congress could approve for the whole country in spite of local objections for individual pieces.Congress tried to solve the problem in 2005 with a law that gave the Energy Department authority to intervene if states did not approve new lines deemed to be in the national interest, but that has not worked well, said Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Energy Committee. It was criticized as an assault on the traditional control by the states of land-use decisions.The electric industry is at least planning to better integrate different parts of the grid so that if power is needed in Baltimore it can be imported from Chicago. A group of technical experts, mostly from the Midwest, have been meeting for months to map out new lines, in an effort that industry veterans say is unprecedented in its breadth. But the group’s aim is simply a map of what such a system would look like; it will not seek permission for such lines, or try to finance them or actually build them. The group is scheduled to make an announcement next week.“We’ve got a real political confrontation that’s going to take place,” said Glenn L. English Jr., chief executive of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, who had served as a congressman from Oklahoma for 20 years. “It basically comes down to the question of prioritization. What’s more important to you? Do you truly want to maximize the use of renewable energy?”'"
"'09-02-08,'0','But no defection hurt as much as that of the high-scoring Marian Hossa. A pending free agent when acquired by General Manager Ray Shero from Atlanta last February, Hossa became a potent partner for Crosby. When he signed with the enemy Red Wings in July, Penguins fans burned their Hossa jerseys, and he will most likely be roundly booed on Sunday.“It’s hard to lose a guy like Hossa, but what are you going to do?” Shero said by telephone from Pittsburgh on Friday. “When I made the trade at the deadline, it was a situation where we knew he was unrestricted and understood the likelihood of resigning him, but there was a window for us. I felt we had a real good team last year and the pieces could come together.”Shero said he would do it all again because, he explained, Hossa’s presence helped his young team go far in the postseason and gain valuable experience. He was able to fill the holes left by the free agents, although the former Islander Ruslan Fedotenko, brought in to replace Hossa, has also been injured.“Luckily we had that start or we wouldn’t be in shouting distance of where we are now,” Shero said. “We’ve got 14 guys back who went to the final, and I’m hoping those are the guys who will get it done for us. We’ll get Gonch back, maybe make a few acquisitions. We have a good schedule in March with lots of home games. So I’m hopeful we’ll get some wins here and get into the playoffs.”The teams’ first rematch after last year’s final took place on Nov. 11, when the Penguins rallied from a three-goal deficit for a wild 7-6 overtime victory. Jordan Staal scored three times in the third period, tying the game with 23 seconds left in regulation.You just can’t keep a good 40-year-old Finnish defenseman down. Take Teppo Numminen, who returned to action with the Sabres in their 5-0 victory over Toronto last Wednesday.Numminen had missed six games after surgery to repair a crack in his jaw, which he sustained from a deflected puck in a game against Carolina on Jan. 17.Last season, Numminen played just once for the Sabres — the final game of the schedule — because he was discovered to have a defective heart valve just before the season began. He underwent open-heart surgery in late September and convalesced, recovered and got into playing shape just in time for that last game.Numminen is the last player still active from the 1986 N.H.L. draft and has appeared in more games in the league than any other European-trained player — 1,361 going into this weekend.“It’s been a long journey,” he said last year when he returned from heart surgery. “It’s great to be healthy and great to be back here.”For Numminen, that long journey is continuing.Some important voices spoke on the issue of fighting last week. Paul Kelly, executive director of the N.H.L. Players Association, said that he did not think fighting should be eliminated from the game but that he did favor establishing rules that would minimize risk of serious injury, such as prohibiting players from removing their helmets while fighting and halting fights if helmets fell off.Kelly also expressed concern about staged fights engaged in by “the super-heavyweights, the 6-foot-7, 250-plus-pound players who frankly, just on the basis of sheer size and strength, have the ability to deliver really damaging blows.” He called those fights “the most dangerous in our sport.”Two of the league’s prominent heavyweights said they shared Kelly’s concerns. Montreal’s Georges Laraque, regarded as hockey’s best fighter, said he phoned Kelly to support the safety measures. Minnesota’s Derek BoogaArd, another top fighter, said that enacting helmet rules was “just common sense” but expressed concern that ridding the game of enforcers would lead to a free-for-all.'"

"'09-02-08,'0','Pete Sessions, a conservative from Waco, Tex., and the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, warned that they could become an insurgency, having learned more about insurgencies “because of the .” (Yes, that’s the same Taliban that was allowed to regenerate by bumbling Republican leaders.)Obama advisers are right to crow that the president’s civility to Republicans will be popular with the public. But the carrot-stick ratio was way out of whack. Mr. Obama should have written up a kosher (as in pork-free) bill that Americans could trust — and Republicans couldn’t as easily mock — and jammed it through.It’s a huge, scary moment, with trillions of dollars and millions of jobs flying out the window. Vice President , in another Cassandra moment, told House Democrats that even if the White House does everything right, “there’s still a 30 percent chance we’ll get it wrong.”The president and his aides seemed a bit snow-blinded by the White House, overwhelmed and slow to understand that they were losing the high ground and the whip hand. They couldn’t even get their pick for commerce secretary, the Republican Senator , to vote for their stimulus bill; he said he would abstain.Those in the president’s circle were too caught up in more narrow concerns, like how their relationships with the president and the capital were shaking out; whether they could breathe on this new planet with the rarefied air of cool planes and helicopters; and whether W.’s mind-boggling mountain of garbage would trash Democratic candidates in 2010 and doom Mr. Obama to one term.“I would rather do the right thing and have one term than be mediocre and have two,” Mr. Obama told House Democrats at their Williamsburg retreat Thursday night. The lawmakers had been feeling disillusioned that they were carrying Mr. Obama’s water on the bill, while Obama aides triangulated and promised that the bill would “improve” in the Senate.told her leadership team that she had told the president, “I don’t mind you driving the bus over me, but I don’t appreciate your backing it up and running over me again and again.”The Obama wizards’ tactical skills seemed to desert them. The White House often ends up making its inhabitants tone-deaf (or even nuts), but this was an unusually quick trip into the cognitive third dimension.Asked what he had learned from the Daschle fiasco, one Obama official replied, “Not to rationalize.”They knew that the choice of conflicted with the Obama change message, but they preferred to focus on how much the president owed his friend and how good they thought he would be in the job.They wanted him because he was the ultimate insider and they lost him because he was the ultimate insider. Now Daschle’s for getting too rich with special interests will be to get richer with special interests.Obama aides call the morass a good wake-up call, and the president seems more aware of how the White House weather can cloud your thinking. Maybe that’s why he keeps trying to pop out to get a breath of fresh air — at an elementary school, at the , at Camp David.On Friday, a reporter asked if the president was already feeling cooped up.“He’s a bit of a restless soul,” Gibbs said, laughing. “His idea of a crazy day is to take a long walk.”doesn’t need to leave his new home to be isolated. That’s the specialty of the White House.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','The Obama administration rightly concluded last week that unless bailed-out bankers were forced to take pay cuts, public support for a continuing bank rescue would never materialize. But the pay curbs are minor in the grand bailout scheme, which will ultimately put hundreds of billions of tax dollars, if not trillions, on the line.Clearly, the bailout has to start putting taxpayers first in vastly more significant ways than it has since President Bush started it last year. On Friday, the Congressional overseers of the bank bailout reported that in a few months last year, the government overpaid for banks’ troubled assets by some $78 billion — a redistribution, in effect, of taxpayer dollars to the banks and their shareholders. And for what? The system was rescued from collapse, but has since edged up to the abyss again. Whether the Obama administration has figured out a better way — one that will protect taxpayers and clean up the mess as quickly as possible — will be clearer on Monday, when it unveils its new and improved plan.Putting taxpayers first means that in exchange for shoring up the banks, the government must receive ownership stakes that reflect the level of support it gives. For the neediest banks, that would likely work out to a majority interest; de facto, taxpayers would own the bank.In those cases, existing shareholders would be virtually wiped out and the government, as the owner, would assume responsibility for restructuring the bank. Contrary to stereotype, in countries that have successfully weathered serious bank crises, including the United States, such a takeover is preferable to leaving firms in the hands of those who have so badly mismanaged them.Done properly, it fosters transparency and restores confidence by allowing for a prompt disclosure of expected losses and an attempt to assign realistic values to the assets that feed those losses. It does not mean putting a government careerist in charge or stacking the bank board with federal officials. Safeguards are needed to avoid political interference in lending and other banking decisions, and rules are needed to determine when and how the government should end its ownership.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','A more liberal expensing regimen “seems to be something that has broad consensus politically and is certainly helpful for small businesses,” Mr. Foster said. Just how valuable a benefit it is in a time like this, though, is debatable.“It doesn’t do any good if you don’t have enough income to use the deduction,” he pointed out.Ms. Weltman agreed, saying that the same applies to many other breaks. Doing even less good for small business are changes in some states that are seeking ways to shore up their depleted treasuries. She advised vigilance for “piddling kinds of tax increases that can impact small business.”One change to federal tax rules that could be useful in today’s climate, especially for businesses that were on a winning streak before slamming head-on into the recession, is found in the stimulus package now snaking its way through Congress.A provision would allow businesses that had a loss last year to offset it against profits earned as far back as five years. Businesses could immediately recoup tax paid on the profits that the 2008 loss wiped away.“Ordinarily when a business suffers a net operating loss, it can carry back the loss two years,” Ms. Weltman explained. Lawmakers “want to extend that to five years, so if you have a very big loss, you’re going to be able to get a refund now. They’re trying to let businesses get some money back so they can use it to survive.”The amount that can be carried back is limited to 90 percent of the loss; the rest is forfeited. This piece of the provision is known as “Rangel’s wrinkle,” she said, a reference to Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the panel that oversees budget matters.Deductions and accounting devices won’t prevent some businesses from being unable to pay their full tax bill. As with individual taxpayers, the Internal Revenue Service is willing to show businesses some leeway, a spokeswoman for the agency said. Debt collections may be postponed if matters have gone that far, and leniency may be granted when payments are missed under installment agreements.Whether or not they get a hand from Congress or the I.R.S., owners of small businesses can give themselves a break by structuring their affairs in a tax-efficient way. Fred Freifeld, an accountant in South Florida, tells fledgling entrepreneurs that they can reduce their liability by incorporating, but that doing so can also make tax matters more complicated, with more kinds of taxes to pay and more frequent payments.Small-business owners must make payments of estimated personal and, if relevant, corporate income tax, as well as self-employment tax, the equivalent of Social Security and Medicare taxes paid by employees and employers. That requires discipline and, of course, cash, which can be hard to come by when a business is new or operating in a weak economy.“Don’t get behind the eight ball as far as taxes go,” Mr. Freifeld said. “You’re not used to estimated tax payments; you’re used to being an employee and having taxes withheld. Taxes have to be paid quarterly, and there are penalties if you don’t. A lot of times people who start their own businesses don’t think about it.”IT is not as though business owners have nothing else to occupy their thoughts. The complexities of taxation and a concentration on other aspects of running a business may mean that new tax breaks are not as beneficial as these owners hope.“The tax code is a pain in the neck,” Mr. Foster said. “My sense is that small-business people have very little time or inclination to follow the threats or opportunities developing in Washington. If there were a proposal to reduce tax rates on small businesses, it would be more eye-catching.”'"
"'09-02-08,'0','“No more dramatic or potentially explosive epidemic of a new acute viral disease has occurred in the world in the past 30 years,” the commission that investigated and controlled the epidemic wrote in The Bulletin of the World Health Organization in 1978.Dr. Close’s role in the crisis began on a flight from Geneva to Kinshasa as he was returning from home leave in the United States. Overhearing comments between two epidemiologists sent at Zaire’s request from the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta to help control the epidemic, Dr. Close asked to join in the conversation. The three spoke the entire night flight, said one of them, Dr. Joel G. Breman.On arrival in Kinshasa, Dr. Close, a man with a take-charge personality, immediately arranged a meeting with the Ministry of Health. He was able to help commandeer pilots and airplanes to ferry equipment to where it was needed. Dr. Peter Piot, a co-discoverer of the Ebola virus, said Dr. Close played “an indispensable” role in controlling the epidemic by using his direct access to Mr. Mobutu to gain political and military logistic support.Dr. Close had one of the earliest mobile phones, “so heavy it had to be carried by someone,” said Dr. Piot, who recently retired as director general of the United Nations AIDS program.“He impressed everybody” by commandeering a Zairian Army transport plane to fly a team to the epidemic area and helping to identify capable people to work on the team, Dr. Piot said, adding, “I thought, ‘This man is more than Mobutu’s physician.’ ”“We, the investigating team, were scared,” said Dr. Breman, who now works at the Fogarty Center at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. But, he said, “Bill was right in the middle, running the hospital in Zaire, assigning aides and making sure the needles, syringes, generators and other equipment were getting to where needed.”The team broke the chain of Ebola virus transmission by providing protective clothing for hospital workers, sterilizing equipment and strictly isolating patients in their villages. The final tally: 318 cases, 88 percent fatal.Dr. Close’s efforts also played an indirect role in early studies of H.I.V. a decade later. Tests showed that a high percentage of people in Kinshasa were infected with the AIDS virus. But the rate of infection in rural areas was unknown.To determine whether the prevalence of the disease had changed over a decade in rural Zaire, Dr. Joseph B. McCormick, a co-investigator of the Ebola epidemic, led another team that tested people in the area in the mid-1980s. In part by comparing rates found in blood stored from a survey in the Ebola region in 1976 to rates from the newer samples, Dr. McCormick said, “we found that the prevalence of infection in the rural area was stable and low at 0.8 percent.”The AIDS study showed that H.I.V. infection and AIDS could have existed and remained stable in a rural area of Africa for many years. It was one of the rare studies able to compare rates over time in the early period of AIDS and would have been impossible without Dr. Close, said Dr. McCormick, now dean of the University of Texas School of Public Health in Brownsville.William Taliaferro Close was born on June 7, 1924, in Greenwich, Conn. He was reared in France and educated in British and American schools before entering Harvard in 1941. He left in 1943 to become an Army pilot in World War II.After his discharge, he earned his medical degree from Columbia University, trained as a surgeon at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan and soon joined a peace missionary group, Moral Re-Armament, for which he went to Zaire in 1960. There, he had a private practice and directed the 1,500-bed Mama Yemo hospital in Kinshasa and the Zairian national health service.“He made a real effort to get public health support into rural Zaire,” Dr. McCormick said.Besides his daughter Glenn of New York City, survivors include his wife, Bettine; two other daughters, Tina Close of Wilson, Wyo., and Jessie Close of Bozeman, Mont.; two sons, Alexander D. Close of Belgrade, Mont., and Tambu Misoki of Sacramento; his twin brother, Edward B. Close Jr. of Littleton, Colo.; and nine grandchildren.Dr. Close left Zaire in 1977 because he was disillusioned by Mr. Mobutu’s corruption and was losing access to him, his daughter Glenn said. He then became a rural doctor in Big Piney championing hands-on care. He wrote four books, including accounts of his life in Africa and Wyoming. He made his last house call a month before he died, she said.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','Few articulate this ethical morass better than Obama, who has repeatedly vowed to “close the revolving door” between business and government and end our “two sets of standards, one for powerful people and one for ordinary folks.” But his tough new restrictions on lobbyists (already compromised by inexplicable exceptions) and porous plan for salary caps on bailed-out bankers are only a down payment on this promise, even if they are strictly enforced.The new president who vowed to change Washington’s culture will have to fight much harder to keep from being co-opted by it instead. There are simply too many major players in the Obama team who are either alumni of the financial bubble’s insiders’ club or of the somnambulant governmental establishment that presided over the catastrophe.This includes , the Treasury secretary. Washington hands repeatedly observe how “lucky” Geithner was to be the first cabinet nominee with an I.R.S. problem, not the second, and therefore get confirmed by Congress while the getting was good. Whether or not this is “lucky” for him, it is hardly lucky for Obama. Geithner should have left ahead of Daschle.Now more than ever, the president must inspire confidence and stave off panic. As Friday’s new unemployment figures showed, the economy kept plummeting while Congress postured. Though Obama is a genius at building public support, he is not Jesus and he can’t do it all alone. On Monday, it’s Geithner who will unveil the thorniest piece of the economic recovery plan to date — phase two of a bank rescue. The public face of this inevitably controversial package is now best known as the guy who escaped the tax reckoning that brought Daschle down.Even before the revelation of his tax delinquency, the new Treasury secretary was a dubious choice to make this pitch. Geithner was present at the creation of the first, ineffectual and opaque bank bailout — TARP, today the most radioactive acronym in American politics. Now the double standard that allowed him to wriggle out of his tax mess is a metaphor for the double standard of the policy he must sell: Most “ordinary Americans” still don’t understand why got billions while nothing was done (and still isn’t being done) to bail out those who lost their homes, jobs and savings.As with Daschle, the political problems caused by Geithner’s tax infraction are secondary to the larger questions raised by his past interaction with the corporations now under his purview. To his , Geithner, like Obama, has devoted his career to public service, not buckraking. But he still has not satisfactorily explained why, as president of the New York Fed, he failed in his oversight of the teetering Wall Street institutions. Nor has he told us why, in his first major move in his new job, he secured a waiver from Obama to hire a lobbyist as his chief of staff. Nor, in his confirmation hearings, did he prove any more credible than the Bush Treasury secretary, the Goldman Sachs alumnus Hank Paulson, in explaining why was allowed to fail while A.I.G. and were spared.Citigroup had one highly visible asset that Lehman did not: , the former Clinton Treasury secretary who sat passively (though lucratively) in its executive suite as Citi gorged on reckless risk. Geithner, as a Rubin protégé from the Clinton years, might have recused himself from rescuing Citi, which so far has devoured $45 billion in bailout money.Key players in the Obama economic team beyond Geithner are also tied to Rubin or Citigroup or both, from , the administration’s top economic adviser, to , the newly named nominee to run the and a Treasury undersecretary in the Clinton administration. Back then, Summers and Gensler joined hands with to ward off regulation of the derivative markets that have since brought the banking system to ruin. We must take it on faith that they have subsequently had judgment transplants.Obama’s brilliant appointees, we keep being told, are irreplaceable. But as de Gaulle said, “The cemeteries of the world are full of indispensable men.” You have to wonder if this team is really a meritocracy or merely a stacked deck. Not only did Rubin himself serve on the Obama economic , but two of the transition’s headhunters were , Rubin’s chief of staff at Treasury and later a Citigroup executive, and James S. Rubin, an investor who is Robert Rubin’s son.A welcome outlier to this club is , the former Federal Reserve chairman chosen to direct Obama’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board. But Bloomberg reported last week that Summers is already freezing Volcker out of many of his deliberations on economic policy. This sounds like the arrogant Summers who was fired as president of Harvard, not the chastened new Summers advertised at the time of his appointment. A team of rivals is not his thing.Americans have had enough of such arrogance, whether in the public or private sectors, whether Democrat or Republican. Voters turned on not just because of her manifest unfitness for office but because her claims of being a regular hockey mom were contradicted by her Evita shopping sprees. ’s sanctification of (himself a tax delinquent) never could be squared with his inability to remember how many houses he owned. A graphic act of entitlement also stripped naked that faux populist .The public’s revulsion isn’t mindless class hatred. As Obama said on Wednesday of his fellow citizens: “We don’t disparage wealth. We don’t begrudge anybody for achieving success.” But we do know that the system has been fixed for too long. The gaping of the past decade — the top 1 percent of America’s earners received more than 20 percent of the total national income — has not been seen since the run-up to .This is why which pits a hard-working young man in against a corrupt nexus of money and privilege, has become America’s movie of the year. As Robert Reich, the former Clinton labor secretary, wrote after Daschle’s fall, Americans “resent people who appear to be living high off a system dominated by insiders with the right connections.”The neo-Hoover Republicans in Congress, who think government can put Americans back to work with corporate tax cuts but without any “spending,” are tone deaf to this rage. Obama is not. It’s a good thing he’s getting out of Washington this week to barnstorm the country about the crisis at hand. Once back home, he’s got to make certain that the insiders in his own White House know who’s the boss.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','Could shame, that long-lost American character trait, be making a comeback? Not likely. So it’s important to make Washington’s plan to rein in executive pay airtight. Loud rebukes against executive excess are amusing, but a $500,000 cap on salary means only that the executives will be paid some other way. And requiring companies to recover compensation only if an executive is found to have lied on financial statements? Good luck with that.“The bite doesn’t match the bark,” said Brian Foley, an independent compensation consultant in White Plains. “Or, put another way, this looks like nip and tuck in a triage situation.”Trying to change the entitlement mind-set that drives executive pay practices is a worthy goal, of course. After all, taxpayers are being asked to redistribute their future wealth by putting billions into banks, all in the hopes of getting the economy to stir.But if even some of that money goes to cushy pay and obnoxious perks, then we are pouring water into a very leaky — and undeserving — bucket.With that in mind, here are some ideas for how to hold taxpayer-supported executives accountable for their actions, both past and future. Some of these approaches could actually generate money for beleaguered taxpayers.Let’s begin with restrictions on severance payouts. According to TARP guidelines put in place last fall, severance is limited to the average compensation received by an executive over the previous five years.At some companies this is no hardship. Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, made $100 million in just salary and bonus from 2003 through 2007, the most recent year for which figures are available. Under TARP, his severance limit on salary and bonus (not counting other compensation, such as stock grants and perquisites) would be $20 million.Mr. Blankfein might find that unbearable, but few others would.Here’s an alternative approach. How about requiring that any severance pay over $1 million be subject to an excise tax of 20 percent? This is the amount levied on golden parachutes, and it could easily be applied to severance at companies tapping the TARP.Furthermore, why not extract a 20 percent tax on all perquisites exceeding $50,000 that are given exclusively to top executives each year? These include such delectables as cars and drivers, country club memberships and personal use of corporate aircraft. If the government won’t bar perks outright, then executives should have to give something back for the freebies.And while we are on the subject of excise taxes, the government should ban the deplorable corporate practice known as the gross-up, in which shareholders pay to cover an executive’s tax bills. Rank-and-file employees at these companies, who have been hit hard by the crisis, don’t get these deals. Why should anyone?A final suggestion: While taxpayer money flows, companies should have to freeze all contributions to executives’ supplemental retirement plans. These are the lovely pots of gold that grow larger every year, even as employee 401(k) plans plummet. Given that these executive safety nets never fray, their beneficiaries can afford a few years when contributions are frozen if TARP money is tapped.IT is also important for the government to provide as many incentives as possible to get taxpayers’ money paid back quickly. So any executive pay restrictions might also state that if TARP funds are returned within a certain period — say, 18 months — the penalties can be avoided or refunded.“Taxpayers need more bang for their buck. We have a right to insist on some accountability,” Mr. Foley said. “If you take a meaningful amount of TARP money, you need to tighten your belt.”That which does not kill you makes you stronger, as the saying goes. If out of this near-death economic experience, shareholders emerge stronger and tougher on directors about me-first executives, more to the good.But in the meantime, it is the government that must be resolute on taxpayers’ behalf. So far, as the Congressional Oversight Panel’s report demonstrates, it has fallen short.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','“Now we have an even playing field,” said Lydia Wickliffe Fenet, an affable 31-year-old who heads special events at Christie’s and says she has cut back on the number of nights she goes out and is choosing less expensive places. “My friends say, ‘Let’s go have a beer instead of a $40 drink.’ ”Brooke Lampley, who is 28 and has been at Christie’s for four years specializing in Impressionism and modern art, said her college classmates who were laid off from their Wall Street jobs now follow more pedestrian pursuits. Most recently some of those friends went to a rodeo.“I shouldn’t say it, but I was jealous of my college friends,” she said. “But not anymore. Their choices helped them establish lives, but not the ones they wanted. I’d rather be doing something I like.”Working in the auction houses has always been a particular New York experience, a sorority of client-advisers and appraisers who spend weekends flying to Palm Beach or the Caribbean hoping to land a big account — and, some of them concede, perhaps a husband — but whose paychecks put them close to the poverty line. Without financial support from their families, many would be unable to have such jobs — and, with them, entree to a rarefied social sphere and up-close contact with incredible works of art.“It’s not that wealth is inherently interesting,” said Ingrid Dudek, a 32-year-old specialist in Asian contemporary art at Christie’s who recently spent a week in St.-Tropez, most of it holed up at a client’s house, appraising millions of dollars worth of objects. “You get to do projects, see collections you never thought you’d ever see. You get a little giddy.”But now even those excursions are becoming rare as collectors have become less willing to sell in a market that might offer them only bargain prices for their artwork.Ms. Lampley said the number of appraisals for upcoming sales among Impressionist collectors had fallen, meaning she was seeing fewer personal collections — previously a big perk of the job. To keep herself occupied, she visits museums during lunch. “I look for ways to keep myself busy,” she said. “I don’t like to be bored.”After a fall in which paintings by the likes of Monet and Warhol went unsold, Christie’s announced a plan to reorganize its operations, cutting, according to news reports, 300 of its 2,100 employees worldwide. Sotheby’s plans to reduce costs by $7 million in 2009, by cutting jobs and capping some salaries.Still even before anyone loses a job, the recession has already faded this gilded world.Christie’s used to host about 400 parties a year, like one last May for several hundred people at the Top of the Rock on the 70th floor of Rockefeller Center, serving mushroom risotto, braised short ribs, chocolate soufflés and wines from Château Latour. Now, the soirees are more likely pint-sized catered affairs with potential buyers invited to collector’s homes to view the artwork up close.Ms. Fenet, who grew up in Louisiana and went to boarding school at the Taft School in Connecticut, said she joined Christie’s client-advisory team in 1999 after reading a profile in a magazine about the glamorous and mysterious life of auction-house women.“Then you see how many degrees they live above your life,” she said of Christie’s wealthy clients. That is especially apparent when she is setting up tables and moving chairs around someone else’s living room. As little as a year ago, hedge fund managers were awash in money, and eager to buy art to signal their entree to New York’s social elite.“People would bid on a $1 million piece of art and someone next to them would bid $20 million, and then $60 million,” Ms. Fenet recalled. “Now fewer people are going to raise their hand at $60 million.”For the moment, the jobs of Ms. Fenet, Ms. Adamski, Ms. Dudek and Ms. Lampley are safe, according to the company, although each of their departments is being asked to cut costs further. That means fewer international trips and an even more watchful eye on entertaining clients — their pared-down lifestyles becoming more so by the month.Now all eyes are trained on the upcoming May sales which, depending on how eager the buyers are, could portend more layoffs. But, again, auction houses have something going in their favor that other recession-battered industries do not. If the economy worsens, some of their clients may be forced to sell whether they want to or not. Perhaps the free cupcakes could soon reappear.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','“That was a moment in our lives we’re pretty proud of,” Fenson said. “It was a time we were playing great and things were going great for us. Being the first American team to medal, it’s quite an honor we hold close to our hearts.”Though Fenson’s rink features all but one 2006 member — John Shuster took some time off after Turin and now skips his own team — the team could not find the same rhythm. In addition to finishing the challenge round 5-4, Fenson said it had not been playing particularly well.While Team Fenson will not be going to Vancouver, a run at the next Olympics is not out of the question. Fenson is the oldest member of his team, and he turns 41 at the end of the month.Scott Baird, the alternate on the Turin team, was almost 55.“We’ve thrown a few things around, a few ideas, and we’re just kind of digesting the whole thing,” Fenton said of 2014. REPRESENTING RUSSIA The Russian pairs skater Yuko Kawaguchi is free to represent her new country at the Vancouver Olympics.Japan’s figure skating federation sent Russian skating officials confirmation this week that it was releasing Kawaguchi, the reigning European silver medalist with partner Alexander Smirnov, the news agencies Itar-Tass and RIA Novosti reported last Wednesday. The Japanese-born Kawaguchi has lived and trained in Russia since 2003, but only became a Russian citizen in December. Because International Olympic Committee rules require athletes to be citizens for three years before representing their new countries at an Olympics, Japan had to sign off on Kawaguchi’s switch.The news is a boost for Russia, which has seen its once dominant pairs program collapse. A Russian or Soviet couple has stood atop the podium at every Olympics dating back to 1964, yet Russia has just one medal — a bronze — to show from the last three world championships.Kawaguchi and Smirnov were fourth at last year’s worlds.DAVIS NEARS TITLE Shani Davis is on the verge of winning yet another speedskating world title. Maybe even two.Davis won the 1,000 meters at last weekend’s World Cup race in Erfurt, Germany, putting him atop the World Cup standings with 690 points. With 90 points more than Canada’s Denny Morrison, Davis needs only to finish fifth or better in the circuit’s final race to clinch his second straight title in the distance, and third in four years.The last 1,000-meter race is the World Cup final, which is March 6-7 in Salt Lake City.Davis is also second in the 1,500-meter standings, trailing Norway’s Haevard Boekko by 35 points with two races to go. The next race is Feb. 14-15 in Heerenveen, Netherlands.MOVING ON SOFTBALL The International Softball Federation opened its first office in Europe on Friday, another step in its efforts to return to the Olympic program.The office is in Lausanne, Switzerland, home of the International Olympic Committee, and is in a complex that houses almost two dozen other international sports federations.Softball and baseball are fighting to be included in the 2016 Olympics after being dropped from the 2012 London Games. While softball officials say their sport was hurt by baseball’s doping scandals and inability to ensure that top players would participate in the Olympics, the United States team’s domination most likely did not help and the federation is hoping to show the game is growing globally.Rugby, squash, golf, roller sports and karate are also vying for the two open spots in the 2016 program. The I.O.C. will decide in October which sports — if any — will be added.GLOVES ARE ON The world champion flyweight Rau’shee Warren will be back in the ring later this month when the United States boxing team travels to Ireland for two dual events.The Americans will face Ireland at the National Boxing Stadium in Dublin on Feb. 27, followed two days later by bouts at the Arch Centre in Athy, Ireland. It is the first senior-level competition to which the United States is sending a full team since the Beijing Olympics.Warren, the first world champion from the United States since 1999, lost a heartbreaking one-point decision in his opening bout in Beijing. He remained amateur in hopes of becoming United States boxing’s first three-time Olympian.Warren will be joined in Ireland by the featherweight Raynell Williams, another member of the United States team in Beijing.Also on the United States roster are Michael Hunter, who failed to qualify for Beijing after winning the super heavyweight division at the Olympic trials; the light flyweight national champion Louie Byrd; and the welterweight national champion Javonate Starks.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','Because all three began showing dogs when they were young, the family is now a fixture at dog shows around the country.“I remember Clint when he was just a little guy,” said Linda Clark, a handler based in Tulsa, Okla., with 30 years in the business. “They were very competitive, even at a young age.”Mollie and T. C. started breeding collies and German shepherds in the 1970s on their ranch near San Antonio, which was also home to horses, cattle, peacocks and guinea hens. Mollie entered the dogs in obedience competitions and packed the children in the car, too, “as a family outing,” she said.Before she knew it, she was driving all three children to obedience and junior showmanship competitions across Texas.“I was amazed when any of them started doing it as their full-time job,” Mollie said. “I guess they had too much fun.”In 1984, Clint handled his first dog at Westminster in the junior showmanship category. He has not missed the show since. Handling was a hobby until college, when he realized he could make more money and have more fun showing dogs than pursuing his childhood dream of becoming a veterinarian. Brian and Colette, who began handling dogs at ages 13 and 12, joined him in the profession a few years later.Professional dog handlers are the exception at most dog shows. The 20,000 dog shows each year in the United States draw about 3.2 million entries, according to the American Kennel Club. But only about 250 people make a full-time living as handlers, said Lisa Peterson, an A.K.C. spokeswoman.Still, top-ranked dogs are nearly always handled by professionals, said David Frei, the Westminster Kennel Club’s communications director. The most active handlers can earn more than $100,000 a year, Frei and others said.The job involves more than jogging a dog around the ring. The Livingston siblings keep the dogs they are showing, or campaigning, at their homes — Clint is based near Denver, Brian and Colette outside Dallas. The dogs must be exercised every morning to keep their muscles toned (sometimes by running them on specially designed treadmills) and they must be regularly shampooed, blow dried, clipped and trimmed. Then there are the shows — Clint, Brian and Colette each said they attend more than 200 events a year.Although they grew up in the eccentric milieu of dog shows, the Livingstons bear little resemblance to the flamboyant characters made famous in spoofs like the film “Best in Show.” All three are plain-spoken and conservatively dressed, and each insists that there is little drama between them.“When they walk into a ring with the dog, their focus is on the dog that they’re showing and how best to present it,” Mollie said. “It’s not a rivalry. It’s just, you go in there with your dog, and you do your best.”That low-key approach works to their advantage, Frei said. Good handlers know how to fade into the background. Sure, each Livingston has a particular style. Clint is more of a showman, Brian has a light touch, and Colette is skilled with large, sometimes difficult dogs.But like umpires or referees, “the guys who are doing the best job are the guys that you don’t remember are there,” Frei said, adding, “They’re not going in with glittery, distracting clothing, or stuff that takes your eye off the dog.”At Westminster, the siblings reserve adjacent areas backstage so that they can look after one another’s dogs. This year, Colette is showing one of Clint’s charges, a Dogue de Bordeaux, because he must show another dog at the same time.Still, there are moments of tension. At a recent competition in Mississippi, Brian had a shot at Best in Show with a Portuguese water dog that the top judge had taken a particular liking to. But, Clint said, one of his Portuguese water dogs beat Brian’s at the breed level, knocking him out of the competition. A Brittany that Clint was showing went on to win Best in Show.“We’re family; we look out for each other,” Clint said. “But we’re also in the same ring a lot of the time, trying to beat each other. It’s a strange relationship in that way.”'"
"'09-02-08,'0','“We will continue to develop missile defenses to counter a growing Iranian capability, provided the technology is proven and it is cost-effective,” Mr. Biden said during the speech.Foreign policy experts said that the Obama administration was most likely averse to making any outright concessions on the antimissile system just days after the Kyrgyz announcement, fearing it could be interpreted as a sign of weakness. Mr. Biden, they said, seemed to be balancing the need to appear firm with the administration’s hopes to reverse the several-year slide in American-Russian relations. Russian cooperation is considered important to American attempts to keep Iran and North Korea from continuing with their nuclear programs.The missile defense plan as it had been envisioned by the Bush administration would place missile interceptors in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic. The Russians balked at the placement so close to their border, saying it was proof that the system was meant to combat their nuclear arsenal, rather than a missile threat from Iran as President Bush had said. Mr. Biden did not say in his speech where he expected the system to be based.In an interview after the speech, Mr. Biden declined to say what changes might be considered. “What I did say in the speech is that we would consult with our European allies as well as consult with the Russians,” he said.A top Obama administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue said that the administration had not yet reached the point of discussing whether it could, or would, move the missile defense sites to other countries.The Russian reaction to Saturday’s speech was quick, and favorable. Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the international affairs committee in the Duma, the lower house of Parliament, said in an interview that he welcomed Mr. Biden’s comments about “a need to listen to partners,” which Mr. Kosachev contrasted with Mr. Bush’s approach “that everything is already predecided, everything is clear and should be done the way the American administration thinks about it.”Mr. Kosachev said the new stance would make it easier to reach agreement on many issues, including the antimissile dispute.Mr. Biden also indicated that the United States would take a nuanced approach toward Iran. He suggested that the administration was willing to be more conciliatory than Mr. Bush had been, but also to continue his tough policies if necessary.“We are willing to talk to Iran,” Mr. Biden said, in a departure from the Bush administration. But the vice president quickly tacked back to a refrain common during the last years of the Bush presidency and spoke of offering Iran’s leader a choice: “Continue down your current course and there will be pressure and isolation; abandon the illicit nuclear program and your support for terrorism, and there will be meaningful incentives.”Iran contends its nuclear program is for generating energy; many Western countries see it as a screen for a nuclear weapons program.It was unclear if Mr. Biden’s refusal to take a clear step back on missile defense Saturday was part of a bargaining strategy in the elaborate chess game being played between the former cold war enemies.In recent weeks, Russia’s leaders have sent mixed messages: offering kind words about Mr. Obama, then suggesting that the United States would need to do more to win Russia’s support — including addressing complaints about American plans to expand NATO and ending plans for the antimissile defense system as it was conceived by Mr. Bush.The Kremlin’s relationship with Washington became increasingly frosty in the last several years as Russia began to try to reclaim some of its old power and chafed at what it saw as Bush administration attempts to stymie its efforts. The relations hit a low point during the brief war last summer between Russia and Georgia, an American ally, over the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, later recognized the independence of the two enclaves.On Saturday, Mr. Biden rejected the notion of a Russian regional sphere of influence and said that Mr. Obama would continue to press NATO to seek “deeper cooperation” with like-minded countries.Although his language was tempered, Mr. Biden said, “We will not agree with Russia on everything.“For example,” he said, “the United States will not recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states. We will not — will not — recognize any nation having a sphere of influence. It will remain our view that sovereign states have the right to make their own decisions and choose their own alliances.”Mr. Biden’s remarks came a day after Mr. Ivanov told the same group that Moscow would not deploy missiles on the Polish border if the United States reviewed its missile defense plan. Just after Mr. Obama won the presidency last year, Mr. Medvedev promised to place short-range missiles on Russia’s western border if Washington proceeded with its planned missile defense system in Eastern Europe.But chances for a clear reconciliation between the United States and Russia at this conference dissipated, foreign policy experts said, after the announcement on the Kyrgyz base. Mr. Obama plans to send as many as 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan over the next two years; shaky overland supply routes through Pakistan would make it difficult for the United States to adjust to the loss of the base.During the interview Saturday, Mr. Biden said that the United States would find an alternative to the air base. “We have other options,” he said, but he did not elaborate.Mr. Biden’s speech was the highlight of the security conference. Most of the dignitaries who were gathered seemed primed to hear how the United States and its new leadership viewed the world. They erupted into applause when Mr. Biden walked onto the stage.It was at this security conference two years ago when the new tension between the United States and Russia leapt to the fore as Vladimir V. Putin, then Russia’s president, lashed out against the United States over its use of force in Iraq.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','THE Saturday Greenmarket at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn is a pleasant little model of civilization, bringing farmers together with local residents, like relatives gathered for a meal. But behind that placid scene, many of the farmers are upset over the firing last month of the market’s longtime manager, Joe Cuniglio. They have rallied around him, protesting to the greenmarket’s executives and calling for Mr. Cuniglio’s reinstatement.“A lot of managers just seem to think they have some cool job and they are there to be our friends and to hang out,” said Kira Kinney, a farmer from New Paltz, N.Y., who has sold her organic produce at many of the city’s greenmarkets. “There aren’t a lot of managers who would necessarily stand up for the farmers’ side.”Mr. Cuniglio, a 58-year-old Brooklyn native, is a crop production specialist who was educated at Cornell and Rutgers universities. His agricultural background, he said, allowed for a kinship that minimized tension between the ruler and the ruled at the Grand Army Plaza market.“When you’re a market manager, they think you’re a regulator,” Mr. Cuniglio said last weekend in a conversation at Brooklyn’s Central Library, on the outskirts of the market. “But I was able to talk to them on a crop level.”Nevertheless, at his yearly evaluation, on Jan. 8, Mr. Cuniglio said he was told by a city Greenmarkets official that it would be his last day on the job. No explanation was given, he added, nor did he ask for one.Mr. Cuniglio said he had often clashed with his superiors over his strict enforcement of the market rules. Farmers must arrive at least a half-hour before the market opens at 8 a.m., for example, and when Mr. Cuniglio confronted those who broke this or other rules, he said, he was sometimes overruled by his bosses. His tendency to speak up, he believes, led to his firing.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','Michael McSweeney, the first deputy and acting city clerk, whose office compiled the list for The New York Times, said it was hard to say precisely how many weddings were performed by each officiant because the spellings of some names are hard to make out on the marriage licenses. “You could imagine that some officiants write better than others,” he said.Asked how many ceremonies he performs in a year, Rabbi Bela Gluck of the Central Rabbinical Congress of the United States and Canada, responded, “I would say approximately 300.” Rabbi Gluck, 56, like the couples he marries, is a member of the Satmar Hasidim, and the brief private ceremonies he performs are done so at the Congress’s offices in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.A minister on the list, the Rev. David Staton, who is affiliated with New Creation Ministry, a nondenominational Christian church in East New York, Brooklyn, said he performs all his weddings — “75 to 80 maybe” a year — at Rikers Island and other city jails.“I’m the main one,” said Mr. Staton, 53, adding that he had just gotten off the telephone with a bride who was to marry a few days later, “and I got one who’s trying to get married. I did one yesterday. I am a busy man.”He said he first went to Rikers Island as an inmate, back when he was abusing drugs. He eventually became a volunteer in a jail ministry program and was ordained six years ago. “I don’t care what religion you are, I do my wedding with Christ,” he said.Rabbi Feller, now in her “early-toward-middle 70s,” also began performing weddings later in life, having been ordained in 2000 after decades of wanting nothing to do with religion because of her experiences in the Holocaust.She arrived at Auschwitz from Hungary, she said, surviving only by convincing the Germans that she was 17 and able to work, though she was not yet 11. The rest of her family died.“I lost my faith in God, definitely,” she said. Now Rabbi Feller thinks that those same experiences help her to understand the lives of the couples she marries. “I meet with couples three or four times to establish a good relationship. I do therapy,” she said. “I don’t do a cookie cutter ceremony.”Though many rabbis refuse to perform interfaith marriages, both Rabbi Feller and Rabbi Burt Aaron Siegel, 69, the leader of the Shul of New York, a congregation in Manhattan, said about 50 percent of their ceremonies involve Jews who marry non-Jews.Rabbi Siegel performs about 130 weddings a year and figures he has married 6,000 couples since coming to New York in 1969, following his ordination in Ohio. He typically meets with couples up to six times. “I get to know them pretty well,” he said. “It’s important to the couple but also important for me.”Mr. Covington, who leads the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, a small congregation in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., offers counseling, but it is not required. He plans ceremonies with couples so, he said, “it is a meaningful celebration of their relationship.”Mr. Staton insists on frank discussions with couples. He said he tells the men “that marriage is not a game.”“They need to stay out of jail or they can’t take care of their family,” he said. And he asks the women, “Are sure you want to marry this guy when he’s in jail?” (He has performed marriages for just seven female inmates.)Justice Harold Silverman, 79, who retired in 2005 from State Supreme Court in the Bronx, said he now officiates at about 30 civil ceremonies a year. But before he left the bench he performed about 80 a year, often in his courtroom or chambers, but also in hospitals and nursing homes. “People who were homeless and came into my courtroom — I married them,” he said.His wife, Beverly, often accompanies him to ceremonies and even cries at some of them, he added. “She gets as big a kick out of it as I do. She’s very romantic.”Mr. McSweeney said improved software helped him compile the list. “I couldn’t tell you who was No. 1 in the 1980s,” he added. “We didn’t have the computer technology to efficiently do the counting.”But there is no question who is No. 1 today — if, that is, you include employees of the clerk’s office. That would be Blanca Martinez of the Manhattan office, whose tally from the decade’s start until last August stood at 67,404 ceremonies.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','Because they are showing only no-fee apartments, where the landlord has offered to pay the broker’s commission, Mr. Lin and Mr. Zhou can collect a percentage of each deal while charging their clients nothing. They also hope to earn advertising revenue generated by Web traffic.“This is one of the best times to be launching this site,” Mr. Lin said. “Renters know this is a renter’s market, and management companies are increasing their incentives all around. So the stars have aligned for this to take off.”Whether RentHop is a workable business remains to be seen. But it represents a fresh tweak on the traditional model of the New York rental market, a system that has been in flux since the Internet began to reshape the industry.Brokers who once enjoyed a stranglehold on listings, pricing details and landlord contacts must now compete with Web sites like StreetEasy.com and Craigslist that empower consumers with much of the same free information. The shake-up has paved the way for entrepreneurs to experiment with new business models that further level the playing field for apartment hunters.Web sites that offer no-fee listings are nothing new, but virtually all of them charge a hefty subscription fee. (Exceptions include the online listings of individual management companies, like Jakobson Properties and the Rockrose Development Corporation. RentHop hopes to provide an aggregate of these listings.) Craigslist also has a section for ostensibly no-fee rentals, but it remains something of a minefield: a study commissioned by the city in 2006 found that nearly a third of those listings did in fact charge a fee to potential tenants.The RentHop creators say they will provide a curated selection of no-fee apartments that filters out any attempts at a bait and switch. Mr. Lin and Mr. Zhou, who hatched the idea for their site last summer over sushi, began by cobbling together about 1,500 listings from cold calls to landlords. Ideally, they said, the site will achieve the breadth of an established Web site and remain at no cost to the consumer.But for now, the site is something of a bare-bones production. There is a clever Google Maps module that allows users to navigate listings using an interactive map, though the interface can be clunky, and many of the listed apartments have few or no photographs.To help expand RentHop’s listings, Mr. Lin and Mr. Zhou recently linked up with Pari Passu Realty, which has its own innovative Internet-enabled business model. Pari Passu takes less than 20 percent of the commission on rental deals and charges agents a flat $99 monthly fee; in the traditional brokerage model, agents split the pot 50/50 with the brokerage house.“One of the harder parts of my job is convincing people that it’s true,” said Larry Link, one of Pari Passu’s two full-time employees, who recruits sales agents for the five-year-old company. Pari Passu makes do by requiring agents to work from home; it also shares office space with a law firm owned by a co-founder, Michael Greenberg. With 90 agents on staff, the principals say they are operating in the black.Mr. Lin and Mr. Zhou caution that they are not yet ready to quit their day jobs. Neither wanted to disclose his employer. “If it becomes superpopular,” Mr. Lin said, “we’d be perfectly willing to show apartments all week long. At that point we would probably need to get some help” from additional agents.Veterans of the business argue that the no-cost model is nearly impossible to pull off.“In order to bring quality, comprehensive neighborhood information — to keep that information updated, verified, to offer end users real customer support — you can’t do that for free,” said Ralph Barocas, co-owner of RDNY.com, which charges $219 for 60 days’ access to thousands of no-fee listings. The 14-year-old company also has a Midtown office for its customers, which is something that RentHop has no immediate plans to provide.And even the best-designed business plan is only as good as its execution. Despite elite diplomas and blue-chip résumés, the RentHop creators admit they have little experience in sales.“It will be fun showing people around and meeting new people,” Mr. Zhou said.Mr. Lin laughed when asked about his abilities as a salesman. “I may be too logical, too nonemotional,” he said. “That’s a skill set that has not been in my past area of expertise.”'"
"'09-02-08,'0','“It is not as painful as our current reality would demand,” said the State Senate’s top Democratic leader, Donald E. Williams Jr. of Brooklyn. “We know the numbers don’t add up completely. Things have changed in the last week-and-a-half.”State Comptroller Nancy Wyman said projected income tax collections in Connecticut have plunged by $665 million in the past month and sales tax revenue estimates are down by $100 million.The co-chairman of the legislature’s Finance Committee, State Representative Cameron Staples, a New Haven Democrat, said Mrs. Rell’s budget proposal “is $1.5 billion out of balance.”“It’s hard to know how to close the remaining gap without some sort of revenue increases,” Mr. Staples said.The federal aid package being debated in the United States Senate is expected to provide Connecticut with an estimated $357 million in new Medicaid financing before June 30. Governor Rell’s administration is counting on more than $900 million in expanded federal Medicaid money over the coming two fiscal years.Connecticut is also expected to receive $718 million or more in federal “fiscal stabilization” money for education and public services in 2010 and 2011. Proposals under discussion in Congress also include at least $584 million for “shovel ready” projects like roads, bridges and mass transit.“I think perhaps the most important part of this package is to provide some funds to the State of Connecticut so it can deal with its huge budget deficit without massive layoffs,” said United States Representative Jim Himes, a Democrat.Mr. Himes, who is serving his first term in the House, said support for the federal aid package within Connecticut crosses party lines. He recalled that, just two hours before the House voted on the plan, Governor Rell, a Republican, telephoned him to ask “who she could call and what she could do” to encourage Congressional approval.Denise W. Merrill, the state’s House majority leader and a Democrat from Mansfield, said the additional federal Medicaid financing would be a “huge help” as lawmakers struggle to patch the gaping holes in the state budget.Martin M. Looney, the state’s Senate majority leader, a Democrat from New Haven, said Connecticut’s deficit problems have grown so sharply in the last few weeks that the federal help won’t go as far as some have hoped.Some Connecticut Republicans are worried the federal plan isn’t putting enough money into areas that will actually boost the state’s economy.“We need to invest more in mass transit in Connecticut,” said John McKinney, the Senate minority leader and a Republican from Fairfield. For many hard-pressed cities and towns, the proposed federal aid package will act as a lifeline, said Ron W. Thomas, a spokesman for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.“This infusion of revenue will help keep some from going under,” Mr. Thomas said.Large cities like New Haven, Hartford and Bridgeport have already been forced to lay off workers. Bridgeport has chopped its work force by about 25 percent because of its recent budget shortfalls, Mr. Thomas said.Officials with the conference of municipalities believe a critical portion of the federal aid plan is financing for local infrastructure improvements. Mr. Thomas said municipal leaders across the state have compiled a list of 568 local projects that could be started in the immediate future.Mayor Dannel P. Malloy of Stamford said his community is hoping to use some of that infrastructure money to start building a new energy generation plant. The proposed $60 million plant is designed to use pellets from wastewater treatment as fuel.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','Many Long Island wine growers say they would be harmed because allowing the state’s 19,000 grocery stores to sell wine would dilute the vineyards’ sales by adding stiff competition from national and international brands.Probably the hardest hit by the expanded consumer outlets, however, would be liquor store owners, industry analysts said.A coalition known as the Last Store on Main Street, representing 2,742 New York wine sellers and liquor store owners, says the move would force more than 1,000 such stores out of business and lead to a loss of more than 4,000 jobs.One of Mr. Roloff’s main worries is that the oversight of wine sales would be less stringent with the increased number of outlets.“I’m a parent,” he said. “For the 25 years I’ve been in business, I’ve been extremely conscious of people who try to buy liquor when they’re not legally entitled to it. So I’m concerned kids might be able to get alcohol more easily. I don’t want those kids on the road.”Thirty-five states allow grocery stores to sell wine. But some liquor store owners — whose three-year licenses cost from about $4,000 in New York City to about $1,500 upstate — say competition from supermarkets would not be fair.Backers of the proposals see the carafe as half full, not half empty, contending that over all the governor’s plan would be good for the wine industry because opening more markets would generate additional sales and create more wine drinkers.“You have to look at the big picture here,” said Joseph M. Gergela III, executive director of the Long Island Farm Bureau. “We’re competing on a world market these days, I don’t care if it’s produce or wines. We need to expand market opportunity. We think this will help people have access to wine who don’t feel comfortable going into a liquor store.”Grocery chains, including King Kullen and Wegmans, have made commitments to carry New York wines, Mr. Gergela added.The introduction of more retail competition is a tough sell to local wine growers, but the state needs money from somewhere, he said. “This is an idea whose time has come,” he said.Charles Massoud, one of the owners of Paumanok Vineyards, in Aquebogue on Long Island, is among those who doubt the claim that the plan would increase the sale of Long Island wines. He said he thinks that people in grocery stores would buy popular and lower-priced labels like Kendall-Jackson, of California, or bulk brands like Australia’s Yellow Tail.“And are more people going to drink more wine just because it’s in a grocery store? I don’t think so,” Mr. Massoud said. “I think the demand is finite.”Whether the governor’s plan becomes law is still up in the air, as the budget must be approved by the State Legislature. Lawmakers could also alter the proposals or drop them entirely before the April 1 budget deadline, a date that is traditionally missed.Paul Dubal is less anxious about the uproar because he says he sells something at his Peekskill Wine & Liquor store in Cortlandt Manor that is not found on supermarket shelves.“I don’t sell wine and liquor,” he said. “I sell myself.”Mr. Dubal said he is behind the counter seven days a week, knows all his customers by their first name and tastes all his offerings to find the best wines at the lowest price.“My customer base is solid,” he said. “They say to me, ‘Paul, don’t worry, we’re not going to a grocery store to buy our wine.’ ”Still, he knows people are strapped for time and attracted to one-stop shopping. This proposal would most likely be a death knell for many small liquor stores, he said, especially those in strip malls with high rents. Which would be too bad, he said.“The backbone of this country is the mom and pop stores,” he said.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','She answered an advertisement for a one-bedroom apartment, with high ceilings and exposed brick, listed by Stephanie L. Davis and Matthew Drennan of Mark David Real Estate. She wouldn’t have responded if she had known it was a fifth-floor walk-up.But the two agents had plenty of apartments to show her. All were one-bedrooms in nondoorman midrise co-op buildings. Ms. Karagosian preferred that to a studio in a doorman building, where “you are obligated to say hi, and sometimes you are not in the mood,” she said.The apartments all seemed to have a small bedroom or a small kitchen. She could barely keep them straight. “Every single apartment in my price range looked the same,” she said.One place on East 80th Street, listed at $439,000, was clean and nicely staged, but had a tiny dorm-style refrigerator. “That’s just weird,” Ms. Karagosian said. A normal refrigerator could have been installed in a closet, but she wasn’t inclined to do renovations. (That apartment sold late last fall for $385,000.)“I was ready to buy,” she said, “but I didn’t want to pay for something I wasn’t in love with.”In May, she was tempted by a one-bedroom on East 30th Street with a communal backyard, for $469,000. It was bigger than most, but she wavered about the layout; the bathroom was near the kitchen.At last she visited a sparkling one-bedroom on East 38th Street, with a new kitchen, many closets, and a lovely bathroom with a claw-foot tub. The sellers were a couple with a baby. “We were waiting for that emotional reaction, and when Kim walked in, it was like ‘wow,’ ” Mr. Drennan said.The apartment, listed at $525,000, was on the ground floor. Monthly maintenance was in the low $900s. Ms. Karagosian’s offer, just below the asking price, was accepted.The board interview loomed. She was told to bring the dog. “They wanted to see how big he is and if he barks a lot,” she said. “The apartment was advertised as dog-friendly, so there shouldn’t be a problem.”There was. With Buttah on her lap, Ms. Karagosian was interviewed by three board members, who expressed concern that the dog would bark whenever someone entered or exited the building. “The dog does bark sometimes,” she said, “but I never had complaints and he never barks excessively.”The board members put Buttah to the test. They rang the apartment’s doorbell to see how he reacted. Sure enough, he barked.“They were O.K. with a baby crying, and a baby cries more than my dog would bark,” Ms. Karagosian said. “I just don’t get it.”She was approved by the board, but with the condition that if complaints were received about Buttah, she would send him for training. If complaints persisted, she was to get rid of him.At the walk-through, the owners left Champagne in the refrigerator. Ms. Karagosian even planned to buy some of their furniture.But she was unwilling to live in fear of every bark. “I was so annoyed by the whole situation,” she said. “I decided it was not the place for me.”Ms. Karagosian decided not to accept the board’s conditions, and recouped her deposit.“We were told a dog was fine,” Ms. Davis said. “The ringing of the doorbell was what got me. Their take on it was that she was on the first floor and they didn’t want the dog yapping every time someone comes in the building. “Our view was: Why wasn’t this brought up months ago? Kim felt so unwelcome.” (The apartment sold about two months later for just over $500,000.)Ms. Karagosian briefly considered continuing to rent, but felt bad that her agents had expended so much effort for nothing.She soon found an apartment in the East 90s, bigger than others that were similar. It was livable but unrenovated, and “I could see the potential in it,” she said. The price was $449,000, with maintenance in the mid $700s. Ms. Karagosian decided she didn’t mind doing renovations after all.This board also wanted to meet the dog. “I was used to it by now,” she said. But this time, one of the board members cradled Buttah in her arms, which, Ms. Karagosian said, “is how it should be.”She paid just under the asking price, and in the fall arrived with Buttah. “I redid my place with painting and decorating, and it makes me feel like I put my own Kim touch on it,” she said. “I found my inner decorating diva, if you will.” Now, she is in the midst of a kitchen and bathroom renovation, and is currently “living in dust, with dropcloths everywhere.”This apartment doesn’t even have a doorbell, just a buzzer to let people in the front door. Buttah doesn’t bark when people walk by, though he does when someone rings the buzzer. “We knew that was going to happen,” Ms. Karagosian said, “but it is just for a couple of seconds.”'"
"'09-02-08,'0','NEW JERSEY’S decision to invest billions of dollars of state pension savings into lightly regulated hedge funds is prompting renewed debate, as the state has begun recording hundreds of millions of dollars in losses from the hedge fund holdings.With Wall Street sputtering over the last few months, the $4.2 billion the state poured into hedge funds since 2006 declined in value to $3.5 billion by the end of the year, according to a detailed analysis of 28 funds in the state’s portfolio.Millions of those losses are gone forever, including more than a third of the $100 million the state invested with a fund called Satellite I in April 2007. The fund’s managers have announced they are closing it, and New Jersey stands to receive back only $62 million of its investment, according to a recent report to the State Investment Council, the volunteer panel that sets state investment strategy.James P. Marketti, a retired state workers’ union leader who serves on the council, said the state locked in about $107 million in losses last month by cashing out of struggling hedge funds like Satellite.Mr. Marketti said the state should have proceeded more cautiously into the hedge fund market, since no one had a clear understanding of the potential risks that are now coming to light.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','Skaters are gliding along outdoors at sites across the metropolitan area, including the Great South Bay on Long Island and Edgemont Park in Montclair, N.J.But whether the water is sufficiently frozen can vary even in the same town. In Linden, N.J., for example, Beno’s Pond in Veterans Memorial Park was open for a week in January, but across town, the pond in Wilson Park has not developed enough ice to allow skating, said Alfred MacDonald, acting director of the Department of Public Property and Community Service.The challenge is finding a spot that is open, safe and supervised, officials say. Some areas that once allowed skating no longer do, including the Nassau County parks, said a spokesman, David Ring. “We have pictures of people skating from years and years ago,” he said. “But it’s been quite a long time since it’s been allowed.”Skating continues in Tarrytown, though. Residents have been skating on the lakes since the 1930s, said Eddie McClain, 52, an employee of the village’s Parks and Recreation Department.“When I was 10, I used to come here and do the same thing,” he said as he sold the green plastic buttons that permit residents and nonresidents to skate there. “They’d open up at 10 a.m., and I’d be here until closing.”The skating areas — cleared-off oval patches ringed by hardened snow that creates makeshift benches — opened on Jan. 23 and will stay open as long as the ice is sufficiently thick, at least six inches, Mr. McClain said.The decision to allow lake skating relies on decidedly preindustrial technology — an ax and a homemade wooden dipstick. The process is simple enough: chop a hole in the ice, drop the stick through and measure the ice’s thickness. At the one-inch mark, the dipstick reads, “run — run”; at three inches, “almost”; at 18 inches, “fantastic.”Skaters have a shack in which to warm up and buy hot drinks; two portable toilets; and an array of donated skates that rent for $3. Two hockey rinks lie on either side of the large central skating area. Nonresidents pay $5 a day and residents pay $10 for the season.Tina Bellino, 44, who has lived in Tarrytown for 21 years, came with Richard Cesca, also 44 and a Tarrytown resident, who was happily carrying two hockey sticks.“It’s my first time on the lake,” Ms. Bellino said. “I’m doing this because he’s the skater. I’d rather be in a warm house.”By 1:30 p.m. on Jan. 25, while sun gleamed off the ice under a clear blue sky, Mr. McClain had already registered 85 skaters that day, and 263 had signed up in two days.Skaters on that first weekend included foreign students from a nearby language school, tiny children shuffling and tumbling, and Philip Vachon, a 48-year-old lighting designer who was gliding with smooth, powerful strokes. Mr. Vachon, a Tarrytown resident born in Montreal, said he learned to skate when he was 3.“People look at you like you’re bizarre when I tell them, ‘I went skating on the pond in my village this weekend,’ ” he said. “This is not a norm in a lot of towns.“I know three-quarters of the people out here. I can see my friends and neighbors who’ve been shuttered in for weeks. This is a real community activity.”Only two parks under county jurisdiction offer pond skating, said Karen Sposato, a spokeswoman for the parks department — Twin Lakes Park in Eastchester and Tibbetts Brook Park in Yonkers. Skaters use the ice unsupervised and may skate only during daylight hours, she said. Because the ice forms naturally on ponds and is not groomed, the surface can be rough, she warned.Some other towns and villages have their own natural skating areas. For example, Mount Kisco residents can enjoy skating on the lighted, supervised pond in Leonard Park, and in Pleasantville residents and nonresidents can use Opperman’s Pond and the pond in Nannahagan Park.In Glastonbury, Conn., a town of 30,000, residents are skating on both the J. B. Williams Pond in the center of town and Eastbury Pond, a smaller, more isolated spot, said Bill Engel, the local recreation supervisor.On weekends, when skating is supervised, J. B. Williams has attracted 20 to 30 skaters a day and Eastbury has had 50 to 70, Mr. Engel said. With no music or skate rentals, the atmosphere, he said, is ""old traditional New England — it’s pretty bare bones.”'"
"'09-02-08,'0','Re “Border Crossings Between Art and Life” by Michael Z. Wise [Feb. 1]:Emily Jacir, an artist of presumably Palestinian birth or descent (in the article she would not say), recently won an award financed by the Guggenheim Foundation. Her entire body of work has been construed by some to be consistently anti-Israel.Many Israeli and Jewish artists have done a lot of work that is critical of Israel and also of Judaism. British authors have written many books critical of England.A great civilization, in my opinion, is distinguished by two traits. First, by the condemnation of brutality in its own society. In other words, how are the weakest members of the society treated? How are women treated? With honor or with physical force? And second, its capacity for self-criticism. Is it punishable by beatings or assassination?When will we see a Palestinian artist critical of Palestinian society? After they have had their state for 2,000 years?'"
"'09-02-08,'0','Viewed through realpolitik’s disinterested prism, the central place that the protection of Israeli interests occupies in American foreign policy priorities seems counterproductive, even a liability. Smaller than New Hampshire, with fewer inhabitants than New Jersey, ringed by mostly hostile neighbors, fighting repeated wars like the latest bloody conflagration in Gaza, entangled in an apparently unsolvable territorial dispute, Israel consumes vast amounts of manpower, expertise, and diplomatic and intelligence resources, if not whole presidential careers, as Patrick Tyler demonstrates in “A World of Trouble,” an authoritative, richly detailed account of American policy in the Middle East. The Israeli-Palestinian imbroglio warps the United States’ relations with the Arab (and wider Muslim) world, Arab leaders faithfully tell every new occupant of the White House. Midwife a meaningful Palestinian state, they claim, and all would be sweetness and light from Rabat to Riyadh.If only the Middle East, as so many American presidents chronicled here seem to believe, were that simple; indeed, the Israeli-Palestinian dispute is a most useful alibi for the region’s creaking dynasties and dictators, diverting domestic attention from their own sclerotic economies and dismal human rights rec­ords. A democratic Palestine, plugged into the global economy, is the last thing they want, for fear their restive populations will demand the same.George Tenet, the former director of central intelligence, also blamed the Jews for many of his troubles, if the extraordinary scene Tyler describes in the book’s prologue is to be believed. He recounts how in 2004 a furious Tenet, dressed in his underwear, drank half a bottle of Scotch, supplied by Prince Bandar bin Sultan at his palace in Saudi Arabia, in a few minutes, while raging at the Bush administration’s duplicity. “They’re setting me up,” he said, but “I am not going to take the hit.” The hit that needed to be taken was for the missing weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, over which the United States had gone to war. The White House, Tyler writes, expected Tenet “to fall on his sword to protect the president.” ­Tenet raged against the “bastards” in the administration and mocked the neoconservatives who supported Israel’s right-wingers as “the Jews.” He then jumped into the swimming pool and did impressions of Yasir Arafat and Omar Suleiman, the chief of Egyptian intelligence. (Tyler’s report is based on the recollections of three witnesses, but Tenet denies making the comments.)“A World of Trouble” covers 10 American presidencies, from Dwight D. Eisenhower’s to George W. Bush’s. An experienced foreign correspondent who has reported from across the Middle East for The New York Times and The Washington Post, Tyler draws on decades’ worth of notebooks, numerous interviews and declassified documents. The Israeli-­Palestinian conflict runs like a thread through the narrative, but Tyler also ranges much wider, to Suez, the Iranian revolution, the Iran-Iraq conflict and both Iraq wars. He writes vividly, allowing the reader access to White House meetings, huddles in the corridors of power, seats at international summits.There are finely drawn pen portraits of the key players. Few of the presidents impress: Jimmy Carter dithers, Ronald Reagan and his advisers are clueless, Bill Clinton is distracted by the Lewinsky scandal. The local leaders seem more serious: Menachem Begin, who equated Arafat with Hitler; Yitzhak Rabin, who made peace with Arafat; and Benjamin Netanyahu, who — along with Hamas suicide bombers — helped destroy any chance of a peace agreement. Here too are crucial Arab figures: the party-loving Prince Bandar, confidant of numerous presidents; the brave but doomed Anwar Sadat; King Hussein of Jordan; and Saddam Hussein, the onetime ally against whom America eventually went to war.It may not be a surprise to learn that the White House — like every government in history — is always riven by factions, duplicitous advisers pushing their own agendas and secret cabals plotting in the washrooms. But it still makes for delicious reading to discover, for instance, the ­power of Mathilde Krim, a fiercely pro-Israel Swiss Calvinist who was a former member of Begin’s right-wing underground, the Irgun. Krim, along with her husband, Arthur, had the ear of Lyndon B. Johnson, apparently more so than did Dean Rusk, his secretary of state, and Robert McNamara, his defense secretary. On Memorial Day in 1967, while Israel and Arab countries were preparing for imminent war, President Johnson was “cavorting” at his Texas ranch with the Krims and other friends.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','There is nothing like the suggestion of a cancer riskto freak out a parent, especially one of the hypereducated, ecoconscious ilk. So you can imagine the reaction when a recent USA Today investigation of air quality around the nation’s schools singled out those in the smugly green hamlet of Berkeley, Calif., as being among the worst in the country. The city’s public high school, as well as a number of day care centers, preschools, elementary and middle schools (including the one my daughter attends), fell in the lowest 10 percent — some in the bottom 1 percent. Industrial pollution in our town had supposedly turned students into living science experiments inhaling a laboratory’s worth of manganese, chromium and nickel each day. This in a city that mandates school cafeterias to serve organic meals. Great, I thought, organic lunch, toxic recess.Since December, when the report came out, the mayor, neighborhood activists and various parent-teacher associations have engaged in a sometimes-acrimonious, acronym-laced battle over its validity: over the culpability of the steel-casting factory on the western edge of town, over union jobs versus children’s health and over what, if anything, ought to be done. With all sides presenting their own experts throwing down the gauntlets of conflicting scientific studies, whom should parents believe? Is there truly a threat here, we asked one another as we dropped off our kids, and if so, how great is it? And how does it compare with the other, seemingly incessant health scares we confront, like panic over lead in synthetic athletic turf or Bisphenol A in dental sealants? Rather than just another wacky episode in the town that brought you tree sitters and the Naked Guy, this latest drama, repeated in various permutations in so many communities, is a crucible for how today’s parents perceive risk, how we try to keep our kids safe — whether it’s possible to keep them safe — in what feels like an increasingly threatening world. It raises the question of what, in our time, “safe” could even mean.Every morning, as part of their daily routine, my husband slathers our daughter with all-natural sun block that claims to ward off skin cancer without causing something worse. Because of suspected harmto children’s reproductive systems, we don’t microwave in plastic or use shampoo containing phthalates. We limit tuna, since elevated mercury levels are linked to learning delays. Better safe than sorry, I say. But safe from what? And, more to the point, safe from which? My own mother forbade me to drink the water in the Minneapolis suburb where I spent my teens: creosote from a closed plant had leached into several of the town’s wells. Although they were shut down, she remained suspicious. Better safe than sorry, she said. Still, during six years of daily showers, my skin would have absorbed plenty of whatever may have been lurking there. Could that be why I scored lower on my SAT’s than I thought I should have? Might the creosote have contributed to my breast-cancer diagnosis at age 35? Or was the culprit the pesticide sprayed each year over my summer camp to combat mosquitoes? (To be fair, we were told to put our pillows under our blankets beforehand.)“There’s no way around the uncertainty,” says Kimberly Thompson, president of Kid Risk, a nonprofit group that studies children’s health. “That means your choices can matter, but it also means you aren’t going to know if they do.” A 2004 report in the journal Pediatrics explained that jittery parents have more to fear from fire, car accidents and drowning than from toxic chemical exposure (with the exception of lead, which still threatens the health of millions of children). To which I say: Well, obviously. But such concrete hazards are beside the point. It’s the dangers parents can’t — and may never — quantify that gobump in the night. That’s why I’ve purged my pantry of microwave popcorn (the bags are coated with a potential carcinogen), but although I’ve lived blocks from a major fault line for more than 12 years, I still haven’t bolted our bookcases to the living room wall.Paul Slovic, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon, calls that skewed response “intuitive toxicology.” When the potential impact of a chemical is catastrophic — cancer or birth defects — we tend to act from the gut, ignoring the actual probability of harm. I wouldn’t expect parents to have the same risk tolerance as experts. Yet, I wonder sometimes if avoiding the vinyl lunch box — I don’t care if it has “Hello Kitty” on the front — is just another blade in a helicopter parent’s propeller, another version of the overzealous monitoring that has produced kids who leave for college without ever having crossed the street by themselves. In this era when children symbolize emotional fulfillment rather than free household labor, we cling to the belief that if we just do everything right — starting with what a woman eats before she’s even pregnant — we can protect them from pain or failure or sadness. We can make them perfect and, in the process, prove ourselves beyond reproach. But of course, that control is illusory: even if it were possible to do everything “right,” it could still come out wrong. What if it wasn’t the creosote or the pesticide that gave me cancer but something even more frightening — plain old bad luck? What is a parent supposed to do about that?As it turned out, further investigation showed that my daughter and her classmates were not soaking up heavy metals with their three R’s. That’s a relief, but how long until something equally scary surfaces? Diesel fumes anyone? Tin-can liners? Chlorinated swimming pools? And how do we know that whatever replaced the bad stuff in baby bottles is safer? You can’t raise your kid in a bubble. Especially one made of plastic.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','The front-to-back symmetry of previous A4s, mimicked by several automakers, was starting to wear out. So Audi has loosened up the look with a slimmer front end, a lower stance and details like a scalloped crease — Audi calls it the “tornado line” — along the lower doors.I spent a week with each of two A4 models, a turbocharged 2-liter 4-cylinder with optional quattro all-wheel-drive, and a 3.2-liter V-6 that had quattro as standard equipment.Like Mazda, which has stretched its 6 sedan, Audi had been stealing jealous peeks at its rivals’ size. The A4 has grown nearly five inches longer, and the wheelbase was stretched 6.5 inches. The back seat is bigger, and the cavernous 16.9-cubic-foot trunk held my family’s weekend luggage with room to spare.Inside, the 4-cylinder test car featured light almond wood with “cardamom beige” seats and trim, which looked as tasty as it sounds. (Black plastic dash trim in the V-6 car, however, had an unexpected low-budget sheen).I happened to be simultaneously testing the Infiniti G37 sedan at the time. And while the 328-horsepower Infiniti chewed up and spat out the Audis in overall performance, the A4’s artistic cabin made the Infiniti’s look like a wad of recycled plastic.The cabin adopts themes from the larger A6 and A8 sedans, including the multimedia control knob on the console. Compared with the more wonky controllers from Acura, BMW, Infiniti and Mercedes, Audi’s remains my user-friendly favorite. And Audi’s iPod controller sets the standard for slick integration of an external music source.In the back, the A4 gains welcome room for knees and hips. Yet Audi pulls the old General Motors trick of placing the rear cushion too low. That creates an illusion of extra space by forcing riders’ knees toward the ceiling.In this fuel-obsessed age, the biggest development is the 4-cylinder engine. With direct fuel injection, it develops 211 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, a gain of 25 percent. Audi claims a 10 percent city mileage gain, with the 2-liter quattro rated 21 m.p.g. in town and 27 on the highway.That front-driver is the only A4 with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Four-cylinder models with quattro offer a choice of a conventional six-speed Tiptronic automatic or a six-speed manual. Moving up, the A4 3.2 quattro gets a 3.2-liter V-6 with 265 horsepower and 243 pound-feet of torque, and it is available only with Tiptronic.The Audi feels typically solid and composed, even in a driving rain. The car is a tad less nose-heavy than before, since more of the engine’s weight is tucked behind the front axle.But as Audi has lengthened and larded successive generations, the A4’s playful spirit has been siphoned away. Like Mets fans, speed mavens must cross their fingers for next year, when an S4 will arrive with a supercharged 333-horsepower V-6.In a nod to performance, the optional Drive Select system lets owners toggle through three settings each for the transmission, suspension and steering. Its active steering can adjust not only the power assistance, but also the steering ratio — how sharply the car turns relative to how far you rotate the steering wheel. As with some other active systems, the only advantage seems to be easier parking at the mall. In comfort mode, the steering feels like an overcooked noodle; in sporty mode, the ride gets crusty. After an hour of fiddling, I left the thing in “auto” and let the rest gather dust.Ultimately, Drive Select doesn’t connect you with the road, so I wouldn’t let it separate $3,000 from my wallet.In its defense, Audi isn’t the only brand overcomplicating something that should be simple.The 4-cylinder engine was the perennial smart choice in smaller Audis and VWs, and this version is the best yet. But here’s the thing: I love this engine in $25,000 Volkswagen GTIs, but not so much in a sedan that goes head-to-head on price with luxury sedans that have two extra cylinders and much more power.Back-to-back drives of the Infiniti and the Audi were revealing. After a run in the rocket-ship G37, the Audi felt boggy and overmatched. Lugging 3,800 pounds of all-wheel-drive sedan, the Audi 4-cylinder posts a decidedly average 6.7-second run to 60 m.p.h.Torque aside, 211 horsepower barely cuts it in family sedans like the Toyota Camry and seems downright skimpy in a $40,000 luxury car. The 3.2 quattro cuts the 0-to-60 sprint to 6.3 seconds, still about a second behind the Infiniti and the BMW 335i.If Audi is determined to compete with the big Deutsche dogs, it has one thing right: the arm-long options list would suit a Porsche. The front-drive A4 starts at just $31,525. But a stripper Audi without all-wheel-drive is like vegan bratwurst minus the mustard. In a car so focused on sybaritic style, skipping the good stuff seems beside the point.My 2.0T quattro test car started at $33,525, but options took the price to a sobering $46,675. Adding adaptive cruise control and rear side air bags would have pushed the fare to $49,000. The 3.2 Quattro, with many more standard features than the 2.0T, starts at $40,825.For the A4, a car that was distinctive and special in the low $30,000 range becomes a trickier proposition as the price soars past $40,000. Buyers had better believe Audi’s pitch about the A4 being in Mercedes’s league, because the prices certainly are.'"
"'09-02-08,'0','Last year, Senator Meyer learned that cabs in Connecticut undergo fewer inspections than taxis in neighboring states, and taxi companies can choose friendly garages to conduct inspections. He helped push for a study of the industry.When the findings were announced in December, two stood out: in a surprise inspection of 43 cabs in August, 41 failed, and six were so unsafe they were towed away for repairs. The report also found that in 2007, Connecticut taxis were involved in accidents four times more frequently than passenger vehicles. The investigators who wrote the report suggested new laws requiring more frequent state inspections, paid for by hundreds of dollars in annual fees for cab companies.Senator Meyer mentioned the study’s findings to Ms. Hughes as she steered her Tortoise, as she calls the Taurus, into traffic. She hadn’t heard much about the state’s report, she said, but she could see the wisdom of more frequent inspections. While waiting for fares at the train station recently, Ms. Hughes said she hopped into a colleague’s car, only to find the air thick with fumes from an exhaust leak.“That never really happens with my cars,” Ms. Hughes said. “I’m just really picky.”No kidding. The Tortoise, which has logged more than 128,000 miles, was spotless outside and in, and the car smelled clean and drove smoothly.Senator Meyer asked how the proposed new fees might affect her business. “It’d be hard on us,” Ms. Hughes said. Connecticut’s taxi industry is already under pressure from the faltering economy, she added, and the number of cabs in the state has climbed steeply through the years, leaving fewer fares for each driver. New Haven had 14 cabs running in the late 1980s, according to WilliamScalzi, owner of Metro Taxi, the city’s dominant service. Now that company runs 142 cabs here alone.Stopped at a light near New Haven’s train station, Ms. Hughes glanced at a trip sheet with enough space to log 15 fares. When she entered the business 10 years ago, she could fill two trip sheets in a day. Now she’s lucky to fill one.Ms. Hughes employs three full-time drivers for the company’s two cabs, and she drives full-time and handles most of the repairs. “Easier stuff,” she said, “like brakes, catalytic converters, front ends.” She takes the cars to an independent mechanic twice annually for inspections, even though the state requires inspections every two years. (New York City cabs are inspected three times annually.)Ms. Hughes pays $1,100 in monthly liability insurance for the cabs, but money has been so tight in recent years that she cannot afford health insurance for herself. Bigger companies, like Yellow Cab and Metro, she said, could more easily absorb the costs of the proposed fee increases, and the additional repair costs that could come from more frequent state inspections.Senator Meyer shifted forward in his seat. “The idea would be that taxis would be free to increase their fares to cover those fees,” he said.Ms. Hughes nodded toward the meter, which was already approaching $10 after only a few minutes. “Yeah, but they’re already pretty high, you know?”Moments later, the car slowed in front of Atticus Bookstore Cafe on Chapel Street. Before leaving, the senator thanked Ms. Hughes for following a more rigorous inspection schedule than many of her counterparts.Over coffee at Atticus, Senator Meyer said he doubted the legislature would adopt the report’s recommendations. The Department of Transportation has its hands full with bigger projects, he said, and Gov. M. Jodi Rell’s hiring freeze would prevent the state from recruiting more taxi inspectors. “I’m worried that it’s going to take something tragic to happen before the state pays more attention to this,” he said.Later that week, Ms. Hughes was completing paperwork in her office in West Haven. A space heater hummed near the cinderblock wall. Photos of her German shepherd, Kaos, adorned her desk.Ms. Hughes said she hoped the state report would not discourage passengers from hailing a cab. “But customers probably won’t think about the accident statistics unless they’re in a vehicle and the driver’s really erratic,” she said. “Then again, you always have the customers who say, ‘Please hurry, I’m in a rush!’ ”Does she oblige? “Nah,” Ms. Hughes said. “I tell them, ‘If you want a faster ride, take the guy behind me.’ ”'"

"'09-02-09,'0','In a move that could force similar changes at other money-losing hedge funds, the well-known fund manager William A. Ackman is cutting his fees and allowing investors to take what is left of their money from one of the funds he manages.Mr. Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital Management, is suffering huge losses on a fund he started nearly two years ago to bet solely on the rise of the stock of the discount retailer Target Corporation.The fund, called Pershing Square IV, is down nearly 90 percent this year, and Mr. Ackman has been feeling pressure from investors who want to take their money out. In an effort to mollify those investors, Mr. Ackman apologized for the losses in a letter sent on Sunday. He personally committed $25 million to the fund to help pay investors.“Bottom line, PSIV has been one of the greatest disappointments of my career to date,” Mr. Ackman said in the letter. “That said, we continue to believe that we will ultimately be successful in our investment in Target.”Those who want to withdraw what is left of their capital from the fund will be paid in March, Mr. Ackman said. About 90 percent of the investors in the Target fund are also investors in Pershing’s other hedge funds, which were down 11 percent to 13 percent at the end of last year.For those investors, Mr. Ackman has agreed to forgo any performance fees on the other funds until he makes up for the current losses in the Target fund, according to the letter. The concessions could spur other hedge fund managers to cut their fees and increase the amount that investors can withdraw. Hedge funds typically charge customers yearly fees of 2 percent of total assets managed plus 20 percent of any profits.Several large hedge funds, including Citadel Investment Group and Farallon Capital Management, have halted investor redemptions in certain funds after having huge losses last year.'"
"'09-02-09,'0','“Or could it be on account of nobody’s got any money,” Minsky snaps back genially. “Did you ever think of that?”Keeping American toes tapping during rough times is certainly an admirable goal. And the cast and creative team of “Minsky’s,” directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw and featuring a perky pastiche score by Charles Strouse and Susan Birkenhead, have brought this long-gestating show to life with skill and spirit. (It has been in development for more than 10 years.)But if I may briefly resort to the lexicon of political rhetoric, “Minsky’s” is a musical comedy that too often seems to be looking back to familiar formulas, dusting off and sprucing up clichés from the showbiz trunk for another repurposing. A show drawing on sights and sounds of eras past can speak to the present and even the future, as the long-running revival of spectacularly proved. But “Minsky’s” seems content to do the old steps in the old style, on the assumption that sentimental escapism presented with gusto and polish can turn the trick one more time.The movie that loosely inspired the show, from 1968, is no celluloid treasure, padded as it is with long atmospheric passages showing people eating pickles and pastrami on the Lower East Side. Its turns on a shred of plot involving a comedy team ( and Norman Wisdom) vying for the love of Britt Ekland, who wanders around looking vague, sweet and beatifically Amish. What the movie has going for it is a keen-eyed, lusty appreciation of the seedy glamour of show-business bottom feeders and the scrapes and scuffles of their lives.That’s a crucial element missing from the stage version. The shortening of the title, traditional when recasting a book or a movie as a musical, is telling in this case. “The Night They Raided Minsky’s” zings. The prosaic “Minsky’s” does not.At one point Minsky complains that Ziegfeld gets away with flesh-flashing on Broadway that would land the burlesque managers in the slammer. But what we see of the Minsky show — shapely chorus girls doing interchangeable dance routines in sparkly costumes — seems little different from the kind of pert, pretty hoofing we’ve seen in and “Crazy for You” and the many period valentines-to-self that Broadway has manufactured in the past couple of decades. (Mr. Nicholaw’s choreography is fetching and competent but rarely inspired.) They call it burlesque, and the sequins are used a little more sparingly, but it feels a lot like plain-vanilla Broadway.Replacing the movie’s scraps of plot with something sturdier, Mr. Martin has borrowed a durable formula from Hollywood romantic comedy in which a seeming mismatch inevitably gives way to true love. In one of the show’s funniest scenes Minsky visits a dime-store to figure out why he’s not happy. In the office next door is a comely neurotic, Mary Sumner (Katharine Leonard), with similar problems and an identical shrink. Minsky and Mary meet cute after their appointments in a bit involving a blind man and a revolving door.As love begins to blossom, however, Minsky discovers that Mary is the daughter of Randolph Sumner ( ), a city councilman on a crusade against the crude and the lewd who hopes to shut Minsky’s down. Through a series of neatly diagrammed comic developments, Sumner is thwarted (and splattered with coconut custard), love triumphs, and the future employment of Minsky’s genial team is secured, at least for now. His cohorts include Beth Leavel as his wisecracking dance director, Maisie; Gerry Vichi as the cigar-chomping comic, Scratch; John Cariani as the goofy bookkeeper, Jason; and a poker-faced Rachel Dratch as the talentless chorine Minsky is forced to employ by his backer.The short and slightly portly Mr. Fitzgerald makes an appealingly offbeat leading man in the tough-talking but soft-hearted vein, an unusual match for Ms. Leonard’s standard ingénue (accessorized with a few decorative neuroses). Ms. Leavel, who appeared as a stage-devouring diva in “Drowsy Chaperone,” proves herself capable of commanding plenty of attention in a less bravura role as the company’s mother hen (a bizarrely glamorous mother hen, in chic deco dresses by Gregg Barnes). Mr. Vichi, with his smashed-knish face, provides a small dose of the lowdown that really does recall the oily lewdness of burlesque.And Ms. Dratch and Mr. Cariani as the matched misfits almost steal the show with a sour-grapes duet, “I Want a Life.” This talentless pair get to deliver some of Ms. Birkenhead’s sharpest lyrics in a plaintive song about the allure of the untheatrical life. “I want a life where pies are dessert,” Mr. Cariani sings in a nasal drone matched by Ms. Dratch’s. “Where flowers are flowers and none of them squirt.”The number’s a charmer, and they do it proud. On the whole the score is bubbly and pleasant, with an accent on brassy energy. Mr. Strouse, best known for his for another Depression-era show, writes pastiche with real knowledge and affection.Fans of traditional musicals will surely warm to the two big numbers led by Ms. Leavel’s Maisie. is an anthem espousing the unpredictable but sustaining rewards of the life of the theater, “where some young girl from Brooklyn/Shows up one rainy day/Gets fitted for a costume/And goes on next matinee.”Earlier she leads a high-energy dance number, “You Gotta Get Up When You’re Down,” which reminds us that “people need something to make their troubles disappear.” Something, of course, might just be a colorful, ingratiating show like the one we’re watching.Those are appealing sentiments to theater lovers. But like much else in “Minsky’s” they have become faded with frequent use by now. They’re practically pieties. For all the vulgar joking and flashing of sequined behinds, you leave “Minsky’s” not with the tingly sensation of having seen something exciting and maybe a little sinful, but with the feeling that you’ve attended a comforting church service.Book by Bob Martin; by Charles Strouse; lyrics by Susan Birkenhead; original book by Evan Hunter; directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw; music director/vocal arrangements, Phil Reno; sets by Anna Louizos; costumes by Gregg Barnes; lighting by Ken Billington; sound by Acme Sound Partners; hair design by Josh Marquette; associate producer, Neel Keller; orchestrations by Doug Besterman; music arrangements by Glen Kelly; technical supervisor, Peter Fulbright; associate choreographer, Lee Wilkins; associate director, Casey Hushion; production stage manager, Karen Moore.

"'09-02-09,'0','And unlike almost every other major paper in the country, the flagship Times newspaper has not significantly reduced the size of its newsroom or the content of its pages; its newsroom staff of almost 1,300 people and budget of well over $200 million are easily the largest in the country.And perhaps more so than other newspapers, The Times has made a long-term bet on the digital future, integrating its print newsroom with the Web, adding blogs like DealBook and City Room, slide shows and videos, even taking on Wikipedia with its Times Topics pages. The bet was that Internet ads would keep growing fast enough to eventually outweigh the erosion of ink-and-paper revenue.But that bet is still up in the air. The company’s digital revenue has leveled off after years of torrid growth — it actually declined slightly in the fourth quarter — and it remains just 12 percent of all revenue. And no one is sure of the trajectory for either print or digital ads once the economy recovers.The drop-off in ad revenue both online and in print has put a squeeze on the company’s cash flow. As a result, the Times Company has been looking to raise money by trying to sell its stake in the Boston Red Sox and arranging a sale-leaseback of its new headquarters building.It slashed its stock dividend by almost three-quarters, and last month, it agreed to borrow $250 million on punishing terms, including an interest rate above 14 percent, from Carlos Slim Helú, a billionaire from Mexico.Newspaper industry analysts say that despite some published alarms to the contrary, the company has positioned itself well to ride out another year of recession, maybe two. The company still operates at a profit, and analysts say it might have gotten by without the Slim loan, but could not afford to take the risk because borrowing could be even harder in six months or a year.“But,” said Edward Atorino, an analyst at Benchmark, a research firm, “I think they’ve put The New York Times out of danger.”And there is a feeling among analysts that there is merit to the last-man-standing strategy.“For most newspapers, we view a flattening-out” of revenue in 2010 or 2011, said Mike Simonton, senior director at Fitch Ratings, “but it’s very murky.”By then, he said, “there could be dramatically fewer newspapers,” leaving those that remain in a stronger position to compete for readers and ads. “And then The New York Times should be a survivor.”Ms. Robinson; Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the company chairman and publisher of The Times; and other executives declined to be interviewed to discuss the company’s track record.One of the company’s two revolving credit accounts will expire in May, with no realistic prospect of renewal, reducing its capacity for short-term borrowing to $400 million. The company already owes $380 million on the two accounts, leaving little room to maneuver. It also has a $99 million payment on longer-term debt due in November, and $250 million in March 2010.Money raised through a sale-leaseback and Mr. Slim’s loan are intended to help make those payments and pay down the revolving credit. But the company has also made a long chain of decisions that depleted its cash. Analysts who follow the company for the capital markets say that some of those moves look right even in hindsight, and others seemed right at the time.Under that sale-leaseback deal, the Times Company would sell the 19 floors it uses in the building but not the six floors it leases to other tenants. The Times Company would still occupy and manage its floors and would have the right to buy back the space at a predetermined price when a 10-year lease expired.“Their decisions probably would have been very different if they had expected this type of revenue environment, but I don’t think anybody did,” said John Puchalla, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service.The company’s clearest and biggest mistake, analysts say, was spending $2.7 billion to buy back its own stock from 1998 to 2004, despite historic high prices. That figure is more than three times the company’s current market capitalization, it outweighs the prices of all the other second-guessed moves combined, and it would be more than enough to ensure the company’s security for years to come.Six years ago, the company paid $65 million for the half of The International Herald Tribune that was owned by the Washington Post Company, taking full ownership of a money-losing paper. The Times Company does not disclose The Herald Tribune’s performance, but executives say that after significant investment, it still loses money.In May 2007, the Times Company raised its quarterly dividend to 23 cents a share from 17.5 cents, though by then, the industry downturn had begun and the first signs of a credit crisis were rippling across the economy. Big investors applauded the move, but “it was a difficult thing for us to swallow,” said Mr. Puchalla, of Moody’s.Last November, the company dropped the dividend to 6 cents. By then, the 2007 increase had cost more than $47 million.The biggest recent expense is the company’s new Midtown Manhattan headquarters, completed in 2007. The Times spent $600 million on the building, although the true net cost of the project is perhaps half that, taking into account the money the company made on the sale of its old building, income from leasing part of the new building and other factors.“It’s tough to say whether the new building was a smart move at the time,” said John Morton, an independent newspaper industry analyst. “They certainly would be in better financial shape if they’d stayed in the old building, but how much better you can’t say. And the decision looked very different then than it does now.”Looking ahead, revenue is expected to keep falling this year, and the company will have to keep cutting costs. Most analysts think it will have positive cash flow in 2009, but not by much.Beyond that, the company’s future rests on questions no one can answer. When will the recession end? When it does, will the decline of print advertising slow to a modest pace? Will Internet ads make a big comeback?Like most publishers, the Times Company is not able to sell all of the potential ad space on its Web sites. It turns much of the remainder over to ad networks, which sell it at a small fraction of the original price.The company does not disclose figures, but industry executives say that online space — which a major newspaper could sell to an advertiser for $10 or more for every thousand readers seeing it — often yields the paper less than $1 when sold through a network.Across the Internet, “we have a glut of unsold inventory every single day,” said Kelly Twohig, the digital activation director at Starcom, which buys media for clients like Kellogg’s and Nintendo. She said that could force major sites like NYTimes.com to cut back the online ad space they offer, to keep prices up.“It’s about understanding, really, the efficacy of ads, and understanding how clutter hurts and lack of clutter helps from a branding perspective,” she said.Still, advertisers say that after the recession, The Times will still be an attractive vehicle for them, if perhaps a lesser one.Kelly Foster, the managing director of print investment at Mindshare, which plans and buys ads for clients like American Express and Kraft, said that marketers were going to be more tactical and probably would not advertise every day in a newspaper as they had in the past.But, she added, “the timeliness of newspapers is always going to be there, and there is credibility to a New York Times.”'"
"'09-02-09,'0','But the news is not expected to change Miami’s decision to rename the stadium, the sports information director Mark Pray told The Miami Herald. Still, because the event is a fund-raiser that depends heavily on Rodriguez’s popularity and charisma, the dedication could turn into an early gauge of how much his image will suffer.A call to Rodriguez’s publicist was not returned, and several messages seeking comment from the Miami athletic department were also not returned Sunday.Rodriguez did not actually attend Miami, but over the years he has become a patron of the baseball program. As a high school standout in baseball and football, he signed a letter of intent in 1993 to play both sports for the Hurricanes. But when the Seattle Mariners selected him with the first overall pick in the amateur draft that year, his signature on a professional contract took precedence.As with most steroid matters these days, the Roger Clemens saga offers a parallel. A month after George J. Mitchell’s report on the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball linked him to steroids in December 2007, Clemens was scheduled to appear at a convention for the Texas High School Baseball Coaches Association. At the time, the organization said that it was happy to give Clemens the benefit of the doubt and that he was still eager to address a group of about 1,000 coaches on his rigorous workout routines. Clemens spoke to the group in January 2008.But the Texas group was not counting on Clemens to help it raise money.Miami’s athletic department, charging its guests $75 each and $1,000 to sponsor a table at Friday’s dinner, has made its goals for Rodriguez’s appearance clear. He will be joined by Miami’s athletic director, Kirby Hocutt, the baseball coach Jim Morris and the 2009 Hurricanes team.Rodriguez’s donation, the largest in the baseball program’s history, went toward upgrading and constructing facilities like a clubhouse, meeting and video rooms, a press box, four V.I.P. luxury suites and a weight room.'"
"'09-02-09,'0','It also is expected to increase financing for a Bush administration program intended to encourage investors to finance such things as and debt.The Treasury Department had intended to unveil the plan on Monday. But on Sunday Mr. Obama’s economic advisers said they would wait another day, to keep the focus on winning Senate approval of an economic stimulus program. Mr. Obama plans to promote the in a televised news conference Monday night.The stakes for the Obama administration’s bank bailout proposal are high, economists say. Regardless of the specifics of the differing economic plans pending in Congress, no spending stimulus is likely to have much long-term effect unless the bank bailout works.“The simple truth is that a self-sustaining expansion in a capitalist economy absolutely requires a functioning banking system,” said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, an advisory firm. There is a general agreement that previous efforts have yet to succeed.When the Bush administration introduced its original $700 billion bank bailout plan last fall, the government was supposed to be the primary buyer of the damaged assets — the securities tied to subprime and other dubious whose value plunged as the intensified. The idea was to pay more than private buyers were willing to spend, but less than the assets might eventually be worth after a recovery.After it turned out that the banks were in even worse shape than thought, the Bush administration decided it was more important to invest directly in the banks.It was also unclear how the assets would be valued, raising political questions about whether the purchase prices would be fair both to the banks and to the taxpayers. But as those assets have remained on the banks’ balance sheets, they have continued to decline in value, producing more multibillion dollar losses.The securities are complex and hard to evaluate, and there is little public information about precisely which assets are owned by each bank. And some prospective purchasers say banks are not making many available for sale, or have refused to accept the prices being offered.The Obama administration, in proposing its plan, will be seeking to spend the remaining half of the original $700 billion in bailout money.By trying to bring in private sector buyers to set prices for the distressed assets, and to take some but not all of the risk that the asset value will continue to decline, Obama officials evidently hope to restore confidence in the banking system. They will also try to avoid the politically perilous course of having the government directly buy the assets at prices that could turn out to be far higher, or lower, than their eventual value.The assets were the product of a market that grew rapidly in the past two decades, in which loans made by banks, and sometimes by others, were packaged into investment securities with varying levels of risk.Because of the hedging of risks, some were presented as safe, even if the underlying loans were risky. When these securitized assets were being created, federal regulators declined to regulate this rapidly expanding shadow financial system. , then the chairman of the , argued that the complex securities were improving the safety of the banking system by transferring its risks to outside investors.It turned out that he was wrong, as became clear when the crisis spread last year.A possible model for the way the new Treasury plan could work arose in a deal last July that had no government involvement. In that case, sold $31 billion in securities for 22 cents on the dollar. The buyer, the Lone Star group of private equity funds, put down only one-quarter of the purchase price and had the right to walk away, forfeiting only the down payment, if it later turned out the securities were worth even less than it had agreed to pay.Thus Lone Star stands to receive the upside profit if the securities prove to be more valuable, but has only a limited downside risk if they do not.In such a deal under the Obama administration’s plan, it would be the government that stood ready to absorb losses if they were too large, while also providing some of the financing for the purchases.Any government-assisted deal would probably need much more public disclosure, some economists say, than was made by Merrill and Lone Star, which did not reveal exactly which securities were involved. Presumably, too, the government would want such packages to be shopped widely to get the best price.“They must disclose fully exactly what the government is buying, or insuring, or providing financing for,” said Simon Johnson, a professor at the and former chief economist of the . “Congress is really hypersensitive to this issue right now. Believing you can get away with the opaque deals we saw in or would be a misconception.”In those deals, in which the government either assisted a takeover or tried to shore up an institution’s balance sheet, the government provided insurance against further losses on portfolios of assets, but did not disclose details of the assets.The securities that Merrill sold last July, known as collateralized debt obligations, are indicative of the type of assets that helped create the current crisis. They are not backed directly by mortgages, but by securities that in turn are backed by mortgages. Thus their eventual value depends, indirectly, on how many loans are repaid. And that in turn, will be affected by how successful the Obama administration is at repairing the financial system and stimulating the economy.When they were created, probably from 2005 to 2007, the Merrill securities were rated AAA, the safest rating there is. The fact Merrill was eventually willing to sell them for less than a quarter of face value indicates how far off those ratings were.If investors previously underestimated the risks of such mortgage-backed securities, they now may be overstating their toxicity — at least in the view of some of the banks that hold them.The banks argue that the few trades of such securities lately have been at unreasonably low prices — ones that would be justified only if foreclosures, and losses on foreclosed mortgages, are far higher than now seem likely.But the banks have shown little interest in demonstrating their confidence in the securities by buying more of them from one another. Instead, banks have sometimes been unwilling to trust other banks that hold such securities.That lack of trust, in turn, has spread to the broader international financial system.If many of those troubled assets can be removed from bank balance sheets, and others seem to have a clear market value, economists hope that banks would feel freer to lend — rather than continuing to hoard capital to protect themselves from further losses. Only then, the experts say, can the banking system get the economy moving again.'"
"'09-02-09,'0','After playing 23 games for the Sharks’ American Hockey League affiliate in Worcester, Mass., Lemieux was called up last month to buttress the fourth line. It is akin to asking Billy Joel to open for Coldplay, but Lemieux is not complaining. Before he became a headlining forward for the Devils and the Colorado Avalanche, Lemieux was a kid from small-town Quebec determined to do whatever it took to play on the big stage.“It’s like being a rookie again, and that feels good,” Lemieux said. “I’m playing now the way I played when I broke into the league.”Lemieux signed a two-way contract in December, meaning he earns less for the time he spends in the minor leagues. But he is just what the Sharks ordered: a double shot of espresso on ice.He gives the team a lift when it is dragging. The day after the All-Star game, the Sharks held a practice before flying to Colorado, where they would meet up with McLellan, who had guided the Western Conference team in Montreal. With McLellan absent and the players coming off a five-day break, there existed the real likelihood that everyone would try to skate by.Lemieux, and Jeremy Roenick, another oldie-but-goodie, who is recovering from a shoulder injury, took control of the practice and made sure it was productive.“They got our mind-set back focused on the job at hand,” defenseman Rob Blake said.Lemieux was working in commercial real estate and running the East Coast Hockey League’s Phoenix Roadrunners when he began considering a comeback. Grateful for the time he was able to spend at home with his two children from his second marriage, 12-year-old Brendan and 11-year-old Claudia, he also regretted that they had few memories of their father as an N.H.L. player.Brendan, a budding hockey forward, was an infant in his father’s arms in 1996 when the Detroit coach, Scotty Bowman, disembarked from a team bus in Denver to lambaste Lemieux after a playoff game. Lemieux, an agitator without peer, earned two suspensions in that playoff series, for punching Slava Kozlov and for checking Kris Draper from behind. Draper fell facefirst into the board and sustained a fractured jaw, a broken nose and a concussion.Everything Brendan knows about his father’s hockey career he learned from watching YouTube videos. That gnawed at Lemieux, and so did the fact that his hockey career felt like a dance he left early. He was gone from the N.H.L. after the 2002-3 season, his retirement hastened by injuries and cemented by the 2004-5 lockout.After the lockout, Lemieux said he had been willing to accept a substantial cut in pay to return to the N.H.L. but was talked out of it by people who told him it would set a bad precedent. “I wish I hadn’t listened to everybody else,” Lemieux said.He has no real regrets, because for five years he was able to play an active role in his children’s lives. “And I needed to do some growing up and learn what life after hockey is going to be like,” he said.Last summer, Lemieux hired a personal trainer, shed 25 pounds and contacted a number of teams, including San Jose, to gauge their interest. It is no surprise the Sharks bit.In the years since Lemieux’s retirement, San Jose has grown into the league’s biggest tease. The Sharks have qualified for the playoffs the last four seasons but have bowed out in the second round for three consecutive years.Lemieux, by contrast, made a career of blooming in springtime. He won the Stanley Cup four times in a career that spanned 20 seasons. Three times he scored more goals in the postseason than during the regular season.The last time Lemieux was promoted from the A.H.L. to the N.H.L., in 1986, he scored 10 goals in 20 playoff games as a rookie to help the Montreal Canadiens win the Stanley Cup. Lemieux won the Conn Smythe trophy, awarded to the most valuable player of the playoffs, in 1995 while leading the Devils to the championship. His other titles came with Colorado in 1996 and again with the Devils in 2000.To glance at his résumé is to marvel at how Lemieux always seemed to be in the right place at the right time. To see him up close is to appreciate how much hard work factored into Lemieux’s success.“He’s opened some eyes of the younger players,” McLellan said.The center on Lemieux’s line Saturday was Tomas Plihal, who was born the same year, 1983, that Lemieux was drafted in the second round by the Canadiens. “He’s playing hard every shift and always finishing his checks,” Plihal said.Blake, 39, said Lemieux’s comeback had given him a new lease on his career, which is in its 19th season. “You find yourself kind of thinking to yourself, maybe he’s right,” Blake said. “Maybe you do hang around as long as you can.”'"
"'09-02-09,'0','What’s the difference between a business event and a party?That may sound like a setup for a joke, but for Corporate America, it is a serious question without a clear answer. Many companies are pulling back on management retreats, junkets for top clients and getaways to reward top producers.And this new austerity is likely to mean new pain for yet another part of the economy: the hotels, resorts, restaurants and event planners that cater to these events, which one trade association has estimated generate $244 million in annual spending and account for 2.4 million jobs.It also means many employees on lower rungs of the corporate ladder are seeing at least a temporary end to what had become a normal perk of business life.“O.K., time out. Something doesn’t feel right,” writes John Stumpf, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, in a full-page ad in Sunday’s New York Times and Washington Post. In a long letter, he blames misleading news articles that create the impression that “every employee recognition event is a junket, a boondoggle, a waste, or that it’s for highly paid executives. Nonsense!”Its annual “recognition events,” Mr. Stumpf added, were paid for by profits, not the government. “Events such as this are the heart of our culture because our product is service, delivered by caring, energized, talented, loyal team members who earn competitive, fair wages and benefits,” his letter states.Wells Fargo, which received $25 billion in federal bailout money, has canceled all its “recognition events” this year, including plans to fly dozens of its top mortgage officers to Las Vegas for a junket at the Wynn Las Vegas and the Encore Las Vegas.Other companies  particularly financial firms that have received federal bailout money  are retreating from anything that might appear overly lavish.“No company wants to look like they are spending money foolishly at a time when people are losing their jobs,” said Jack Riepe, a spokesman for the Association of Corporate Travel Executives, the industry trade group.Just this weekend, the North Carolina bank BB&T, which had received a $3.1 billion bailout, canceled a four-day retreat in March for its Sterling Performance Club, its top salesmen and their families at the luxury Ritz Carlton in Amelia Island, Fla.The trip included free air fare and hotel, foot scrubs and spa services, a sailing regatta and golf and tennis and sightseeing trips. BB&T did not return phone calls about the cancellation, which was confirmed by the hotel and local vendors.“Everyone is concerned about their image,” said James Etkin, president of ME Productions, an event planning company in Miami, who said there are far fewer extravaganzas now. “They don’t want to be in the headlines.”Meeting Professionals International, a trade group, predicted a 12 percent drop in conference attendance this year and a 9 percent decrease in off-site meetings and other corporate events. The association is the widely cited source on the estimated number of jobs supported by such events, and the spending on them.And in a survey released last week, the Association of Corporate Travel Executives said 71 percent of its members planned to spend less on travel this year and would use teleconferences more to replace meetings.The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority issued a statement last week saying that “it is unfair to punish an entire industry that generates billions of dollars in economic stimulus and jobs for the American public.”Vivian A. Deuschl, a spokeswoman for Ritz Carlton, a luxury hotel chain, said these cutbacks “have had a terrible effect on hotels, and luxury hotels have been very vulnerable.” Even companies not accepting bailout money have canceled events, “because it is a perception thing and that is very difficult to overcome,” she added. The Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay, Calif., has received cancellations from 32 groups in the last four months, a loss of $2.3 million in revenue, she said.What is the new test for what’s acceptable? “Anyone investing in a meeting or an event has to have a solid business purpose,” said Bruce M. MacMillan, chief of Meeting Professionals.By that standard, an event organized two years ago by Mr. Etkin for an investment bank would probably be considered out of bounds today.'"

"'09-02-09,'0','ROME — A rehabilitated bishop at the heart of a Vatican uproar for denying the Holocaust ever happened has been dismissed as the head of an Argentine seminary, Argentina newspapers reported in their Monday editions.They said the bishop, Richard Williamson, who has asserted that he does not believe the Nazis used gas chambers, was no longer the head of the La Reja seminary on the outskirts of the Argentina capital.“Monsignor Williamson’s statements do not in any way reflect the position of our congregation,” the newspapers quoted Father Christian Bouchacourt, the head of the Latin American chapter of the Catholic Society St. Pius X, as saying.Pope Benedict XVI provoked widespread anger last month when he rescinded the excommunications of Bishop Williamson and three fellow bishops as part of an effort to heal a 20-year-old schism within the church.Apparently surprised by the vociferous reaction, including unusual public criticism from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the pope’s native country, the Vatican has since said Bishop Williamson must recant his views on the Holocaust.'"

"'09-02-09,'0','“We’ve got to work through the differences, find the best bill we possibly can, and get it in place as quickly as possible to contain what is a very damaging and potentially deflationary spiral,” Mr. Summers said on “Fox News Sunday.”“If there was ever a moment to transcend politics, this is that moment and that’s what I very much hope will take place as this legislation moves forward,” he said.Significant differences exist between the House and Senate versions of the stimulus package, primarily over tens of billions of dollars in aid to states and local governments, provisions and programs for education, health and renewable energy. Even so, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle said that they expected fast action on the bill, perhaps even getting it to President Obama’s desk by week’s end.The bill produced through negotiations in the Senate late Friday night and into Saturday is a $827 billion package of government spending and tax cuts. It cuts some $40 billion in aid to states from the House version of the bill and scales back President Obama’s signature middle-class tax cut. The Senate plan also creates new tax incentives to encourage Americans to buy homes and cars within the next year.Just three Senate Republicans have pledged to support the measure — of , of and Senator of Maine. But their votes are enough to lift Democrats over the -proof number of 60 votes needed to pass the bill.Senator of , who like other Republicans is arguing for more tax cuts and less government spending in the stimulus measure, said that Republicans would try to delay a vote on the Senate version of the bill for a few days, challenging Democratic plans for a Tuesday vote. But he said that he fully expected the measure to pass.“It will pass this week, but we want some time to go through it,” he said, speaking on ’s “Meet the Press. This is almost a trillion dollars. You don’t get do-overs with a trillion dollars.”Democratic Senator of New York said that he expected an even faster pace, remarking on CNN’s that he believes the House of Representatives and Senate will agree to a final economic stimulus bill by the end of the week.“The two bills are quite close,” Senator Schumer said. The House, Senate and the White House, he said, “all agree there has to be some give and take.”The delay of the administration’s bank bailout plans, first indicated by Mr. Summers on ABC’s “This Week,” comes amid continuing criticism of how the first half of the $700 billion , released by the Bush administration, was administered and used. But while the program has been taken to task for failing to lead to significant new lending by that received the funds, the second half of the money also may not require banks to do additional lending, Obama officials have said.A central element of the Obama bailout plan to loosen would be a major expansion of a lending facility begun in November by the , when it was headed by Mr. Geithner. The program, which was initially financed by $200 billion in Fed money and $20 billion in seed capital from the $700 billion bailout fund, lent money to investors to buy securities backed by student, auto and , as well as loans guaranteed by the .On Sunday, Mr. Summers did not directly address a question about whether the banks would be required to lend more if they received additional bailout funds, saying only that the Treasury Secretary will “be proposing a program that will make certain that we are stabilizing this system and increasing credit flows, because that’s got to be the objective.”Mr. Summers also said at least $50 billion of the measure would be directed at preventing foreclosures. But he did not provide details, saying he did not want to step out in front of Mr. Geithner’s announcement.One proposal on assistance involves and , the mortgage finance companies now under government control, to help stabilize the housing markets by providing guarantees on low-rate mortgages. Another proposal, said to be favored by Mr. Summers, would provide incentives to encourage investments in pools of mortgages, as well as in the companies that service mortgages.President Obama last week signed an executive order that will limit at banks receiving a large share of bailout funds. The administration has also pledged additional transparency in how the money will be distributed. The Senate voted to release the second round of TARP funds on Jan. 16.'"

Gov. David Paterson and other politicians are trying to head this off, or reduce the pain. Here’s one suggestion: Ask drivers to start paying tolls on the bridges that cross the Harlem and East Rivers.Just about every commuter pays a fee of some sort — except for drivers who use those bridges. This is manifestly unfair to millions of others who take the bus, subway or railroad in this area to get to work.Charging drivers their fair share was an important part of proposals offered last year by a commission led by Richard Ravitch, who once ran the authority. To put the entire system on a stronger financial footing, and to avoid both drastic fare increases and service cuts, the commission’s plan required contributions from riders, businesses and people who drive cars.Riders would endure a modest increase in the cost of their trips. Businesses, governments and unions in the 12-county area around New York City would do their part with a modest tax per employee. And drivers would start paying new bridge tolls.It is that last part that has politicians in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx up in arms. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, seeking re-election this year, has not rejected the measure, suggesting that it is an option and obviously trying to leave the impression that it does not come from him.

"'09-02-10,'0','It intends to call for the creation of a joint Treasury and Federal Reserve program, at an initial cost of $250 billion to $500 billion, to encourage investors to acquire soured mortgage-related assets from banks.The Fed will use its balance sheet to provide the financing, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation might provide guarantees to investors who participate in the program, which some people might call a “bad bank.”A second component of the plan would broadly expand, to $500 billion to $1 trillion, an existing $200 billion program run by the Federal Reserve to try to unfreeze the market for commercial, student, auto and credit card loans. A third component would involve a review of the capital levels of all banks, including projections of future losses, to determine how much additional capital each bank should receive.The capital injections would come out of the remaining $350 billion in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.A separate $50 billion initiative to enable millions of homeowners facing imminent foreclosure to renegotiate the terms of their mortgages is to be announced next week.Some of President Obama’s advisers had advocated tighter restrictions on aid recipients, arguing that rising joblessness, populist outrage over Wall Street bonuses and expensive perks, and the poor management of last year’s bailouts could feed a potent political reaction if the administration did not demand enough sacrifices from the companies that receive federal money.They also worry that any reaction could make it difficult to win Congressional approval for more bank rescue money, which the administration could need in coming months.For his part, Mr. Geithner will blame corporate executives for much of the economic crisis, according to officials. He will announce rules that require all banks receiving capital from the government to submit plans that describe how they intend to strengthen their lending programs and generally restrict them from using the money to acquire other banks until the government money is repaid.But officials said Mr. Geithner worried that the plan would not work — and could become more expensive for taxpayers — if there were too much government involvement in the affairs of the companies.Mr. Geithner also expressed concern that too many government controls would discourage private investors from participating.A spokeswoman for Mr. Geithner, Stephanie Cutter, had no comment.In an interview on Monday Mr. Axelrod did not deny that there were differences of opinion as the policy was being crafted or that he had taken a harder line on issues such as executive pay restrictions, as other participants to the discussions recalled. But he said he was ultimately satisfied with the final product put forward by Mr. Geithner.“We had a great and productive discussion and as a result we came up with a good set of guidelines and rules,” he said. “I didn’t come away disappointed in any way.”The White House is hoping that its rescue plan will be perceived as a more coherent rescue effort than the Bush administration’s, and one whose breadth and scope are so vast that it begins to restore financial confidence in the battered markets and entices private investors to come off the sidelines.The plan is calibrated to work on multiple fronts, with promises to invest billions of dollars in scores of ailing banks and creation of a new institution to relieve bank balance sheets of their most troubled assets.It will also renew a legislative proposal giving bankruptcy judges greater authority to modify mortgages on more favorable terms to borrowers and over the objections of banks.Officials say that new rules encouraging transparency and limiting lobbying are intended to begin to restore political confidence in a program that has faced withering criticism in Congress, an effort that they view as essential because they expect to return to Congress for more money later this year.But as intended largely by Mr. Geithner, the plan stops short of intruding too significantly into bankers’ affairs even as they come onto the public dole.The $500,000 pay cap for executives at companies receiving assistance, for instance, applies only to very senior executives. Some officials argued for caps that applied to every employee at institutions that received taxpayer money.Abandoning any pretense about limiting the moral hazards at companies that made foolhardy investments, the plan also will not require shareholders of companies receiving significant assistance to lose most or all of their investment. Some officials had suggested that the next bailout phase not protect existing shareholders. (Shareholders at most banks that fail will continue to lose their investment.)Nor will the government announce any plans to replace the management of virtually any of the troubled institutions, despite arguments by some to oust current management at the most troubled banks.Finally, while the administration will urge banks to increase their lending, and possibly provide some incentives, it will not dictate to the banks how they should spend the billions of dollars in new government money.And for all of its boldness, the plan largely repeats the Bush administration’s approach of deferring to many of the same companies and executives who had peddled risky loans and investments at the heart of the crisis and failed to foresee many of the problems plaguing the markets.In internal discussions, Mr. Geithner is said by officials to have raised the lessons of countries that forced banks to make loans and adopted other, more interventionist measures. Those strategies, he said, wound up costing more and undermining their governments’ credibility. He concluded the wiser course would be to provide economic incentives to encourage lending.Some Democrats in Congress who have been given previews of the outline of the plan said it struck the right balance.“They want to make sure the plan is a balance of carrots and sticks, which are needed substantively and politically,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. “They are using every tool in the book because the problem is so vast, but they are also tailoring their response to the individual needs of each institution.”For private institutional investors, the question of whether to invest alongside the government will depend on what kinds of carrots and sticks Treasury officials offer.Managers of hedge funds and private equity funds are closely watching to see how much the government pushes banks to write down the value of troubled mortgages and mortgage-backed securities they want to sell.There is no market value for most of those troubled assets because they are not trading. Investors want to buy them at the lowest price possible, but banks want to avoid selling them at rock-bottom prices and realizing huge losses.The impasse is particularly serious for whole mortgages, which are loans that banks have kept on their own books instead of selling them to Wall Street firms, which bundle them into pools and resell them as mortgage-backed securities.Under current accounting rules, financial institutions have already been required to write down the value of mortgage-backed securities to reflect their current market value. But banks do not have to write down the value of whole mortgages if the borrowers are still current, and many regional banks collectively hold vast numbers of those loans.Under the category of sticks, private investment managers are closely watching how the Treasury rolls out its “uniform stress test” for grading the health of banks. If the government takes a tougher line with more banks, it could force them to sell off more of their loans and take their lumps sooner rather than later.Under the category of carrots are various forms of financing and government guarantees.'"
"'09-02-10,'0','“The priority now has to be restoring trust, demonstrating that the financial system can be supported in ways that are accountable and transparent,” Lawrence H. Summers, the director of President Obama’s National Economic Council, said Sunday on “This Week With George Stephanopoulos.”But the administration has not explained in recent weeks whether the new reporting requirements will demand a detailed accounting down to the last dollar or merely a general narrative description. Nor is it clear how much the administration will open up other key aspects of the bailout, including the government’s secret deliberations over which firms should get TARP money, or how the government negotiates the value of the preferred shares and warrants it acquires from banks in exchange for bailout money.The issue of transparency is all the more pressing given the administration’s decision to use public money as a means to encourage hedge funds and other largely unregulated private investors to play a greater role in the bailout.Despite the efforts of multiple oversight bodies, members of Congress and news organizations, central elements of the execution and impact of the first stage of the bailout still remain all but invisible, even though hundreds of billions of tax dollars have already been invested in more than 350 banks, two major automakers and the nation’s largest insurance company.The lack of transparency has sown confusion and suspicion, with chastened bankers even facing allegations that they are dipping into the public trough to subsidize bonuses and lavish retreats. And with half the TARP money still to be spent, the failure early on to create clear-cut mechanisms for holding banks accountable for how they spend tax dollars is hardening criticism in both parties.Mindful of public opinion, the Obama administration has already taken modest steps toward more transparency — a point the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, is expected to emphasize when he unveils the administration’s strategy to revive the financial system. It made public hundreds of pages detailing bailout agreements with the nation’s largest banks, and it promised to promptly publish any new contracts. It also set new limits on lobbying and executive compensation for firms seeking bailout money.In addition, Mr. Geithner is expected to announce a new Web site devoted to the bailout. The site will identify all recipients of TARP money, and it will include reports on their use of bailout funds and assessments of whether firms are complying with executive compensation limits and other restrictions.Mr. Geithner is also expected to announce that all banks that receive financial assistance must show how every dollar they receive from the government is helping them to preserve or generate new lending compared to what they would be doing without assistance. Among other things, they will have to file monthly reports with the Treasury that describes their lending activity in considerable detail.The level of lingering mistrust was underscored in a report released on Friday by the Congressional Oversight Panel set up by Congress to monitor the bailout.The report concluded that, contrary to statements by Mr. Bush’s Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the government substantially overpaid for its equity stakes in banks. In all, the panel estimated the Bush Treasury Department spent $254 billion to buy assets actually worth only $176 billion, effectively handing firms like Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and the American International Group a $78 billion subsidy.Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard law professor who is the panel’s chairwoman, has warned for months of the practical and political ramifications of a highly complex, poorly explained and mostly opaque bailout apparatus. In an interview, she argued that without significant changes it will be virtually impossible to answer the most fundamental question of accountability: “What are you doing with our money?”She is hardly alone in her fears.A recent report by the Government Accountability Office found that while the Treasury Department had strengthened management of the bailout, it had “made less progress in improving the transparency of the program.”Despite running hundreds of pages in length, the government’s current contracts with TARP recipients contain only two vaguely worded sentences describing what the banks pledge to do for the public in return for tax dollars: They must try to “expand the flow of credit to U.S. consumers and businesses” and they must “work diligently” to help homeowners avoid foreclosures. The documents contain no other requirements for disclosure or use of the federal money.The G.A.O. report warned that unless future agreements allowed the Treasury Department to follow the money, the government might “have difficulty taking action” against firms that squander bailout money. What’s more, it said, the public may never know whether TARP achieved its stated goals of stabilizing the banking system, spurring new lending and providing relief to homeowners on the brink of foreclosure.“We have to be able to know what these banks are doing with the money,” Jeb Hensarling, a Republican representative from Texas who sits on the Congressional Oversight Panel, said in an interview.But the populist impulse to follow the money is not always shared by banking regulators who are primarily concerned with preserving the overall stability and liquidity of the financial system. For them, there is such a thing as too much transparency — especially if it undermines public faith in banks or discourages ailing firms from seeking help.This clash of values emerged at a Congressional hearing in January, when Alan Grayson, a Democratic representative from Florida, asked Donald L. Kohn, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, to identify each institution that had taken advantage of some $1.2 trillion in new emergency lending by the Fed.“I would be very, very hesitant to give the names of individual institutions,” Mr. Kohn said. He added: “I’d be very concerned, Congressman, that if we published the individual names of who’s borrowing from us, no one would borrow from us.”Mr. Kohn’s reluctance is noteworthy because the Obama administration wants the Federal Reserve to play a bigger bailout role by expanding its lending to investors who buy securities backed by student, auto and credit card loans.Some banking executives have argued that because of the fungible nature of money there is no ironclad way to separately account for how banks use their federal bailout checks. But according to senior G.A.O. officials, two of the nation’s eight largest banks are doing precisely that.The two banks — G.A.O. officials declined to identify them — have adopted accounting procedures that will let them track how they are spending TARP money. The other six, though, told the agency they did not intend to separately track bailout money because they view it as no different from any other capital.Among the questions confronting the Obama administration is whether to renegotiate the Bush administration bailout contracts to demand an accounting of all TARP money committed before Mr. Obama took office. It could, alternatively, insist firms account only for future injections of TARP money. But for now, in the absence of a clear requirement forcing a thorough accounting, other efforts are under way that will give at least a partial picture of how the money is being spent.Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general in the Treasury Department responsible for monitoring TARP, is asking every firm that gets TARP money for a “narrative” description of what the firm is doing with it. He is also asking for a letter signed by a senior executive certifying that the information is accurate.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, meanwhile, has begun requiring state-chartered banks outside the Federal Reserve System to “monitor” use of capital injections and financing guarantees from the federal government.'"
"'09-02-10,'0','Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, who campaigned upstate for Congress last year as a stalwart opponent of gun control, vowed after meeting with the parents of a slain Brooklyn high school senior on Monday that she would lead the fight against gun violence as a senator for all of New York.Ms. Gillibrand, the recipient of a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association, did not disavow any of her previous votes, but said she would work to end illegal gun trafficking and to give young people in cities expanded access to after-school programs, job training and other alternatives to joining gangs.It was the latest stop on a fast-paced tour in which Ms. Gillibrand has been listening to her new constituents, explaining her past positions as the representative of a largely conservative district, and in some cases adjusting them noticeably to conform to the state’s Democratic mainstream.Her announcement came after a private meeting at Nazareth Regional High School, in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, with the parents and classmates of Nyasia Pryear-Yard, a 17-year-old who was shot in the face and killed at a club on Jan. 18.“There’s a very big difference between making sure hunters can hunt in upstate New York, because it’s part of our heritage and our history and the Second Amendment to our Constitution, and fighting against gun violence,” Ms. Gillibrand told reporters. “And those are values and views that I’ve always held  that we do need to fight against gun violence. We do need to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.”Jennifer Pryear, the killed girl’s mother, said she knew of Ms. Gillibrand’s background opposing gun control legislation but was hopeful after their conversation. “You have to give a person the opportunity to show their face, first,” she said. “So I’m going to give her the benefit of the doubt to do what she says she’s going to do. You just have to give a person a chance.”Ms. Gillibrand denied that she was changing her stance on guns, saying she had supported House legislation aimed at ending gun violence. And she said her high rating with the National Rifle Association derived from just three House votes, including one supported by Representative Carolyn McCarthy, the Long Island Democrat who was widowed by gun violence and who has raised the idea of challenging Ms. Gillibrand in a primary.But an official involved in Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the group formed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, which includes 17 New York mayors and hundreds nationwide, pointed to a bill that the group had asked Ms. Gillibrand to oppose, but that she later agreed to co-sponsor. That bill, which did not come up for a vote, would have permanently codified the so-called Tiahrt Amendment, preventing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from issuing reports on gun trace data that law-enforcement agencies use in anti-trafficking efforts.Later, at a wide-ranging luncheon with editors of The New York Times, Ms. Gillibrand said she favored the latest economic bailout proposal, and insisted that her support for same-sex marriage, which has been highlighted since her appointment, was not a turnabout, noting that she had expressed her support for a New York gay-marriage bill just before the November election.On immigration, she said she had sent a letter to the Homeland Security secretary, Janet Napolitano, calling for an end to unwarranted home raids and to the deportations of immigrants taken by force from their homes.Asked to describe the process by which Gov. David A. Paterson selected her, Ms. Gillibrand said she had scant contact with the governor before he announced her appointment. She said she was interviewed by him for an hour in mid-December, bumped into him at an inaugural party in Washington, and then in a call the day before the announcement, he asked her to show up in Albany to stand with whoever was chosen. Then, at 2 o’clock the next morning, she got the call from him saying she had been selected.'"

"'09-02-10,'0','2. MORE DEDUCTIONS When you income drops, you’re more likely to qualify for certain tax breaks that phase out if you earn too much money. Tax professionals said that more people are qualifying for the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is aimed at working people and families with low incomes: a married couple filing jointly with two children and an adjusted gross income less than $41,646 in 2008 may be eligible for a maximum tax credit of $4,824. The credit is refundable, which means that even if you do not owe any taxes, you’ll receive the credit in the form of a check from Uncle Sam.If you’re on the hunt for a new job, many of your costs may also be deductible, as long as you itemize your deductions instead of taking the standard deduction. Deductible expenses include résumé paper, printing, travel expenses, long-distance calls and faxes, postage, even meals and lodging expenses. But job expenses are considered a miscellaneous deduction, which means you can only deduct costs that exceed 2 percent of your adjusted gross income. Since other expenses can also be included in the miscellaneous bucket — from tax preparation fees to work uniforms — be sure you’re including them all, said George Jones, a senior tax analyst at CCH.If you need to relocate for a new job, moving expenses are deductible for all taxpayers, as long as your new job is located at least 50 miles farther from your old residence than your old job was.A smaller paycheck will also make it more likely to qualify for the medical deduction: Medical expenses, including health insurance costs, exceeding 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income are deductible, as long you itemize.And more taxpayers are also likely to qualify for the child tax credit, the additional child tax credit, as well as the Saver’s Credit, which allows some I.R.A. and 401(k) plan participants to reduce their tax bill by up to $1,000 — even though they’ve already received a tax benefit by excluding their contribution amount from their gross income. But to qualify, married couples filing jointly need to have adjusted gross income of $53,000 or less, according to CCH.3. REBATE Remember the stimulus checks distributed last year in an attempt to jump-start the economy? If you earned too much to qualify, but your income dropped last year (or you had a child), you may still have a chance to claim it (or more of it). Here’s why: Since the government wanted to get the money into people’s hands quickly, eligibility was based on taxpayers’ 2007 tax returns. But taxpayers have the chance to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit — or a larger portion of it — based on their 2008 income if they didn’t receive the maximum amount.Single taxpayers with incomes of less than $75,000 will get the full $600 credit, though people with incomes up to $87,000 will receive a reduced amount. Married taxpayers filing jointly with income up to $150,000 will qualify for the $1,200 check, though it phases out completely at $174,000, according to Mr. Jones. You can claim the rebate on line 70 of your 1040 tax return.4. DISCHARGED DEBT Normally, if a portion of your mortgage debt is forgiven, the amount erased is considered taxable income. But Congress has temporarily lifted that rule for debts wiped out on your primary home. So if your lender restructured your loan and reduced the amount, or you had debt forgiven as part of a foreclosure, you will not owe taxes on that amount — up to $2 million, or $1 million for married people filing separately — as long as the debt reduction occurred from 2007 to 2012, according to Mr. Jones.There are caveats. This only applies to debt used to purchase, build or improve your home. It does not apply to those who used cash from refinancing their mortgage to pay off credit card debt, for example. And it comes at a cost. When you sell your home, you may end up paying more in capital gains taxes. That’s because participating in this break will reduce the cost basis of your home by the amount of the debt forgiven.If you’ve had other debts discharged, you may be exempt from paying taxes on the forgiven debt if you have declared bankruptcy or are insolvent (your total debts exceed assets), according to the I.R.S.5. I.R.A. AND 401(K) WITHDRAWALS Taxpayers who tapped their I.R.A. (and did not repay it within 60 days) will owe income taxes. Those under age 59 ½ will also owe a 10 percent penalty. There are some cases where the penalty is waived. If, for instance, you used the money to pay for your medical insurance after you lost your job, according to the I.R.S., you would not pay a penalty. Participants in 401(k) plans are subject to similar rules, though withdrawals that are deemed qualifying hardships — like costs tied to foreclosure, eviction and education — are still subject to the penalty if made before age 59 ½. But you can take penalty-free withdrawals if you left your job the year you turned 55 or later.Roth I.R.A.’s can be tapped without penalty, as long as you withdraw your own contributions and not investment earnings.6. NEWLY SELF-EMPLOYED Many people who have lost their jobs are attempting to strike out on their own. Just “be aware you are now self-employed and there are whole series of new rules,” Mr. Steber said. Some of those rules are good — “There are a lot of deductions and benefits,” Mr. Steber said. And some are bad — “You owe self-employment taxes, including Medicare and Social Security, and you are responsible for both parts.” While most workers typically split this 15.3 percent combined tax with their employer, the self-employed must pay the entire amount. It’s also important to keep meticulous records of all expenses.7. CAN’T PAY TAXES If you can’t afford to pay your taxes, you should still file your return on time and pay as much as you can to avoid penalties and interest, the I.R.S. said. But call the I.R.S. to see whether you can get an extension, a payment plan or other relief.8. INVESTMENT LOSSES Most Americans are fortunate enough to still be employed, though their retirement accounts have been decimated. The upside, at least for eternal optimists is that investors can use their investment losses (in taxable accounts only) to offset an equal amount of gains. But if you don’t have any gains, or your losses exceed your gains, losses can be used to offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income (or $1,500 for married individuals filing separately). Remaining losses can be carried over to future years — indefinitely.9. FILE ONLINE If you file your taxes electronically and chose to receive your refund via direct deposit, it could take as few as 10 days to receive the money. Filing on paper could take several weeks.10. GET HELP If you’re entering uncharted territory, you may want to consult with a professional. And make sure your tax preparer knows all the facts pertinent to your changing circumstances. “Not telling them is not going to give you the best answer,” Mr. Steber said.'"
"'09-02-10,'0','Many postmenopausal women take multivitamins in the belief that they help prevent cardiovascular disease or cancer, but a large study has found that they do neither.Previous studies have had mixed results, some suggesting that multivitamin supplements are associated with a reduced risk for some cancers, others finding little or no effect.For the new findings, published in the February issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine, researchers analyzed data from 68,132 women who were enrolled in a clinical trial and 93,676 in an observational study. They followed the women for an average of about eight years to track the health effects of multivitamins.After controlling for age, physical activity, family history of cancer and many other factors, the researchers found that the supplements had no effect on the risk for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, heart attack, stroke, blood clots or mortality.The scientists acknowledge that women who take vitamins also engage in other healthy behaviors, and that there may be unknown variables affecting their results.“Consumers spend money on dietary supplements with the thought that they are going to improve their health, but there’s no evidence for this,” said Marian L. Neuhouser, the lead author and a nutritional epidemiologist with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. “Buying more fruits and vegetables might be a better choice.”'"
"'09-02-10,'0','In some ways, the Hitch’s role was already fading by the time its troubles boiled publicly to the surface. Competition had wooed away some people. New owners, who took over after the last member of the hotel’s founding family died in 2006, did not inspire the same loyalty, lawmakers said. At the start of this year’s session, only about 18 lawmakers out of 90 were still there, down from perhaps 60 to 70 a few years back.Lawmakers said they believed that internal troubles or mismanagement was probably a greater culprit than recession; Wyoming, buoyed by oil and gas production, has the lowest unemployment rate in the nation.But the shock of the Hitch’s stumble was no less raw. That one hotel could become an adjunct to legislative life is in some ways a Western concept. Big states with small-city capitals — and in the past, far fewer lodging choices — tended to foster herd behavior almost by necessity. And congregating became part of the political culture. In Helena, Mont., the Placer Hotel became the Legislature’s default bedroom and watering hole. In Bismarck, N.D., the Patterson partnered up the capital’s political-social dance.Whether good law and public policy resulted is another question, but there is no doubt, lawmakers here said, that coziness has its consequences, for good or ill. Lobbyists living down the hall have access and familiarity day and night, and evening functions at the Hitch bar — some still recalled decades later with rolled-eyes or laughter — took a toll as well.“The upshot is that it’s a tamer Legislature — tamer and more well behaved, but a whole lot less fun,” said Representative Ross Diercks, a Democrat first elected to the State House in 1992.But veterans like Senator John J. Hines, the Senate president, who has slept seasonally at the Hitch for his entire 25-year legislative career — and who said last week that he planned to stay put, at least for now — said he thought something had been lost, too.Democrats and Republicans rubbing shoulders on a daily basis, chatting over breakfast, can break down barriers and allow people to see one another as human beings rather than as political opponents, Mr. Hines said. The Hitch and an older hotel, the Plains, which served a similar function in the early 1900s, were a bridge that does not exist now.“We don’t get to know each other quite as well,” said Mr. Hines, a Republican. “It’s harder to be disagreeable with a friend.”At its core, the relationship between the Hitch and the Legislature was always about smart business, of course, at least from the hotel’s perspective. The Hitch deliberately went after lawmakers with a bidding war in the 1960s and ’70s, taking a loss on rooms for House and Senate members, at one point charging as little as $5 a night, knowing that a broader payoff in receptions and parties would follow from cornering the legislative market.But the business plan had political implications from the start, too. In the mid-1960s, for example, a delegation from northern Wyoming — a part of the state that had long chafed over the political dominance of the southern counties in the Legislature — broke tradition and moved to the Hitch from the Plains. And around the same time, a rising young state representative, Ed Herschler, a Democrat who later served three terms as governor, from 1975 to 1987, staked out the Hitch as new turf and presided there throughout his rise to power.By the end of last week, the hotel was still open, the lights still on. A lawyer for the Hitch, Joseph J. DiPasquale, said the bankruptcy put a stay on payment of debts like the electrical bill, currently in arrears by about $38,000.“The plan is to reorganize the Hitching Post,” Mr. DiPasquale said. “The plan is continue operations.”Some lawmakers even think the hotel could reverse Cheyenne’s legislative diaspora and become the center of social gravity once more, like the old days.“It would take a price war,” Mr. Scott said. “But then, that’s how they got it in the first place.”'"
"'09-02-10,'0','Starting perhaps 12,000 years ago, when people in what is now the Middle East began turning wolves into dogs, humans have domesticated animal species as varied as cows to cats. They initiated or encouraged changes that turned weedy grasses into crop plants like rice and corn. Stone age hunters may even have helped drive some ancient creatures, like wooly mammoths, to extinction.In a report in Friday’s issue of the journal Science, researchers led by Jeff Feder, a biologist at Notre Dame, say the introduction of apples to North America in the 17th century eventually led some fruit flies that had specialized on hawthorn fruit to branch out to apples instead. By the mid-1800s, the scientists say, the two groups of flies had become genetically different. And that, in turn, encouraged modifications of parasitic wasps that feed on the flies.“It’s a nice demonstration of how the initial speciation of one organism opens up an opportunity for another species,” Dr. Feder said in a statement.Human behavior has affected human evolution as well. Cattle-herding peoples developed an ability to digest milk as adults through mutations that provided a definite survival advantage when times were hard.But those were low-tech days. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, humanity’s collective ability to change the world has been powered by fossil fuels and multiplied by machines. Often, the result has been evolutionary change at a fast pace and on a broad scale.Researchers have long known that bacteria evolve to evade antibiotics, and that parasites, like those that cause malaria, adapt to drugs used against the disease. More recently, researchers have reported that cod, overfished for decades off New England and the Canadian Maritime Provinces, have begun reproducing at younger ages and smaller sizes. Other scientists have reported similar changes in species as diverse as bighorn sheep, caribou and ginseng plants.The shift improves the chances of reproducing before being killed. But at least as far as the fish are concerned, the change is harmful in the long run, according to Paul Paquet, an environmental scientist at the University of Calgary. The spawn of younger fish do not seem to be as robust as the spawn of older fish.“It’s forced evolution,” he said. “It is not working to their advantage.”Fishery officials in Maine, eager to preserve the state’s lucrative lobster catch from similar effects, now say fishers must release any lobster not just if it is small, but also if its shell is larger than 5 inches.“This law exists to protect breeders,” the Atwood Lobster Company, one of the state’s major distributors, tells would-be customers on its Web site. “Larger lobsters are capable of reproducing greater and healthier numbers of offspring, and Maine lobster harvesters feel very strongly about protecting this brood stock.”Like other lobster-producing states, Maine also requires fishers who trap egg-bearing females to mark them with a small “V-notch” and throw them back. Anyone who in turn catches one of these notched lobster must also throw it back.But the effects of this kind of regulation can be hard to predict. In Rhode Island, Dr. Cobb said, a notching program began about a decade ago, after an oil spill killed many lobsters. Initially, he said, it was so successful “the sex ratio went all out of whack,” to the point that researchers estimated that 75 percent of the state’s lobsters were female, a situation that can work against reproductive success.“The concern is for sperm limitation,” he said, adding that a similar problem had been seen with blue crabs. The end result was more lobster eggs but not more baby lobsters in state waters.In many areas of the West, conservationists hope to maintain genetic diversity in deer, bears and other species by building tunnels and overpasses to allow them access to their full range, even if it is now divided by highways. But often the animals have already adapted to their newly humanized habitats. Deer thrive on suburban shrubs. Black bears in Nevada dine so well at garbage cans and dumpsters that they have more and healthier cubs than their country cousins.In another report in Science last week, researchers from Stanford and elsewhere reported that wolves and coyotes with dark coats may have originally gained a gene for darkness by mating with their humanized kin, dogs. Conservation purists often cringe at the mixing of wild and domesticated animals, but as the wolves and coyotes confront shrinking wild habitat, the researchers said, the introduction of genes from domesticated animals may turn out to help them.As climate warms, plants in the Rocky Mountains are moving to higher elevations, where it is cooler. In some areas of New England, researchers report that trees, shrubs and flowers are in bloom a week or two earlier than they were even a century ago. And the cast of characters seems to be changing in the tide pools of Monterey Bay, where plants and animals adapted to warmer water seem to be moving in.Sometimes, researchers report, invasive species can add to the biological richness of a given habitat. But that kind of change can be a problem for conservation organizations that buy land seeking to preserve a particular ecosystem, only to find that it is shifting out from under them.In addition, when plants, birds and insects have evolved en suite to sync their hatching, blooming or migrating patterns, individual changes can leave nestlings hatching too late to dine on their favored swarming insects, or flowers blooming ahead of the arrival of the birds they need to pollinate them.People have also brought technology to bear on themselves. But so far at least, “the accomplishments have been minimal,” said Francisco Alaya, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Irvine. He cited treatments for diseases like Type I diabetes that allow people who might otherwise have died in childhood to grow up and pass their health defects on to their descendants.He predicts it will be a long time before geneticists are able to manipulate genes to improve the human species, especially because the genetic influence on desirable traits, like high intelligence or ethical behavior, is so complex and so meshed with environmental factors. Even the traits themselves, he said, are hard to define.Anyway, he said, “if we start to change genes, how many people are we going to manipulate? A hundred? A thousand? A million? Still it will be a very little fraction.”Dr. Ayala said he found it far more interesting to contemplate the way humans have improved their scope as a species by cultural evolution.“We are still biologically adapted to tropical climates,” he said. “Yet we have populated the continents of the earth without changing our physiology. We just use clothing and housing and heating and air conditioning. We travel the oceans without scale, and we fly without having evolved wings.”'"
"'09-02-10,'0','A small survey of young black men from the South who tested positive for H.I.V. in their teens and early 20s found that most had engaged in risky sexual behaviors but thought it unlikely they would be infected, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.More than half of the 29 gay or bisexual men surveyed said they had engaged in unprotected anal sex in the year before they were infected and had had sex with slightly older men, the survey found. Both are risky behaviors, yet the vast majority of the young men said they had not thought that they would ever be infected.Young black gay and bisexual men are becoming infected with H.I.V. at alarming rates, particularly in the South, and health officials are trying to analyze their risk factors in order to refine education and intervention strategies.“We need to make sure that H.I.V. infection does not become a rite of passage for young black men who have sex with men,” said Dr. Alexandra Oster, one of the authors of the survey published last week in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.After the Mississippi State Department of Health notified the C.D.C. in late 2007 that the number of new H.I.V. diagnoses had spiked at a sexually transmitted disease clinic serving Jackson, Miss., , the agencies teamed up to do the survey. The number of newly diagnosed H.I.V. cases among all black men in the Jackson area had increased 20 percent between 2004-2005 and 2006-2007, but infections among those ages 17 to 25 had jumped 45 percent.'"
"'09-02-10,'0','“This is an opportunity to improve our profitability by wisely using some extra capacity in our system,” Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, said on Monday. “DreamWorks has a great creative and commercial track record.”Stacey Snider, the chief executive of DreamWorks, said on Monday, referring to Disney, “We’re not just in the place we need to be, we’re in the best place we could be.”The extra capacity Mr. Iger mentioned involves Touchstone, which was founded in 1984 as a way for Disney to expand beyond the family market and make movies for adults. Touchstone released the company’s first R-rated picture, “Down and Out in Beverly Hills,” and scored several megahits, including “Pretty Woman.”But in 2006, Disney significantly scaled back its investment in Touchstone as moviemaking costs soared industrywide, deciding instead to focus on family pictures stamped with the Walt Disney logo. As a result, Touchstone has released two to three pictures a year, compared with six or seven in earlier years.In 2008, Touchstone released “Miracle at St. Anna” and “Swing Vote,” both box office disasters with combined worldwide sales of $36.6 million and combined production budgets of $66 million, excluding marketing. While Disney’s bets on the movies did not pay off, they did not hurt the studio much either, because Spike Lee and Kevin Costner, respectively, shouldered part of the production costs. DreamWorks had a hot streak at the box office when it was owned by Paramount, with hits that included “Norbit” and “Tropic Thunder.” But several recent films, including “Revolutionary Road,” “The Ruins,” “Ghost Town” and “The Uninvited” have underperformed, posing a challenge.Ms. Snider said the DreamWorks slate stood a reasonable chance of turning a profit for all involved. “When you’ve got that kind of volume, you’re looking at actuarial results, not picture-by-picture performance,” she said.Touchstone will not release a DreamWorks film until late next year. No titles have been announced, but the pictures Mr. Spielberg and Ms. Snider are working on most aggressively include a comedy starring Steve Carell called “Dinner With Schmucks” and “Motorcade,” a Secret Service drama. DreamWorks is also developing a series of movies around “The 39 Clues” series of children’s fantasy adventure books.The agreement between Disney and DreamWorks was reached after a planned distribution deal between DreamWorks and Universal Pictures fell apart last week. Underscoring the squishy nature of Hollywood dealmaking, a partnership between DreamWorks and Universal was formally announced in October. “This agreement starts a new chapter,” said Mr. Spielberg at the time. But no paperwork was ever signed, say the people with knowledge of the Disney deal.The economic slowdown has made it difficult for DreamWorks to raise the necessary money for film production to supplement its $500 million or so in backing from Reliance Big Entertainment of India. In recent weeks, talks between Universal and DreamWorks grew increasingly bitter, with DreamWorks asking Universal to change its original terms and Universal asking Mr. Spielberg to change the terms of a long-standing consultant contract he holds with the Universal theme parks.Universal executives then became furious that Mr. Spielberg’s representatives approached Disney without alerting them. In a cranky public statement on Friday, Universal said it was walking away from DreamWorks.'"
"'09-02-10,'0','The indulgence is among the less noticed and less disputed traditions to be restored. But with a thousand-year history and volumes of church law devoted to its intricacies, it is one of the most complicated to explain.According to church teaching, even after sinners are absolved in the confessional and say their Our Fathers or Hail Marys as penance, they still face punishment after death, in Purgatory, before they can enter heaven. In exchange for certain prayers, devotions or pilgrimages in special years, a Catholic can receive an indulgence, which reduces or erases that punishment instantly, with no formal ceremony or sacrament.There are partial indulgences, which reduce purgatorial time by a certain number of days or years, and plenary indulgences, which eliminate all of it, until another sin is committed. You can get one for yourself, or for someone who is dead. You cannot buy one — the church outlawed the sale of indulgences in 1567 — but charitable contributions, combined with other acts, can help you earn one. There is a limit of one plenary indulgence per sinner per day.It has no currency in the bad place.“It’s what?” asked Marta de Alvarado, 34, when told that indulgences were available this year at several churches in . “I just don’t know anything about it,” she said, leaving St. Patrick’s Cathedral at lunchtime. “I’m going to look into it, though.”The return of indulgences began with , who authorized bishops to offer them in 2000 as part of the celebration of the church’s third millennium. But the offers have increased markedly under his successor, Pope Benedict, who has made plenary indulgences part of church anniversary celebrations nine times in the last three years. The current offer is tied to the yearlong celebration of St. Paul, which continues through June.Dioceses in the have responded with varying degrees of enthusiasm. This year’s offer has been energetically promoted in places like , , , Ore., and Tulsa, Okla. It appeared prominently on the Web site of the Diocese of Brooklyn, which announced that any Catholic could receive an indulgence at any of six churches on any day, or at dozens more on specific days, by fulfilling the basic requirements: going to confession, receiving holy communion, saying a prayer for the pope and achieving “complete detachment from any inclination to sin.”But in the adjacent Archdiocese of New York, indulgences are available at only one church, and the archdiocesan Web site makes no mention of them. (Cardinal “encourages all people to receive the blessings of indulgences,” said his spokesman, Joseph Zwilling, who said he was unaware that the offer was not on the Web site, but would soon have it posted.)The indulgences, experts said, tend to be advertised more openly in dioceses where the bishop is more traditionalist, or in places with fewer tensions between liberal and conservative Catholics.“In our diocese, folks are just glad for any opportunity to do something Catholic,” said Mary Woodward, director of evangelization for the Diocese of Jackson, Miss., where only 3 percent of the population is Catholic.Even some priests admit that the rules are hard to grasp.“It’s not that easy to explain to people who have never heard of it,” said the Rev. Gilbert Martinez, pastor of St. Paul the Apostle Church in , the designated site in the New York Archdiocese for obtaining indulgences. “But it was interesting: I had a number of people come in and say, ‘Father, I haven’t been to confession in 20 years, but this’ ” — the availability of an indulgence — “ ‘made me think maybe it wasn’t too late.’ ”Getting Catholics back into confession, in fact, was one of the motivations for reintroducing the indulgence. In a 2001 speech, Pope John Paul described the newly reborn tradition as “a happy incentive” for confession.“Confessions have been down for years and the church is very worried about it,” said the Rev. Tom Reese, a Jesuit and former editor of the Catholic magazine America. In a secularized culture of pop and self-help, he said, “the church wants the idea of personal sin back in the equation. Indulgences are a way of reminding people of the importance of penance.”“The good news is we’re not selling them anymore,” he added.To remain in good standing, Catholics are required to confess their sins at least once a year. But in a survey last year by a research group at , three-quarters of Catholics said they went to confession less often or not at all.Under the rules in the “Manual of Indulgences,” published by the Vatican, confession is a prerequisite for getting an indulgence.Among liberal Catholic theologians, the return of the indulgence seems to be more of a curiosity than a cause for alarm. “Personally, I think we’re beyond the time when indulgences mean very much,” said the Rev. Richard P. McBrien, a professor of theology at Notre Dame who supports the ordination of women and the right of priests to marry. “It’s like trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube of original thought. Most Catholics in this country, if you tell them they can get a plenary indulgence, will shrug their shoulders.”One recent afternoon outside Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Church in Forest Hills, , two church volunteers disagreed on the relevance of indulgences for modern Catholics.Octavia Andrade, 64, laughed as she recalled a time when children would race through the rosary repeatedly to get as many indulgences as they could — usually in increments of 5 or 10 years — “as if we needed them, then.”Still, she supports their reintroduction. “Anything old coming back, I’m in favor of it,” she said. “More fervor is a good thing.”Karen Nassauer, 61, said she was baffled by the return to a practice she never quite understood to begin with.“I mean, I’m not saying it is necessarily wrong,” she said. “What does it mean to get time off in Purgatory? What is five years in terms of eternity?”The latest offers de-emphasize the years-in-Purgatory formulations of old in favor of a less specific accounting, with more focus on ways in which people can help themselves — and one another — come to terms with sin.“It’s more about praying for the benefit of others, doing good deeds, acts of charity,” said the Rev. Kieran Harrington, spokesman for the Brooklyn diocese.After Catholics, the people most expert on the topic are probably Lutherans, whose church was born from the schism over indulgences and whose leaders have met regularly with Vatican officials since the 1960s in an effort to mend their differences.“It has been something of a mystery to us as to why now,” said the Rev. Dr. Michael Root, dean of the Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary in Columbia, S.C., who has participated in those meetings. The renewal of indulgences, he said, has “not advanced” the dialogue.“Our main problem has always been the question of quantifying God’s blessing,” Dr. Root said. Lutherans believe that divine forgiveness is a given, but not something people can influence.But for Catholic leaders, most prominently the pope, the focus in recent years has been less on what Catholics have in common with other religious groups than on what sets them apart — including the half-forgotten mystery of the indulgence.“It faded away with a lot of things in the church,” said Bishop DiMarzio. “But it was never given up. It was always there. We just want to people to return to the ideas they used to know.”'"

Toyota Motor, the world’s largest car manufacturer, on Friday forecast a net loss of 350 billion yen, or $3.8 billion, for the year, its first since 1950.Honda and Nintendo are among the few companies to still expect a full-year profit, but both sharply downgraded their expectations for the full year.'"

After seven years of follow-up, more than 7 percent had symptoms of depression.But while about 6 percent of those who watched less than three hours a day were depressed, more than 17 percent of those who watched more than nine hours a day had depressive symptoms.The association was stronger in boys than in girls, and it held after adjusting for age, race, socioeconomic status and educational level.“We really don’t know what it was specifically about TV exposure that was associated with depression, whether it was a particular kind of programming or some contextual factor such as watching alone or with other people,” said Dr. Brian Primack, the lead author and an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.'"

"'09-02-10,'0','Starting perhaps 12,000 years ago, when people in what is now the Middle East began turning wolves into dogs, humans have domesticated animal species as varied as cows to cats. They initiated or encouraged changes that turned weedy grasses into crop plants like rice and corn. Stone age hunters may even have helped drive some ancient creatures, like wooly mammoths, to extinction.In a report in Friday’s issue of the journal Science, researchers led by Jeff Feder, a biologist at Notre Dame, say the introduction of apples to North America in the 17th century eventually led some fruit flies that had specialized on hawthorn fruit to branch out to apples instead. By the mid-1800s, the scientists say, the two groups of flies had become genetically different. And that, in turn, encouraged modifications of parasitic wasps that feed on the flies.“It’s a nice demonstration of how the initial speciation of one organism opens up an opportunity for another species,” Dr. Feder said in a statement.Human behavior has affected human evolution as well. Cattle-herding peoples developed an ability to digest milk as adults through mutations that provided a definite survival advantage when times were hard.But those were low-tech days. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, humanity’s collective ability to change the world has been powered by fossil fuels and multiplied by machines. Often, the result has been evolutionary change at a fast pace and on a broad scale.Researchers have long known that bacteria evolve to evade antibiotics, and that parasites, like those that cause malaria, adapt to drugs used against the disease. More recently, researchers have reported that cod, overfished for decades off New England and the Canadian Maritime Provinces, have begun reproducing at younger ages and smaller sizes. Other scientists have reported similar changes in species as diverse as bighorn sheep, caribou and ginseng plants.The shift improves the chances of reproducing before being killed. But at least as far as the fish are concerned, the change is harmful in the long run, according to Paul Paquet, an environmental scientist at the University of Calgary. The spawn of younger fish do not seem to be as robust as the spawn of older fish.“It’s forced evolution,” he said. “It is not working to their advantage.”Fishery officials in Maine, eager to preserve the state’s lucrative lobster catch from similar effects, now say fishers must release any lobster not just if it is small, but also if its shell is larger than 5 inches.“This law exists to protect breeders,” the Atwood Lobster Company, one of the state’s major distributors, tells would-be customers on its Web site. “Larger lobsters are capable of reproducing greater and healthier numbers of offspring, and Maine lobster harvesters feel very strongly about protecting this brood stock.”Like other lobster-producing states, Maine also requires fishers who trap egg-bearing females to mark them with a small “V-notch” and throw them back. Anyone who in turn catches one of these notched lobster must also throw it back.But the effects of this kind of regulation can be hard to predict. In Rhode Island, Dr. Cobb said, a notching program began about a decade ago, after an oil spill killed many lobsters. Initially, he said, it was so successful “the sex ratio went all out of whack,” to the point that researchers estimated that 75 percent of the state’s lobsters were female, a situation that can work against reproductive success.“The concern is for sperm limitation,” he said, adding that a similar problem had been seen with blue crabs. The end result was more lobster eggs but not more baby lobsters in state waters.In many areas of the West, conservationists hope to maintain genetic diversity in deer, bears and other species by building tunnels and overpasses to allow them access to their full range, even if it is now divided by highways. But often the animals have already adapted to their newly humanized habitats. Deer thrive on suburban shrubs. Black bears in Nevada dine so well at garbage cans and dumpsters that they have more and healthier cubs than their country cousins.In another report in Science last week, researchers from Stanford and elsewhere reported that wolves and coyotes with dark coats may have originally gained a gene for darkness by mating with their humanized kin, dogs. Conservation purists often cringe at the mixing of wild and domesticated animals, but as the wolves and coyotes confront shrinking wild habitat, the researchers said, the introduction of genes from domesticated animals may turn out to help them.As climate warms, plants in the Rocky Mountains are moving to higher elevations, where it is cooler. In some areas of New England, researchers report that trees, shrubs and flowers are in bloom a week or two earlier than they were even a century ago. And the cast of characters seems to be changing in the tide pools of Monterey Bay, where plants and animals adapted to warmer water seem to be moving in.Sometimes, researchers report, invasive species can add to the biological richness of a given habitat. But that kind of change can be a problem for conservation organizations that buy land seeking to preserve a particular ecosystem, only to find that it is shifting out from under them.In addition, when plants, birds and insects have evolved en suite to sync their hatching, blooming or migrating patterns, individual changes can leave nestlings hatching too late to dine on their favored swarming insects, or flowers blooming ahead of the arrival of the birds they need to pollinate them.People have also brought technology to bear on themselves. But so far at least, “the accomplishments have been minimal,” said Francisco Alaya, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Irvine. He cited treatments for diseases like Type I diabetes that allow people who might otherwise have died in childhood to grow up and pass their health defects on to their descendants.He predicts it will be a long time before geneticists are able to manipulate genes to improve the human species, especially because the genetic influence on desirable traits, like high intelligence or ethical behavior, is so complex and so meshed with environmental factors. Even the traits themselves, he said, are hard to define.Anyway, he said, “if we start to change genes, how many people are we going to manipulate? A hundred? A thousand? A million? Still it will be a very little fraction.”Dr. Ayala said he found it far more interesting to contemplate the way humans have improved their scope as a species by cultural evolution.“We are still biologically adapted to tropical climates,” he said. “Yet we have populated the continents of the earth without changing our physiology. We just use clothing and housing and heating and air conditioning. We travel the oceans without scale, and we fly without having evolved wings.”'"

"'09-02-11,'1','Someone should have told Treasury Secretary that the one thing to avoid at a time of uncertainty is raising more questions.When he announced the Obama administration’s new-and-improved bank bailout plan on Tuesday, Mr. Geithner certainly seemed to have digested some of the flaws in the Bush administration’s rescue attempt — especially the lack of accountability and transparency in how taxpayers’ dollars were spent. Unfortunately, the rest of his speech invited, at best, healthy skepticism from the markets, the public and lawmakers — and at worst, more mistrust.First, there was no new bailout plan and no firm timeline for a plan. There were only outlines. One outline calls for a new public-private fund that would ultimately buy up some $500 billion to $1 trillion of the bad assets that are clogging ’ balance sheets.But Mr. Geithner did not say how the Treasury Department would operate the fund. He also did not address the extent of any taxpayer subsidies or other government guarantees that may be used to entice private investors to participate. Also left unanswered was the devilish question that undermined Bush officials’ attempts to buy up those same assets: how much should be paid for them? A fact sheet released by the Treasury Department implied that private investors would value the assets correctly.Another outline calls for more injections of taxpayer-provided capital into troubled banks. Previous injections have been faulted because taxpayers have not received an equity stake that reflects the risk. There is no indication that the problem will be solved this go-round.'"
"'09-02-11,'1','In Congo in December, a contingent of 100 peacekeepers that was less than a mile away did not intervene in a rebel massacre that human rights investigators said killed 150 people; the peacekeepers reported that they were short of equipment and manpower and lacked the intelligence capacity to figure out what was happening in the nearby town.In some conflict zones, peacekeepers do not have the technology to fulfill even one of their most basic tasks: tracking the movements of the armed groups they are trying to keep separate.The problems prompted several leaders of the United Nations’ peacekeeping efforts to embark on a new round of studies about how to ensure peacekeepers can fulfill their missions, the efforts being extended over several months to try to avoid suggestions for quick fixes that get shelved.But some experts say the most important fix is perhaps the hardest. The Security Council, they say, needs to avoid sending missions to countries where there is not yet a real peace to keep.The difference between peacekeeping mandates, one written in 1974 and the other taking effect less than 14 months ago, goes a long way toward explaining the difficulties United Nations troops now face.The mandate that established the United Nations force on the Syria-Israel border nearly 35 years ago is just a few sentences long — basically directing the troops to monitor the cease-fire. Ever since, the bloodiest scenes witnessed by the blue-helmeted soldiers deployed with little more than binoculars have mostly been of stray cows blown up by land mines.The 2007 mandate establishing the United Nations peacekeeping force for Darfur covers more than two pages and details a battery of tasks, which include protecting civilians, guiding an inclusive political process, promoting economic development and human rights, and monitoring the border with neighboring states.“Previously, you were there as an important symbol rather than as an active force,” said Nicholas Haysom, the United Nations director for political, peacekeeping and humanitarian affairs.The scope and number of missions expanded, in good part, to try to address past failures.After sending five successive missions to Haiti, where the violence erupted again after they left, for example, the United Nations decided that peacekeepers should do more to ensure that countries were economically stable when they departed.And after the massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia, the United Nations added the protection of civilians as a priority for each mission.But many feel that peacekeeping has become a panacea, with the deployment of United Nations forces considered proof that the Security Council is paying attention to a crisis, whether the troops are effective or not. The Council has a tendency to just keep extending missions once approved.As a result, the number of personnel on peacekeeping missions has grown to 113,000 soldiers, police officers and civilians assigned to 18 missions, from 40,000 in 2000.In the past few months alone, the Security Council has voted to take over a European mission deployed in Chad, to beef up the force in eastern Congo and to contemplate deploying a new force in Somalia.The peacekeeping budget has ballooned to $8 billion.The United States pays about 27 percent of that budget, and Ambassador Susan E. Rice has suggested that the Obama administration will seek changes in peacekeeping missions, but she has yet to define them.At least three different efforts have started recently within the United Nations system to find ways to streamline and improve peacekeeping, including one by the Council itself.Experts inside and outside the United Nations say two changes are essential.The forces need to train specifically for every aspect of their expanded mandates — how to intervene to stop a rape epidemic in the Congo, for example.But the most critical change, the experts say, would be for the United Nations to resist sending forces into active battle zones, including those where they could find themselves pitted against a national government.“They can’t start a war against a host government like a well-organized Sudanese campaign,” said Maj. Gen. Patrick C. Cammaert, a Dutch marine with long experience in United Nations peacekeeping operations. “That goes beyond protecting civilians; it is on a magnitude that a U.N. mission cannot deal with. It is a political issue that the Security Council has to decide before issuing the mandate.”And Maj. Gen. B. T. Obasa, the military attaché at the United Nations Mission of Nigeria, which deploys some 4,000 soldiers in Darfur, expressed frustration that the countries contributing troops are not consulted more.“We were supposed to go to Sudan to keep the peace, not for peace enforcement, which we find ourselves doing now,” he said. “If the U.N. goes into any country, they should know and be certain what we are going to do there, what the requirements are and how long we will stay.”'"
"'09-02-11,'1','Mrs. Clinton said recently that relations during the Bush administration “turned into an economic dialogue,” adding, “That’s a very important aspect of our relationship with China, but it is not the only aspect.”Speaking last week to reporters, she said, “We want it to be part of a broader agenda, and that’s what we’re working to achieve.”Mrs. Clinton has not yet publicly declared her priorities for China, and she must square her ambitions with those of the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, and other senior Obama administration officials, like Carol M. Browner, the White House’s coordinator of energy and climate policy.But Mrs. Clinton has moved to reclaim the role of the State Department in making China policy after years in which the Treasury, led by Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., dominated the issue. Mr. Paulson initiated and led the so-called Strategic Economic Dialogue that covered a wide variety of topics but, according to critics, limited American scrutiny of issues like Tibet.China’s crackdown on protesting Tibetan monks last year led Mrs. Clinton, then a Democratic presidential candidate, to call on President Bush not to attend the Beijing Olympics. Mr. Bush went to Beijing anyway — a decision in keeping with his administration’s practice of pushing China harder on its exchange rate than on its human rights abuses.The Obama administration, officials said, will start softly, too, focusing initially on climate change and energy efficiency. Mrs. Clinton is expected to bring along her new special envoy for climate change, Todd Stern, who has written about the need for countries that are major emitters to work together.The United States is likely to emphasize joint research projects over harder issues like cuts in Chinese emissions, an approach that largely echoes that of the Bush administration. Even so, climate experts warned that progress could easily be derailed by other jolts between Beijing and Washington.“We need to be willing to set aside other things that could poison the relationship: conflicts over Iran, conflicts over Africa, conflicts over the currency,” said David G. Victor, an energy expert at Stanford University.Mrs. Clinton, whose weeklong Asian tour also includes stops in Japan, Indonesia and South Korea, is unlikely to confront the Chinese on her first visit. But given that she often cites her 1995 speech to a women’s conference in Beijing and its hostile reception by the Chinese, it is hard to imagine that she would soft-pedal human rights abuses in Tibet or elsewhere.Officials said Mrs. Clinton was determined to engage the Chinese on North Korea, pushing for a resumption of multiparty talks with the North Koreans. Outside experts have urged the secretary to name a lead American negotiator for North Korea before her trip, to underline her urgency.Christopher R. Hill, the current negotiator, is expected to be appointed ambassador to Iraq, though he will travel to Asia with Mrs. Clinton. Among the people rumored to be in line for the North Korea post is Stephen W. Bosworth, a former American ambassador to South Korea.Mr. Bosworth, now dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, returned Saturday from a private visit to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, telling reporters that he detected some willingness on the part of North Korean officials to talk to the Obama administration.Mrs. Clinton’s greatest challenge in seizing China policy, some experts said, is that she is not the Treasury secretary. “What’s more important right now than economics?” said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.'"
"'09-02-11,'1','“If you do this, it will be one of the best things for India and one of the worst for Americans, [because] Indians will be forced to innovate at home,” said Subhash B. Dhar, a member of the executive council that runs Infosys, the well-known Indian technology company that sends Indian workers to the U.S. to support a wide range of firms. “We protected our jobs for many years and look where it got us. Do you know that for an Indian company, it is still easier to do business with a company in the U.S. than it is to do business today with another Indian state?”Each Indian state tries to protect its little economy with its own rules. America should not be trying to copy that. “Your attitude,” said Dhar, should be “ ‘whoever can make us competitive and dominant, let’s bring them in.’ ”If there is one thing we know for absolute certain, it’s this: Protectionism did not cause , but it sure helped to make it From 1929 to 1934, world trade plunged by more than 60 percent — and we were all worse off.We live in a technological age where every study shows that the more knowledge you have as a worker and the more knowledge workers you have as an economy, the faster your incomes will rise. Therefore, the centerpiece of our stimulus, the core driving principle, should be to stimulate everything that makes us smarter and attracts more smart people to our shores. That is the best way to create good jobs.According to research by Vivek Wadhwa, a senior research associate at the Labor and Worklife Program at Law School, more than half of Silicon Valley start-ups were founded by immigrants over the last decade. These immigrant-founded tech companies employed 450,000 workers and had sales of $52 billion in 2005, said Wadhwa in an essay published this week on .He also cited a recent study by William R. Kerr of Harvard Business School and William F. Lincoln of the that “found that in periods when H-1B visa numbers went down, so did patent applications filed by immigrants [in the U.S.]. And when H-1B visa numbers went up, patent applications followed suit.”We don’t want to come out of this crisis with just inflation, a mountain of debt and more shovel-ready jobs. We want to — we have to — come out of it with a new Intel, , and Apple. I would have loved to have seen the stimulus package include a government-funded venture capital bank to help finance all the start-ups that are clearly not starting up today — in the clean-energy space they’re dying like flies — because of a lack of liquidity from traditional lending sources.Newsweek had an essay this week that began: “Could Silicon Valley become another ?” Well, yes, it could. When the best brains in the world are on sale, you don’t shut them out. You open your doors wider. We need to attack this with green cards not just greenbacks, and with start-ups not just bailouts. One Detroit is enough.'"
"'09-02-11,'1','Molson Coors Brewing reported a lower profit for its fourth quarter on Tuesday despite having raised its beer prices.Molson, which partly owns the Miller brands in the United States through a joint venture with SABMiller, said its financial results were hurt the most by the strength of the dollar, which lowers revenue when foreign currencies are converted to dollars.Peter Swinburn, the chief executive, said that beer drinkers might have balked at higher prices for Miller Lite in the United States, where consumers have been hard hit by rising unemployment and a deepening recession. Like other brewing companies, Molson has raised its prices in the last year because of higher costs.Mr. Swinburn also said that Miller Lite was a popular brand at bars and restaurants and that those sales had declined as the economy softened and fewer people ate out.“I think we’re recession-resistant, not recession-proof,” he said. “In economic times like this, this is a good industry to be in.”For the quarter ended Dec. 28, profit fell 44 percent to $96.8 million, or 52 cents a share. That compared with $173.2 million, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier.'"
"'09-02-11,'1','Muzak Holdings, the maker of background music heard in elevators, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday.The company had a heavy debt load, and it filed to try to refinance some of its debt. In a court filing, the company listed its total debt at $100 million to $500 million.The filing listed assets of less than $50,000, but a company spokeswoman, Meaghan Repko, said total assets were about $320 million. That included the Muzak operating company, she said, which also filed for bankruptcy. She declined to provide a more exact figure for the company’s total debt.Many of Muzak’s biggest creditors are music companies that license songs for use on Muzak playlists. While the company is known as the creator of elevator music, its business is now more focused on creating playlists for use in retail stores, installing professional sound systems and providing other services.Muzak, which is based in Fort Mill, S.C., filed for protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court in the District of Delaware in Wilmington.'"
"'09-02-11,'1','WASHINGTON — An F.B.I. agent who worked on the investigation of Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, who was convicted on ethics charges, has said in a stunning formal complaint that a fellow agent and prosecutors contrived to improperly conceal evidence from the court and the defense.Among the startling accusations in the statement by the agent, Chad Joy, is that another agent maintained an inappropriate relationship with the prosecution’s star witness. Mr. Joy said his colleague, Mary Beth Kepner, almost always wore pants but on the day the witness, Bill Allen, took the stand, Ms. Kepner donned a skirt, which Mr. Joy said she described as “a present” to Mr. Allen.Both Mr. Joy and Ms. Kepner continue to work in the Anchorage office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, who presided over the Stevens trial in Federal District Court here, has called a hearing Friday to consider a request by Mr. Stevens’s lawyers for a new trial based on Mr. Joy’s complaint, which was filed with the Justice Department as part of a procedure to obtain whistleblower status, which would protect him against job-related retaliation.Mr. Stevens, an Alaska Republican who lost his campaign for re-election in November, is awaiting sentencing after his conviction on charges involving failure to list on his Senate disclosure form goods and services he obtained from several supporters, but mostly from Mr. Allen, an influential oil-services tycoon in Alaska and a onetime close friend.Mr. Stevens’s trial was punctuated by errors by prosecutors, which brought serial scoldings from Judge Sullivan. At the time, the chief prosecutor, Brenda Morris, repeatedly apologized for the errors, insisting to Judge Sullivan that they were mistakes of inadvertence and negligence but were not purposeful.'"
"'09-02-11,'1','A close look at the history of the stimulus bill — the first major product of the new administration — shows that the industries that stand to gain most from the proposed legislation were also working to help shape it even before Mr. Obama had won the election.For months, the industry officials had been talking with Obama advisers about how to use taxpayer aid to jump-start the economy while laying the groundwork for both the new president’s and their own goals of building a high-tech infrastructure.Mr. Obama’s advisers say that the administration was only following through on the public promises he made in a campaign that began with a call two years ago to curb America’s dependence on foreign oil and extend broadband access “through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America.”And they emphasized that Mr. Obama had taken unusual steps to disclose what those firms were saying, like posting any proposals submitted to the transition on its Web site, in contrast to the Bush administration’s fight to keep secret how fossil fuel company executives shaped its energy policy in 2001.“Whatever they shared, we put out there so the public could see it,” said John Podesta, president of the liberal Center for American Progress and co-chairman of the transition.Campaign finance records also show that executives at many of the energy and technology companies that stand to profit from the stimulus bill were also big contributors to Mr. Obama’s campaign. His promises about a “smart grid” and universal broadband dovetailed with the dreams of many in the technology industry, as well as allied fields like renewable energy and electric power.Drawing on renewable energy sources, like wind turbines and solar panels, would be easier with a smart grid that could handle inconsistent electricity production. More energy would lower the cost of running giant computer servers, and because such a grid can send signals in both directions, it would also allow variable pricing for peak hours and could potentially expand the Internet network, as would extending other forms of broadband lines to rural and underserved areas. And moving health records online would open new markets for digital connections, data storage and consumer services.“They all converge,” said Christopher G. Caine, vice president for governmental programs at I.B.M., which is in both the smart grid and health care data businesses. At the transition’s request, I.B.M. prepared a research report concluding that $30 billion in spending this year on the smart grid, broadband access and digitized health records would create approximately 949,000 jobs.The idea of harnessing such pre-existing proposals to a stimulus package traces back to September 2008, when the financial crisis was worsening and it became clear that a jobs bill could be an early priority if Mr. Obama won the election.Obama advisers including Mr. Furman, Julius Genachowski and Austan Goolsbee began soliciting input from the high-tech and alternative energy interests, including General Motors, I.B.M., Google, the Information Technology Industry Council and the electric utilities’ Edison Institute.By October, “there was a query that said ‘if you had money to spend on broadband as part of this stimulus, what would you propose?’ ” said Debbie Goldman, telecommunications policy director and research economist for the Communications Workers of America, which has pushed for greater government spending on broadband.After the election, the campaign’s policy teams went through their agenda and selected those items that could have a quick start and natural end date to identify candidates for a jobs bill.“Synergies between our short-term goals and our long-term goals,” David Axelrod, a top adviser to Mr. Obama, said in an interview, “that was the sweet spot.”The transition also sought expert advice, holding conference calls and meetings at its temporary headquarters in Washington with a parade of industry lobbyists and executives from high-tech and clean energy companies from mid-November to early December.On Dec. 2 for example, Ms. Goldman of the communications workers union made a presentation promoting the jobs that would be created by broadband spending. On the same day, representatives of all the renewable energy trade groups sat around a table making pitches to Carol M. Browner, who is now Mr. Obama’s energy policy chief.“It was nice they were having us all in so early,” said Karl Gawell of the Geothermal Industry Association, whose members would benefit from $400 million in grants in the House version of the stimulus bill.The process reached a climax when economic team members flew to Chicago to meet with Mr. Obama on Dec. 16. The team laid out the structure of the plan — increased spending on infrastructure, education, energy and health care, with tax cuts, financial aid to states and unemployment and food stamp benefits.While much of the presentation involved broad themes, Mr. Furman said it put special focus on “a number of high-priority flagship details” like the renewable energy and high-tech components. Mr. Obama signed off on the initial outline, after making a few adjustments.“The president-elect was particularly interested in the energy component of the plan and pushed for a more robust effort on the smart grid,” Mr. Furman recalled.Three days later — the Friday before Christmas — transition officials met at the Capitol with Congressional leaders and staff to present the proposals, which Mr. Furman said were couched in the form of “suggestions” by the president-elect.His team had few staff and relied on Congress to convert their ideas into legislative language. Congressional committees, meanwhile, had been working since November to draft their own version of a stimulus bill, and added their own details to Mr. Obama’s blueprint. For example, House Democrats attached privacy protections to measures that promote the online storage of medical records, banning the sale of health data, an idea long pushed by the American Civil Liberties Union.Mr. Garfield of the Information Technology Industry Council said technology lobbyists accepted the privacy rules in a spirit of compromise, in light of the victories they won elsewhere with Mr. Obama’s help.“I won’t say it is great to be the king, because we are not the king,” Mr. Garfield said. “But it is good to be heard.”'"
"'09-02-11,'1','“Frankly, she’s very lucky to get away with supporting, even indirectly, perhaps the most ruthless terrorist outfit in the world,” said Suresh Jayawickrama, a songwriter based in Colombo.Mr. Jayawickrama is from the country’s majority Sinhalese ethnic group, and his reaction is similar to that of many Sri Lankans who know M.I.A.’s music. But he also said that M.I.A. deserved for her artistry and the fame she had achieved. “She really should have a little more recognition in this country,” he said.Despite decades of conflict, music has remained largely free of political messages or overtones in Sri Lanka, perhaps because audiences are seeking entertainment and escape from the daily reminders of civil war.“Compared to other countries, people don’t write many songs here about what is going on politically,” said Dillain Joseph, a singer who is of mixed Sinhalese and Tamil parentage.Meanwhile, M.I.A.’s claims that the government is carrying out a genocide against Tamils place her on the outer fringe of opinion about the conflict.Although the government has brutalized and killed Tamil civilians over the past 25 years, human rights organizations spread the blame around, estimating that 70,000 people on both sides have been killed in the fighting.“This is a conflict in which both sides have terrible human rights records,” said Yolanda Foster, a specialist on Sri Lanka with in . “The Tamil Tigers have a long history of child recruitment, hostage taking, forcing civilians to the front lines. It’s complicated to assign blame.”M.I.A. was born in but moved to Sri Lanka when she was 6 months old so that her father, an engineer and a leader in the Tamil separatist movement, could help fight for an independent Tamil homeland. Her childhood took her across northern Sri Lanka, wracked by insurgency, to and back to Britain, where her mother and siblings settled into a public housing project outside London. Her father remained in Sri Lanka. She now calls New York home.Sri Lankans who have seen her videos say they interpret some parts as showing support for the Tigers, or at the very least glorifying their cause. But for those not familiar with the conflict, they might come across as generic third-world scenes.“I kind of want to leave it ambiguous for my fans,” she said in the PBS interview, referring to the lyrics of her song “Paper Planes,” which was nominated for record of the year at the Grammys but did not win.“Paper Planes,” which compares international drug dealing with selling records, drew a reaction from DeLon, a Sinhalese rapper based in , who made a video remix in which he interspersed images of people being blown up by Tamil Tiger bombs and subtitles about M.I.A. being a terrorist.M.I.A. responded that she did not support terrorism.Despite those tensions, which played out largely on the Internet and abroad, musicians in Sri Lanka say the music scene has remained ethnically diverse, with members of the country’s numerous ethnic groups and religions often forming bands together.“There’s a lot of mixing and matching going on,” said Rienzie Pereira, a guitar player. “It’s basically like sports. No matter what ethnic group you are from, people can play together.”'"
"'09-02-11,'1','Mr. Kinch gives credit for his creation to Michel Bras, the chef in Laguiole, France, who has long served a dish whose ingredients reflect the land around the restaurant.Gargouillou (pronounced gar-gu-YU) is the name of the dish, said Mr. Liebrandt, who also credited Mr. Bras. “He is the genius chef from Laguiole who took a simple vegetable composition and elevated it into something new, fresh and magical,” he wrote by e-mail.Reached in Laguiole, where the restaurant that he runs with his son, Sébastien, is closed for the season, Mr. Bras said that the idea for the 50- to 60-ingredient dish — which changes daily based on what’s in the market and his home garden — came to him during a run in the countryside in June 1978, when the fields and mountains were in full flower. “It was beautiful, it was rich, it was marvelous,” he said. “I decided to try to translate the fields.”Gargouillou’s effect has been as prolific as it has been poetic. In 2007, on a posting on the Love Apple Farm’s blog, www.growbetterveggies.com, Mr. Kinch wrote, “This dish has had enormous influence on a whole generation of chefs around the world, many who took the idea and built their own theme into it.” For example, at Mugaritz, just outside San Sebastián, Spain, the chef Andoni Aduriz, “one of the world’s brilliant talents, has placed his own stamp on what has now become a signature dish at his restaurant worthy of his name,” Mr. Kinch wrote.There are other Gargouillou gardeners in the United States, like Daniel Patterson at Coi in San Francisco, who serves Abstraction of Garden in Early Winter. And at a dinner set for Feb. 21 at the James Beard House in Manhattan, Dominique Crenn from Luce at the InterContinental San Francisco will serve Le Jardin de l’Hiver (Winter Vegetables with Black Olive Soil).Mr. Bras is flattered by the homages. “I’m self-taught, so I’m very proud,” he said. Asked if an urban chef could make a true Gargouillou, he said with a laugh that a visit to the Union Square Greenmarket could yield “the world’s biggest.”As for Mr. Kinch, he wrote in an e-mail message: “I think that it points out the evolution of how great ideas and concepts spread. It is wonderful.”“We all find our inspiration from our peers,” he added. “I know I do.”'"

The 185-year-old Moscow theater, home to the Bolshoi Ballet and the Bolshoi Opera, closed in July 2005 to undergo restorations to its structure, orchestra pit and backstage area; at the time the Bolshoi anticipated that work would be completed by 2008. But now Russia’s culture minister, Aleksandr Avdeyev, said the renovations would not be finished until the middle of 2011 because contractors were hired that “were inexpensive rather than high quality,” The Guardian reported. Mr. Avdeyev also said that the installation of a stage hydraulics system would take longer than originally expected. Nikita Shangin, former chief architect of the renovation, said previously announced completion dates were “all bluff and politics,” according to The Guardian, adding, “I always believed it would take a lot longer.”'"

"'09-02-11,'1','A bankruptcy would make Sirius XM one of the largest casualties of the credit squeeze. With over $5 billion in assets, it would be the second-largest Chapter 11 filing so far this year, according to Capital IQ. The filing by Smurfit-Stone, with assets of $7 billion, has been the year’s biggest to date.Sirius XM, which never turned a profit when both companies were independent, is laden with $3.25 billion in debt. Its business model has been dependent, in part, on the ability to roll over its enormous debts — used to finance sending satellites into space and attract talent like Mr. Stern (who was paid $100 million a year) — at low rates for the foreseeable future until it could turn a profit.The company’s success and failure are also tied to the faltering fortunes of the automobile industry, which sells vehicles with its radio technology installed and represented the largest customer base among Sirius XM’s 20 million subscribers.Sirius XM owes about $175 million in debt payments at the end of February that it is unlikely to be able to pay.Sirius XM’s problems could pave the way for a takeover by EchoStar, the TV satellite company, which has bought up Sirius XM’s debt.Mr. Karmazin has been locked in talks with EchoStar’s chief executive, Charles W. Ergen, over Sirius XM’s options, people involved in the talks said. The men are said not to get along, these people said, and Mr. Karmazin had rebuffed Mr. Ergen’s takeover advances before.Sirius XM hired Joseph A. Bondi of Alvarez & Marsal and Mark J. Thompson, a bankruptcy lawyer with Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett, to help prepare a Chapter 11 filing, these people said.Documents and analysis are close to completion and a filing could come in days, according to a person familiar with the matter.The threat of bankruptcy could also be part of a negotiating dance with Mr. Ergen, who could decide to convert his debt into equity instead of demanding payment.In addition to the $175 million due in February, EchoStar also owns $400 million of Sirius XM’s debt due in December. If Sirius XM files for bankruptcy, EchoStar could seek in court to take over the company. Mr. Ergen, however, may be able to negotiate to convert his shares before bankruptcy at an attractive rate and gain control of the company, these people said.For Mr. Karmazin, the sale or bankruptcy of Sirius XM would be one of his first failures. He founded Infinity Broadcasting, sold it to CBS and later merged the combined companies into Viacom, where he had a notoriously difficult relationship with Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman, before being ousted.Mr. Karmazin bought two million shares of Sirius XM at $1.37 a share in August. Before that, he had bought 20 million shares at an average price of $5 each. On Tuesday, Sirius closed at 11.4 cents a share.Since the summer, the company’s prospects have dimmed.“I’m not trying to paint the rosy picture, because we have challenges connected to our liquidity and certainly our stock price is dreadful,” Mr. Karmazin said in December. “But, you know, our revenues are growing double digits. We’re growing subscribers. We’re not losing subscribers.”A spokeswoman for Mr. Karmazin declined to comment. A spokesman for EchoStar could not be reached.Mr. Karmazin staked the success of the merger on nearly $400 million in annual cost savings and the potential to gain subscribers through deals with auto companies to put satellite radios into cars.But satellite radio failed to win over many younger listeners, and competition from other sources slowed subscriber growth.'"
"'09-02-11,'1','“I feel like Orfeo facing the gates of hell,” he said, referring to the title character in Gluck’s opera “Orfeo ed Euridice,” who descends into Hades to retrieve his wife. The news conference took place at the Met’s small auditorium, List Hall, in contrast to Mr. Gelb’s first major news conference as general manager, which was held on the Met’s main stage.Mr. Gelb referred to operas the Met has decided not to present because of costs: Graham Vick’s 1994 production of Shostakovich’s “Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District” and Herbert Wernicke’s 2001 production of Strauss’s “Frau Ohne Schatten.” Two less costly productions of Strauss operas, “Ariadne auf Naxos” and “Elektra,” will replace them. Other productions left on the cutting-room floor are revivals of John Corigliano’s 1991 “Ghosts of Versailles” and Berlioz’s “Benvenuto Cellini.”“The cuts we have made are going to help us make ends meet, but we have not solved the problem yet,” Mr. Gelb said. “But we can’t stop and wait until the economics are settled to announce the season. We have to move forward.”Some of the high points of the new season had already emerged in past news accounts. They include Rossini’s “Armida” with Renée Fleming in the title role and Verdi’s “Attila” with Riccardo Muti making his Met conducting debut. The “Attila” production team includes Miuccia Prada, the fashion designer, and Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, the Swiss architects who designed the Bird’s Nest stadium for the Beijing Olympic Games.Other new productions include Janacek’s “From the House of the Dead,” with Esa-Pekka Salonen conducting in his Met debut, and Puccini’s “Tosca,” with Karita Mattila singing the title role for the first time outside her native Finland.Patrice Chéreau, a major figure in Europe, will make his directing debut at the Met in the Janacek, which has already appeared in Vienna. Luc Bondy will direct “Tosca” in his Met debut.At a news conference complete with videos and projected photographs, a promotional image of Ms. Mattila as Tosca poised to leap to her death prompted her to say: “I kind of like it. I look so different. My toes look enormous.”“Armida,” “Attila,” “The Nose” and “From the House of the Dead” have never been performed at the Met.Another new production is Ambroise Thomas’s “Hamlet,” conducted by Louis Langrée. Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser created the production, which will have Simon Keenlyside as Hamlet and Natalie Dessay as Ophélie.The Met said it would continue its last-minute discount ticket program and open up dress rehearsals for three operas, not yet announced, free to the public.In another cutback, there will be 9 live high-definition broadcasts to movie theaters, down from 11 this season, although Mr. Gelb said a 10th could still be added. But on the positive side Mr. Gelb said the Met’s HD transmissions had passed the million-ticket mark in sales for last weekend.Next season’s transmissions are “Tosca” on Oct. 10; “Aida” on Oct. 24; “Turandot” on Nov. 7; “Les Contes d’Hoffmann” on Dec. 19; “Der Rosenkavalier” on Jan. 9; “Carmen” on Jan. 16; “Simon Boccanegra” on Feb. 6; “Hamlet” on March 27; and “Armida” on May 1.'"
"'09-02-11,'1','Now, as Justice Lippman stands one step from becoming the chief judge of the state’s highest court, his body of work as a jurist remains relatively thin, leaving some judges and legal scholars uncertain about what he will bring to the bench that has the last word on state law.“The Court of Appeals is in the business of settling the law and making the law when it isn’t there,” said Vincent M. Bonventre, a professor at Albany Law School who studies the Court of Appeals. “It’s very, very different than being on a lower court. Lippman hasn’t spent much time even on a lower court or any time litigating these kinds of issues.”Although the candidates to replace Judith S. Kaye as chief judge included two current Court of Appeals judges and others with more courtroom experience, Gov. David A. Paterson nominated Justice Lippman last month. Not only does the chief judge hear and help decide cases as part of the seven-member court, but he also serves as the chief executive of the court system, which has a budget of more than $2 billion and handles more than four million cases a year.Justice Lippman, 63, declined to comment until after his State Senate confirmation hearing, scheduled for Wednesday. But those who have worked with him describe a man who is enthusiastic, optimistic and intelligent. The New York State Bar Association gave Justice Lippman and five of the other six finalists “well-qualified” ratings, and he was one of only two to get an “exceptionally well-qualified” rating from the New York City Bar Association.A Manhattan native, Justice Lippman’s entire professional career has been in the state court system, starting in 1968, after graduation from law school at New York University, when he became an entry-level court lawyer. He became the deputy chief administrator for management of the state court system in 1989. In 1995, Gov. George E. Pataki appointed him to be a judge on the Court of Claims, which hears cases in which the state is being sued, and the following year Ms. Kaye hired him as the chief administrative judge.He won election as a State Supreme Court justice in 2005, but kept his administrative role until May 2007, when Gov. Eliot Spitzer appointed him to the rung below the Court of Appeals, the Appellate Division’s First Department, hearing appeals from Manhattan and the Bronx.Some of Justice Lippman’s colleagues have coined the phrase, “to be Lippmanized,” which happens when Justice Lippman persuades someone to side with him.“He is one of those people who really does engender loyalty and support because he treats everyone with dignity and respect,” said A. Gail Prudenti, the presiding justice of the Second Department, which hears appeals from the rest of the city and several suburban counties.As chief administrative judge under Ms. Kaye, he succeeded in persuading lawmakers to more than double the financing for the court system and back innovations like jury reform and specialized courts for issues like drug abuse, mental illness and domestic violence.Despite his accomplishments, he will inherit several pressing matters if he is confirmed, not the least of which is the Legislature’s freezing of judicial salaries since 1999.“From a standpoint of administration, I think he’s in a unique position to take his expertise, especially in these tough economic times, to help reduce the bureaucracy in that system and make it a more efficient court operation,” said John A. DeFrancisco, the former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.Justice Lippman has won many allies from his work in Albany, including Ms. Kaye, who kept it barely a secret that she wanted Justice Lippman to succeed her when she reached the mandatory retirement age of 70 last year.“He kept himself above the political scene,” said Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, who has been a friend of Justice Lippman’s since they were children on the Lower East Side. “He dealt with Republicans and Democrats the same.”Mr. Silver said his friendship with the judge had little to do with the nomination and that Justice Lippman earned it on his own merits.Justice Lippman began to hear cases as an acting Supreme Court justice and in 2005 ran for one of four Supreme Court seats covering five counties in the northern suburbs. Some Democratic and Republican party leaders in the area agreed to endorse him and another candidate, all but assuring they would win. Justice Lippman had said he would run only with a cross-endorsement. because he did not want to be involved in a partisan election. Three years earlier, he dropped out of a State Supreme Court race after the parties could not agree on a cross-endorsement.In a 2005 article in The Journal News, Ken Harper, then chairman of the Putnam County Democratic Committee, criticized the cross-endorsement as a back-room deal. The judicial election process in New York State has often been criticized as putting too much power in party leaders’ hands, but it was upheld unanimously by the United States Supreme Court a year ago.Nicholas A. Spano, a former Republican state senator who was friends with Justice Lippman, said the judge had earned the right to run virtually uncontested.“I think it would have been practically an insult for him to have to run in a competitive political race because he was so nonpartisan and so eminently qualified for the job,” Mr. Spano said in a recent interview.In Justice Lippman’s time on the bench, he has presided over more than 2,000 cases, according to a spokesman for the court system. He wrote 14 opinions in 20 months with the Appellate Division (most decisions at that level are issued through memos not signed by any judge) and a handful more while on the Supreme Court.Justice Lippman’s supporters argue that he already has proven his legal acumen and, although he may have presided over relatively few cases, he spent many years as a court lawyer helping judges decide cases. Some also note that many Court of Appeals judges, including Ms. Kaye, came to the court never having served as a judge.Although no clear ideological picture emerges from the few opinions Justice Lippman has written, academics say he appears to be a shrewd and pragmatic jurist.Perhaps his most notable opinion was published last April, when he upheld a jury’s verdict that the Port Authority was 68 percent liable for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Justice Lippman wrote that the Port Authority had knowingly ignored “an extreme and potentially catastrophic vulnerability” in its security.In a decision last June, People v. Valdez, Justice Lippman upheld a theft conviction, but in his ruling, he criticized the trial judge for allowing the prosecution’s main witness, a police officer, to testify about his accolades, which included two “Cop of the Year” awards. Daniel J. Castleman, the chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said the ruling had an influence on the way prosecutors are trained.Mr. Bonventre noted two slight patterns in Justice Lippman’s opinions: he is careful to protect the rights of the accused, and he favors letting lawsuits play out in court. They suggest a judge who is “at least moderately liberal,” Mr. Bonventre said.Oscar G. Chase, a law professor at New York University, said that Justice Lippman’s judicial prowess remains an open question, but that the few opinions he has written have been “well-organized and thorough, even if it doesn’t always persuade all of his colleagues.”'"
"'09-02-11,'1','The stock market, propped up for weeks on the expectation that Washington would finally deliver a comprehensive rescue plan, dipped almost as soon as Mr. Geithner began speaking in the morning. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 382 points, or 4.6 percent, by the time the market closed. Yields on Treasury bills dropped, indicating a flight from to the safety of government bonds. Asian markets slipped more narrowly.While traveling in , Fla., welcomed the news that the Senate voted 61-37 to approve its $838 billion economic stimulus bill Tuesday, but dismissed the market reaction to his bank rescue plan.“Wall Street, I think, is hoping for an easy out on this thing and there is no easy out,” Mr. Obama said in an interview with ABC News.Many of the vital details of the program remain unsettled and are the subject of an intense behind-the-scenes debate.The president himself had built up expectations that the plan would get ahead of the crisis — and not lurch from pillar to post as the Bush administration did last year, often in partnership with the New York Federal Reserve under its then-president, Mr. Geithner.A central piece of the plan — and the one item that investors most craved information about — would create one or more so-called bad banks that would rely on taxpayer and private money to purchase and hold banks’ bad assets. But the administration provided the least amount of details about this part of the plan.Another centerpiece of the plan would stretch the last $350 billion that the Treasury has for the bailout by relying on the Federal Reserve’s ability to create money, in effect, out of thin air. The Fed’s money will enable the government to become involved in the management of markets and banks in ways not seen since .In the markets, for instance, the administration and the Fed are proposing to expand a lending program that would spend as much as $1 trillion to make up for the $1.2 trillion decline between 2006 and last year in the issuance of securities backed primarily by consumer .The plan’s third major component would give banks new helpings of capital with which to lend. Banks that receive new government assistance will have to cut the salaries and perks of their executives and sharply limit dividends and corporate acquisitions.They will also have to make public more information about their lending practices. A Treasury fact sheet said that banks would have to state monthly how many new loans they make, but stopped short of ordering banks to issue new loans or requiring them to account in detail for the federal money.Mr. Obama, in the ABC News interview, suggested that banks would be required to reveal more about their mortgage holdings.“Essentially what you’ve got are a set of banks that have not been as transparent as we need to be in terms of what their books look like. And we’re going to have to hold out the Band-Aid a little bit and go ahead and just be clear about some of the losses that have been made because until we do that, we’re not going to be able to attract private capital into the marketplace.”The day was the first big test of Mr. Geithner as Treasury secretary, who has one of the toughest sells in America: convincing lawmakers and taxpayers that they should again bail out the very banks whose mistakes contributed to the loss of more than three million jobs and caused acute financial pain.It was clear during the hours he spent before the cameras and lawmakers that he was well-spoken and thoughtful. But his career until now had played out behind the scenes as a civil servant and a central banker. He occasionally lapsed into financial jargon and struggled to connect to a broader public audience.As the day wore on, Mr. Geithner faced growing skepticism from Democratic and Republican lawmakers, many of them channeling deep voter disgust with the way the government has handled the bailout over the last nine months.Even Democrats who are supportive of the administration said that it had failed to provide more information about how it would be spending the remaining money in the bailout program.“We need more details from Treasury on how exactly it plans to remove bad assets while protecting the taxpayer,” said Senator , the Democrat who is a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee. “We have zombie banks that are weighed down because their liabilities exceed their assets. Without a precise mechanism for addressing toxic assets, it will be difficult to increase lending.”The pessimism seemed to indicate that Mr. Geithner missed the mark with one of his shorter-term goals — to quickly instill confidence that the Obama administration has a coherent approach to the banking crisis and that the transparency and oversight of the new program will differ markedly from the Bush administration’s management of the first $350 billion that Congress authorized last year for the , or TARP.“The spectacle of huge amounts of taxpayer money being provided to the same institutions that helped cause the crisis, with limited transparency and oversight, added to the public distrust,” the Treasury secretary said, in a clear swipe at the Bush administration.“We will have to try things we’ve never tried before. We will make mistakes. We will go through periods in which things get worse and progress is uneven or interrupted,” Mr. Geithner said.Representative , the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, criticized the Obama administration for not putting out more details and said it should commit more than $50 billion to avert home foreclosures.“The secretary said the administration would present details of their foreclosure reduction plan in a few weeks, which is too much time,” Mr. Frank said.Appearing on Tuesday afternoon before the Senate banking committee, Mr. Geithner vowed to move quickly to provide more details. But Republicans were skeptical.“Is there a concrete plan here?” Richard Shelby of , the senior Republican on the committee, asked Mr. Geithner point blank, after noting that Mr. Geithner had been part of the leadership involved in last year’s bailout efforts. “What is different about the process that you are offering here to devise your plan such that we should have confidence that it is well thought out?”There was also withering criticism from Wall Street. Ethan Harris, co-head of economics research at Capital, said the program was “shock and uh.” He said the Treasury made a “tactical mistake” by building up expectations about a plan before it had much to announce.“What’s striking is that these are not new issues that they are facing,” Mr. Harris said. “These are the same issues that the Treasury faced last fall — how do we price the assets? The fact that it’s so been so difficult to figure out the answer may tell you something about whether it’s worth doing or not.”Mr. Harris warned that setting up a so-called bad bank would be very expensive, as Mr. Geithner himself acknowledged when he set the goal of creating a fund that would reach $1 trillion. Frank Pallotta, a former managing director at and a veteran mortgage trader, said the gap was so wide between what banks were valuing their assets and what investors were willing to pay that the government would attract investors to buy only if it provided a subsidy of one form or another.“Right now, the banks aren’t selling anything,” said Mr. Pallotta, now a consultant to both buyers and sellers of distressed mortgages. “You have Chase thinking that its assets are worth 75 cents on the dollar, and Joe Hedge Fund who thinks they are only worth 45 or 25. There is a huge gap, and the government has to find out if there is some middle point where they can get in.”Mr. Pallotta said he did not fault the Treasury for failing to offer specifics yet, but he said it could not delay for long. “If we don’t hear in the next 30 days about how this thing will flesh out, then I would be upset.”'"
"'09-02-11,'1','SAN FRANCISCO  Paul S. Otellini, the chief executive of Intel, made an uncharacteristic lunge toward the limelight on Tuesday, holding up his company’s $7 billion investment in new computer chip factories as a patriotic gesture for other businesses to follow.Although he had already told shareholders and Wall Street analysts of the company’s investment plans, Mr. Otellini used the opportunity of a speech before the Economic Club in Washington to vow that Intel would spend more money than ever to expand chip factories in the United States. He made that promise despite a precipitous decline in sales and profits of computer chips, the layoffs of at least 5,000 workers and the closing of older chip plants in Asia and the United States.He also urged companies trying to survive the recession to follow Intel’s model of investing in future products. Such a message comes from a company that earned $11 billion in cash last year and uses its manufacturing prowess and financial strength as an edge over rivals.“I thought it was very important for Intel, who is clearly a bellwether company, to be able to make this announcement in an environment where, quite frankly, there is a lot of doom and gloom,” Mr. Otellini said in a telephone interview after the speech.The severity of the economic decline prompted Mr. Otellini to make a rare speech tied to investing in the United States, he said. “This is all about confidence,” he said. “Economic cycles are about confidence.”Intel’s investment will go toward chip plants in Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico, not the factories overseas. “We believe in the company and in this country,” Mr. Otellini said.These facilities will produce a new line of cheaper and more energy-efficient chips late this year. Historically, Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has invested in the plants, which cost more than $3 billion each, even during lulls in demand for computers. As a result, the company believes that the more advanced chip-making technology gives it more than a year’s lead over rivals.Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s main competitor, has found the cost of building chip factories so prohibitive that it is trying to turn over that part of its operation to a newly created company to stay focused on design. On Tuesday, A.M.D. said it would need to delay a shareholder vote on the creation of the company, jointly owned by A.M.D. and an investment firm based in Abu Dhabi, until next week.'"
"'09-02-11,'1','Investors had been expecting the Obama administration to unveil a shock and awe solution on Tuesday for the nation’s hobbled banking system. But the main reaction was disappointment as the new plan raised more questions than it answered, sending stock markets and the shares of banks assumed to be holding toxic assets sharply lower.The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 381.99 points, or 4.6 percent, to close at 7,888.88, led by steep declines in Bank of America, Citigroup and large banks already leaning on taxpayers for support. Regions Bank, SunTrust, KeyCorp and Fifth Third fell even more as investors worried that regional banks could be vulnerable to a new “stress test” aimed at revealing the weakest links in the industry.“The market was looking for a silver bullet,” said David H. Ellison, the chief investment officer for FBR Funds, which specializes in the banking sector. “They are getting the wake-up call again that it is going to take time. There is no quick fix here.”Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner laid out a $2 trillion financial stability plan, including an effort to entice private equity, hedge funds and other investors to buy hard-to-sell assets that have bogged down banks. Another involves a new round of capital injections for banks deemed to have enough resources to withstand a continued economic decline.David Burg, a financial analyst at Alpine Mutual Funds, said bank stocks plunged because the initiative would force many troubled financial institutions to take large amounts of new capital that would dilute the value of their outstanding shares.“These guys are going to do a stress test on top banks and say, based on the results, ‘You need X amount of new capital and you have to take it.’ Common shareholders in these banks will get absolutely destroyed,” he said.But that was about the only certainty investors took from hours of speeches and testimony by Mr. Geithner on Tuesday. Investors said his failure to publicly detail the mechanics of the plan forced them to make wild assumptions about various players in the industry.For example, the proposed “stress test” seems intended to allow regulators to better assess the depth of a bank’s problems, and to convince taxpayers that they are not pouring money down an endless hole. The test automatically applies to the nation’s 20 largest banks, and to any other bank applying for taxpayer support.Federal officials are expected to demand that banks maintain ultraconservative capital levels — enough to weather the possibility of a further economic downturn, said a government official who was not authorized to speak publicly.The goal is for banks to have enough of a buffer to lend during the current downturn. That could mean that banks that normally would not need additional capital could require it if the economy worsened.Banks will be expected to assess their expected losses over the next two years. While Mr. Geithner did not say whether derivatives, or off-balance sheet exposures, would be included in the test, the government official said the test would be customized based on each bank’s mix of loans and its history of losses.Regulators will also continue to look at a whether a bank is holding at least 6 percent of so-called Tier 1 capital, a well-known measure of its financial health, and whether at least half of that capital is held in common stock, the official said. But regulators will have leeway to allow a bank to continue operating if it falls slightly short of that standard. It is unclear how the test will apply to Citigroup and Bank of America.Investors are concerned that, unlike these banking giants, any number of regional banks are not considered too big to fail. That is worrisome in the current environment because many are sitting on commercial real estate loans whose value is eroding rapidly with the economy.If regulators impose loose standards for the test, banks that might not otherwise survive could receive a lifeline. If they take a stricter stance, it could lead to another wave of takeovers and failures.'"

"'09-02-12,'1','And so on.Apple has spent the last year licking its wounds and propping up this iMovie impostor. The new version, iMovie '09, is far more usable.If you're scoring at home, here are the features that have been restored: themes, extracting audio, chapter markers, direct export to iDVD, visual effects (including slo-mo, reverse motion, black-and-white and more).Here's what's still missing: plug-ins, audio effects, manual audio adjustments, bookmarks, importing old iMovie projects without losing all your enhancements.That tally isn't exactly fair, however, because it doesn't consider all the things the new iMovie does that the old one couldn't. For example, its various skimming and scene-grabbing tools make it very quick to excerpt the best parts of your raw footage, and you never wait for anything to ""render"" in iMovie '09; any effect, transition, color adjustment or title you apply takes effect instantly.A new pop-up menu appears when you drag one clip onto another one, offering options like Cutaway, Insert, Audio Only, Picture in Picture and Green Screen--by far the simplest presentation of these advanced features you'll see in a video editor. There are a handful of nice-looking, canned ""themes"" that let you open and close your movie with pro-looking graphics, and an excellent map feature that draws an animated line to show the course of your travels (à la Indiana Jones).There's a wicked-cool feature that lets you tap along to music--every beat, or at any spastic intervals you want--and then drop video clips onto those markers, so that the video cuts happen right in time to the music (or to your taps). Fast and easy.The killer app, though, is image stabilization. It takes a long time to apply to a clip--several minutes each--but it winds up making jerky footage smooth, even if you were filming while hiccuping on a camel ride during an earthquake. You control the degree of smoothness; that's lucky, since 100 percent steady looks almost freakishly unnatural.This feature works fantastically well--so much, in fact, that it's ruined everyone else's videos for me. Now, every time I see a handheld camera shot--on YouTube, on the news, in a documentary, I struggle to suppress the instinct to mentally apply iMovie stabilization to it. I just can't overstate what a revelation this feature is--and how much more watchable your home movies become.The new iMovie offers so many satisfying time-savers that I would embrace it wholeheartedly, if it weren't still missing one critical option.See, the world is moving to hi-def camcorders. And iMovie '09 works great with hi-def camcorders. But what if you want to show your edited movie on a high-definition TV?You can upload it to YouTube (at diminished quality), export it to a DVD (at diminished quality), or send it to your Apple TV, iPhone or iPod (at diminished quality).In the days of olde iMovie, you could export the results back to your tape camcorder. You'd preserve 100 percent quality, you'd free up the space on your hard drive, ready for the next editing project, and you'd have a simple way to play the movies on your HDTV.Apple, however, is convinced that tape camcorders are dead, and it seems determined to pound nails into that coffin. The company expects you to store all of your video, now and forever, on hard drives. (The 100 MiniDV tapes currently in my cabinet, for example, would require about 1.5 terabytes of hard drive space--double that if I want a backup.)No Macs have Blu-ray burners, and iMovie lacks an Export to Tape command, so your high-def masterpieces are pretty much trapped forever on your Mac. (Sure, you could post them online, but only if they're short, and only if everyone in your potential audience has very high-speed Internet.)Otherwise, if you've been terrified by the quivering disaster that was iMovie '08, you can come out hiding now; it won't bite. It requires a lot of relearning, but there's a lot of joy along the way.Especially for the hard-drive industry.'"

"'09-02-12,'1','Novartis has obtained the worldwide rights to an anticlotting drug that could eventually compete with Plavix, the world’s second-best-selling medicine behind the cholesterol pill Lipitor.In a deal expected to be announced Thursday, Novartis would pay $75 million initially to Portola Pharmaceuticals, a privately held biotechnology company based in South San Francisco, Calif.The drug, elinogrel, is still in the second of three phases of clinical trials, so it is not yet clear how effective it will be in preventing heart attacks and strokes. And even if a successful Phase 3 trial is completed and federal regulators approved the drug, it would be unlikely to reach the market before 2013 or later.Yet based on how it works, Portola and Novartis say, it might be faster than Plavix. And its effects might be more reversible. Patients taking Plavix who need an operation sometimes have to wait several days until the drug is out of their system to avoid the risk of excessive bleeding.Plavix, sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis, had sales of $7.3 billion in 2007, according to IMS Health, a research company.But it could soon face competition. An advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration last week recommended approval of prasugrel, a blood thinner developed by Eli Lilly and Daiichi Sankyo.'"
"'09-02-12,'1','The term “yacht club” does not exactly evoke populist sentiments or mainstream economic concerns. Still, in its own ways, this small, high-end casualty of the bust has relevant lessons.Originally incorporated to encourage “Yachting and the cultivation of Naval Science and Seamanship,” the Knickerbocker Yacht Club has for more than a century catered both to serious sailors and to members who bought into its sense of seaside amity.In 1907, the club moved to Port Washington, essentially the one Jewish yacht club in a non-Jewish world. Members transported their old frame headquarters to Long Island, hoisted it atop the new one and began anew. There was iceboating and frostbiting (dinghy racing) in the winter, serious racing and leisurely cruising all summer. Members’ crafts ranged from 200-foot yachts to 10-foot dinghies, but most were moderate, with owners functioning as one-person crews. The club’s Knickerbocker Cup race, started in 1982, became internationally recognized.At its peak in the early 1980s, the club had about 290 families with 165 boats. And then, slowly, the world changed. Boating declined in popularity. Families started carting their kids to soccer games, ballet lessons and SAT classes instead of having them hang out by the water learning to sail. Living on Long Island got so expensive that older members moved away.And even the old sort-of rich, the doctors and dentists and successful business owners who could afford to spend tens of thousands of dollars on sailboats and their accouterments, found themselves feeling the pinch in the way they hadn’t in previous generations.This was not the world of the zillionaires across the Sound in Greenwich and Darien. It was mostly people who made a good living but paid high taxes and struggled with college tuitions. Even at the yacht club, or this one anyway, making ends meet wasn’t always so easy even before the roof fell in, a reminder of just how small a slice of American life got the big rewards during the Wall Street boom years.Membership fell to about 120 over the years and, with disaster looming, fell further this year. An attempt to merge with the Manhasset Bay Yacht Club next door fell through. Finally, the financial collapse put a noose around everyone. “That was the death knell,” said Jeanne Rosenthal, an ophthalmologist and the vice commodore, whose father taught her to sail at the club as a young girl. “This place was like ‘Cheers.’ I don’t know how I’ll survive without it.”Knickerbocker isn’t the only club for the well-to-do that will struggle to survive. And every collapse and divorce brings its unhappy stories. This one could, too. Members ratified the decision to close, but some still feel it was a mistake, that officials panicked or refused to consider alternatives, putting irreplaceable real estate on the market with whatever intrigue that produces.Geography aside, it’s not quite Gatsby’s world. But were he around to survey the pumped-up universe of fraud and collapse, the titanic hangover now playing out, from that big house across Manhasset Bay, he might look out to the water and give a wry smile.'"
"'09-02-12,'1','“It’s fantastic that an old dog was recognized,” said Jody Lomenzo, the owner of a public relations company in Richmond, Va. Stump is one year older than Chloe, Lomenzo’s bichon frisé. “It just shows that the feisty little guy still had the stuff it takes to be a winner.”Garrett Russo, 40, a professional dog trainer in the East Village, agreed. He was sitting in Tompkins Square Park on Wednesday petting Kasha, a 10-year-old Australian sheepdog mix. “It’s absolutely a victory for older dogs,” Russo said.Although most show dogs have careers that peak between the ages of 2 and 6, several breeders and owners said they had seen an increase in the number of dogs competing in the veterans’ class, a category reserved for dogs of more advanced years.The age minimum for the class varies by breed. The American Kennel Club does not keep statistics on the average age of dogs in their events, but Stump is not alone, according to Michael Canalizo, the director of event management for the A.K.C.“Over the last 10 years, more clubs are offering a competitive veterans’ class, and many dogs are winning from there,” he said.In 2000, Canalizo retired Ch. Tryst of Grandeur, a 9-year-old Afghan hound. The year before her retirement, she won 22 best of breed prizes. Elderly dogs even have a few advantages, Canalizo and others said, because they were seasoned competitors who were more likely to perform predictably.“It’s like the same patina you get from a very elegant mature person,” Canalizo said. “They have a certain posture and confidence that you only get with age.”To remain competitive in the autumn of their lives, dogs must have a shiny coat, all their teeth and be in sound physical shape. But gray hair is O.K., said Charlotte McGowan, a senior A.K.C. judge who has judged show dogs for 35 years.“I have gray hair and that’s fine,” McGowan said, adding that she always asked a dog’s age. Not too long ago, she gave a top award to a 10-year-old Siberian husky who, she said, looked like he was 3 years old.“I love to see dogs that get to be older dogs and they’re still active and happy and playful,” she said.A dog’s aging process can vary widely depending on its breed, and owners of Sussex spaniels said it was no coincidence that the oldest dog to win best in show was one of their own. Mary Anderson, a California breeder who owns seven Sussex spaniels, said the dogs did not fully mature until they were 8 or 9 years old. Dogs from the veterans’ class regularly won best of breed at Sussex spaniel shows, she said. “The older they get, the better they get,” Anderson said.The coats of Sussex spaniels typically lighten as they age — as happened in Stump’s case — but they do not turn gray. Stump also had all his teeth, Sommer said.Despite Stump’s tip-top condition, Sommer insisted he would keep his promise to return the dog to retirement in Houston. “He’s just going to lounge around and sleep in the bed with us,” he said.Stump showed some signs of slowing Wednesday. He and Sommer rose at 5 a.m. to tour the morning news shows, pausing for lunch at Metrazur restaurant to dine on tuna tartar and sliced steak.After receiving the affections of more than a dozen members of the Metropolitan Dog Club and fixing the crowd with his signature forlorn stare, he appeared to be relieved when Sommer tipped him over on his side to give the photographers a new paws-up angle.Stump fell asleep. Sommer eyed the table that was serving as a makeshift dog bed and said, “Now, if they could just put wheels on this thing, I could wheel him home.”'"

"'09-02-12,'1','The Iraqi National Museum, home to priceless artifacts that were plundered in the chaos after the United States-led invasion in 2003, will reopen this month, an Iraqi official said Wednesday, Reuters reported. The long-awaited reopening will mark a milestone in the government’s efforts to retrieve and preserve objects and archaeological sites from Iraq’s history after almost six years of theft, destruction and violence. Qahtan al-Jibouri, minister of state for tourism and antiquities, said the government had been renovating the museum in central Baghdad for several months and planned to open it to the public before the end of this month. The museum and other archaeological sites will be protected by a new Interior Ministry force called the “relics protection force,” Mr. Jibouri said.'"
"'09-02-12,'1','Mexico still has the edge, with 29 victories and 11 draws in 55 matches in the competition, which has become so intense that Frankie Hejduk, one of the American mainstays, compares it to an American football rivalry. Hejduk, who plays for the defending champion Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer, gets to feel that other rivalry up close.“This is just like the — can I say the word? The M word?” Hejduk said, joking on Tuesday, knowing that people in Ohio do not even like to utter the name of their rival from the neighboring state of Michigan.That game every November brings out the extreme partisan in this part of the world. Mexican fans found their way to Columbus on Wednesday, even though the American federation does its best to sell tickets only to American fans. Dozens of fans wearing green Mexican jerseys were walking around a generally desolate downtown.“If we play in L.A., you’ve got 25,000 Mexican fans,” Hejduk said Tuesday, noting that Mexican fans would find a way to attend any Mexico game in the southern tier of the United States.“You’re hearing cheers for the other team,” Hejduk, 34, said, repeating the wisdom that causes matches to be placed in heartland cities like Columbus or Birmingham, Ala., or Nashville.“Here, we’ve got the 12th man,” Hejduk said. He has been part of the national team going back to the 1998 debacle in France, the three humiliating losses in the World Cup.“We’ve had their number the last few times,” he said of Mexico, adding that it would be fine with him if the Mexicans did have a psychological disadvantage here, “if that’s what it takes.” But he added, “It’s a difficult game.”Hejduk heard that Mexican entrepreneurs were selling voodoo dolls back home, sponsored by an American company, Blockbuster, instructing fans to stick pins where they wished to inflict pain. “It tells me they’re passionate,” Hejduk said with a smile. “No pain yet. I’m going to get one of those dolls.”Hejduk, who has scored two of his six international goals against Mexico, was one of the best American players Wednesday, running hard from his right back position. The United States chose to play with the strong wind at its back in the first half but averted trouble in the third minute when Tim Howard made a kick save.The United States mostly controlled the ball after that, focusing on possession and short passes. Then Hejduk earned a corner kick with a hard run down the right side, tangling with a Mexican defender, both of them slamming into the advertising boards.DaMarcus Beasley, who was all over the field, swung a long, left-footed kick from the right corner that curled back to Landon Donovan, who headed the ball back across. Oguchi Onyewu headed it on goal, and Bradley slotted home the rebound for a 1-0 lead.Playing into the wind in the second half, the United States used its height to control the shorter kicks. Mexico did launch an attack of a different kind when the Mexico captain Rafael Márquez kicked Howard in the right thigh on his way down, and earned a red card in the 67th minute, putting the Mexicans down a player.The United States dominated, and then in extra time outworked the outmanned Mexicans, with Jozy Altidore and Donovan setting up Bradley’s second goal.The major negative for the United States was that Howard was hit with a yellow card for delay of game after being kicked by Márquez, and must now sit out the next match, in El Salvador on March 28. This meeting was the first in the final round of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. While both teams should be among the three nations from a six-team group guaranteed to qualify, every game between them is an event.The two rivals are expected to meet next in Azteca Stadium, on Aug. 28. There may not be February wind and rain, but it will be noisy, and the place will rumble.'"
"'09-02-12,'1','Q. I am trying to decide which type of broadband service to use. I see that a DSL provider offers “up to 7.1 Mbps,” while the cable company says it can do “up to 10 Mbps.” What do these numbers mean?A. The numbers refer to how fast you can download files over your Internet connection. Data transfer speeds are traditionally measured in bits per second. The “7.1 Mbps” figure means that the DSL provider says it can download a file to your computer at 7.1 megabits (or million bits) a second, and the cable company says it can move that file faster, at up to 10 megabits a second.Higher speeds save time when downloading large files like movies, music, large photos and other hefty chunks of data because you receive it all quicker — in theory. In reality, the actual data transfer rates will probably be much slower than advertised.Congestion on the Internet, the number of other people using the service at the same time, and even settings on your computer can affect how quickly your data actually moves.Be aware that what goes down does not usually go up as fast. Most broadband services have faster speeds for snagging files than for sending them. For example, a DSL provider may offer 7.1 megabits a second for downloads, but only 768 kilobits a second for uploading files.When shopping for a service, be sure to find out the speeds for both directions in the data transfer if you expect to be uploading large files on a regular basis.'"
"'09-02-12,'1','“It’s an upsetting, depressing, scary time, and to have someone to relate to and to vent with would be nice,” said Ms. Berry, who works for a children’s clothing company in New York and notes that the cost of meeting people the old-fashioned way — by going out a lot — is an expense she can no longer afford. “The money I do have, I want to save in case I get laid off,” she said.Speeddate.com was averaging about 80,000 virtual encounters a day in October; today traffic is up 60 percent, with an average of 130,000 daily encounters, said a founder, Dan Abelon.The $34.99-a-month fee to join Match.com’s for-profit site is apparently not deterring new members: the site’s North American membership grew 17 percent in December. Nor has a $50-a-month fee scared away people from Perfectmatch.com, which had a 30 percent increase in January.Of course, online dating has had a following ever since dating sites popped up around 1994, said Mark Brooks, editor of Online Personals Watch, an industry news blog. A few years later came sites like Friendfinder.com, Match.com and Matchmaker.com. Niche sites — that is, those catering to people with specific interests (say, Christian singles) soon proliferated; some promised more “scientific” results by bringing in relationship experts like the anthropologist Helen Fisher at Chemistry.com.During the last economic downturn, in 2001, Duane Dahl, the chief executive of Perfectmatch.com, noted that there was a spike in interest similar to what the industry is seeing now. For instance, he said, the strong third and fourth quarter results his company saw in 2008 were consistent with 2001 numbers. Mr. Brooks said the industry then started leveling off in February 2005. David Evans, an online dating consultant, noted that about 30 million people will log on this year to one of the estimated 1,500 online dating services nationwide.These days the sites seem to be attracting a more frugal crowd.“During recessions people stay at home more, they don’t want to pay and go to bars. They’re going online to meet each other,” said Markus Frind, the chief executive of Plentyoffish, a free site, where visits have increased 77 percent from December 2007 to December 2008, and 32 percent over the last three months.“Typically, we always see an increase in traffic in the beginning of a new year — part of a New Year’s resolution,” said Matt Tatham, a media analyst at Hitwise, an online measurement company. “People are looking for some change in their life. This year is different than in years past. Because of the economy there are a lot of people who are out of work and have free time and can spend more time online going to dating sites.”In the universe of online dating, the selection criteria for potential partners are showing initial signs of shifting as a result of the recession. While “marriage” and “children” were always popular key words, Mr. Frind said, during this period last year Plentyoffish.com users mentioned the word “job” in their profiles 5.5 percent of the time. This year, that number has risen to 7.7 percent.On Blackpeoplemeet.com, a site for black singles, the percentage of people listing “job” as a criterion when asked ‘What are you looking for in a partner?’ increased 18 percent from January 2008 to January 2009. (Other profiles are more direct: “Looking for a date for dinner, Dutch treat,” read one Match.com headline).MEANWHILE, offline romance specialists say they are also seeing a spike in business. Mary Jo Fay, who operates a seminar for 30- to 50-year-old singles in Denver, said her business has quadrupled over the last few months. In November, 12 people paid $10 for the two-hour event; this month, she has 60 people lined up, with a waiting list of 25.On Saturday, about 500 people attended the Rocky Mountain Singles Summit, a singles event in Denver, up from 400 a year ago. From October through December 2008, new membership at The Right One/Together Dating, a dating service with 60 locations across the country, increased about 18 percent compared with the same period the previous year. The price of membership starts at $1,000, said the company’s chief executive, Paul A. Falzone.“People are putting down deposits rather than paying in full, which is fine,” Mr. Falzone said.Indeed, many singles are guarding their wallets, but that doesn’t mean they are staying home.“Dinner and a movie has turned into the early-bird special at Denny’s and a DVD from the library,” said Tony Dudek, 55, a single technology entrepreneur in Denver. “Everyone is so emotionally and financially constrained that it’s made it a lot more difficult.”One single, Kevin A. Pemberton, a vice president with a money management company in New York, thinks the current economic climate is forcing men to re-evaluate what they want in a partner. He said he has noticed “humility” as far as dating goes, a “return to substance.”If the recession results in a desire for a relationship that is not based on one’s personal finances, then it may actually be a boon for love, said Dr. Paulette Kouffman Sherman, a psychologist in New York and author of “Dating From the Inside Out” (Atria Books, 2008). “There’s so many aspects of a person,” she said. “It’s kind of sick that we only focus on jobs or money.”That’s a view that Annie Edgerton, an actress in Manhattan, shares. She is currently taking her time to get to know prospective partners through e-mail and Facebook messages.“This whole thing has actually taken a lot of the pressure off to impress with money,” she said. “Now you can get to know a person for who they are, rather than what they do, because they might not do it anymore.”'"
"'09-02-12,'1','Dr. Brandman, a 60-year-old cardiologist who founded Medilinq in Houston in March 2004, described the company’s target customers as the working poor and the self-employed who are both uninsured and ineligible for Medicaid. They pay $24.95 a month for steep discounts on medical bills that the company has negotiated and that, he said, “are competitive with those offered by the Aetnas and the Cignas of the world.” Health care providers support his product, he said, because the company makes sure most bills are paid within 10 days, in contrast to the industry average of 75 days, and because it eliminates the paperwork that can eat up 25 percent of their revenue. “Medilinq is a sort of a Costco and PayPal mode for health care,” Dr. Brandman said.As the number of people without access to health care grows and as billing headaches become more acute, he added: “We’re looking at having a big year this year. Economic hard times are a good opportunity for us.”Mr. George, of Fidelis Security Systems, said that in the past, companies’ loss of digital assets like design documents and marketing plans was generally inadvertent, as the data slipped through holes in the computer system.But in a recession, he said, there is an increased chance that disgruntled or laid-off employees might purposely disseminate intellectual property to potential rivals.“The big threat to computer systems until now has been hackers from the outside,” he said. “Data leakage by insiders is the next big threat, and we can stop it in its tracks.”Fidelis’s orders jumped 99 percent last year, he said. In 2009, “our operating projection is to grow faster.” Fidelis also hopes to add to its work force in the second half of this year. It doubled last year to 50.Skeptics might suppose that the recession would temper Mr. George’s ambitions. But he says he joined the company last March just as it was completing $22 million in venture capital financing. The timing, he said, was fortuitous — or “plain dumb luck.” That nest egg should tide the company over for the next couple of years, eliminating the need to go out again with cup in hand when options for financing are limited, he said.A partnership with International Business Machines, which markets his products, helps as well, he said. But however slow the nation’s economic recovery might be, he said, he predicts substantial growth for Fidelis.There were 19 major data breaches in the United States in January alone, costing companies hundreds of millions of dollars, he said, and the market to protect against such breaches is expected to grow to $1.2 billion in 2011, from $500 million this year.“My ambition is to build this into a $50 million to $100 million company within three years,” he said.Mr. Burckmyer and Mr. Noll, both 32 years old and with entrepreneurial and sales backgrounds, set up Knob Hill Partners last summer and persuaded a dozen investors to provide them with a total of $500,000 in operating capital to look for promising businesses whose owners were interested in selling. They are searching especially for companies with strong growth potential and price tags of $10 million to $30 million in energy efficiency, specialty software or information technology. Once they locate a company, they said, their investors are prepared to contribute the funds for them to acquire it and manage it.With prices falling, the recession is a good time to be shopping for a business. But Mr. Burckmyer and Mr. Noll say they have a competitive advantage over others who are prowling the market with the intention of re-engineering a company and flipping it after two or three years.Typically, owners who have nurtured their ventures for decades “want to protect continuity,” Mr. Burckmyer said. “Their workers are like family to them.” Unlike the bargain hunters, he said, he and Mr. Noll promise to stay in their new management roles for the long haul and to avoid layoffs if possible.He cited inconclusive talks the two men held with the owner of an electronics equipment recycling company. “He wanted somebody who was committed to sticking around,” he said. “Once people understand what we’re doing, we get a better reception.”Knob Hill Partners is known as a “search fund.” Such funds have been around for a quarter-century, but because they have consistently produced double-digit returns, they are gaining popularity with wealthy people in this recession as an alternative to stocks, bonds, real estate and other traditional investments.Mr. Burckmyer and Mr. Noll closed their fund in December when they got enough funds to conduct their search. Once they find a company they want — and what their investors, who are savvy business people and their de facto consultants, also want — they will be able to go back to their investors and get the resources to quickly seal a deal.Nobody enjoys witnessing the pain that the recession is inflicting on ordinary people, Mr. Burckmyer said. Still, the troubled economy offers openings for entrepreneurs with sharp eyes and sharp elbows.“We’re now in what I humbly concede to be an enviable position of going out to find a business to buy as pricing multiples fall through the floor,” he said.'"
"'09-02-12,'1','WASHINGTON  The American military has not properly tracked tens of thousands of weapons the Pentagon bought and shipped to Afghan security forces, leaving the arms at risk of being stolen or sold to militants, according to a federal report that is to be presented at a House panel hearing on Thursday.American military officials failed to keep complete records on about 87,000 rifles, pistols, mortars and other weapons  about one-third of all light arms the United States sent to Afghan soldiers and police officers from December 2004 to June 2008, auditors from the Government Accountability Office found. Further, American military trainers kept no reliable records on 135,000 more weapons donated by 21 countries, including Hungary, Egypt, Slovenia and Romania.The report, which will be presented at a hearing of a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee, also found that Afghan security procedures were so inadequate that weapons supplied to Afghan forces were at “serious risk of theft or loss.” A copy of the report about the Afghan forces was provided to The New York Times by a Congressional official who sought to underscore the seriousness of the issue before the hearing.“It’s critical that we not have weapons bleeding out of the system into the hands of insurgents,” said Representative John F. Tierney, a Massachusetts Democrat who leads the House committee’s national security and foreign affairs subcommittee.The auditors documented only small numbers of weapons that had been stolen, sold, or pilfered by deserters or that were otherwise unaccounted for, but with the Afghan National Army scheduled to nearly double in size to more than 120,000 troops over the next five years and other efforts planned to expand police forces, security experts say that the potential for lost or stolen weapons falling into the hands of militants could significantly increase.In the rush to arm and equip allied forces, the Pentagon has stumbled before in putting safeguards in place to monitor weapons. The American military lost track of some 190,000 pistols and automatic rifles supplied by the United States to Iraq’s security forces in 2004 and 2005, government auditors determined.In the Afghanistan report, the auditors concluded that, until June 2008, the military did not even take the elementary step of recording the serial numbers of some 46,000 weapons the United States provided to the Afghans, making it impossible to track or identify any that might be in the wrong hands. Serial numbers for the 41,000 other weapons from the United States were recorded, but American military officials had no idea where those weapons were, the report found.Auditors found that American trainers were not following their own rules. The military is not supposed to issue weapons to Afghan forces until it ensures that they have safeguards in place to track and secure the arms. But the auditors found that weapons were issued to Afghans even when there were concerns about  or evidence of  poor security at weapons depots and corruption by Afghan officials.'"
"'09-02-12,'1','But he provided almost no specifics or figures on that or other matters, though he spent considerable time trying to bat down grim-sounding numbers thrown at him by worried senators of both parties.When Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, asked him about the estimate of some economists that United States banks might hold $2 trillion in bad assets — and asked Mr. Geithner whether he had not underestimated the problem — the Treasury secretary neither confirmed nor denied the number.Still, he assured committee members that the delays in providing a fuller picture did not mean a half-hearted approach. “We believe the policy response has to be comprehensive and forceful and that there is more risk and greater cost in being gradualist and tentative than there is in aggressive action.”He said the administration had learned from failed policy initiatives at the outset of the Great Depression, and during the early years of the Japanese recession of the 1990s, adding, “We believe that the action has to be sustained until recovery is firmly established.”More than one senator asked the Treasury chief about media estimates that the government had now taken on outlays, commitments or loan guarantees of a staggering $7.8 trillion. Mr. Geithner went to great pains to note that the ultimate cost would be far less.“I understand that,” said Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a crucial Republican on the panel. “And you’re saying, we don’t want to be tentative and we don’t want to be limited. But I don’t want to be reckless, overspending and unprincipled, either. And so there’s a tension here.”A central pillar of the plan that Mr. Geithner announced Tuesday would create one or more so-called bad banks to buy and hold banks’ bad assets, using a mix of taxpayer and private money. Few details on this were provided, and intense, behind-the-scenes talks on the best way to do this continued.The administration and the Fed are also proposing to expand a lending program that would spend as much as $1 trillion to make up for the even greater decline in the issuance of securities backed mainly by consumer loans. Banks would also be given new infusions of capital with which to lend. In exchange, they would have to cut the salaries and perks of their executives and sharply limit dividends and corporate acquisitions.But the initial reaction from the markets, lawmakers and economists was sharply negative. Some Wall Street experts said the plan relied too greatly on the same vague solutions proposed under the Bush administration. The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 4 percentage points Tuesday, though stocks were level through midday Wednesday.Asked late Tuesday about the initial reaction, President Obama told ABC News: “Wall Street, I think, is hoping for an easy out on this thing and there is no easy out. Essentially what you’ve got are a set of banks that have not been as transparent as we need to be in terms of what their books look like.”Mr. Obama, who has traveled this week to Indiana, Florida and Virginia to make his case for quick action on an $800 billion stimulus plan to a deeply worried public, said that he was constantly seeking the right balance in his comments on the crisis.“I’m constantly trying to thread the needle between sounding alarmist but also letting the American people know the circumstances that we’re in,” he said. “And the fact of the matter is, is that we are in not just an ordinary recession, we are in a perfect storm of financial problems.”'"
"'09-02-12,'1','They and others that have taken in billions of dollars in hard-earned taxpayer dollars are widely perceived not to be returning the favor to the nation. Some say they are curbing lending while continuing to dish out millions in executive pay. But they are also the giants of the banking world that lawmakers are counting on to haul the economy back onto its feet.This “dilemma,” as Mr. Frank described it, led some lawmakers to walk a finer line with the bankers than had been the case with the heads of the Big Three automakers, who have also sought billions in support to shore up their teetering industry.So, at the first hearing to call banking chiefs to account for how they have spent a collective $165 billion in taxpayer money, the pitchforks were tabled — for the most part.“You once lived behind a one-way mirror, unaccountable to the public at large,” said Representative Paul E. Kanjorksi, a Democrat from Pennsylvania. “When you took taxpayer money you moved into a fishbowl.”The love-hate relationship with Wall Street dates back to the days when the financial district was settled by the Dutch. But the 1930s holds the greatest echoes to today. Back then, lawmakers were looking for answers behind the 1929 stock market crash, and for years they hauled bankers into contentious hearings.The sessions led to a large-scale makeover of financial regulation and left the reputation of the industry scarred for decades.The issues are different this time, but the accusations are similar. Wall Street has been accused of letting greed blind its leaders to responsibility — and some of the chiefs acknowledged as much.Mr. Mack offered a full-throated mea culpa for the bank’s role in fueling the crisis (“We are sorry for it,” he said). Mr. Pandit, the head of Citigroup, pledged to cut his salary to $1 a year until the bank returned to profitability and took personal responsibility for the “mistake” of even thinking about buying a new $50 million private jet after getting government financing. “I get the new reality, and I will make sure Citi gets it as well,” he declared.Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman’s chief executive, acknowledged “public anger at our industry.” Mr. Lewis of Bank of America, who occasionally grew testy and red-faced at questions about lending, told lawmakers that his bank had “every incentive to lend.”But that was about where the contrition stopped.For the most part, the bankers focused the lawmakers’ attention on an armory of data and figures they hoped would show, contrary to public perception, that they had increased lending despite a worsening economy, and modified tens of thousands of mortgages for troubled homeowners since receiving injections of capital from the government last autumn.Until recently, none of the banks had disclosed any information on their use of taxpayer money, and they were not required to do so when it was given to them. But in recent weeks, reports of multibillion-dollar bonus pools for bank employees, Super Bowl parties and decked-out corporate jets fueled public outrage about what some view as the government’s largesse.One lawmaker from Florida, Alan Grayson, said he had received 500 e-mail messages from residents of his district in anticipation of the hearing. One woman suggested that Wall Street bonuses should be used to build new schools. Another said the chiefs of Wall Street should go to jail.The bankers said they could track the flow of government money through their companies and pledged that no taxpayer funds were being used for such luxuries.But no one questioned the chiefs on the bonuses they paid to their rank and file. The New York comptroller has estimated that the industry paid employees about $18 billion in bonuses.Instead, lawmakers mainly struck hard on the lending issue, describing situations in which their constituents could not get loans. Several asked the bankers why there seemed to be a disconnect between their lending figures and the hundreds of ordinary people who continue to line up for loans.Jamie Dimon, the chief of JPMorgan Chase, said that much of the perceived pullback in credit was in fact traceable to money pulled out of the financial system by nonbank sources like hedge funds and money market funds, a claim that some in the money market industry contest.Some lawmakers asked Citigroup and other banks with big credit card businesses why they had raised credit card rates in recent months, even as many of their customers were struggling to make ends meet in the tough economy. Mr. Pandit said Citigroup had not raised rates for two years, and only did so recently because its cost of financing had gone up.Other lawmakers homed in on the foreclosure crisis. Representative David Scott, a Democrat from Georgia, convinced the panelists to agree that they would not foreclose on any owner-occupied homes for three weeks to give regulators time to roll out their new plans.Much of the hearing was also focused on parsing how the financial situations of the banks vary. Some are still in desperate straits and others are turning a profit. But as lawmakers repeatedly stated, all of the chiefs and their banks will face greater scrutiny now that they are taxpayer-backed institutions.The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who nabbed one of the few public seats in the hearing room, put it simply: “They’ve never had to be accountable before,” he said.Louann Prosack, a retiree from Jessup, Md., said she traveled to Washington to understand why Wall Street workers were being paid so much, even as their companies foundered.“It’s coming out of other people’s pockets, the money,” Ms. Prosack said. “And they say they can’t live on their $150,000 salary. That’s more than I ever made in a year, and I managed.”'"
"'09-02-12,'1','WASHINGTON — The peanut processing company at the center of a salmonella outbreak did not await the results of contamination tests before shipping products to customers, Congressional investigators disclosed Wednesday.When the plant’s manager was told that one such test had shown that the products were tainted with salmonella bacteria, he responded by saying, “Uh-oh,” according to documents released by the House Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee.Michelle Pronto, an official at the laboratory that did the tests, told the investigators, “When I asked if he could get it back, he said it was on a truck heading to Utah.”The plant, in Blakely, Ga., owned by the Peanut Corporation of America, shipped contaminated peanut products to distributors who sold them to schools and nursing homes, and the products were included in crackers and cookies made by some of the largest food makers in the world.The disclosure came at a theatrical hearing of the investigations subcommittee that forced the company’s executives into the public eye. Subpoenaed to testify, Stewart Parnell, the president, and Sammy Lightsey, manager of the company’s Georgia plant, instead cited their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.Shortly after the two settled into their seats, Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, brandished a large jar wrapped in yellow crime-scene tape and filled with contaminated cookies and crackers and asked the executives, “Would either of you be willing to take the lid off and eat any of these products?”Clearly shaken, the men demurred and were dismissed a moment later. They swept out of the hearing room and were pursued by a group of photographers and reporters who shouted questions.Eight deaths and more than 550 illnesses have been associated with the outbreak. It has also led to one of the largest food recalls in the nation’s history — including some items that remained in the House Republican cloakroom until Tuesday night, said Representative Bart Stupak, the Michigan Democrat who is the subcommittee’s chairman.On Monday, the Peanut Corporation closed its plant in Plainview, Tex., after tests found salmonella contamination there, too.Federal investigators raided the Blakely plant on Monday as part of an investigation into whether the company had deliberately shipped contaminated products.Documents made public on Wednesday by the investigations subcommittee show that the company stopped using a private laboratory because too many tests done there had showed contamination.Mr. Parnell complained in an e-mail message to Mr. Lightsey that the positive salmonella tests were “costing us huge $$$$$ and causing obviously a huge lapse in time from the time we pick up peanuts until the time we can invoice.”Ms. Pronto, the official at the laboratory that did the tests, J. Leek Associates, said the Peanut Corporation eventually stopped using the lab because it found too much contamination in its samples, according to documents provided by the committee.“I called Mr. Lightsey to follow up on the recent discussion regarding the confirmed positive,” she told committee investigators, “and he confirmed that because of the high coliform results they were going to send samples to a different lab.”Even after the company was identified as the source of the outbreak, Mr. Parnell sent an e-mail message to officials at the Food and Drug Administration pleading with them to allow the company to continue doing business. He wrote that they “desperately at least need to turn the raw peanuts on our floor into money.”He said the peanuts would be processed by its plant in Texas, which former employees described in interviews with The New York Times as “disgusting.”Despite more than 12 tests in 2007 and 2008 that showed salmonella contamination in his company’s products, Mr. Parnell wrote an e-mail message to company employees on Jan. 12 saying, “We have never found any salmonella at all.”As a result of the peanut contamination — one of dozens of similar outbreaks over the past decade — influential members of Congress have pledged major changes in the nation’s food protection system. In opening statements on Wednesday, members of the investigations subcommittee said changes would come quickly.Peter Hurley, a police officer from Portland, Ore., came to the hearing with his wife and three young children, who squirmed throughout the long opening statements of committee members.Mr. Hurley described how his 3-year-old, Jacob, came down with diarrhea and vomiting in early January. To get him to eat something, Jacob’s mother continued to feed him his favorite food, Austin Toasty Crackers With Peanut Butter, “the very food that we later found was the cause of his poisoning,” Mr. Hurley said.Another witness, Jeff Almer, described how his mother, who had overcome cancer and other health problems, checked into a rehabilitation facility in Brainerd, Minn., to overcome a urinary tract infection. There she ate contaminated peanut butter and died.“Cancer couldn’t claim her, but peanut butter did,” Mr. Almer said. “She was let down in the worst possible way by the very government whose responsibility it is to protect its citizens.”Both Republican and Democratic members of the panel promised victims’ families that they would strengthen the nation’s food-safety net.“I’ll just make this commitment to you: We’re going to do this, and we’re going to do this in your loved ones’ memories,” said Representative Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado.'"
"'09-02-12,'1','The stock market fell more than 4.5 percent on Tuesday after Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner sketched out plans to inject more capital into banks, mitigate foreclosures and encourage hedge funds and private equity investors to buy up the distressed mortgage-related assets weighing down banks. Investors said Mr. Geithner’s approach was short on details and raised more questions than it answered.Among the most pressing concerns was how the government would value these hard-to-sell assets, and how it would entice private investors to buy them. Investors also worried that bank shares could be further diluted if the banks had to take on additional government investments.“The market doesn’t like uncertainty,” said Bill Schultz, chief investment officer at McQueen, Ball & Associates. “How do we get comfortable with the markets going forward if we’re seeing uncertainty from the government?”Underscoring the breadth of the global downturn, the government reported that the United States trade deficit narrowed to $39.9 billion in December as overall trade volume diminished. The total value of imported and exported goods and services in December was $308 billion, down 12 percent from December 2007.With the recession showing no signs of having reached a bottom and major banks shaky, analysts said the stock and bond markets were looking to Washington for guidance more than ever. Investors pushed share prices up in anticipation of Mr. Geithner’s announcement, and stocks plummeted when he failed to deliver a step-by-step road map to recovery.“Everybody’s just sort of sitting around, waiting for the meat on the bones” of the government plans, said Dan Greenhaus, an analyst in the equity strategy group at Miller Tabak & Company. “How long can you keep waiting on the sidelines until the government does something?”In credit markets, jitters about the banking rescue plan outweighed growing concerns about vast new government spending programs, and Treasury prices rose for a second day. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note was up 17/32, at 104 26/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.75 percent, down from 2.82 percent late Tuesday.The Mortgage Bankers Association reported that applications for home mortgages fell 25 percent last week, and that applications for refinancing fell 30 percent. Although the weekly survey is volatile, economists said the drop could reflect uncertainty about the housing market and the direction of mortgage rates.European markets closed slightly higher while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index closed down 2.5 percent.Following are the results of Wednesday’s Treasury auction of a record $21 billion in 10-year notes:'"

"'09-02-13,'0','Confronted with new cultural and legal restrictions after the Islamic Revolution in 1979, some young women turned to higher education as a way to get away from home, postpone marriage and earn social respect, advocates say. Religious women, who had refused to sit in classes with men, returned to universities after they were resegregated.Today, more than 60 percent of university students are women, compared with just over 30 percent in 1982, even though classes are no longer segregated.Even for those women for whom college is not an option, the Internet and satellite television have opened windows into the lives of women in the West. “Satellite has shown an alternative way of being,” said Syma Sayah, a feminist involved in social work in Tehran. “Women see that it is possible to be treated equally with men.”Another sign of changing attitudes is the increasing popularity of books, movies and documentaries that explore sex discrimination, rights advocates say.“Women do not have a proper status in society,” said Mahnaz Mohammadi, a filmmaker. “Films are supposed to be a mirror of reality, and we make films to change the status quo.”In a recent movie, “All Women Are Angels,” a comedy that was at the top of the box office for weeks, a judge rejects the divorce plea of a woman who walked out on her husband when she found him with another woman.Even men are taking up women’s issues and are critical of traditional marriage arrangements. Mehrdad Oskouei, another filmmaker, has won more than a dozen international awards for “The Other Side of Burka,” a documentary about women on the impoverished and traditional southern island of Qeshm who are committing suicide in increasing numbers because they have no other way out of their marriages.“How can divorce help a woman in southern parts of the country when she has to return after divorce to her father’s home who will make her even more miserable than her husband?” said Fatimeh Sadeghi, a former political science professor fired for her writing on women’s rights.Janet Afary, a professor of Middle East and women’s studies at Purdue University and the author of “Sexual Politics in Modern Iran,” says the country is moving inexorably toward a “sexual revolution.”“The laws have denied women many basic rights in marriage and divorce,” she wrote in the book. “But they have also contributed to numerous state initiatives promoting literacy, health and infrastructural improvements that benefited the urban and rural poor.”To separate the sexes, the state built schools and universities expressly for women, and improved basic transportation, enabling poor women to travel more easily to big cities, where they were exposed to more modern ideas.Ms. Afary says that mandatory premarital programs to teach about sex and birth control, instituted in 1993 to control population growth, helped women delay pregnancy and changed their views toward marriage. By the late 1990s, she says, young people were looking for psychological and social compatibility and mutual intimacy in marriage.Despite the gains they have made, women still face extraordinary obstacles. Girls can legally be forced into marriage at the age of 13. Men have the right to divorce their wives whenever they wish, and are granted custody of any children over the age of 7. Men can ban their wives from working outside the home, and can engage in polygamy.By law, women may inherit from their parents only half the shares of their brothers. Their court testimony is worth half that of a man. Although the state has taken steps to discourage stoning, it remains in the penal code as the punishment for women who commit adultery. A woman who refuses to cover her hair faces jail and up to 80 lashes.Women also face fierce resistance when they organize to change the law. The Campaign for One Million Signatures was founded in 2005, inspired by a movement in Morocco that led to a loosening of misogynist laws. The idea was to collect one million signatures for a petition calling on authorities to give women more equal footing in the laws on marriage, divorce, adultery and polygamy.But Iran’s government has come down hard on the group, charging many of its founders with trying to overthrow it; 47 members have been jailed so far, including 3 who were arrested late last month. Many still face charges, and six members are forbidden to leave the country. One member, Alieh Eghdamdoust, began a three-year jail sentence last month for participating in a women’s demonstration in 2006. The group’s Web site, www.we-change.org, has been blocked by the authorities 18 times.“We feel we achieved a great deal even though we are faced with security charges,” said Sussan Tahmasebi, one of the founding members of the campaign, who is now forbidden to leave Iran. “No one is accusing us of talking against Islam. No one is afraid to talk about more rights for women anymore. This is a big achievement.”Women’s advocates say that the differences between religious and secular women have narrowed and that both now chafe at the legal discrimination against women. Zahra Eshraghi, for example, the granddaughter of the revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, signed the One Million Signatures petition.“Many of these religious women changed throughout the years,” said Ms. Sayah, the feminist in Tehran. “They became educated, they traveled abroad and attended conferences on women’s rights, and they learned.”Because of the government’s campaign of suppression, the process of collecting signatures has slowed recently, and many women do not want to be seen in the presence of a campaigner, let alone sign a petition. Most feminist groups limit their canvassing now to the Internet.But while the million signatures campaign may have stalled, women have scored some notable successes. A group that calls itself Meydaan has earned international recognition for pressing the government to stop stonings.The group’s reporting on executions by stoning in 2002 on its Web site, www.meydaan.net — including a video of the execution of a prostitute — embarrassed the government and led the head of the judiciary to issue a motion urging judges to refrain from ordering stonings. (The stonings have continued anyway, but at a lower rate, because only Parliament has the power to ban them.)'"
"'09-02-13,'0','A federal judge in Texas dismissed on Thursday a large portion of a defamation lawsuit filed by Roger Clemens against his chief accuser and former trainer, Brian McNamee.In the ruling, United States District Judge Keith P. Ellison said that statements McNamee made to George J. Mitchell about Clemens’s alleged use of steroids and human growth hormone were privileged because they were made in connection with a federal investigation.In addition, Ellison ruled that the court did not have jurisdiction over the statements McNamee made to Mitchell or similar statements he made in an interview on Sports Illustrated’s Web site, SI.com, because they were not made in the Southern District of Texas, where the lawsuit was filed in January 2008.What remained of the lawsuit were Clemens’s accusations that McNamee defamed him when he told Andy Pettitte in 1999 or 2000 that Clemens used performance-enhancing drugs.McNamee has denied that that specific conversation took place and has claimed that Pettitte asked him around the same time why McNamee did not tell him about the drugs Clemens was supposedly using. In Pettitte’s testimony last year before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, he said that Clemens told him in 1999 or 2000 that he was using banned substances.“We are perfectly happy with the decision today and the small pieces that are left of the suit,” Richard Emery, a lawyer for McNamee, said in a telephone interview. “There is no conceivable damage to Clemens, even if his allegations were true. All this does is give us an opportunity to take Clemens’s deposition and potentially present more lies to the federal government.”'"
"'09-02-13,'0','The company’s announcement took no one by surprise. It had hired the investment bank Lazard and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis to help it try to restructure its debt as it dealt with a committee of bondholders over possible alternatives to bankruptcy.Last month, Charter said that it would forgo a $74 million interest payment on its bonds due Jan. 15, entering a 30-day grace period during which it tried to work out a pact with some of its creditors.That period was set to expire within days. Earlier this month, it hired Greg Doody, a lawyer who helped restructure the California utility Calpine, to help reorganize the company.In its announcement on Thursday, Charter said that it had an agreement in principle with its bondholders in which the company will raise about $3 billion through refinancing existing debt and getting new capital. In addition, two of its subsidiaries will pay off the $74 million that was due last month.The company plans to operate with about $800 million in cash on hand through the bankruptcy process, instead of taking out what is known as debtor-in-possession financing, a customary loan in bankruptcy but one largely unavailable to highly indebted companies like Charter. It also said that Mr. Allen would remain its largest voting investor.“We are pleased to have reached an agreement with such a significant portion of our bondholders on a long-term solution to improve our capital structure,” Neil Smit, Charter’s chief executive, said in a statement.“The interest and support provided by our stakeholders with their new capital investment underscores their confidence in Charter and our business.”Charter’s announcement did not mention any negotiations with its secured lenders. Over the years, the 16-year-old publicly held company, which operates in 27 states, had secured loans to finance various acquisitions at very favorable terms. With credit now much more expensive, these lenders would like to renegotiate the terms of their loans, people briefed on the matter said.“The spreads that Charter pays are well below what it would pay if it had to get a loan now,” Mr. Solomon said.While it has labored under an increasingly oppressive debt burden, Charter’s business remains viable, said Jake Newman, an analyst at CreditSights.The company said it expected to report earnings of $2.3 billion before interest, depreciation and amortization for 2008, 10 percent more than in 2007, even though it had a sharp drop in customer growth in the fourth quarter.“I think that management has done a pretty good job, given the constraints of leverage that they’ve got,” Mr. Newman said. “Operationally, there are things that the company could be doing better. But you could say that about a lot of companies.”'"
"'09-02-13,'0','LOS ANGELES — The producers of “American Idol” had hoped that a new focus this season on the personal stories of the contestants would stem a slide in ratings. But on Wednesday it was one of those personal stories that apparently spawned this season’s first big scandal on “Idol.”Hours after Joanna Pacitti, a 23-year-old Philadelphia native, was named one of the 36 semifinalists in the show’s eighth season on Wednesday’s broadcast, the producers of the series disqualified her from the competition and replaced her with another female performer who viewers had been told was eliminated.The producers would not give a reason for the disqualification, which followed a recent report in Star magazine that Ms. Pacitti had professional or personal relationships with two executives at 19 Entertainment, the company founded by Simon Fuller, one of the creators and an executive producer of “American Idol.”An “Editor’s Note” tacked on to the end of a news release issued shortly after the West Coast broadcast of “American Idol” on Wednesday said, in its entirety: “It has been determined that Joanna Pacitti is ineligible to continue in the competition. ‘American Idol’ contestant Felicia Barton has replaced Ms. Pacitti as part of the top 36.”Spokesmen for Fox, for 19 Entertainment and for Fremantle North America, which also produces the show, declined to comment further.Ms. Pacitti attracted attention almost from the beginning of this season because of her previous professional singing career. When Ms. Pacitti arrived to audition before the show’s judges last summer in Louisville, Ky., Kara DioGuardi, who joined the series as the fourth judge this year, said on camera that she recognized Ms. Pacitti and asked if she was the same person who previously had a recording contract with A&M Records.'"
"'09-02-13,'0','For years, R. Allen Stanford, a flamboyant Texas billionaire, richly rewarded the well-heeled clients of his private investment empire.But now federal authorities are investigating whether those rewards were simply too good to be true.Several federal agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the F.B.I. and the Internal Revenue Service, have spent “many months” looking into the business activities of the Stanford Financial Group, which is based in Houston, and Mr. Stanford’s bank based in Antigua, which issues high-yielding certificates of deposit, according to two individuals briefed on the investigations who were not authorized to speak publicly.The focus of the investigations appears to be how the bank could issue C.D.’s that pay interest rates that are more than twice the national average.A spokesman for Stanford Financial said the company had been told by the S.E.C. and by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a securities industry oversight group, that “their visits to our offices were part of a routine examination.”The spokesman said those visits occurred in January. Embarrassed by their delayed response to multiple opportunities to reveal the $50 billion Ponzi scheme that Bernard L. Madoff is suspected of orchestrating, regulators are turning up the heat on money-management firms that appear to be performing significantly better than their peers.This is not the first time Stanford’s business operations have raised eyebrows.Stanford, a diversified financial firm that offers a broad array of services, including investment banking and research, holds about $8 billion in deposits at its bank and has about $50 billion in assets in its wealth management affiliate, according to its spokesman.'"
"'09-02-13,'0','JERUSALEM — Just in time for Valentine’s Day, Israel allowed the export of a shipment of flowers from Hamas-run Gaza on Thursday for the first time in about a year, Israeli officials said.The flowers, destined for Europe, are hardly a token of affection between Israel and the Islamic rulers of the Palestinian enclave, but they could portend a possible thaw in commercial relations in the context of a cease-fire.The shipment of 25,000 carnations passed through the Kerem Shalom cargo terminal on the Israel-Gaza border at the Dutch government’s request, according to Maj. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry agency that handles Palestinian civilian affairs. They are scheduled to be flown from Ben-Gurion Airport on Friday.Gaza does not have a functioning airport or seaport, and it has no commercial crossing on its border with Egypt, so all exports have to pass through Israel.When asked about the potential for additional exports, Major Lerner said, “There are no further activities scheduled, but we will be reviewing the situation from time to time.”“Basically it is a Palestinian decision — whether they want to send flowers or rockets,” he said.'"
"'09-02-13,'0','The Post rule of a room for each guest isn’t practical in today’s world, where even fairly grand houses may have only four or five bedrooms. Ask guests who know each other whether they would mind sharing a bed or a room. Let others know in advance that they may be sleeping on an inflatable mattress or a sleeper-sofa. .Plan some activities, but be flexible. Guests will sometimes entertain themselves. One might want to putter in your garden; another might be intent on finishing a book. But you should have something in mind to fill most of the hours on Saturday. If your house is on the water, you might have a kayak rental company deliver enough boats to let everyone have a paddle. If your house is in or near a village center, you can suggest that some guests might want to poke around the shops.Volleyball and croquet are easy to set up, and almost anyone can play. Croquet has an advantage in that participants can drink while playing. Board games like Scrabble or Cranium might help if the weather turns bad. But whatever you have planned, abandon the plan if guests want to do something else.Be prepared to cook. Say your guests arrive Friday night; you should have something ready for them to eat upon arrival. Set up a buffet that you can replenish. And your guests will be looking to you for breakfast Saturday and Sunday mornings. There are few things better (or easier) than a spread of bagels, cream cheese, lox, whitefish and onions.If people decide to explore the village, you can say that they’re on their own for Saturday lunch. Most of your culinary efforts should focus on Saturday night’s dinner. If you’re not a good cook, you can still toss steaks onto the grill and put potatoes in the oven. Even if you are a good cook, you won’t want to spend most of the day in the kitchen. Perhaps the main dish can be something made in advance, or at least brought to the weekend house ready to slide into the oven. Even with sleeping arrangements and meal service that would appall Emily Post, your weekend party can be a success if hosts and guests follow her best advice. The host never appears inconvenienced by a guest, and a guest “shall show neither annoyance nor disappointment — no matter what happens.”'"
"'09-02-13,'0','The Dow Chemical Company said on Thursday that it would cut its quarterly dividend by 64 percent as it struggles with a decline in demand and a dispute over its refusal to close a takeover of its rival the Rohm & Haas Company.Dow said it would pay a dividend of 15 cents a share on April 30, compared with its previous dividend of 42 cents.The company has been cutting jobs and spending.Dow has been embroiled in a court battle with Rohm & Haas over a $15 billion acquisition.The company refused to close the takeover after a critical joint venture with Kuwaiti investors fell apart. Dow had intended to use proceeds from the transaction, a $17.4 billion plastics joint venture — to help finance its purchase of Rohm & Haas.According to Dow, completing the Rohm & Haas deal now would jeopardize both companies.Andrew N.

"'09-02-13,'0','The reinsurance giant Swiss Re said Thursday that its chief executive, Jacques Aigrain, was stepping down despite a recent vote of confidence — backed by a capital injection — from Warren E.

"'09-02-14,'0','HERE’S my magic bullet to save our tanking economy: Reverse Inheritance.Allow me to explain. Many Americans have children. Most of these children will one day command a decent salary. So let’s permit parents to pre-emptively tap into those future earnings in the form of loans payable now. These loans can then be spent on perms, basketball sneakers and American-made vehicles; and they’ll provide much-needed capital for small businesses like laundromats and hoagie shops.How would this work, exactly? Well, I have a 4-year-old. An expert from a federal Department of Reverse Inheritance Policy, or D.R.I.P., would subject my son to a series of physical and standardized tests and determine that there will be, say, a five-year period in my son’s adulthood when he’ll earn $100,000 a year.I, as the boy’s parent, would then be entitled to a Reverse Inheritance loan of $50,000 (or 10 percent of the earnings from the aforementioned five-year period). And my child will simply earn $10,000 less per year (plus interest) over that same period, which is thankfully much, much, much farther down the road. (If he has children by then, he’ll qualify for a Reverse Inheritance loan, of course, and his wallet won’t feel a thing.)For multi-child households, Reverse Inheritance could result in an immediate tidal wave of money — and that’s all we citizens need worry about.Other upsides? Reverse Inheritance loans will be taxed, so the government will receive sorely needed funds for new packages of stimuli. The program could also result in a New Deal level of job creation, with hundreds of thousands of census-type inspectors out in the field identifying whether our children will be future hedge fund titans or brilliant scientists, sluggish nonprofit grant writers or poorly paid chimney sweeps.Reverse Inheritance loans would initiate spending in every sector. Couples of every stripe will hurl cash at adoption agencies, fertility specialists and surrogates. Singles will spend money on dental work and tanning, as well as lessons in dance and etiquette, in order to get their piece of the pie. Parents will devote vast sums to stimulating their child’s earning potential with “Baby Einstein” DVDs and 64-packs of crayons — stimulating the economy in the process.'"

"'09-02-14,'0','As a young prosecutor in the early 1990s, Bobby DeLaughter was a hero to the civil rights community, a white Mississippian who gambled with his future by pursuing an old race crime that many in the state simply wanted to forget. Mr. DeLaughter’s doggedness in prosecuting the white supremacist Byron De La Beckwith was celebrated in a Hollywood film and in books, and he was regarded as a model of probity.This week though, Mr. DeLaughter, now a Mississippi judge, suffered an abrupt reversal of fortune: he appeared in leg irons and handcuffs in federal court in Oxford, Miss., pleading not guilty to a federal indictment accusing him of unduly favoring the celebrated former plaintiffs’ lawyer Richard Scruggs, now serving seven years for efforts to influence judges, including Mr. DeLaughter.Judge DeLaughter has been caught in a bribery scandal that has rocked the legal establishment in his home state, and brought low some of its leading figures. The millions that Mr. Scruggs gained in asbestos and tobacco litigation have sloshed over an impoverished state, continuing to taint public officials and lawyers, figures likely and unlikely. On Friday, a former Mississippi state auditor, Steve Patterson, was sentenced for his part in a Scruggs-inspired scheme, a day after Judge DeLaughter’s own court appearance.One of the unlikeliest figures is Judge DeLaughter, 15 years ago the belated avenger of one of the nation’s great 1960s civil rights martyrs, Medgar Evers. In 1994, against big odds and the passage of more than 30 years since the killing of Mr. Evers, the young assistant district attorney put together a solid case against Mr. Beckwith that resulted in the old Klansman’s conviction decades after the crime.Fueled by a sense that a gross injustice had occurred in the failure of two all-white juries to convict Mr. Beckwith in the 1960s, and overcoming the conventional prejudices of his own white working-class background, the undemonstrative Mr. DeLaughter pursued his prey stolidly. He had to contend with dead or missing witnesses and evidence, a sometimes-reluctant boss, and an unenthusiastic public, at least among whites in the state.But Mr. DeLaughter was undeterred, gaining the crucial trust of Mr. Evers’s widow, Myrlie, who eventually supplied him with a long-missing trial transcript from the 1960s, essential for prosecuting the case again. He was played by Alec Baldwin in the 1996 movie about the case, “Ghosts of Mississippi.”'"
"'09-02-14,'0','“These are decisions that are made with significant advance planning,” said Ronald L. Frasch, president and chief merchandising officer for Saks. He emphasized that he would not undo the decision even if he could.“A store like Saks needs to have the best product available,” Mr. Frasch said. “And I do think the man who wants to present himself in a certain way, he’s still out there.”In a recession, a luxury retailer like Saks must walk a razor’s edge between lowering operating costs to survive a slowdown in consumer spending and maintaining its status as a purveyor of elite brands.Figures suggest that many consumers are walking around in last year’s suits and dresses. Every major department store, high-end to low, is experiencing sales declines, with luxury stores struggling the most. Sales at Saks stores open at least a year, an important measure of retail health, fell 23.7 percent last month. And the company eliminated 1,100 jobs, or about 9 percent of its workers.Saks’s optimism about Kiton stems from sales of its fall collection, some of which Saks offered in New York for the first time in June. The company declined to provide exact sales figures but said sales of the brand exceeded expectations — which were high because they were set in spring 2008, well before retail Armageddon.“We had a very impressive first season with the collection,” said Tom Ott, senior vice president and general merchandise manager for men’s wear and home furnishings at Saks. “Which just shows that at the end of the day the customer is searching for value. And value isn’t just in the price.”Kiton — which employs 330 tailors who create its garments by hand — produces only a few thousand pieces a year. It takes 25 hours to make a jacket. Fans of Kiton clothes, and it is a devoted cult, say the garments are soft, light and exquisitely made. They are said to fit like a second skin.A suit jacket can supposedly be crushed into the crevice of an airline seat for a long flight, only to shed its wrinkles at the end.“You have to be over a certain income level to even consider” the Kiton line, said Simon Collins, dean of fashion at Parsons the New School for Design. “Once you put it on, you can’t go back.”Small, costly details of tailoring mark the brand. Unlike many suit jackets, Kiton’s have “surgeon’s cuffs,” or buttons that open at the wrist. Some customers keep a couple of them undone as a subtle status symbol. But Mr. Collins, who owns a Kiton jacket, described that as a gauche habit.“It’s a really ostentatious thing to do,” he said. “The tasteful thing to do is to have them and never open them.”Many of Saks’s employees have visited Kiton’s factories in Italy, enabling them to explain to clients why they are paying so much.Mr. Frasch said he expected the new shop to do well. But not even luxury retailers own crystal balls. “We are flying blind, and that could be said of any retailer in this industry right now,” he said.Apparel sales numbers from SpendingPulse, a report by MasterCard Advisors, and from other groups have shown that men’s clothing has been doing better than women’s — a trend that has been noted in past economic downturns as men began dressing more formally, perhaps out of fear for their jobs.Walter Loeb, president of Loeb Associates, a retail consultancy, said that while men’s clothing was typically the most optional item in a family budget, more men were donning suits and ties nowadays.“They want to give an image of neatness and being in command of the situation,” he said. “In this particular recession, where people are threatened just by the news of unemployment around them, they have to be careful how they behave and how they look.”The Kiton shop at Saks is not, however, a counterintuitive recession strategy but part of a broader men’s department facelift that has been going on for more than two years. Construction and manufacturing delays pushed back its opening. And while the timing may be inauspicious, Mr. Ott said Saks was investing in Kiton for the long term.“I think at Saks Fifth Avenue, we’ve been here through tough times before,” he said. Part of the luxury goods business, perhaps especially in hard times, is playing to customers’ fantasies.'"
"'09-02-14,'0','“I never felt I was ostracized for being Jewish,” he said. “I’ve had a pleasant life and steady growth.”He cares deeply for his country and believes that a more confident society that is asking more questions will be better able to hold the state to account.Turkey is a vibrant democracy in a region where few others are. It has come a long way since the 1940s, when its economy was largely centralized and there was just one political party. But an influential state establishment still wields tremendous power, and the military is still involved in politics, steering the country from behind the scenes.Mr. Alaton developed his taste for democracy in Sweden, where he worked as a welder in the early 1950s. He quickly fell in love with the Social Democrats, who preached workers’ rights and social equality, when they barely existed in Turkey.“Sweden was a revelation,” he said. “It opened my eyes. It opened my thoughts.”He was shocked at how well he was treated. The factory where he worked actually had an indoor swimming pool for the workers. He remembers calling his mother.“I told her, ‘I’m being treated like a king,’ ” he said.He also got some advice he never forgot from the father of a girlfriend at the time.“I know you will be successful,” he recalled the man saying. “But don’t let your money muzzle you or stop you from expressing your thoughts.”When he returned to Turkey in 1954, he found a business partner and slowly began to build his company, selling heating systems in Istanbul. He tried to recreate Sweden in his own factories. Walls were painted cheerful colors, and a big cafeteria was built for the workers.In the 1960s, secret police officers, hunting Communists, came to Mr. Alaton’s plant, acting on a tip from an informant. What raised suspicions? The walls were painted red. (“They were salmon!” he said.) Further suspicions arose around his practice of eating with the workers. In the end, they made no arrests.“They didn’t believe that a businessman was a Communist,” he said, laughing.HIS Jewishness did affect him, and in many ways was the reason that his beginnings were so humble. His father, a yarn importer, lost everything in 1942 when Turkey imposed the infamous Wealth Tax. While its stated aim was to fill state coffers during World War II, larger amounts were levied on non-Muslims, like Jews, Armenians and Greeks. It was widely seen as a racist attempt to diminish the economic power of minorities in Turkey.Many Jews had been in what is modern-day Turkey for longer than the ethnic groups of some of the officials enforcing such policies, having immigrated to the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century from Spain, where they had faced persecution.Burdened with the tax, the family lost their house, furniture and business. Mr. Alaton was 15 at the time, and remembers their being left with some mattresses and a few towels. Mr. Alaton’s father went to a labor camp in eastern Turkey to work off his remaining debt, and Mr. Alaton, as the oldest boy, was forced to drop out of school to support the family.He remembers the evening his father returned home from the camp, a bent, gray-haired man who, in the dimness of an apartment without power, he mistook for a beggar.“I looked at my sister — we didn’t know who this man was,” he recalled.His father never recovered. He had met Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey’s founder, and strongly believed in the project of the modern republic. When the state betrayed him, he was unable to move on. Mr. Alaton, as a young man, criticized him for it, something he now regrets.“I still have this weight on my conscience,” he said.It is tragedies like this that have caused the Jewish community, like other religious minorities in Turkey, to keep a low profile, staying out of politics and rarely speaking out. Mr. Alaton says he has tried to change that. “So we can prove we are useful to society,” he said.For example, when a rabbi was asked by a Turkish university to teach the Old Testament to Muslim theology students, community members balked, apparently worried that such exposure could bring harm. Mr. Alaton said it took him an entire year to persuade them to approve the request.“What are you afraid of?” he said, exasperated.EVENTUALLY they did give their approval, and a chair was established at the Marmara University Theology Faculty.As for worries that the current government is going to bring hard-line Islamic rule to Turkey, Mr. Alaton does not share them.“We are too open a society for that,” he said. “They are using this to create a new scarecrow. Our history has been full of scarecrows.”Turkey has been a democracy for years, and, unlike in Russia, which tried to erect the structures of democracy overnight after the Soviet Union’s collapse, cramming democracy down people’s throats in one painful gulp, the adjustment in Turkey has been much more gradual.“We’ve been able to digest our democratic values,” he said. “You should be very hopeful.”'"
"'09-02-14,'0','MOSCOW (Reuters) — The United States indicated a willingness on Friday to slow plans for a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe if Russia agreed to help stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons.Plans for the shield have contributed to a deterioration in the relationship between the United States and Russia over the past few years, but the administration of President Obama has said it wants to press the “reset button” and build better relations with Moscow.“If we are able to work together to dissuade Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapons capability, we would be able to moderate the pace of development of missile defenses in Europe,” a senior administration official said.It was the administration’s most explicit statement linking the missile shield to Russia’s willingness to help resolve the international standoff over what is believed to be Iran’s nuclear weapons program.The American official’s comments came as Under Secretary of State William J. Burns held talks in Moscow; he is the most senior American official to hold such talks since Mr. Obama took office last month.'"
"'09-02-14,'0','Even before the downturn, younger adults were not necessarily enthusiastic about riskier forms of investing, even though they are far from retirement. A joint study by the and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association noted that just 45 percent of households headed by people under 40 held 51 percent or more of their portfolios in stocks, mutual funds and other, similar last spring. That is less than what households headed by those 40 to 64 owned. Fifty percent of them invested more than half their money in equities.Data from Vanguard, however, suggests that its investors under 45 who use target-date mutual funds, which allocate assets among stocks and bonds for the investor, tend to have significantly more money in stocks than those who do not use these mutual funds. As more employers automatically sign up younger workers for plans and use fairly aggressive target-date funds as a default investment, those employees’ exposure to stocks will grow.So perhaps a better question to ask is not whether people in the first half of their working lives are becoming more risk-averse, but whether they should be.On Thursday night, Kevin Brosious, a in Allentown, Pa., polled the students in his financial management class at DeSales University on the percentage of their portfolios they would allocate to stocks right now. The majority would put less than half in stocks; among their reasons were fear of job loss, lack of accountability on Wall Street and economic fears amplified by the news media.The problem with their approach, according to Mr. Brosious, is that by investing conservatively they are probably guaranteeing themselves a smaller return and a more meager standard of living in retirement.Or, as Robert N. Siegmann, chief operating officer and senior adviser of the Financial Management Group in , wrote to me in an e-mail message, “Why would you consider taking less risk NOW after most of the risk has already been paid for in the market over the past 12 months?”If investing still seems too risky to you right now, you’re not alone. At , according to a spokesman, younger 401(k) participants are not making many big investment moves. But there is a sense that at least some younger investors may divert 401(k) contributions to other uses, especially as more companies reduce or suspend their 401(k) matches.In that case, one sensible way to reduce overall risk is to pay down high-interest debt, like or private student loans. That, at least, offers a guaranteed return, since every extra dollar you pay now keeps you from having to pay more interest later. Also, the sooner you rid yourself of debt payments, the less you would need in your monthly budget if you lost your job.“I think the only thing younger people should be more risk-averse about is the leverage they take on,” said Jeffrey G. Cribbs, president of Wealth Management in Oak Park, Ill. In particular, he suggested they buy real estate and cars at levels below what they can actually afford.So what kind of risk should you take on with the savings you have left over? To Moshe A. Milevsky, the author of “Are You a Stock or a Bond?,” risk should have less to do with the era in which you live and more to do with what you do for a living.If you are a tenured professor, a teacher, a firefighter or other government employee, you have better job security than most other people. Your income stream is stable, like a bond. Certain service providers, like plumbers and doctors, have similar security.Investment bankers and many technology and media workers, however, have more volatility in their career paths. A chart of their income might bounce around like one showing a stock’s price.“The idea is that we should focus on our human capital and invest in places where our human capital is not,” Mr. Milevsky said. “It’s not about risk tolerance or time horizon but about what you do for a living.”As a tenured professor, he invests entirely in equities. Other people with bondlike characteristics who are far from retirement could take similar risks, and withstand 2008-level losses, because their incomes are fairly stable. Those who have more stocklike careers, however, probably ought to invest a bit more conservatively, in both their retirement accounts and in their primary residences.For most young people, however, their biggest asset is not a 401(k) account or a home but the trajectory of their career and the value of 20 or 30 or 40 years of future earnings. It makes nearly everyone a millionaire on paper. So whether you are taking on too much risk right now or not, all of that money will provide many more chances to fix any mistakes you have already made.'"
"'09-02-14,'0','First of all, let’s give the guy a break.The new Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, has been in office for all of what, two weeks? He is charged with fixing the most terrifying financial crisis in nearly 80 years. He is under intense pressure to do something big  and fast. It is not his fault that the night before his big speech, President Obama raised expectations absurdly, more or less proclaiming during a news conference that his Treasury secretary had the problem solved. When Mr. Geithner unveiled outlines of his “Financial Stability Plan,” on Tuesday morning, it quickly became apparent that it was still a work in progress.Nor is it his fault that his high-pitched voice conveys uncertainty, even when he is trying to sound bold and determined, while his brow seems to be permanently furrowed. Watching him, you can’t help think: if he’s that worried, how scared should I be? (A little media training might help.)The stock market fell more than 4 percent on Tuesday, largely in reaction to his speech, but I can’t think of a less reliable barometer of whether Mr. Geithner’s ideas will work. “A few hundred points up or down in the market today or next week isn’t material to what’s at stake here,” said Daniel J. Arbess, who manages the Xerion hedge fund for Perella Weinberg Partners. “Government has to get it right this time because another false start risks triggering years of economic malaise.”Mr. Arbess added, “This is about recovery from a financial system disaster that was decades in the making. Everybody knows it is incredibly complex. It’s not going to be resolved in a matter of days or weeks.” Point well taken.Second of all, the reality is that nobody can say with any certainty what will work and what won’t. Nobody inside or outside the administration knows  not Tim Geithner, not Lawrence Summers, not Paul Volcker. It is difficult even to evaluate what has already taken place. Was the original $350 billion in bailout money wasted because bad assets were left on the books, where they continued to deteriorate, causing yet more losses? Or did the recapitalization stave off disaster, keeping the system from collapsing and buying time? I’ve heard both arguments.Truth is, solving a financial crisis amounts to a kind of sophisticated, high-stakes guessing game. Every proposed solution also has the potential to backfire. As the bank chieftains who testified before Congress said repeatedly on Wednesday  when they weren’t groveling, that is  reigniting the banking system has to start with re-establishing confidence.But confidence has as much to do with psychology as with shoring up balance sheets or dealing with bad assets. What will attract private investors? What will help banks trust each other again? What will make them feel secure enough to begin lending more? Nobody knows for sure. To his credit, Mr. Geithner acknowledged as much in his speech. He’s going to need to keep repeating it.Having said that  and acknowledging that I’m guessing, just like everyone else  I still can’t help thinking that Mr. Geithner is avoiding the most straightforward, obvious path out of the crisis.As I polled my Talking Business kitchen cabinet this week, gauging reaction to the Treasury secretary’s plan, I kept hearing the same refrain. “We’ve got to get on with it,” said Christopher Whalen, the veteran bank analyst who publishes Institutional Risk Analyst. “Just do it,” said Joshua Rosner, a managing director of the research firm Graham-Fisher.“When I talk to experts, after about two minutes they say, ‘we should just nationalize,’ ” said Simon Johnson, a banking expert (and blogger) at the Sloan School of Business at M.I.T. “That tells me that the consensus is moving in this direction, and we are all just afraid to say it.”Nationalization. I just said it. The roof didn’t cave in.Although Mr. Geithner’s plan has been criticized for lacking details, the Treasury Department has put out enough information to get a decent read on it. There will be lots more capital thrown at banks, a huge expansion of an important program to reignite the securitization markets, and the establishment of a “bad bank,” using both private and public money to begin finally taking toxic assets off the banks’ balance sheets.The part that really caught my eye, though, was the so-called stress test. According to Mr. Geithner, the federal government is going to send in an army of bank examiners to pore over the books of the big banks, to figure out how crippled they would be under various economic assumptions. That got me thinking about nationalization. Weeks ago, Daniel Alpert, a managing partner of Westwood Capital and a charter member of my kitchen cabinet, sent me a proposal for solving the bank crisis that began with a stress test.'"
"'09-02-14,'0','When Bobby Brown, snotty and kinetic and magnetic, left the megasuccessful R&B boy band New Edition for a solo career in 1986, it appeared as if it might have the effect of a puncture, slowly letting the air out of one of pop’s biggest phenomena. Mr. Brown was the wild card, but also the selling point.Eventually replacing him with Johnny Gill, a rigorous and ferocious young singer, however, turned out to be a masterstroke. Suddenly, New Edition was not only cool, but serious too.In the decades since, New Edition has tried various reunions, all short-lived, many marred by ill will. The iteration on display at the Nokia Theater on Thursday night — a splinter wing of its best singers dubbed the Heads of State, with Mr. Brown, Mr. Gill and the effortlessly tender Ralph Tresvant — was promising and well edited, a union of old-school showmen conceding little to the years gone by.Here again, Mr. Brown was the selling point — no other New Edition member has matched his solo success or his tabloid ubiquity — and he was again unpredictable. But not erratic: if anything, Mr. Brown shelved the wounded comic persona he has cultivated in recent years as a reality-television punching bag in favor of jovial camaraderie. The least expected element of this show was that Mr. Brown was happy being just one singer in a group of three.In an hour and a half the men worked through mostly abbreviated versions of more than 20 solo and group hits, with their dance moves at about 60 percent strength. As ever, Mr. Gill’s voice was an abrasion, all finely scratched burrs. Old age has given his vocals some of the liquidity of Luther Vandross’s, heard here on “Half Crazy,” but Mr. Gill is far more appealing as a growler. Near the end of the show, he dotted “Rub You the Right Way,” one of his signature songs, with vibrant, sharp-edged runs that turned it from seduction to aggression. (No “My, My, My,” though?)That was followed, of seeming necessity, by a cooling off with “Sensitivity,” the biggest hit from Mr. Tresvant, whose pillow-soft vocals have been the template for much of the pop-oriented R&B of the last few years. He was lithe on New Edition hits like “With You All the Way” and “Cool It Now,” and by the time he arrived at “Do What I Gotta Do,” his shirt was unbuttoned, revealing abs Alex Rodriguez might covet. One woman in the audience licked her finger and pressed it to her own chest, hissed seductively, then screamed, “Hot!”'"
"'09-02-14,'0','“Millionaire” remains a mainstay of daytime television, and its repeats are among the highest-rated shows on the cable channel GSN. The format has been licensed or optioned in more than 100 territories; the show recently went into production in Afghanistan. “The producers around the world are absolutely thrilled that the movie has come along,” said Paul Smith, an executive producer of “Slumdog.” “It’s drawing new attention to ‘Millionaire.’ It’s revitalizing it.”Mr. Smith, who helped pitch the original British version of the television show, which had its debut on the network ITV in 1998, is a prominent connection between the show and film. He has no stake in the small-screen version now; his production company, Celador Productions, sold its television interests two years ago. He said in an interview that he viewed “Millionaire” merely as the “linking device” for the film.Still, moviegoers may find themselves humming the “Millionaire” theme music as they leave the theater, and if they do, Mr. Davies won’t mind one bit.“Enough people have asked me, ‘Isn’t this great for “Millionaire”?’ that I know it’s been great for the overall brand in the U.S.,” he said.If “Millionaire” is on viewers’ minds more this year, it hasn’t been reflected yet in the ratings in the United States. The audience for the syndicated weekday series has declined 9 percent this year, mirroring broader declines for daytime shows.But “Millionaire” has fared better than other recent daytime game shows, including “Trivial Pursuit: America Plays,” which, after its first season in syndication, is not expected to be renewed. “Millionaire” also benefits from having long-term contracts with local stations. Ms. Vieira said she was engrossed by “Slumdog,” apart from her role on the television show, and said if it aroused new interest, “that would be terrific.”Ms. Vieira, who is also co-host of the “Today” show on NBC, typically tapes a full season of “Millionaire” — 200 episodes — between July and November, making for some long days. “When I think about it, I want to cry, but when I’m doing it, I love it,” she said in an interview on Thursday. “I always leave feeling energized.”Ms. Vieira’s “Millionaire” contract continues through the 2010-11 season. This year, Mr. Davies and Ms. Vieira said, the two have seen a change in the tenor of the game show’s contestants. “We’ve had more contestants in tears, emotional about winning the money,” Mr. Davies said. Ms. Vieira said more contestants had said they were appearing “because they really needed the money, for things like house payments, food, kids’ educations.”“If you wanted to trace the recession, I could have from that broadcast,” she added.Perhaps the quest for a million dollars would resonate in prime time as well, although a prime-time comeback faces several hurdles, including the question of whether Mr. Philbin would be able or willing to return as host. Mr. Davies said he was convinced that the show would be back on ABC someday. “I’ve never lost confidence in it,” he said.And the presence of “Slumdog” at the Academy Awards can only help, he said. “By the way,” he added, “I’ve got to think the ‘Survivor’ folks and the ‘Idol’ folks are thinking, ‘Movie, movie, movie.’ ”'"
"'09-02-14,'0','I can’t remember the first time I shot someone.It might have been when I first saved humanity from interstellar demons in the original Doom. Or it could have been when I took down a mothership full of alien slavers in the 1994 Mac classic Marathon. Maybe it was as I escaped from a Nazi prison castle and killed Hitler as the Polish-American soldier B. J. Blazkowicz in 1992’s Wolfenstein 3D.What I am sure of is that I have stared down a gun sight and blown away tens of thousands of bad guys since the first-person shooter became perhaps the most popular form in gaming about 15 years ago. In thinking about all those victims, the common thread is that within their various fictions almost all of them had it coming — they deserved it. Aliens, mutants, zombies, Nazis and criminals of all description have fallen to my bullets, blasts and laser rays without provoking a smidgen of guilt.That is by design. Moral clarity is taken for granted in most shooting games, because otherwise the psychological weight of killing hundreds or thousands of other humans (or humanlike beings) would make many games unbearable to play. Most gamers really don’t want the opportunity to zoom in with a virtual sniper rifle and start pulling headshots on innocent people.I have only recently come to one of the most popular shooters of recent months, Call of Duty: World at War, developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. As enjoyable and fun as World at War most certainly is, its most impressive element is how mindfully the game balances the requisite moral imperative with a frank and at times merciless acknowledgment of war’s brutality.World at War, which could take anywhere from 8 to 20 hours to complete in its single-player mode (depending on skill and difficulty level), returns the Call of Duty franchise to World War II after 2007’s Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, developed by Infinity Ward. The most evocative sequence in Call of Duty 4 brilliantly highlighted the impersonality of high-tech weapons by setting the player as a gunner in an AC-130 gunship firing down at the ghostly infrared images of fleeing enemies. Yet World at War does its predecessor one better with its unflinching renditions of close-quarters combat in the jungles and bunkers of the Pacific campaign, the ruins of Stalingrad and during the final Soviet push to the Reichstag in Berlin.'"
"'09-02-14,'0','Peacekeepers should be sent into the country and economic sanctions imposed, Dr. Des Forges said, concluding, “Can we do anything less in the face of genocide, no matter what name we give it?”After a Tutsi-led rebel group took power after ending the killings, Dr. Des Forges spent four years interviewing organizers and victims of the genocide. She testified before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, based in Arusha, Tanzania, and at trials in Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Canada. She also appeared on expert panels convened by the United Nations and what is now the African Union, as well as the French and Belgian legislatures and the United States Congress.The MacArthur Foundation recognized her work with a $375,000 “genius” grant in 1999. Her authoritative book, “Leave None to Tell the Story: Genocide in Rwanda,” was published that year.On its Web site, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum said Dr. Des Forges’ book provides “a meticulously detailed description of the organization of the campaign that killed some half million Tutsi,” adding that it “analyzes the failure of the international community to intervene in the genocide.”Mahmood Mamdani, a professor of government and anthropology at Columbia University and the author of the book “When Victims Become Killers: Colonialism, Nativism and Genocide in Rwanda” (2001), called Dr. Des Forges “the leading person who sought to document the events leading up to the Rwandan genocide, so that future generations would have the material on hand to draw the appropriate lessons from it.”In 2001, after a Belgian court sentenced four Rwandans, two of them Roman Catholic nuns, to long prison terms for their roles in the genocide, Dr. Des Forges said she had been deeply impressed by the proceedings — the first in which a jury of ordinary citizens was asked to sit in judgment of war crimes in another nation.“People maybe don’t even realize just how revolutionary this jury trial, so far from the events, really is,” she told The Times then. The Belgian trial, she said, “has been done with a great deal more depth than those in Rwanda.”Dr. Des Forges was also an authority on human rights violations in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire.While a central focus of her work was documenting the crimes of the Hutu-led government that organized the three-month-long genocide, Dr. Des Forges later leveled strong criticism of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the Tutsi-led rebel movement headed by Paul Kagame, now Rwanda’s president. His government has been in power since the genocide.Dr. Des Forges was among critics who accused the Kagame government of massacring thousands of Rwandan civilians in 1994, of killing civilians and refugees in the eastern Congo in 1996 and 1997, and of making repeated military interventions in the Congo. The government barred her from entering the country last year.Alison B. Liebhafsky was born Aug. 20, 1942, in Schenectady, N.Y., the daughter of Herman A. Liebhafsky, a chemist, and Sybil Small. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1964 and received a master’s degree in 1966 and a doctorate in 1972, both in history, from Yale.Her master’s thesis focused on the impact of European colonization on Rwanda’s social system, and her doctoral dissertation was about Yuhi Musinga, the mwami, or ruler, of Rwanda from 1896 to 1931, during which Germany, and later Belgium, colonized Rwanda.Dr. Des Forges is survived by her husband, Roger V. Des Forges, a historian of China who teaches at the State University of New York at Buffalo; a brother, Douglas Small Liebhafsky; a daughter, Jessie Des Forges; a son, Alexander; and three grandchildren.Theodore S. Dagne, an Africa analyst for the Congressional Research Service, worked with Dr. Des Forges in Africa and in Washington. On Friday, he recalled how she fought to save the life of a human-rights associate in Rwanda, Monique Mujawamariya.“On Day 1” of the genocide, Mr. Dagne said, “Alison was calling Monique hour after hour as they were going door to door killing people; Monique tells Alison they are close.”Ms. Mujawamariya managed to escape by crossing the border.“Day after day, for months,” Mr. Dagne said, “Alison lobbied everybody she could think of in Kigali and Washington and finally arranged for Monique to come to this country.”Ms. Mujawamariya now lives in Canada, he said.'"
"'09-02-14,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — Several big banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, are expanding efforts to halt home foreclosures while the Obama administration develops a plan to help struggling homeowners.The White House said President Obama would outline his plan to spend at least $50 billion to prevent foreclosures in a speech on Wednesday in Arizona, one of the states hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis.“It’s not intended to be measured by one day’s market scorekeeping, but instead to ensure that the 10,000 Americans each day that have their homes foreclosed on — and the millions more that are barely getting by — are protected,” the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said Friday.Treasury Secretary Timothy F.

"'09-02-14,'0','SEATTLE (AP) — Microsoft plans to open its own stores despite the economic downturn that has left many retailers struggling.The company said Thursday that it had hired David Porter, a 25-year veteran of Wal-Mart Stores, as its corporate vice president for retail stores. Mr. Porter was head of worldwide product distribution at DreamWorks Animation SKG since 2007.Mr. Porter, who is set to start work on Tuesday, is charged with improving the PC-buying experience. The company said his first task would be to set the timing, locations and design of Microsoft-branded retail stores, which will sell computers installed with Microsoft software as well as other company products.Microsoft has been working to revive the image of its ubiquitous Windows operating system, starting with a $300 million advertising campaign that began last fall. Vista, the most recent version of the software, was widely criticized for being slow, requiring new and more expensive hardware, and not working with devices like printers and scanners. Vista has also been the subject of a series of snide television ads from Apple.At the same time it introduced upbeat new TV ads last fall, some of which struck right back at Apple, Microsoft posted 144 of its own employees in electronics chain stores around the world to talk with shoppers about Windows.'"

"'09-02-15,'0','As with race, discrimination is discrimination.The writer is the author of a book about gays in the military and a senior research fellow at the Palm Center, University of California, Santa Barbara.Years ago I earned tuition money as a curb hop at a drive-in restaurant across the Potomac from Washington. After being served, customers ate in their cars — if, that is, they were white. Now, just decades later, a man who at that time would have had to exit the parking lot dines with his family in the White House.As an Army veteran, I am encouraged to think that at some point in the future another discriminatory policy, “don’t ask don’t tell,” will be long gone, and a man or woman who is gay could be named chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Miracles, in our still emerging democracy, do happen.As a student of American defense policy at Stanford, I support the return of R.O.T.C. programs to the nation’s elite universities. One of my best friends, a chemistry major, drives almost two hours each week to attend Naval R.O.T.C. classes in Berkeley because Stanford barred military instructors from its campus in 1969.As an openly gay college student, however, I take issue with Mr. Harbaugh’s suggestion that college students who oppose the military’s presence on their campuses are somehow ignorant for directing their criticisms of the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy at the armed services rather than at Congress.The fact that the military did not formally write the policy does not prevent active and former officers from calling for its repeal. A public repudiation of “don’t ask, don’t tell” by current service members would help universities welcome R.O.T.C. back to their campuses and show students what military service truly is: one of the nation’s highest callings.I recently finished a three-year tour as a R.O.T.C. instructor at the University of California, Berkeley, arguably (if more for its history) a more liberal campus set in implicitly antimilitary surroundings. The midshipmen of the R.O.T.C. unit are bright, service-oriented students who are great ambassadors of the military for their civilian peers.The military’s officer corps benefits from having graduates of elite universities who bring their educational and campus experiences to the job as they go on to lead diverse military personnel in different cultural settings worldwide. These officers may eventually be the “elites who shape our national policy,” with the military background to make informed decisions.Bringing R.O.T.C. to more Ivy League campuses would extend scholarship opportunities to qualified students who might not otherwise be able to afford an elite education. It is also an outstanding way to enable young people to answer President Obama’s call to engage in public service.The writer, a former Navy pilot, is a graduate of the Naval Academy.Kenneth Harbaugh’s Op-Ed article transported me to the fall of 1999 when Northwestern’s provost welcomed my R.O.T.C. class by insisting that the university valued its opportunity to shape America’s military.R.O.T.C. had survived Vietnam-era strife, ranging from the demand that the university turn its building into a child care center and rescind its academic credit to a damaging student break-in.I had reservations about joining — questioning whether military service would prove relevant to journalism — but decided to try the program for my first year.The military needs to frame its opportunities in terms that top-tier students value. Exotic travel and guaranteed jobs will not resonate. Instead, the military needs to appeal to their desire to pursue lives of lasting impact.I was struck by how few classmates knew that R.O.T.C. was on campus. We always had available spots, vacancies that could bridge the military-civilian divide while enriching the military and our universities.Just as we have a separation of church and state, we should also have a separation of the military from education. I do not include the military academies, whose function is to prepare officers for either active or reserve duty.Other educational institutions should concentrate on nonmilitary academics. Patriotism does not depend upon a military education, nor is service to mankind dependent upon having the R.O.T.C. on campus.'"
"'09-02-15,'0','The group is part of a new effort by the Children’s Hospital to protect young children from psychological damage that can be common in poor families.Experts say Montefiore’s new program is a rare example of mental health services for children under 5, a population that Evelyn Blanck, co-president of the New York Zero to Three Network, described as “under the radar screen.” Many pediatricians are not trained to recognize psychological problems, and surveys show that parents often complain about physicians’ lack of support for behavioral issues.“There is really a disconnect between the genuine needs and challenges that are facing our young children and their families and what doctors are providing,” said Dr. Dina Lieser, executive director of Docs for Tots, a nonprofit group that advocates for young children.The National Academy of Sciences released a report on Friday calling on federal, state and local governments to make prevention of mental, emotional and behavioral disorders in young people “a very high priority.” The report called the current emphasis on treatment once mental disorders emerge as “myopic,” and said that prevention means focusing on people with early symptoms and risks, such as maternal depression or poverty.At Montefiore’s pediatric practice, the Comprehensive Family Care Center, there is a psychologist on site, and doctors — who are trained to recognize depression in parents — screen each patient for mental health concerns. Of 2,400 children screened since 2005, 1,120 have been recommended for mental health services, and 780 have participated.The screening program currently costs the city $20,000 to $30,000 a year; therapy is generally covered by Medicaid. The Altman Foundation has covered the $150,000 yearly cost for a separate program, known as Healthy Steps, which since 2006 has screened 250 families at the family care center and provided individual and group counseling.In Healthy Steps at Montefiore, which is part of a national program, 20 percent of the mothers are teenagers, 27 percent grew up in foster care, 37 percent have parents with mental illness, and more than 10 percent were physically or sexually abused — all risk factors for their babies’ healthy mental and social development, according to Dr. Briggs. Research shows that environmental factors like poverty, homelessness, domestic violence and drugs can lead to depression, anxiety, aggression, poor academic performance, autistic behavior and social or developmental delays.“If a child is exposed to chronic or toxic stress, his reaction to stress gets turned on way too quickly,” Dr. Briggs said, citing one case in which the mother of a 2-year-old boy wondered whether it would be normal for his tantrums to have intensified after he witnessed the fatal shooting of his father on the street.According to doctors at Montefiore, a child enrolled in the Healthy Steps program is one-third as likely to score “at risk” for social or emotional developmental problems. Among mothers in the program, depression dropped from 30 percent at the first visit to 6 percent after two months, while 35 percent reported feeling unsupported at the first visit compared with 10 percent at two months.One recent morning at the hospital’s family care center, a half-dozen mothers sat in a circle as their babies and toddlers played with bubbles on a foldout mat. It seemed like a typical mommy-and-me group, with talk of breastfeeding and gassy babies. But in this group, which was run by a social worker, some of the problems preceded the births: Erika Hernandez, 30, said she had been abused by her stepfather and spent most of her pregnancy homeless; Amanda Agosto, 32, said she had been frequently abandoned by her mother, who she said has bipolar disorder and schizophrenia; others were single and poor.Though cost is often cited as a reason for not providing mental health services to children, Dr. Andrew D. Racine, director of general pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore, said the costs to society only rise if problems are ignored.“We are seeing the enormous payoffs when you intervene with a child at six or nine months,” said Dr. Racine. “But the ability to intervene or change the trajectory narrows as the kids get older. By the time you get to school-aged children, it already costs a lot more money, time and energy for less returns.”As an example, Dr. Briggs cited Emily Caraballo, 22, and her son, Hector, who before age 4, she said, had witnessed his father physically and verbally abuse his mother. Before an appointment last fall, Dr. Briggs was summoned by a security guard to the waiting room, where she found Ms. Caraballo “bleeding all over her face because her son has scratched her, and she has him pinned down on the floor so he doesn’t hurt anyone.”“Hector had never received a single ounce of help of any kind — he’s never even been in a school setting because he’s out of control,” Dr. Briggs said. “This is a kid who should have been seeing me since the time he was an infant and this would have been a different story.”Ms. Caraballo now lives in a domestic violence shelter, and her son is at one of the city’s two psychiatric hospitals that take children under 5. “They say to be a better parent, you need to be strict,” she said. “But Dr. Briggs took the time not only evaluate him, but to look at the circumstances that cause the situation. He developed a rapport with Dr. Briggs, he feels comfortable speaking about what he’s witnessed between me and his father.”'"
"'09-02-15,'0','Mr. Tompkins sold out of the apparel industry after concluding that he had been merely “manufacturing desires to get people to buy products they don’t really need.”Over the past 18 years, the couple has acquired more than two million acres for conservation in Chile and Argentina. The crown jewel is Pumalín Park, a vast nature sanctuary which they finally succeeded in giving to the Chilean government after debunking initial public suspicions that they were conspiring in a mysterious plot to undermine national security.Even more controversial and no less results-oriented are Kierán Suckling and Peter Galvin, co-founders of the Center for Biological Diversity, an activist group whose aggressive use of the 1973 Endangered Species Act has prompted other environmentalists to brand them as radicals.In the early 1990s, they won both fame and infamy by protecting the endangered Mexican spotted owl against the intrusion of lumbering interests in Arizona and New Mexico. (“We effectively ended the timber industry in the southwest,” Mr. Suckling boasts.)According to Mr. Humes, the center has won about 450 of some 500 lawsuits filed over the past 15 years, resulting in first-time protections for 350 endangered species and the preservation of 70 million acres of critical habitat.Another eco baron demonstrates what individuals of modest economic means can achieve on the environmental front through vision and persistence. Carole Allen, a widowed single mother who works at the juvenile probation department in Houston, rallied a group of local schoolchildren around the cause of saving the endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle.In so doing, she provoked the wrath of the 17,000-vessel shrimp trawling fleet in the Gulf of Mexico, whose drag nets routinely scooped up thousands of turtles every season.But thanks to the unrelenting efforts of Ms. Allen and her youthful cohorts, Texas officials ultimately agreed to enforce laws that require turtle exclusion devices on the shrimpers’ nets and a partial ban on shrimping within five miles of the coast.THEN there is Roxanne Quimby, who started out selling organic honey, candles and lip balm from the back of a Volkswagen minibus, and went on to help create the national cosmetics company Burt’s Bees. Having recently sold her stake in the company, Ms. Quimby has amassed a fortune of over $360 million, which she is using to create a 3.2 million acre public preserve in the Maine woods.Mr. Humes extols the accomplishments of Andrew Frank of the University of California at Davis, who invented and patented the plug-in hybrid, a vehicle that can run on a combination of gasoline and electrical power. Mr. Frank has since used off-the-shelf parts to turn a Ford Explorer into a vehicle with “the efficiency equivalent of a 100-mile-a-gallon motor scooter.”Mr. Humes also applauds the efforts of Terry Tamminen, a former Malibu pool cleaner, in formulating California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, one the nation’s most comprehensive environmental laws, and cheers the eco-conscious philanthropy of Ted Turner, who annually supports over 500 environmental organizations and plans to bequeath to conservation most of the 2 million acres of land he owns in the United States.The inherent flaw in “Eco Barons” is its sprawling scope. Although Mr. Humes is an able reporter and a passionate writer, he tries to cover too many ecological crises and praise too many people. At times, the book reads like a roster of nominees for the environmentalist hall of fame.But his urgent message is clear: We must all strive to become “eco barons” in our own right if we are to save Planet Earth.'"
"'09-02-15,'0','BEIRUT, Lebanon — The king of Saudi Arabia dismissed two powerful religious figures Saturday, as part of a government shuffle that appeared aimed at reforming the kingdom’s hard-line religious establishment.King Abdullah removed the chief of the feared religious police and a conservative cleric who declared last fall that it was permissible to kill the owners of television stations that broadcast immoral content, the Saudi Press Agency reported. Also, for the first time in the kingdom, he appointed a woman to serve as a deputy cabinet minister, choosing a respected technocrat who will preside over girls’ education.The changes are seen as an effort to moderate the power of hard-line clerics in Saudi Arabia’s religious establishment, which wields tremendous power but has come under strong criticism in recent years. The intolerance of the cane-wielding religious police, known as the mutawa, has become a special source of popular anger.King Abdullah has spoken often of the need for reform, but the changes announced Saturday are the first serious shake-up since he came to power in August 2005. The moves were not unexpected, but the timing was a surprise: the announcement had not been expected until late summer.The changes announced by the official news agency included a reconfiguration of the Grand Ulema Commission, an influential body of religious scholars from all branches of Sunni Islam. In the past, the commission had been dominated by clerics from the austere Hanbali school, but now moderates will be represented. There were also changes to the Saudi military establishment.“These are important changes, and they are pushing King Abdullah’s reform agenda in many different areas — religious, legal and military,” said Bernard Haykel, a professor of Middle East studies at Princeton University. The king replaced the head of the religious police, Sheik Ibrahim al-Ghaith, with a more moderate figure, Abdel Aziz bin Humain, the news agency reported.'"
"'09-02-15,'0','Investors’ wrath reached a boiling point last year, and some investors went to the courts to do something about it. In 2008, 210 class-action suits alleging securities fraud were filed in federal court, a 19 percent increase over the year before, according to data by Cornerstone Research and Stanford Law School. Nearly half of the firms sued were in the financial services sector.If these suits follow recent patterns, about 40 percent of them will end up being dismissed, with almost all the rest resulting in a settlement. Settlements tend to be for 2 percent to 5 percent of the total amount of the plaintiffs’ theoretical maximum claim, said Joseph Grundfest, a law professor at Stanford University and co-director of the Rock Center for Corporate Governance. But that may still mean total payouts in the billions of dollars.And because many firms being sued are receiving government bailout money, taxpayers may one day be on the hook for some of those settlement bills, Professor Grundfest said.'"
"'09-02-15,'0','Armstrong, whose career has also been blemished by doping allegations, said it was time to wipe those riders’ dark marks from the sport’s slate.“Do we make mistakes, all of us? Absolutely,” Armstrong said Thursday at the race’s kickoff news conference. “As a society, are we supposed to forgive and forget? Let them get back to their jobs? Absolutely.”Even so, there were some riders at the starting line for the prologue Saturday whose names are well known not only for their feats on a bike, but also for their transgressions off it.Landis’s name was in the news for more than two years after he rode one of the most brilliant stages in the Tour de France. On a particularly grueling mountain stage at the 2006 Tour, he took off on a solo breakaway and won the stage by about six minutes, setting him up for the victory. He left Paris with the yellow jersey.But it was not his to keep.Landis, now 33, spent about $2 million and two years unsuccessfully fighting his case. Along the way, he lost much more. His father-in-law committed suicide. His marriage crumbled.Landis missed Thursday’s news conference after he crashed in a training ride. Still, his competitors are wary of him. He won this race in 2006 to start a season that ended in disaster.“He is motivated,” the two-time defending race champion Levi Leipheimer said. “He’s got to be fresh. He’s a tough guy. It won’t affect him.”Basso, who won the 2006 Giro d’Italia, is another rider who could blossom after a suspension. In an interview Thursday, Basso, 31, said that he spent his suspension thinking about how his actions affected his fans and the public.“You feel bad because the people, everyone, are disappointed in you, but I hope the time can help to cancel those negative feelings,” he said. “I’m happy to be back, but it is a very hard moment for me.”Hamilton, 37, said he might not be in the best shape for this race, considering that he recently spent three weeks training indoors because of bad weather in Boston. He was there visiting his mother, who has breast cancer.Hamilton, whose marriage also did not survive the aftermath of his positive doping test, arrived at a prerace news conference in a dark jacket and collared shirt; most of the other riders wore sweat jackets. He had pulled his black Rock Racing team cap down low, nearly hiding his eyes.“I appreciate every day and every race,” said Hamilton, who is the 2008 United States professional road racing champion. “Who knows where I’ll be next year, maybe on the couch.”Andrew Messick, the president of A.E.G. Sports, which owns and operates the Tour of California, said there would be rigorous drug testing at this race. He said the event would “showcase clean racing for everyone in America.”The drug-testing plan here includes taking blood samples from each of the 136 riders and using those samples as part of the International Cycling Union’s biological passport program. That program compiles biological data on each athlete. The data are analyzed over time for any indications of doping.Urine samples will also be taken from 30 percent of the riders, according to a statement on the race’s Web site. Each day, the stage winner, the overall leader and several additional competitors will also be drug tested.“The assumption is that the playing field is level,” said Steve Johnson, the chief executive of USA Cycling, adding that the athletes returning from drug suspensions should be welcomed back.“It’s part of the sport,” he said. “What can you say?”But with half of the Rock Racing team here, which includes Hamilton, linked to the vast Spanish doping ring in 2006, questions of the sport’s credibility remain.And, as always, so does the question of Armstrong’s credibility. Despite his spectacular career, with seven consecutive victories in the Tour de France, and his seemingly untiring work to promote cancer awareness, he still must deal with the downside of his fame.At Thursday’s news conference, Armstrong jousted with a reporter from The Sunday Times of London. That reporter, the former professional cyclist Paul Kimmage, asked Armstrong why he admired “unrepentant dopers” like Landis, Basso and Hamilton.Armstrong, a cancer survivor, shot back. He remembered that Kimmage, an antidoping crusader, had called him “the cancer of the peloton” in a radio interview last year. Kimmage was referring to the doping allegations surrounding Armstrong.“You said, ‘Folks, the cancer has been in remission for four years, but our cancer has now returned,’ meaning me,” Armstrong said as he stared at Kimmage.“You are not worth the chair that you are sitting on with a statement like that,” he said.Armstrong went on to explain that he respected riders like Landis and Basso for standing up for their beliefs. He reminded the crowd that the men had not admitted to any wrongdoing.“Floyd does not believe that he is guilty, so to appease people like you and others, he can’t confess,” Armstrong said. “He doesn’t feel that he broke the rules. You can’t do that just to get people off your back.”The race will go on with some unanswered questions and, perhaps, some skepticism. But many riders in the peloton said they would not judge cyclists like Landis, Basso and Hamilton for their past problems.George Hincapie, 35, of the Columbia-Highroad team, said they had suffered enough.“They have lost a lot of time and maybe friends and have gone through a lot; they’ve paid their dues,” he said. “If they are doping again, a) they will probably get caught, and b) they are idiots.”Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, the gold medalist in the time trial at the Beijing Olympics, won Saturday’s 2.4-mile prologue in 4 minutes 32.90 seconds. Levi Leipheimer of the United States was second, 1.21 seconds behind. David Zabriskie of the United States was third, 2.65 behind Cancellara. Lance Armstrong was 10th in 4:37.17, Ivan Basso finished 66th in 4:49.10, Tyler Hamilton 71st in 4:49.80 and Floyd Landis 90th in 4:53.26.'"
"'09-02-15,'0','Treasury’s fuzziness, of course, also provides an opening for corporate lobbyists to step into the vacuum and bend the program to suit their needs. Taxpayers, on the other hand, don’t have lobbyists arguing on their behalf.Many of the questions arising from Mr. Geithner’s bailout haiku involve the matter of the so-called stress tests that he said the government would use to analyze the nation’s banks. The tests are to determine which banks have the best shot at survival and therefore merit taxpayer money. No sense throwing taxpayer funds at zombies.But Mr. Geithner did not detail what his stress tests would measure. “We want their balance sheets cleaner and stronger,” he said. “And we are going to help this process by providing a new program of capital support for those institutions which need it.”Any measurement of bank health would most likely require answering two questions: What is the equity that the bank has on hand and how much earnings power does the institution have to make it through the economic downturn?Measuring equity positions at banks today is easy, if unsettling. During the credit boom, banks used excessive amounts of debt to juice their returns. This was especially so at the largest institutions, and it has left many banks in a very deep hole now that they may not have the cash or the earnings power to pay down all that debt.Identifying banks that have the wherewithal to earn their way out of that hole is far more complex because it involves knowing where the economy will be in six months or a year. If you assume that we will emerge from the recession soon, the stress test might generate one result; a graver economic outlook would produce an entirely different projection of a bank’s potential for survival.Let’s consider a hypothetical stress test. Say a bank has $120 in assets of which $100 are loans. That means its tangible equity to assets is 1.2 percent — a very weak position. If those loans had to be marked down because the market was troubled, reducing their value to $85, the bank would have a negative equity-to-assets position (homeowners who have mortgages that are greater than the market value of their homes know exactly how this feels).Faced with that situation, anyone trying to determine whether a bank should be saved would then have to assess whether the firm has enough earnings mojo — or an ability to raise more money — in order to wait out the current economic malaise. The longer the malaise lasts, the more earnings potential or extra capital a bank would need to survive.Private investors are not going to be willing to put money into an institution whose business model is broken and whose profit power is limited. Investors in the stock market have already run their own stress tests on the banks and have found many of them lacking — hence the free fall in the share prices of many banks.On the bright side, lots of small banks that focused on good, old-fashioned lending are considerably better off than their big and formerly powerful brethren created in the merger mania of the last decade.So here’s a strong first step: the Treasury Department needs to hire out-of-work bankers to conduct what investors call a “burndown analysis” of banks’ financial positions. This is what private investors do as they go foraging for gems hidden amid the wreckage in the banking system.A burndown analysis, because it is a worst-case exercise, typically requires very pessimistic estimates for loan performance early on and higher-than-average loss estimates for loans in later years. A bank’s prospects also derive primarily from its deposits, not its loan book, in such an assessment. To reiterate: Any examination of a troubled financial institution needs to determine what its assets are truly worth, how much can it earn and how much capital it needs to operate at a profit.THERE is no silver bullet to end this crisis, and Mr. Geithner was correct when he said it was going to take time to work our way out of it.But it will also require transparent, rigorous analysis; candor with the public and investors; and a recognition that lots of debt heaped upon a pile of dubious assets has created a financial nightmare — it’s no more complicated than that.Worst of all, none of this had to happen. Regulators should have been more vigilant.'"
"'09-02-15,'0','JOHANNESBURG — Zimbabwe’s new prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, said Saturday that the arrest of one of his closest allies on treason charges on Friday was politically motivated by elements in President Robert Mugabe’s party “determined to undermine the spirit and credibility of the unity government.”The arrest of Roy Bennett, a white farmer who is treasurer of Mr. Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic Change and his nominee for deputy agriculture minister, soured what was to have been a day of pageantry and good will as ministers in the new coalition government were sworn in.Instead, Mr. Bennett’s incarceration at a jail in eastern Zimbabwe again suggests how difficult it will be for Mr. Mugabe’s party, ZANU-PF, which has ruled Zimbabwe for almost three decades, to work constructively with a political opposition that it has long derided as a pawn of the West and subjected to violent intimidation.Hours before Mr. Bennett’s arrest, Mr. Tsvangirai, who was himself acquitted of treason charges in 2004, told journalists that the world needed to stop thinking of Mr. Mugabe as the problem and to see instead that confidence was building in the power-sharing deal, under which he and Mr. Mugabe are to govern Zimbabwe together.In an interview on Saturday, Mr. Tsvangirai did not sound so cheerful. While careful not to criticize Mr. Mugabe, he suggested that some in ZANU-PF would like the deal to fail. His view echoed that of civic activists who worry that hard-liners in Mr. Mugabe’s repressive security services, perhaps fearful of prosecution for their human rights crimes, are trying to scuttle the deal.'"

"'09-02-15,'0','Donyale Werle’s tastefully abstract set stands for a barn and a troop ship, a battlefield and a meadow. But it would have read as static without Ben Stanton’s romantic lighting design — oh, that evening sky! — and Bart Fasbender’s finely tuned sound. These elements have to (and do) work in careful synchronization, and not just because the characters discuss how long after the lightning bolts they hear the thunder.Chris Miller’s music complements the other dreamlike elements. But because Mary spends most of the play in that nightgown and Charlie in an army uniform, the costume designer, Jenny Mannis, doesn’t get much of a chance to show off.“Mary’s Wedding,” which was first produced in 2002, travels hither and yon in time and space, disregarding the impossibility of certain juxtapositions. The sweethearts are sitting side by side, at home in Canada, when a letter from the future Charlie arrives from overseas. At another point, a pleasant tea party suddenly becomes Charlie’s first night on the front. But isn’t that the way dreams are?One of the loveliest ephemeral moments is in a scene that finds Charlie fighting in Europe but talking face to face with Mary, who appears to be standing a foot or so away on the battlefield. Then it begins to snow, but the snow falls only on Charlie’s side of the stage.Mr. Massicotte has said that he set out to write a war drama, not a romance, and his point of view on that subject is still in evidence. Charlie romanticizes war with childlike enthusiasm. When he is finally living his dream, being part of a cavalry charge, he writes Mary that “the sound of our harness” is “like sleigh bells.”The pacifists among us may want to ask: What is wrong with men like this? The obvious comparison is with Mary, who, as the story draws her picture, dreams only of looking beautiful on her wedding day. There we have two routes to the same goal: being admired.If you are inclined toward tears at the theater but hate to make a scene, here is a recommendation: When Mary begins her final speech or maybe even a little before that, stop listening to her specific (gut-wrenching) words and think about baseball. Or something. But do be sure to listen carefully and reflect deeply at the very end, when Charlie makes his most crucial and difficult promise to Mary: “You will never have this dream again.”'"
"'09-02-15,'0','“There is a projection of very little net gain,” he said. The tax had been scheduled to raise $115 million in January.Mr. O’Toole and other lawmakers briefed on preliminary reports of the January tax revenue numbers said they would also show a continued collapse of the state’s two largest taxes, the income tax and the sales tax. Specifically, they said sales tax collections were down 12 percent from collections a year earlier, and income tax collections declined about 15 percent from a year ago.State Treasury Department officials are planning to release a complete report and analysis of January tax revenues early this week, according to Tom Vincz, a spokesman for the Treasury Department.The revenue shortfall is the latest in a series of grim fiscal news.Last Tuesday, members of the State Transportation Trust Fund Authority, the panel that oversees a $1.6 billion annual program for highway and mass transit improvements, learned that the fund would not be able to support any new projects after this year, unless there is a sharp change in financial circumstances.“The 2011 program may not be able to support any new projects,” said Steve Hanson, the Trust Fund Authority’s executive director, referring to the 2011 budget year that begins July 1, 2010. “That part of the program is in jeopardy right now.”And later this week the State Investment Council is scheduled to meet to receive a monthly update on the status of New Jersey’s pension funds, which began the budget year underfinanced by $28 billion and lost about $17 billion during 2008.“The unprecedented global economic crisis has affected collections of virtually every revenue source, resulting in a $2.1 billion shortfall in the current year budget,” Mr. Vincz, the Treasury Department spokesman, said in a statement. “We will be updating our revenue collections through January and budget outlook for FY 09 early next week.”With the state budget year now seven months old, officials said the poor January returns will likely add at least $500 million to a current year budget deficit that was already projected at $2.1 billion. The projected gap for the new fiscal year, which begins July 1, is just over $5 billion.Gov. Jon S. Corzine is expected to outline his plan to grapple with the immediate fiscal problems shortly. He is due to unveil his budget for the new fiscal year on March 10. State officials hope to collect almost $700 million in federal support from the stimulus package to help close the gaps.Senator Barbara Buono, chairwoman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, said budget analysts told her the continued decline in sales-tax returns through last year’s Christmas season produced “the worst quarter in history for the sales tax.”“The governor and his cabinet are working as we speak to reconcile this increased shortfall with the cuts in our budget,” said Ms. Buono, a Democrat from Middlesex County. “Any glimmer of hope we were going to see a quick turnaround in this economic maelstrom is fading.”New Jersey is not alone in seeing its corporate tax revenues dry up as business earnings vanish and companies seek refunds from overpayments they made based on optimistic forecasts in earlier years. According to a recent report by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government’s Fiscal Studies Program, corporate income tax returns declined through last September at a double-digit rate nationwide, with “surging corporate tax refunds” contributing to the problem.In New Jersey, the corporate tax was scheduled to generate $2.6 billion when lawmakers adopted the budget for the year that ends June 30. Through December, the tax had returned only $1.2 billion, about $90 million behind projections, the state’s latest revenue report shows.Lucy Dadayan, a senior policy analyst for the Nelson Rockefeller Institute of Government, said that 27 of 37 states surveyed around the country faced a decline in corporate business taxes paid last year.In New York City, city officials refunded more than $800 million to companies that overpaid corporate business taxes last year.'"
"'09-02-15,'0','But even these secure methods are not completely foolproof.“It can be difficult to control a staff of tens of thousands,” Mr. Tyszka said, “so some communications can squeak outside the normal secure channels.”Larger banks usually use the more secure e-mail method, he said, while smaller community banks or credit unions may not want to pay for encryption systems. Many of them, though, will send loan documents through conventional mail or other services like U.P.S. or FedEx.The bigger problems, Mr. Tyszka said, come with smaller mortgage brokers who may communicate with borrowers via e-mail messages.“Frankly, they may not know any better,” he said, adding that unlike banks, brokers are not audited by federal regulators, so such practices may be more likely to go unnoticed.But George Hanzimanolis, the immediate past president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, argued that “consumers are actually safer using a broker than a big bank — with banks, hackers know exactly where to go.”He added that many smaller brokers use “loan origination systems” that help them transmit documents securely.Still, the president of a mortgage brokerage firm in the greater New York City area, who spoke on the condition of anonymity rather than disclose details about the data handling procedures of business partners, was not surprised by the findings in the Wolters Kluwer survey.The brokerage president, who has also served in board positions for state and national mortgage broker trade groups, said the mortgage industry’s troubles were partly to blame. “In their desperation,” the president said, “people may not be thinking about this stuff.”This executive provided a recent example: a well-established mortgage broker recently decided to shut down, but he wanted to find another broker to honor his loan commitments.He had no secure e-mail system to transmit 40 loan applications, so began sending them via e-mail to the brokerage president. After two files had arrived, the brokerage president alerted the sender to possible privacy implications.A similar problem, the mortgage company president said, involves the whereabouts of mortgage applications when a business shuts down.“How many companies are closing down,” the executive asked, “and how many loan originators are walking around with boxes of loan files in their cars, in their houses, on their laptops? Where did your file end up? In somebody’s family room?”'"
"'09-02-15,'0','PATHMARK in Port Chester and Whole Foods Market in White Plains were the worst offenders among food stores selling outdated items in an investigation this winter by Westchester’s Department of Consumer Protection, according to the department. They are among 21 large and small markets countywide fined a total of $59,600 for failing to pull expired items off their shelves, the department said in a report released on Monday.Pathmark had 271 outdated items on its shelves, and Whole Foods Market had 156, the report said. Only A.&P. in Armonk and Costco in New Rochelle had no outdated items. Another 12 stores had fewer than 10.Of 46 markets inspected from mid-December through the first week in February, county investigators said they found an average of 35 outdated items per store. The latest findings represent a 60 percent reduction from the average of 88 items per store found during a similar investigation in 2007, but an increase since a second survey six months ago, which showed an average of 30 outdated items per store.Expiration dates can mean one of three things: the date by which the product should be sold; by which it should be used; or by which it is best to be used. The county prohibits the sale of merchandise after that date.In most cases, the outdated food found was not spoiled, Gary S. Brown, director of the Consumer Protection Department, said in a phone interview after the release of the report. “After the expiration date, many foods lose nutritional value, although they don’t necessarily make you sick until well beyond the sale date,” Mr. Brown said.'"
"'09-02-15,'0','Over the summer, Mr. Johannesson expressed interest in buying the Saks department store chain. He cultivates a hip image, with long flowing hair and black clothes, and according to a recent profile in The Times of London, furnished his London office with a 10-foot statue of a Viking with a Fender Stratocaster guitar strapped to his back.But as the economy of tiny Iceland faltered, Mr. Johannesson’s empire began to crack. Earlier this month, Baugur Group’s British assets were placed under the control of an administrator, because of large unpaid debts to Icelandic banks.Two weeks ago, as the company came under pressure, Mr. Johannesson put the top two stories of his Manhattan penthouse on the market for $25 million. The listing agent, Tim Cass of the Corcoran Group, said that the 4,235-square-foot penthouse had been priced to be competitive with a slightly smaller penthouse built by Julian Schnabel, the artist, in a pink extension atop a building known as the Palazzo Chupi at 360 West 11th Street in the Village. That apartment was listed for $32 million in the spring, and after two changes in brokers and several price cuts, it is now available for $22 million.The Johannesson penthouse is one of seven listings in a building with only 20 apartments. This is an unusually large number of resales, especially for new construction introduced with great fanfare only a few years ago. Brokers said that the spurt in listings, including two full-floor apartments, probably reflected the weak economy, as well as a newly discovered aversion to ostentatious wealth on the part of some wealthy people during the downturn.A day before that penthouse went on the market, Frank A. Cassou listed his 18-foot-wide town house on East 78th Street between Madison and Park Avenues for $15 million, with Louise Beit of Sotheby’s International Realty.The town house has five freshly renovated stories, five fireplaces and 4,600 square feet of space.Mr. Cassou is the executive vice president, chief legal counsel and secretary of NextWave Wireless, a company with interests in advanced technology. It warned last summer that it might soon run out of money.The stock in NextWave has collapsed, from more than $7 a share in May to as little as 17 cents last week, leading to several shareholder lawsuits that named Mr. Cassou as a defendant along with other top executives. In December, Mr. Cassou sold 250,000 shares of his company stock for 8 cents a share, or a total of $20,000. In 2007 they were worth more than $2.5 million. Mr. Cassou did not respond to several telephone messages.Despite declines in the luxury market, the value of Manhattan real estate has so far held up better than many other investments. Mr. Cassou and his wife, Gabrielle could still end up with a considerable gain. They paid $5.45 million for the house in 2003.In October 2007, the couple bought a two-bedroom apartment at the Plaza Hotel for about $4.75 million. But last spring, as the NextWave situation deteriorated, they put it back on the market. It sold last August for just about what they had paid for it.'"
"'09-02-15,'0','The cost of keeping up may soon rise, if only slightly. As part of his proposed budget, Governor Paterson hopes to expand the state sales tax to apply to haircuts, as the city’s tax already does. It would add about 4 percent to the cost of a trim, and would come at a time when hairdressers say they are seeing some customers less frequently or are hearing fewer requests for pricier services like coloring.It would seem a worrisome development for stylists and salons. But at Marie Bové, which is near the middle of the pricing scale in the city, and where the average cut or color costs $150 to $200, haircutters said they were not too worried. Dino LaValle, a nine-year veteran of the Manhattan hairdressing scene who works at the salon, said that although any new cost would be a cause for concern, there were certain eternal truths.“People are vain,” he said. “They still want to look good. No matter what, their hair is going to grow, and if they like you, they’re going to come to you to cut it.”Lisa Greco, a manager of the salon, has seen signs of strain: Some unemployed customers arrive for their appointments armed with résumés for their hairdressers to pass along discreetly to better-connected clients. Marina Moldavsky, a stylist, said that some customers who pay $85 for a haircut were refugees from more expensive salons where they were paying $150. And they are less likely to arrive in a taxi. “I had a lady, she walked 20 blocks today,” she said.Sian Griffiths, a 26-year-old Englishwoman who had come for a quick appointment before boarding a flight to London, knows the financial crisis well; she was laid off from JPMorgan Chase & Company in November. People who are like her and her former co-workers, she said, make up the bulk of the customer base at a midrange salon like Marie Bové, she said. It seems inevitable, she said, that hairdressers, who depend on tips for a major part of their income, will begin to suffer as their clients in the financial industry get poorer.Then, sounding a bit like the Wall Streeter she was, she said, “I just think in an economic crisis, sales taxes are a really flawed way of generating revenue because sales taxes decrease spending.”Her blond hair bouncing as she spoke, Ms. Griffiths said she felt for the stylists.At the moment, though, the customers may not mind so much. Professor Snitow, for one, said that while running out of money would keep her away, an 8.625 percent tax would not.“I’ll put it this way,” she said. “I’ll save my money on hair when it doesn’t matter what women look like anymore. When the feminist revolution is entirely achieved, I’ll save money on hair.”'"

"'09-02-15,'0','Supermarkets and other retailers pay beverage distributors an amount equal to the deposits when they buy the beverages from them. The retailers then pass on that cost to consumers, like Mrs. DiMotta, who can get their deposits back when they bring the bottles back to a redeeming center.But every year, about $25 million in deposit money goes unclaimed, and the question of who gets to keep that money — and whether the bottle deposit program should be expanded — has emerged as a contentious political issue in Connecticut this legislative session as lawmakers wrestle with a huge state budget deficit. Bottle distributors had been keeping the money from unclaimed deposits, an arrangement they have lobbied hard to protect. But in November, faced with mounting budget woes, lawmakers ordered all unclaimed deposits put into an escrow account, and last month the legislators voted to seize that money for the state as of April 1.Now Gov. M. Jodi Rell has proposed expanding the 5-cent deposit requirement to include water bottles, which do not currently carry a deposit. An estimated 580 million water bottles are sold in Connecticut each year, and requiring a deposit on them could increase the state’s income from unclaimed deposits by about $13 million a year, according to he governor’s office. Republicans and Democrats say money from unredeemed bottle and can deposits, if water bottles are included, could bring the state total to $38 million a year.Mrs. Rell’s plan would also account for consumers who place their deposit containers directly in curbside recycling bins. Municipalities would then be able to sort out the redeemable bottles and cans and receive a share of the unclaimed deposit money to help cover recycling costs.Currently, cities and towns do not receive any money for deposit containers in their trash collections because there is no system for municipalities with curbside programs to sort out and get money for redeemable containers, according to Betty McLaughlin, executive director of the Container Recycling Institute, an environmental advocacy group.Other legislative proposals would put deposits on virtually all plastic or aluminum noncarbonated beverage containers or increase the deposit to 10 cents.Connecticut has debated for years about whether other recycling ideas would be more effective.The original sponsor of the state’s first “Bottle Bill,” former State Senator George L. Gunther of Stratford, now 89, said the measure was billed as an antilitter program. Mr. Gunther, known as Doc, remembers that it took eight years to gain approval.But throughout the years, opponents of the program said there was no need for the deposit system when many cities and towns began requiring residents to place those same bottles in recycling bins picked up by garbage workers — which means some consumers did not bother to take them to a redeeming center to collect the 5 cents.James A. Amann of Milford, who just retired as speaker of the State House of Representatives to explore a run for governor, was one of those opponents.During his years as speaker, Mr. Amann, a Democrat, often said his wife hated the idea of deposits on water bottles because they always recycled them anyway.But Ms. McLaughlin and other environmental advocates said deposit programs have been enormously successful. She said that in Michigan, the only state with a 10-cent deposit, 96 percent of the eligible containers are recycled.In Connecticut, consumers can take their empties back to a store or one of a handful of independent redemption centers to get their deposits back. Big supermarkets usually have a separate room with machines that accept bar-coded containers and give consumers a receipt, which they can cash inside.Beverage distributors pick up the returned bottles and cans, paying retailers handling fees of 1.5 cents for each beer container and 2 cents per soda can or bottle. The distributors then sell the recyclable materials.Until last month, distributors in Connecticut had been allowed to keep the deposit money from cans and bottles that consumers failed to redeem. Distributors said they needed the revenue from the unredeemed deposits to cover handling fees and the rising costs of collection and transportation of cans and bottles. They spent millions of dollars over the past 17 years successfully lobbying against state efforts to claim that money.“Our concern has always been primarily to recoup the costs of our administrative requirements,” said Jay F. Malcynsky, a lobbyist for the Pepsi Bottling Group.NEARLY everyone agrees that a major expansion of the deposit system is probable this year because of Connecticut’s continuing fiscal crisis — and a change in legislative leadership, with Mr. Amann, one of the main opponents of the deposit system, now gone from the Assembly.His successor as the highest-ranking House leader, Christopher G. Donovan, Democrat of Meriden, is far more supportive of expanding the deposit system. So is the Senate’s top Democrat, Donald E. Williams Jr. of Brooklyn.And the state is staring at a $1.1 billion deficit for the current fiscal year and even more frightening projected budget gaps over the next 24 months.But there are plenty of opponents to expanding the deposit program. Supermarket owners warn that extending deposits to cover water and other beverages could overwhelm stores, raising costs by forcing investment in larger recycling areas. They also warn that more containers would increase potential food contamination hazards.“Once you get beyond the current system, you’re really turning a supermarket into a garbage dump,” said Stan Sorkin, president of the Connecticut Food Association. He said the best solution would be to have curbside recycling for all types of containers, and bypass supermarkets and other retailers altogether.The largest producer of bottled water in the nation is Nestlé Waters North America, with headquarters in Greenwich. Brian J. Flaherty, director of public affairs, said Nestlé is now committed to achieving a 60 percent recycling rate for its containers by 2018.But Nestlé officials favor the proposal that would enable cities and towns to receive a share of the deposit revenue, Mr. Flaherty said. California has such a system, he said, which encourages towns and cities to set up their own curbside recycling.Other lawmakers are opposed to expanding the deposit to other beverages, like water, because it means consumers will spend more for such products upfront.State Representative Pamela Z. Sawyer, Republican of Bolton, said children’s sports teams in her small town always buy a 30-pack of bottled water to take to games. Another 5 cents a bottle would add $1.50 to their out-of-pocket costs.“To me, that’s a very significant change of public policy,” Ms. Sawyer said. “This is water we’re talking about here.”The co-chairman of the legislature’s Environment Committee, State Representative Richard Roy, Democrat of Milford, said the ultimate goal was to increase recycling to reduce the need to dispose of hundreds of millions of plastic containers.“We don’t feel bottle deposits and single-source recycling are competitive. We feel they’re complementary,” he said. “We want to use both programs to recycle as much as we can.”'"

The theater held an event in downtown Santa Cruz to publicize the crisis. The artistic director, Marco Barricelli, made a short speech, which was quickly uploaded to YouTube, and the theater’s appeal was forwarded around the world. In 10 days Shakespeare Santa Cruz raised $416,417 from more than 2,000 individual donors.The crisis at the Magic, which presented the first productions of Mr. Shepard’s “Buried Child” and “Fool for Love,” has had a long and complex gestation. Last spring when the trustees hired Ms. Greco, a nationally prominent freelance director, they hoped that she could re-energize the theater and reverse a decline in subscriptions that had taken place over the past several years. The previous artistic director, Chris Smith, had interpreted the Magic’s new-play mission to mean that every production should be a world premiere. Too frequently the board president, Missy Kirchner, said, the results weren’t audience ready. “Our subscribers weren’t thrilled with the work, and, frankly neither were we,” she said. Yet even as subscriptions declined, the budget almost doubled, to more than $2 million, and the debts mounted.Nevertheless the board approved a $2 million budget for Ms. Greco’s first season, which included a mix of world premieres, second productions and a recent Broadway play, Theresa Rebeck’s “Mauritius.”Then late last year, as the recession deepened and subscriptions came in $75,000 short of projections, the board took a closer look at the balance sheets and realized that the Magic was in trouble, Ms. Kirchner said. The theater had maxed out its $300,000 line of credit and had $300,000 in other debts.Ms. Greco was determined not to sacrifice her next production of the season, an autobiographical play (with a slightly racy title) about a black woman struggling with breast cancer. So she began the viral fund-raising campaign. The board had determined that if the theater could raise $350,000 — enough to pay the artists hired for the play as well as the Magic’s staff, who had been working without salary — the production could go ahead. The board contributed $170,000, which included $100,000 from Ms. Kirchner. Then Ms. Greco and her staff turned to their Facebook friends and e-mail lists.“We heard from people we hadn’t heard from since kindergarten,” she said. “There were actors who overnighted checks.” In 12 days, including the contributions from the board, the theater raised $455,000.The Magic’s future remains in doubt. Ms. Greco cut the 2008-9 budget to $1.65 million by moving the play in the season’s sixth slot, a world premiere by the “Six Feet Under” writer Craig Wright, to next fall. But although the theater now has some money in the bank, it has only just begun paying off its debts.“I’m cautiously optimistic,” Ms. Kirchner said. She is offering immediate payment to any creditors willing to accept 10 cents on the dollar, she said, and she is looking for help from individual donors and a corporation.Larry Eilenberg, who ran the Magic in the early 1990s and again from 1998 to 2003, said in an interview that, more than the economy, changes in the local and national theater scene have made the Magic’s mission of nurturing new playwrights hard to sustain. When the Magic was founded in 1967, and through the 1980s, new plays were primarily the province of small theaters, while the big regional companies were mostly devoted to classics and other revivals. In the 1990s, as the bigger theaters got into producing new plays, places like the Magic had a harder time competing for the best material.In his experience, Mr. Eilenberg said, the Magic’s two theaters of 160 seats each could not support a $2 million budget. Contributed income accounted for 65 percent of Magic’s projected budget this year; earned income only 35 percent. “That’s a disastrous formula,” Mr. Eilenberg said. “You aspire to 50-50.”He suggested that Ms. Greco would do well to see if the Magic could reconfigure its current space, perhaps to create one 99-seat theater and one 299-seat theater. Better yet, he said, she should look into real estate downtown or in a part of the city that is better served by public transportation. (Fort Mason, where the theater is now, has ample parking but is out of the way for young people and for tourists.)The most important thing, he said, is for Ms. Greco to think creatively about how to find new playwrights.“The theaters that are remembered are remembered not for their actors or directors but for their writers,” Mr. Eilenberg said. “The Magic is always going to be in the textbooks because of Sam Shepard and some others. They have to keep finding people like that.”'"

"'09-02-16,'0','SEOUL — North Korea suggested on Monday that it will press ahead with test-launching what its neighbors believe is a ballistic missile capable of reaching as far as Alaska.""One will come to know later what will be launched,"" the North’s state-run news agency, KCNA, said, commenting on recent news reports in the region that the isolated country has been readying its longest-range Taepodong-2 missile for a test launch from a base on its east coast.North Korea made the statement on the 67th birthday of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, who is widely praised at home for spearheading the country’s ""space development,"" a term the nation used when it tested a shorter-range Taepodong-1 missile in 1998.North Korea’s missile program has long unsettled neighbors because of the possibility that it might place nuclear warheads atop them.Increased activities at the North’s Musudan-ri missile base -- where North Korean engineers have reportedly been putting together a 32-meter-long Taepodong-2 missile for a test — came as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was on her way to Asia to start her first overseas visit since taking office.'"
"'09-02-16,'0','Family and friends of both men said they accepted the rigors of life on the road as the sacrifice they had to make in order to create the music they were passionate about.“Ever since Sept. 11, he said the travel has been harder on him,” said Bob Sneider, a jazz musician and a friend of Mr. Mellett’s who teaches at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y. “But music was his passion, and he loved to go and perform for people.” Mr. Niewood had also toured with Simon and Garfunkel and Liza Minnelli and had appeared on “Saturday Night Live.”He had known Mr. Mangione since they were grade-school classmates in Rochester, N.Y., said Adam Niewood, Mr. Niewood’s son, who is also a musician even though his father had encouraged him to do something that offered more financial security.“I marvel at the fact that my dad’s mother hardly went anywhere besides her hometown, and he set foot on almost every continent just by playing saxophone,” Adam Niewood, 31, said.“He’d say, ‘A lot of people have to save up all year to take one vacation; I go on vacation 10 months out of the year and I don’t have to pay, I get paid.’ ”Mr. Mellett grew up near Washington and studied music at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh before transferring to William Paterson University in Wayne, N.J., said his friend and former roommate Paul Wells, 35, who is also a jazz musician.Mr. Mellett was married to Jeanie Bryson, 50, a jazz singer and the daughter of Dizzy Gillespie, with whom he would often perform. They lived in a ranch-style house in East Brunswick, N.J., a lifestyle that Mr. Mellett found ideal, far from the famed jazz clubs of Manhattan. Though he occasionally taught lessons to supplement his income, Mr. Mellett earned a steady salary from being part of Mr. Mangione’s ensemble. At Mr. Niewood’s prompting, Mr. Mellett also worked with the Radio City Music Hall orchestra during the “Christmas Spectacular” show.“He loved his wife, he loved his home, he loved the town where they lived, and he loved the life they built up,” Mr. Wells said. “We both shared the common goal of being working New York City musicians. As we got older, we found it was more complicated than we thought when we were 20 years old.”'"
"'09-02-16,'0','Joe Goldstein, a New York sports publicist for nearly 60 years who promoted Madison Square Garden basketball, the New York City Marathon and, most famously, a trotting horse with a supposed addiction to artichokes, died Friday in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 81.The cause was a heart attack and a stroke, his son Adam said.Operating far from the world of public-relations aides who turned out slick corporate brochures, Mr. Goldstein relied on his contacts with reporters to promote his clients.“Goldstein operates out of his pockets,” Sports Illustrated wrote in a 1987 profile. “He scribbles notes on pink cards, then loses them.”Mr. Goldstein was best remembered for his promotional work in the years when New York had dozens of sportswriters on daily newspapers looking for angles he was happy to supply.In the spring of 1959, a story came out of France about a star trotter named Jamin who was said to love artichokes. Jamin was invited to take part in the first International Trot at Roosevelt Raceway on Long Island, where Mr. Goldstein was the public-relations director. But the trotter’s prospects were dire, or so Mr. Goldstein suggested, after 154 pounds of artichokes flown to Idlewild Airport from France were briefly confiscated by the Department of Agriculture, then went astray.'"
"'09-02-16,'0','The advocates came from 47 countries to participate in the project, called Musawah, the Arabic word for equality. They spent the weekend brainstorming and learning the best Islamic arguments to take back to their own societies as defenses against clerics who insist that women’s lives are dictated by men’s strict interpretations of Islam.“We are trying to develop a new language, offer it to the world and use it,” said Marwa Sharafeldin, an activist from Egypt.Ms. Anwar, the main organizer, said her group was almost alone when she started it 20 years ago, but now it is one of many. “It’s a movement whose time has come.”The repression comes not from the Koran, the women argue, but from the human interpretation of it, in the form of Islamic law, which has ossified over the centuries while their globalized lives have galloped ahead. So they are going back to the original text, arguing that its emphasis on justice makes the case for equality.“Feminist Islamic scholarship is trying to unearth the facts that were there,” Ms. Mir-Hosseini told a room of eager activists Sunday. “We can’t be afraid to look at legal tradition critically.”She referred to the work of Muslim intellectuals, like Nasr Abu Zayd of Egypt and Abdolkarim Soroush of Iran, reformers who argue that the Koran must be read in a historical context, and that laws derived from it can change with the times. Their ideas are controversial, and both are in exile in the West.Ms. Mir-Hosseini argues that Muslim societies are trapped in a battle between two visions of Islam: one legalistic and absolutist that emphasizes the past; the other pluralistic and more inclined toward democracy. She said that in Iran reformers were gaining ground, but that President Bush’s antagonism toward the country ended up strengthening hard-liners there.“It’s really a struggle between two world views,” she said, adding that time was on the side of the women.It was the rise of political Islam that brought the women together. As Malaysia’s progressive family laws began to be rolled back in the late 1980s, Ms. Anwar and several other women formed a Koran reading group.“There is an understanding that mullahs know best, that you cannot speak,” Ms. Anwar said. “Muslim women’s groups are coming out to challenge that authority.”Some scholars argued that the effort sounded unrealistic and would have no impact, mainly because it appeared to ignore more than a thousand years of Islamic legal scholarship and practice. Religious authorities are the only ones with the power to interpret laws, and circumventing that well-entrenched system would require replacing it altogether.“This kind of argument is being made at the margins of the Islamic world,” said Bernard Haykel, an expert on Islamic law at Princeton University. “It has shape and form, but no substantive content. There’s no real way of actually bringing about these changes.”But others made the case that change, though incremental, was happening at the grass-roots level in a number of Muslim societies. Isobel Coleman, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, who attended the conference, argues that women’s movements are making progress, as girls’ education levels increase and the Western world is a click away on satellite television. Women are even taking positions in religious institutions, she said: a woman has headed the Shariah College at Qatar University.“It’s a slow shift,” said Ms. Coleman, whose book on the topic, “Paradise Beneath Her Feet: Women and Reform in the Middle East,” is to be published by Random House in 2010. “It’s just beginning to come together as a movement.”There have been some successes. In Morocco, sweeping changes of family law in favor of women went into effect in 2004. Critics argued that it was possible only because the country’s king approved it, but Moroccan activists said it never would have happened if they had not spent years lobbying and formulating legal arguments, some of them based on Islamic tenets.That has had ripple effects. Elaheh Koolaee, a professor from the University of Tehran who formerly served in Iran’s Parliament, said that Iranian women had been watching the Moroccan example and that a Muslim success was an invaluable tool. “It’s important for us to show positive experiences from within Muslim societies that are not from the U.S. or Europe,” she said.Ms. Mir-Hosseini said she believed that change was coming, and that it was just a matter of when.“There’s so much tension and energy there now,” she said. “It will be a flood.”'"
"'09-02-16,'0','Meanwhile, the repatriation of its looted treasures has continued, most recently with three objects that ended up in Peru, including a letter written on a tablet.The returning holdings, though, appear to have overwhelmed the museum and its staff. The Culture Ministry’s statement said the museum had effectively become “a large warehouse” for unregistered items, adding that allowing the public to visit could jeopardize “priceless relics.” The ministry cited concerns about security around the perimeter of the museum, which is located in central Baghdad not far from the Green Zone.But officials of the Tourism Ministry, which is under the financial and administrative oversight of the Culture Ministry, remained unmoved.In a statement issued later on Sunday, Baha al-Mayahi, an adviser at the ministry, said he was surprised by Mr. Jabiri’s comments and reiterated that all efforts were being made to reopen next Monday. He said invitations had already been sent out to government and foreign officials.Reached in the evening, Mr. Jabiri was not backing down either, calling the reopening announcement an “illegal action” that was outside the Tourism Ministry’s authority.“We are going to use all legal means to close the doors of the museum to preserve our historical heritage,” Mr. Jabiri said, attributing the chaos to “parties that have no experience in government.”The discord underscores the conflicting aims of the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. It has called the reopening of the museum, along with the preservation of archaeological sites, a high priority. But hopes of reviving a cultural institution and tourism have been tempered by declining resources and the danger that is still palpable in Baghdad, despite a significant drop in violence in the past year.BAGHDAD — Two people were killed and 20 wounded Sunday when a bomb exploded in Sadr City, a poor Shiite neighborhood in northeastern Baghdad, the Interior Ministry said.The bomb had been placed between two blast walls. It detonated when traffic was passing, and most of the casualties were shoppers at a nearby market.Another bomb exploded in an adjacent neighborhood, wounding two people.In the northern city of Mosul, which has still been wracked by violence while much of the rest of Iraq has calmed, a civilian and an Iraqi soldier were killed in separate attacks.And in southern Iraq, an American soldier was killed by a bomb, the military said.'"

"'09-02-16,'0','The quick shift in the G-7’s stance toward China underscores how sharply policy positions are changing as the world economy continues to struggle.It is also further proof of the diminishing stature of the G-7. It has become clear that rapidly growing economies like China, India, Brazil and South Korea, which are part of the Group of 20 but not the G-7, will play defining roles in generating the purchasing power the global economy so desperately needs.The G-7 session this weekend was Mr. Geithner’s first official trip abroad as Treasury secretary. After the withering reception that his bank rescue plan received in Washington, he could be excused for seeing the event as a well-timed respite.Mr. Geithner, whose previous job was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has spent his academic and professional life studying and implementing international financial policy. So two days spent in Rome brainstorming with G-7 finance ministers about fixing the global economy played to his specialty.As one might expect in a gathering of diverse economies, there were differences of opinion.Amid signs that Europe’s worsening economic slump has created fissures among G-7 leaders about how to deal with the crisis, Mr. Geithner fielded questions from his peers about provisions viewed as protectionist in the Obama administration’s stimulus plan. Ministers said the plan lacked detail and expressed worry over the debt needed to pay for it.Few if any concrete measures were proposed to address the world slump, though the group’s final statement did point to increased steps to inject liquidity and strengthen bank balance sheets.“There are no quick fixes,” said Alistair Darling, the British chancellor of the Exchequer.Mr. Geithner’s trip to Rome — like many of his experiences since his protracted confirmation process — was a whirlwind, crammed tight with meetings, dinners and, when he could squeeze it in, a trip to the gym.On paper, there has never been a Treasury secretary more qualified to be America’s lead spokesman on international financial affairs. Mr. Geithner, unlike virtually all of his predecessors, has an orientation — personal, academic and professional — that is rooted outside his native country’s borders.At one dinner, Mr. Geithner, a veteran of international talks, gave an emotional speech outlining his respect for the consultative process.“It was very heartfelt,” said a Treasury official, who added that Mr. Geithner relied on notes he had taken minutes before speaking instead of his prepared presentation. “You could tell it was a homecoming.”But when it came to underlining the importance of a coordinated approach to stimulating economies, Mr. Geithner was all business. And while most leaders agreed on the need to bolster government spending, the question of how to finance it remained a contentious one here as well as in the United States.Last week Giulio Tremonti, the Italian finance minister and Mr. Geithner’s host for the weekend, reviewed the United States administration’s stimulus in a Milan newspaper.“If the problem is an excess of debt, the cure is not adding more debt, whether that debt is public or private,” he wrote in the newspaper, Corriere della Sera, referring to this approach as the “American way.”Italy is one of the most indebted countries in Europe, with a debt that surpasses its annual gross domestic product.The national debt of the United States, by contrast, was about 40 percent of G.D.P. at the end of 2008, but Moody’s Investor Service said it expected that to rise to 60 percent by 2010 because of the recession and spending tied to the government’s bailout and stimulus programs.There was also much discussion about the “Buy America” provision in the stimulus plan passed by Congress on Friday, which covers iron, steel and manufactured goods. The president of the World Bank, Robert B. Zoellick, said he had emphasized in meetings with ministers how crucial it was to keep the world economy open and to not repeat the protectionist policy errors of the 1930s.“The ‘Buy American’ provision is very dangerous,” he said.Mr. Geithner was careful to take on both issues at his closing news conference, where he emphasized the administration’s commitment to open markets while also taking up America’s growing debt burden.“We need to show the world that we can bring our resources and expenditures back into balance,” he said. “That is crucially important.”Hit with a barrage of questions regarding his bank plan, he effectively said stay tuned.“We are going to move quickly to lay out a broad design,” he said. “But we also want to makes sure that they work.”And amid the camera flashes and aggressive questioning, the Treasury secretary seemed to have found a comfort level that was lacking during his earlier public appearance in Washington, where he announced his bank plan but took no questions. His voice had a deeper quality and his smile was more self-assured.When there were no more questions at his Saturday news conference, he waited several beats before exiting with a quick wave and headed for the plane waiting to take him and his team back to Washington.'"
"'09-02-16,'0','The concerts in Beijing took place on Friday and Saturday nights at the National Center for the Performing Arts, better known as the Egg, the controversial half-oval glass marvel designed by French architect Paul Andreu and built off Tiananmen Square. It was the same building in which the New York Philharmonic played last year before going to North Korea.Mr. Haitink said on Friday afternoon that the jet lag was severe, but that China had not failed to make an impression.“I’m just overwhelmed,” he said at a news conference, held inside the Egg. Arriving in Shanghai, he said, “I had a feeling that I was on a different planet.”Mr. Haitink visited the Shanghai Museum, which holds a trove of ancient artifacts. Here in Beijing he listened on Thursday night to two Chinese musicians perform on the erhu and guzheng, traditional string instruments.“I got a slight opening of insight into your enormous culture, and I think it’s very precious and very impressive,” he said, addressing Chinese journalists. “When I saw those girls playing with such poise, such cultural security, I thought, ‘Well, we could learn from them.’ ”The Beijing performances were the final stops on a 10-concert tour of Asia that also included Yokohama and Tokyo in Japan, and Hong Kong. The $3 million cost of the Asia tour was recouped through corporate sponsorships as well as fees and ticket sales. The orchestra left Chicago on Jan. 26 in two airplanes, one carrying 118 musicians and 62 staff members and patrons; the other, 20 tons of cargo.The tour on mainland China got off to an auspicious start. During a news conference before the first concert in Shanghai, Mr. Haitink and other musicians learned that two recordings on the orchestra’s in-house record label, CSO Resound, had each won a Grammy.Mr. Chang, the violist, said the Shanghai concerts had been attended by his former teachers, schoolmates and colleagues. His 97-year-old mother had planned to attend, but she was injured in a fall just days earlier. Still, he said, “it was a historic homecoming for me.”In Beijing the orchestra performed in one of the Egg’s smaller halls, giving the concerts an intimate feel. The tickets, considered very expensive by Chinese standards, sold out days in advance. Chen Zuohuang, the Egg’s artistic director, said important Chinese figures had lobbied for tickets, but there were no extras to give out.“These two days we can feel the holiday atmosphere among all the music fans in China and Beijing, because finally we have the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Mr. Haitink making their debut in Beijing,” he said. “We’ve been waiting for this moment for too long.”Hours before the Friday concert Mr. Chang said that performing in the Egg was “an unknown for us.”“We’re all in awe of the vastness,” he said. “Today was the first time I walked in here.”The crowd at the final concert, on Saturday, was enthusiastic, but respectfully quiet. Listeners had braved a sudden cold snap in Beijing, an onrush of biting wind from Siberia, to attend the performance. A hush of anticipation settled over the hall as Mr. Haitink strode onto the golden wood panels of the stage at 7:30 p.m. The orchestra ran through the playful notes of Haydn’s Symphony No. 101.After a 15-minute intermission the orchestra took up the longer, louder, more cinematic piece of the evening, Bruckner’s Symphony No. 7. Some audience members leaned forward in their seats. A few snapped quick photographs with their cellphones, even though cameras were officially banned from the concert.When the final note faded to silence, one listener immediately yelled, “Bravo!”Mr. Haitink returned to the stage five times as virtually every member of the audience continued to clap.“We think this is a beautiful concert,” said Li Xianjin, 45, standing in the lower balcony with his wife and son. “This is our first time hearing music in the Egg.”His wife, Xu Hongyan, nodded. “The Chicago orchestra is very famous,” she said. “It’s their first time in China. It’s the best orchestra, and this is the best place to hear music in all of China.”Then they walked out, carrying some of the night’s warmth into the Siberian wind.'"
"'09-02-16,'0','In an interview on Saturday, Mr. Tsvangirai did not sound so cheerful. While careful not to criticize Mr. Mugabe, he suggested that some in ZANU-PF would like the deal to fail. His view echoed that of civic activists who worry that hard-liners in Mr. Mugabe’s repressive security services, perhaps fearful of prosecution for their human rights crimes, are trying to scuttle the deal.Mr. Tsvangirai’s party alleged in a statement on Saturday that military intelligence had planned Mr. Bennett’s arrest and that there was a plan to “dump Roy Bennett into the Chivero River,” and it warned that any harm to him “will be placed squarely on those responsible.” Mr. Tsvangirai said, “President Mugabe and myself will meet to address these issues as a matter of urgency.”Mr. Bennett was arrested by the law and order division of the police, which handles political crimes, according to The Herald, a state-owned newspaper. Mr. Tsvangirai said he knew that some had suggested that he was naïve to join a government with Mr. Mugabe, but he insisted that the negotiated settlement was “the most workable solution.”“People have no food, no schools,” he said. “The country is on its knees. We had to act. We could not be seen to be authors of chaos.”Mr. Tsvangirai, a former trade unionist who has led the political opposition for the past decade, won more votes than Mr. Mugabe in March but dropped out of a runoff after widespread, state-sponsored violence against his followers. As prime minister, he is faced with running the operations of a government that is “Zanufied,” as people in Zimbabwe say, from top to bottom by the ruling party’s patronage.His strategy seems to be to get civil servants, soldiers and policemen back to work — and win their loyalty — with a promise made in his inaugural address on Wednesday to pay them in foreign currency. The vow was greeted by delirious applause. Astronomical hyperinflation has rendered the pay of all public employees so valueless that they cannot even afford bus fare.But as prime minister of a country that has paid its bills only by printing ever more worthless Zimbabwean dollars, Mr. Tsvangirai has not said where he will get the hard currency to pay the wage bill for what he estimated was 230,000 people. The cost: about $40 million a month.He acknowledged that the United States and Britain and the rest of Europe were not going to pump in aid to Zimbabwe until they were convinced Mr. Mugabe was genuinely sharing power and restoring democracy.'"

It’s a simple primer, but it covers everything.THE BASICS II To make sure you are tracking everything that is coming in and out, you may want to double-check how you do your cash flow analysis against the sample worksheet provided by the Small Business Administration.SPEAKING OF BASICS The best way to avoid cash flow problems caused when customers or businesses do not pay you is “to weed out those slow pays/no pays out before they become clients,” writes Joseph Anthony in Microsoft’s Small Business Center.“If someone is about to become a significant client or customer, do your homework,” he says. “Ask for — and check out — credit references. Call other businesses that have had a relationship with the client. You might even pay for a credit check from an organization such as Experian or Dun & Bradstreet.”'"

"'09-02-17,'0','But that comparative increase is largely a function of the region’s real estate market experiencing the effect of the downturn long after the rest of the state had. The region is still faring better, with only 3 percent of California’s home foreclosures. “We are not immune to the recession. We’re just late, as opposed to 2000, when we were the recession,” said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto.The California real estate market softened, then consumers reduced their “shopping at the mall,” Mr. Levy said. “Finally, they have reduced their purchasing of iPods and flat-screen TVs.”The dot-com bust at the beginning of the decade and the recession that followed were felt most severely in Silicon Valley. But this recession is clearly different. The region’s situation is exacerbated by the state government’s enormous budget deficit, which last week stood at $42 billion.The State Assembly has been struggling to write a budget proposal that includes large tax increases and deep cuts in a huge range of services and public projects, including money for education, training programs and hospitals throughout the state.One area of serious concern in the report is the state’s community college system, which employers have long relied on to help train lower and middle-income workers for new jobs. Joint Venture believes the system is underfinanced, and it has been threatened with cutbacks in state support.Joint Venture is among a number of California organizations calling for an overhaul of the state government to help solve California’s financial problems. Last week, Joint Venture’s 49-member board voted unanimously to support a convention to rewrite California’s Constitution. The group and others are hoping to gain enough support to place a proposition on the ballot in June.“This is a statement that the system is broken, and that inaction will lead to ruin,” said Russell Hancock, chief executive and president of Joint Venture. “It’s time to start over.”The report also showed that the gap between the wealthiest and the poorest residents continued to grow. The percentage of households earning more than $100,000 a year rose to 42 percent in 2008, from 35 percent in 2002, while the number of households earning $35,000 or less rose to 20 percent, from 19 percent in the same period.During that period, the number of immigrants to Silicon Valley grew 9 percent.The report highlighted reasons for optimism. Overall venture capital investment in Silicon Valley companies fell 7.7 percent during the year, but less than the decline of 11.4 percent nationwide.Investment of nearly $1.9 billion in clean technology during 2008 was nearly double that in 2007. The bulk of new technology jobs will be in clean technology businesses, according to the report. That sector has had job growth of 23 percent since 2005. In that sector, green construction has had the most growth, with a fourfold increase in jobs since 2005.“Silicon Valley has a unique role to play in solving the climate crisis and bringing an end to this recession,” Mr. Hancock said.'"

Japan, the world’s third-largest oil consumer, said that its economy contracted the most since 1974 in the fourth quarter. “The market data from the U.S. and the other major economies is not painting a picture of an imminent recovery,” said Toby Hassall, research analyst at Commodity Warrants Australia in Sydney. “The Japanese data was pretty bad.” Crude oil for March delivery traded at $36.85 a barrel, down 68 cents from the Friday close, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 10:38 a.m. in Sydney.

"'09-02-17,'0','One soldier is dead of meningitis at Fort Leonard Wood and a second is “very seriously ill,” officials at the Army base in southern Missouri said. Officials released few details and did not identify either soldier. Both cases involved noncontagious forms of meningitis, the authorities said. The two soldiers were members of the same unit, but no connection has been found between the cases. “Although difficult to comprehend, all clinical data show these cases are unrelated and purely coincidental,” said Lt. Col. John Lowery, deputy commander for clinical services at the base. The first soldier died after meningitis was diagnosed on Feb. 5. The second soldier is a 28-year-old who received a diagnosis of strep pneumonia leading to meningitis on Friday. The authorities said that although the illnesses were non-contagious forms, they were “heightening awareness” of preventive measures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Surgeon General’s Office and the Army Medical Command are reviewing the cases. Meningitis kills about 300 people in the United States each year.'"
"'09-02-17,'0','The other four major leaguers on the roster are Kosuke Fukudome (Cubs), Kenji Johjima (Mariners), Akinori Iwamura (Rays) and Daisuke Matsuzaka (Red Sox). But considering there were more than 20 active players with American major league experience to choose from, Japan seemed to go out of its way to select a distinctly domestic team, perhaps hoping for the advantage of unfamiliarity.Excitement for the Classic has been building since the Beijing Olympics ended in August.A debate raged last fall over who should manage the team. As an acclaimed former manager of the Chunichi Dragons and the Hanshin Tigers, Senichi Hoshino seemed to be the most likely choice, despite a glaring blemish: the heavily favored, star-studded team of professionals he took to Beijing returned without a medal.Still, the winds did not shift fully against him until Suzuki, the nation’s biggest star, questioned how serious the country was about fielding the best team if active managers from the professional leagues were not being considered as candidates.Soon after, Tatsunori Hara of the Yomiuri Giants emerged as manager. That means Japan is asking a manager to leave his team for up to five weeks in the middle of spring training for the sake of the country’s reputation in the World Baseball Classic, as it did for the inaugural event. Sadaharu Oh took a sabbatical from the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks to guide Japan to the tournament championship in 2006.In the United States, no team would consider allowing its manager to take such a leave during spring training. So the Americans will once again rely on a former major league manager, this time Davey Johnson, whose 14-year career as a manager ended with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2000.The selection process offers another difference between Japan’s approach and that of the United States. The handful of worthy players who were not invited to Japan’s camp were outwardly upset. In contrast, the four 20-game winners in the United States last season and the National League Cy Young Award winner, Tim Lincecum, who was 18-5, are American; none will be playing for Team USA.Many players feel the tournament interferes with their preparation for the regular season. Of the 12 pitchers on Japan’s 2006 team, 2 matched their innings total in the regular season from the year before. Ten were still in Japanese baseball and used in a similar role in 2007; eight rebounded with more innings than in 2006.Another example of Japan’s willingness to sacrifice the regular season for the Classic is its strategy of filling its pitching staff. The tournament schedule is such that teams are typically comfortable with a three-man starting rotation. But pitch count rules limit their use and Japan likes the strategy of replacing a starter with a starter. Twelve of the 15 pitchers in camp here are starters compared with 6 of 21 on the United States’ most recent roster.A rare voice of concern comes from Bobby Valentine, who manages the Chiba Lotte Marines. He worries that the ace he is lending to Team Japan will be used as a reliever, meaning he will not log enough innings to be ready for the regular season.“If we’re going to give up players for the W.B.C.,” Valentine told the Japanese news media from Lotte’s Okinawa training camp, “they should at least be used in roles similar to what they normally do, so their preparation for the regular season isn’t compromised.”In the 2006 tournament, a starter from Valentine’s team pitched one inning over the tournament’s three weeks and started the season in the minor leagues to build his arm strength and stamina.The former Met Masato Yoshii is now the pitching coach for the Nippon Ham Fighters. He, too, will be giving up his staff ace, and although he has trepidations similar to Valentine’s, he balances them with national pride.“We, as a nation, want to impress the rest of the world,” he said. “We want to get on the field and say, ‘Hey, we might be just a little island country in the Far East, but we can play a pretty mean game of baseball.’ ”The country’s manga comic book culture gives some insight into its craving for baseball supremacy. “Kyojin no Hoshi” was a popular comic series that came out in the late 1960s. Readers were attracted to the inspiring fantasy of a Japanese pitcher who toils to create the “Big League Ball,” a pitch so tricky it confounds the mighty American batter, Armstrong Ozuma, a fictitious defector to Japan from a real St. Louis Cardinals team that won two of its three World Series appearances in that era.Today, at least 12 books can be found on Amazon.com celebrating Japan’s championship at the inaugural World Baseball Classic. There are no books on the tournament listed on its English site.'"
"'09-02-17,'0','Icelandic’s crammed planes, powered by turbo-prop engines while its rivals flew jets, took 10 to 12 hours to reach Europe and usually landed late.“We’re slow but we’re low” was the slogan as the airline started ferrying 20-something passengers to Luxembourg on DC-8s, with an obligatory stop in Iceland. Lacking a flag carrier of its own, Luxembourg was the only country in Europe that would allow Icelandic to land, and passengers then continued their journeys by bus or train.Old, cheap planes, hard-working pilots and maximum use of aircraft allowed Icelandic to build up a 2 percent share of trans-Atlantic traffic by the end of the 1960s, earning 90 percent of its revenue outside Iceland. While passengers were jammed into a one-class cabin, the airline did not skimp on meals, which were served with wine and a choice of cognac or brandy.“We traveled in style even though it was the cheapest flight across the Atlantic,” said Edda Helgason, who flew the airline frequently in the 12 years the family spent living in Rye, N.Y.Under Mr. Helgason’s stewardship, the airline greatly increased its flights, to up to five a day from New York in its heyday, and the expansion also brought change to his home country, introducing new ways of thinking to the Icelandic business community, while opening up an island of under 300,000 people to tourism from Europe and the United States.Mr. Helgason’s successor, who stepped down as chief executive three years ago and who coincidentally has exactly the same name, said his predecessor would be remembered as a pioneer in international aviation.“Icelandair is still carrying five times the population of Iceland,” he said of the airline, which still makes 75 percent of its income abroad, and flies about 1.6 million passengers a year.Mr. Arngrimsson called him a visionary figure at the only budget airline of its era to have survived.Born July 20, 1921, in the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik, Sigurdur Helgason came to the United States in his 20s and graduated with a business degree from Colombia University in New York in 1947. He then returned to Iceland, where he managed a cement company before joining Icelandic Airlines as a board member in 1953.In 1961 he took over the United States operations of the airline, and when Icelandic Airlines merged with a smaller competitor in 1973, he returned to head the new entity, Icelandair. He stayed on as chief executive for a decade and in 1984 became chairman of the board, remaining until he retired, in 1991. Thereafter he lived in Iceland, New York and Mustique.He married Unnur Einarsdottir in 1952. In addition to his daughter Edda, he is survived by three other children, Olof, Helgi and Sigurdur, who is a pilot with Icelandair.Edda said of her father: “He opened up the opportunity for people in America to appreciate the value of Europe, and Europe of America, and there was Iceland, perfectly located, in between. For him it was a great opportunity.”'"
"'09-02-17,'0','Paul Kedrosky, a senior fellow at the Kauffman Foundation, said he was asked to be co-chairman of a three-day conference about finance and technology in New York City that was to have been held earlier this month. The conference has been postponed indefinitely.While the previous year’s conference drew 550 participants and positive feedback, Mr. Kedrosky said, the volatility among financial firms had decimated the target audience. “A huge chunk of them have lost their jobs, are worried about losing their jobs or are under very tight financial constraints,” he said.One conference planner, who did not wish to be identified because of continuing hotel negotiations, canceled a two-day seminar a month before it was scheduled to take place when only 16 delegates had registered. The event had drawn an average of 125 people in years past. The organization refunded registration fees for the handful who had signed up, and offered a credit toward a future event to offset the expense of canceling their flights.Some event organizers, desperate for delegates, are going so far as to waive registration fees or to offer free hotel rooms to lure budget-minded business travelers. Canceling an event is not cheap. Costs can run into six figures, starting with the hotel’s cancellation fees and including any planned entertainment and functions planned outside the hotel.Holding a conference with a drastically reduced head count is not much better, though. Typical contracts include clauses that require the host to compensate the hotel for the difference between the number of guest rooms held for the group and those actually filled.As a rule, hotels would rather have fewer guests than receive a cancellation check, because conferences usually generate revenue from purchases like minibar snacks or fitness center passes.In flush times, hotels would probably have been able to rebook the rooms. But in the third week of January, the average occupancy rate of hotels in the United States was 47.3 percent, according to research firm STR Global, down nearly 8 percent from the same period last year. This means hotel rooms are likely to remain vacant if a meeting is canceled.Convention centers are expected to be less affected than hotels because their space is booked several years in advance. But the drop in meetings will probably lead to a decline in hotel tax revenue for local governments. For now, the approximate half-year lag between when those taxes are collected and when municipalities receive them is insulating cities that depend on tourism dollars, but the downturn could start to pinch by the third quarter of 2009.Even when companies do sign on to attend or exhibit at an event, they are often sending only one or two employees where they once sent a phalanx of workers.Pinny Gniwisch, founder and head of marketing for the online jewelry retailer Ice.com, decided not to take another employee with him to an Internet retail conference in Orlando, Fla., earlier this month because he expected turnout to be lighter than usual. “Initially, we thought having one person there from a networking perspective might not be able to cover all the bases, but seeing that a lot of people probably won’t be there, the necessity for two people there is gone,” he said.Professional speakers have also been hurt in the meeting downturn. “I would say the majority of companies we’ve dealt with in the past have either lowered their budgets or canceled their meetings,” said Barry Maher, a motivational speaker who says his business has been affected.And underwhelming attendance has a discernible impact on an event, said Thom Singer, another professional speaker. In November, Mr. Singer said he spoke at an accounting industry conference that drew fewer than one-third of the expected 150 delegates. “I think the attendees kind of felt like it was second-rate because it was so small,” he said. “You definitely felt disappointment. The vibe was not as strong.”But several frequent business travelers said there was a silver lining to sparsely attended conferences and conventions. They can speak directly with educators and experts, which would not be possible at larger gatherings and fellow participants tend to be corporate decision makers rather than underlings.Mr. Gniwisch of Ice.com agreed. “That’s the only reason I didn’t cancel,” he said. “When it’s more intimate, people feel more comfortable. For deal making, people connect a lot better that way.”'"

Salopek of The Chicago Tribune for articles detailing America’s antiterrorist activities, including the rendition of terrorist suspects to secret prisons, in remote and lawless regions around the Horn of Africa, including Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea.The Seattle Post-Intelligencer’s chief investigative reporter, Eric Nalder, won the military reporting Polk for his two-part series, “Demoted to Private: America’s Military Housing Disaster,” revealing the loss of millions in a Pentagon program intended to privatize military housing construction but that failed to build homes for personnel in six states.Jim Schaefer and M. L. Elrick of The Detroit Free Press won the local reporting Polk for articles revealing that Detroit’s mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick, had lied under oath and used $8.4 million in city money to settle a whistle-blower case in exchange for destroying evidence of his affair with an aide. The mayor pleaded guilty to two felonies, resigned and was imprisoned for several months.The award for labor reporting went to Paul Pringle of The Los Angeles Times for disclosing that the Los Angeles chapter of the Service Employees International Union, representing 160,000 mostly low-wage workers, and a related charity, had paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to companies owned by relatives of the local’s president, who was removed from office amid state and federal investigations.The Polk for justice reporting was won by Ryan Gabrielson and Paul Giblin for “Reasonable Doubt,” a five-part series in The East Valley Tribune that exposed a campaign by the Maricopa County sheriff, Joe Arpaio, against illegal immigrants in and around Phoenix, including racial profiling, slow responses to emergencies, lax criminal enforcement and other violations.Susanne Rust and Meg Kissinger of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel won the Polk for environmental reporting for a six-part series, “Chemical Fallout: A Journal Sentinel Watchdog Report,” which cited the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration for failures related to toxic chemicals in products ranging from microwave-safe plastics to baby bottles.The sports reporting award went to Ken Armstrong and Nick Perry of The Seattle Times for “Victory and Ruins,” a four-part series revealing that two dozen members of the University of Washington football team that won the Rose Bowl on New Year’s Day in 2001, were allowed to play despite criminal arrests, some for violent felonies, while they were enrolled at the university.Richard Behar, an investigative journalist, won the award for magazine reporting for “China Storms Africa,” which appeared in the business publication Fast Company. The article detailed China’s drive to invest in sub-Saharan Africa to acquire raw materials for manufacturing.The television reporting award went to Scott Pelley, correspondent; Solly Granatstein, producer; and Nicole Young, co-producer, of CBS News for “The Wasteland,” a segment on “60 Minutes” that revealed how American companies that had been paid to recycle electronic waste had dumped it in China, leading to health and environmental perils.Stefan Forbes, the producer and director of “Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story,” won the Polk for documentary reporting. His film showed how the celebrated political strategist helped win major elections for the Republicans and why, long after his death in 1991, his playbook continues to influence American politics.The award for radio reporting went to Alex Blumberg, a producer of “This American Life” for Chicago Public Radio, and Adam Davidson, a business correspondent for National Public Radio, for their report, “The Giant Pool of Money,” which distilled the complex subprime mortgage crisis through the stories of brokers, packagers and those who lost homes.Established in 1949, the awards are administered by Long Island University.

"'09-02-17,'0','Expectations are running so high, and the appetite for information is so large among the nation’s educators, that when Mr. Duncan organized a conference call last Wednesday to begin explaining the stimulus bill’s terms to a few dozen state and district superintendents, 800 callers swamped the switchboard.Most of Mr. Duncan’s unusual power would come in disbursing a $54 billion stabilization fund intended to prevent public sector layoffs, mostly in schools. The bill sets aside $5 billion of that to reward states, districts and schools for setting high standards and narrowing achievement gaps between poor and affluent students. The law lets Mr. Duncan decide which states deserve awards and which programs merit special financing.“It’s hard to imagine moving that much money that quickly,” said Margaret Spellings, Mr. Duncan’s predecessor, who turned her seventh-floor office over to him last month. “The point is, it’s never been done before, and as much confidence as I have in Arne Duncan, there’s an awesome opportunity for slippage with that much money moving through the meat grinder.”Maybe Ms. Spellings is slightly jealous, since she and other secretaries stretching back decades had only small amounts of money for favored projects.“Teeny, teeny,” said Amy Wilkins, who as vice president at the Education Trust, a civil rights group, has studied the budgets of several of Mr. Duncan’s predecessors. “Margaret was looking for quarters in her pencil drawer.”Mr. Duncan said he understood the unusual circumstances.“There’s going to be this extraordinary influx of resources,” he said in an interview. “So people say, ‘You’re going to be the most powerful secretary ever,’ but I have no interest in that. Power has never motivated me. What I love is opportunity, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something special, to drive change, to make our schools better.”Mr. Duncan said he intended to reward school districts, charter schools and nonprofit organizations that had demonstrated success at raising student achievement — “islands of excellence,” he called them. Programs that tie teacher pay to classroom performance will most likely receive money, as will other approaches intended to raise teacher quality, including training efforts that pair novice instructors with veteran mentors, and after-school and weekend tutoring programs.The stimulus money will help states avert some, but most likely not all, of the education cutbacks for the 2009-10 school year resulting from state budget shortfalls that currently total some $132 billion. California, for instance, is facing a $41 billion budget shortfall, much of it in school spending, but will receive some $11 billion in education money from the stimulus, estimates the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union.The positions of deputy secretary, under secretary and chief of staff and dozens of other senior posts at the Education Department remain unfilled, so Mr. Duncan is relying on help from career officers and consultants. He has appointed teams to develop procedures for distributing the stimulus billions quickly, and many aides, he said, have been working evenings and weekends to begin organizing the effort.“I want all of us to work hard enough and smart enough to take full advantage of this, because it’ll never happen again,” Mr. Duncan said last month in his first speech to hundreds of civil servants at department headquarters, as the outlines of the huge stimulus package were taking shape in Congress.Urging department employees not to be deferential, he described the reception he got on his first visit to his headquarters.“It was like, ‘Hello, Mr. Secretary-designate-nominee,’ and it didn’t feel right,” Mr. Duncan said. “My name is Arne. It’s not Mr. Secretary. Please just call me Arne.” That line drew a standing ovation.He has hit it off well with Congress, too, so far. His wife, Karen, whom Mr. Duncan met in Australia, where he played professional basketball after his 1987 graduation from Harvard, accompanied him to his Senate confirmation, along with their daughter, Claire, 7, and son, Ryan, 4, who sat quietly during the hearing, reading storybooks.“If you and your wife have done such a great job with Ryan, who is so well behaved, I hope you can do that with every child in American classrooms,” said Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia.Another Republican senator, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said Mr. Obama had made “several distinguished cabinet appointments.”“I think you’re the best,” Mr. Alexander, who was education secretary under the first President Bush, said to Mr. Duncan.But now comes the hard part.Last year the Education Department distributed about $59 billion to states, school districts and colleges, most of it along well-worn financing paths mapped out by Congress.“Congress usually spends two years debating the rules for how to spend $50 million,” said Jack Jennings, president of the Center on Education Policy, a research organization in Washington. “But this time they’re providing money without spelling out how it should be spent, so Arne Duncan and his staff are going to have to work out rules themselves in just weeks. He’s going to have his hands full.”Congress has stipulated some rules, of course. To receive a share of the $54 billion stabilization fund, governors must make several “assurances” to Mr. Duncan, intended to drive school reforms: that they are developing statewide data systems that can allow schools to track individual students’ academic progress, that they are assigning experienced teachers fairly to rich and poor schools alike, and so on. Mr. Duncan has the ticklish job of ruling on whether the governors’ assurances are convincing.And Congress has given him a $5 billion incentive fund that he can use to reward states that are raising student achievement and withhold money from states that are not. “We have states that tell the public that 90 percent of kids are meeting state standards,” Mr. Duncan said, “but when we look at how they’re doing on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, it’s nowhere close. I’m not going to reward that.

It seems that even consumers for whom money is increasingly tight are so mortified at the prospect of what marketers call a “sweat event” that they are happily paying extra.Kevin Hochman, marketing director in P.&G.’s deodorant division, said company research indicated that 25 percent of women consider themselves “heavy sweaters”; among both sexes, about 35 percent experience at least one weekly “sweat event,” defined as feeling underarm wetness (whether or not anyone else notices), he said.“What we’re finding is that even though people are using antiperspirant, the products were not meeting the adequate level of protection based on their bodies’ chemistry,” Mr. Hochman said.When Secret Clinical Strength was introduced, it was enclosed in a package, to cast it as a more upscale product like a face lotion and to allow adding instructions; for example, application before bedtime instead of in the morning is recommended. (Reapplying after the morning shower is optional but not necessary.)Lisa J. Pieretti, executive director of the International Hyperhidrosis Society (hyperhidrosis is the medical term for extreme sweating, which afflicts an estimated 3 percent of the population), said that antiperspirant, paradoxically, relies on perspiration to work: perspiration draws the active ingredient into the sweat gland, and plugs form to stem more perspiration.While sleeping, Ms. Pieretti said, people sweat only slightly, which encourages a “real nice plug” to form; apply it in the morning, however, then run to catch the bus, and the sweat may dilute and divert the active ingredient.Though merely a matter of physiology, perspiration is, of course, freighted with social stigmas. The hyperhidrosis group, which receives financing from dermatologists and Procter & Gamble, commissioned a Harris Poll: 66 percent of respondents, asked what they associate with others visibly sweating, thought that the sweat-sopped were nervous. Forty-nine percent assumed they were overweight or unfit.So Ms. Pieretti said she was not surprised that even in this economy, consumers were paying more for clinical strength products.“If I’m paying four more dollars for Secret Clinical Strength, which will last me maybe three months, I wouldn’t mind paying a little more for it for better protection,” Ms. Pieretti said. “At least I’d have the confidence that I’m not going to go to a job interview and have huge sweat stains under my arms, which will make people perceive that I’m nervous or lying or I don’t know what I’m talking about.”Secret’s first television ad for the product, which ran for 18 months, featured three bridesmaids in sleeveless dresses at an outdoor reception whose antiperspirants are overtaxed, each regarding her armpits nervously, and one even noticing a wet spot under her arm, a pointed image in the generally more euphemistic deodorant pitch.“We have not shown pitting out before — it’s the most overt we’ve ever been,” said Becky Swanson, the creative director for Chicago-based Leo Burnett USA on the Secret account, adding that the spot’s humor seemed to give it leeway. The commercial ends when the bride throws the bouquet, but the bridesmaids are too self-conscious to raise their arms to catch it.Mr. Hochman, of P.&G., said its high-octane Secret, Gillette and Old Spice products were engendering great loyalty, with the rate of repeat buyers as much as 2.5 times that of its standard deodorants. Although sales of several of the clinical strength deodorants are brisk, only Secret has cracked the 10 top sellers, ending 2008 in the fifth spot with a 4.25 percent share of the market, according to Information Resources.The primary marketing target of Unilever’s clinical deodorants — Degree, Dove and Suave — are the 25 percent of consumers who, according to company research, consider themselves “excessive sweaters,” said Kevin George, general manager of the company’s deodorant and hair care divisions.But Mr. George added that consumers less prone to perspire gravitate to the products if “they have an absolute cannot-fail situation — like a woman getting married or going to a big event in a sleeveless dress — so the product has to perform for them.”Although deodorant unit sales were down in 2008 from the previous year, revenue was up because of the success of the higher-priced products. Like others in the industry, Mr. George said he was heartened to be marketing the new deodorants; since more than 90 percent of United States households already use deodorant, the pool of new customers is shallow.“Unless we get people to grow a third arm, there’s limited potential,” Mr. George said.'"

"'09-02-17,'0','In November, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a paper reporting that babies conceived with IVF, or with a technique in which sperm are injected directly into eggs, have a slightly increased risk of several birth defects, including a hole between the two chambers of the heart, a cleft lip or palate, an improperly developed esophagus and a malformed rectum. The study involved 9,584 babies with birth defects and 4,792 babies without. Among the mothers of babies without birth defects, 1.1 percent had used IVF or related methods, compared with 2.4 percent of mothers of babies with birth defects.The findings are considered preliminary, and researchers say they believe IVF does not carry excessive risks. There is a 3 percent chance that any given baby will have a birth defect.But the real question — what is the chance that an IVF baby will have a birth defect? — has not been definitively answered. That would require a large, rigorous study that followed these babies. The C.D.C. study provides comparative risks but not absolute risks.Yet even though the risks appear to be small, researchers who are studying the molecular biology of embryos grown in petri dishes say they would like a better understanding of what happens, so they can improve the procedure and allow couples to make more informed decisions.“There is a growing consensus in the clinical community that there are risks,” said Richard M. Schultz, associate dean for the natural sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. “It is now incumbent on us to figure out what are the risks and whether we can do things to minimize the risks.”And although the questions are well known, the discussion has been largely confined to scientists, said Dr. Elizabeth Ginsburg, president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology.Dr. Ginsburg, who is the medical director of in vitro fertilization at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, says her center’s consent forms mention that there might be an increased risk for certain rare genetic disorders. But, she says, none of her patients have been dissuaded.Richard G. Rawlins, who directs the in vitro fertilization and assisted reproduction laboratories at the Rush Centers for Advanced Reproductive Care in Chicago, said that when he spoke to patients he never heard questions about growing embryos in the laboratory and the possible consequences.“I have never had a patient ask me anything” about it, he said, adding, “For that matter, not many doctors have ever asked, either.”Dr. Andrew Feinberg, a professor of medicine and genetics at Johns Hopkins, became concerned about the lack of information about IVF eight years ago when he and a colleague, Dr. Michael R. DeBaun, were studying changes in gene expression that can lead to cancer.Their focus was on children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, characterized by a 15 percent risk of childhood cancers of the kidney, liver or muscle; an overgrowth of cells in the kidney and other tissues; and other possible abnormalities, among them a large tongue, abdominal-wall defects and low levels of blood sugar in infancy.The syndrome, Dr. Feinberg and Dr. DeBaun found, was often caused by changes in the expression of a cluster of genes, and those changes also are found in colon and lung cancers. Children with those gene alterations had a 50 percent risk of the childhood cancers. The normal risk is less than 1 in 10,000.The two investigators recruited children with the disorder, following them and studying them in their clinic. Then, several mothers in the study who had had IVF asked the researchers: Was it possible that the fertility treatments had caused Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome?That prompted Dr. Feinberg and Dr. DeBaun to investigate the prevalence of IVF and related methods in the pregnancies that resulted in children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Their conclusion, and the conclusion from at least half a dozen other large studies, was that there were about 10 times more parents who had used IVF or related methods than would be expected.Another disorder caused by abnormal gene expression, Angelman syndrome, also is suspected of being linked to IVF. It involves severe mental retardation, motor defects, an inability to speak and a cheerful disposition. The disorders are rare. Beckwith-Wiedemann occurs just once in 13,000 children, and Angelman occurs about once in every 10,000 children.Why, researchers ask, would growing embryos in petri dishes elicit changes in gene expression? And if there are changes, could they alter the laboratory conditions so those gene expression changes do not occur?One place to look might be the broth, known as the culture medium, in which embryos grow. From the start of IVF, scientists knew that the composition of the broth affected how quickly embryos grew, Dr. Rawlins said. And they knew that embryos, both animal and human, grew much more slowly in the lab than they did in the body.One thing the culture medium provides is chemicals that can be used to add methyl groups to genes. The presence, or absence, of the methyl groups can control whether genes are active or not, a process known as epigenetics. Epigenetic changes not only cause rare disorders like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome but also are associated with low-birth-weight babies and an increased risk of a variety of cancers. That does not mean that growing embryos in petri dishes will have such effects, but it does raise questions about what is known about the procedure.Dr. George Daley, a researcher at Harvard Medical School studying human embryonic stem cells, said the questions also extended to those cells, which are taken from human embryos and grown in petri dishes. He has seen epigenetic changes in stem cells but is not sure what they mean.“My major concern is that we don’t have enough information, or the tools to measure epigenetic stability,” he said. “It may or may not be relevant to the safety of the cells, though I suspect it is.”But figuring out what, if anything, in the culture medium might adversely affect embryo growth and development may not be easy, Dr. Feinberg said.Dr. Ginsburg said the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology discussed whether to ask IVF centers to report what media they were using to grow their embryos. But, she said, “programs use multiple media, and it is very common for programs to switch from one media to another.”If mouse embryos are even close to reflecting what can happen with humans, then there is no question that gene expression can be altered by growing embryos in a laboratory, Dr. Schultz says.He and several others spent years asking whether there were gene expression changes in mouse embryos that are grown in the laboratory — there are — and whether they could see behavioral changes in the animals. They did.For example, the investigators gave mice a test that required remembering the location of a platform hidden by opaque water. The IVF mice had no trouble learning where the platform was, but were more likely to forget what they had learned, Dr. Schultz found.In another test, which measured a fear response when mice are in the open, IVF mice lacked the normal caution and fear that non-IVF mice are born with.“They are changes,” Dr. Schultz said, of the test results. “And the only difference is that they were cultured,” meaning that the mice started out as embryos in a petri dish.Along with the behavioral changes were changes in the methylation of genes — epigenetic changes, Dr. Schultz reports. “I am suspicious that manipulation and culturing of embryos is a contributing factor,” he adds.But following babies born after IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection is not easy. And if problems emerge from epigenetic changes, they may not be apparent until adulthood or middle or old age.“When you send questionnaires, the tendency is for the couple who may have had a problem or who think they have a problem to answer that questionnaire,” said Dr. Zev Rosenwaks, director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility at New York Weill Cornell Center. Those who do not respond tend to be parents whose children seem fine, skewing the data.Dr. Rosenwaks’s group largely paid for its own studies. They conclude, he said, that “even if there was a slight increase in abnormalities, the rate was not much higher than in the general population.”Others, like Dr. Alistair Sutcliffe of University College London, say the field is crying out for more information on the risks.“I talk on this topic worldwide,” he said. “My talks over time are based on the known literature. And I have gradually become slightly less optimistic about the things that are known about the health of the children” born after IVF and related procedures.“Obviously, more knowledge is required,” Dr. Sutcliffe said. “The perfect study hasn’t been done.”'"
"'09-02-17,'0','It isn’t easy being an amphibian these days. Perhaps one-third of amphibian species are thought to be threatened or endangered. Among these are many frog species that have suffered sharp declines in recent years, victims of a fungal disease, chytridiomycosis.Less attention has been paid to the situation with salamanders, but a report in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that they, too, are a large part of what has been called the global amphibian crisis.David B. Wake and Sean M. Rovito of the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues surveyed salamander populations in Guatemala and Mexico and compared the results to past surveys.The sites included a region in western Guatemala that Dr. Wake and others had surveyed in the 1970s. This time, the researchers found very few specimens of some species, notably Pseudoeurycea brunnata and P. goebeli, which were among the most abundant three decades before. Generally, species at higher elevations showed the greatest declines.The researchers found no direct evidence that chytridiomycosis was involved, although they said it may have played a role. Deforestation and climate change may also be factors, they said, by reducing moisture at higher elevations.'"
"'09-02-17,'0','Dermatologists routinely talk of the need to wear sunscreen. But the body needs sunlight to produce vitamin D, a crucial nutrient.So is it possible that wearing sunscreen might interfere with the synthesis of vitamin D?Yes. Studies have found that by blocking ultraviolet rays, sunscreen limits the vitamin D we produce. But the question is to what extent.A few studies have concluded that the effect is significant — a reduction as great as tenfold. But more recent, randomized studies that followed people for months and in some cases years suggest that the effect is negligible. While sunscreen does hamper vitamin D production, these studies say, it is not enough to cause a deficiency.That is in part because most people typically do not apply enough sunscreen to get its full effects, which in turn allows some sunlight through, said Dr. Henry Lim, chairman of dermatology at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and a spokesman for the American Academy of Dermatology. And according to the National Institutes of Health, it does not take much sunlight to produce adequate amounts of vitamin D: perhaps as little as 30 minutes of daytime exposure (without sunscreen) twice a week.Dr. Lim added that rather than cutting back on sunscreen, people concerned about vitamin D should consume more foods rich in vitamin D, like salmon, milk and orange juice.Sunscreen can reduce vitamin D production, but probably not enough to have a significant effect.'"
"'09-02-17,'0','One conference planner, who did not wish to be identified because of continuing hotel negotiations, canceled a two-day seminar a month before it was scheduled to take place when only 16 delegates had registered. The event had drawn an average of 125 people in years past. The organization refunded registration fees for the handful who had signed up, and also offered a credit toward a future event to offset the expense of canceling their flights.Some event organizers, desperate for delegates, are going so far as to waive registration fees or to offer free hotel rooms to lure budget-minded business travelers. Canceling an event is not cheap. Costs can run into six figures, starting with the hotel’s cancellation fees and including any planned entertainment and functions planned outside the hotel.Holding a conference with a drastically reduced head count is not much better, though. Typical contracts include clauses that require the host to compensate the hotel for the difference between the number of guest rooms held for the group and those actually filled.As a rule, hotels would rather have fewer guests than receive a cancellation check, because conferences usually generate revenue from purchases like minibar snacks or fitness center passes. In flush times, hotels would probably have been able to rebook the rooms. But in the third week of January, the average occupancy rate of hotels in the United States was 47.3 percent, according to research firm STR Global, down nearly 8 percent from the same period last year. This means hotel rooms are likely to remain vacant if a meeting is canceled.Convention centers are expected to be less affected than hotels because their space is booked several years in advance. But the drop in meetings will probably lead to a decline in hotel tax revenue for local governments. For now, the approximate half-year lag between when those taxes are collected and when municipalities receive them is insulating cities that depend on tourism dollars, but the downturn could start to pinch by the third quarter of 2009.Even when companies do sign on to attend or exhibit at an event, they are often sending only one or two employees where they once sent a phalanx of workers.Pinny Gniwisch, founder and head of marketing for the online jewelry retailer Ice.com, decided not to take another employee with him to an Internet retail conference in Orlando, Fla., earlier this month because he expected turnout to be lighter than usual. “Initially, we thought having one person there from a networking perspective might not be able to cover all the bases, but seeing that a lot of people probably won’t be there, the necessity for two people there is gone,” he said.Professional speakers have also been hurt in the meeting downturn. “I would say the majority of companies we’ve dealt with in the past have either lowered their budgets or canceled their meetings,” said Barry Maher, a motivational speaker who says his business has been affected. When a client cancels, Mr. Maher and others in his field are doubly hurt, because they depend on their presentations to bring in new bookings. Mr. Maher says he has been booking smaller, less lucrative gatherings to increase his exposure.And underwhelming attendance has a discernible impact on an event, said Thom Singer, another professional speaker. In November, Mr. Singer said he spoke at an accounting industry conference that drew fewer than one-third of the expected 150 delegates. “I think the attendees kind of felt like it was second-rate because it was so small,” he said. “You definitely felt disappointment. The vibe was not as strong.”But several frequent business travelers said there was a silver lining to sparsely attended conferences and conventions. They can speak directly with educators and experts, which would not be possible with a large crowd, and fellow participants tend to be corporate decision makers rather than underlings.Mr. Gniwisch of Ice.com agreed. “That’s the only reason I didn’t cancel,” he said. “When it’s more intimate, people feel more comfortable. For deal making, people connect a lot better that way.”'"

"'09-02-17,'0','BARCELONA, Spain — Microsoft said on Monday that LG Electronics had agreed to use Microsoft’s new mobile operating system on 50 of its smartphone models, increasing the software maker’s bid to gain a bigger share of the fast-growing mobile software business.LG had previously used the software, called Windows Mobile, on only one handset model. Microsoft made the announcement on the opening day of Mobile World Congress, the mobile industry’s largest convention.Microsoft’s Windows operating system software powers more than 90 percent of all personal computers, according to the research firm Gartner. But Microsoft trails its rivals in mobile software for smartphones. Symbian, the operating system developed by a consortium led by Nokia, the world’s top handset maker, leads with 52.4 percent and Research in Motion, the Canadian maker of the BlackBerry smartphone, with 16.5 percent, according to Canalys, a research firm in Reading, England.At the end of 2008, Microsoft had 13.9 percent of the global mobile operating system market. The company hopes agreements with major handset makers like LG will help it regain its momentum in mobile software, which is among the fastest-growing segments of the global software industry.“The mobile device is the computing device of the future,” said Bengt Nordstrom, the founder and chief analyst of Northstream, a company in Stockholm that advises mobile operators and equipment makers.'"
"'09-02-17,'0','The Mini workers had returned to work on Jan. 5 after an extended four-week Christmas holiday.“Sacking an entire shift like this, and targeting agency workers who have no rights to redundancy pay, is blatant opportunism on BMW’s part and nothing short of scandalous,” Tony Woodley, the joint general secretary of Unite, the biggest union in Britain, said in a statement.Mr. Woodley said the union would oppose the cuts and would “also be keeping up the pressure on our government to do more to protect jobs in this country.”The carmaker is the latest in Britain to announce plant closures and job cuts. Honda has closed its plant in Swindon for four months from February to May. Nissan Motor said in January that it would cut 1,200 jobs at its plant in Sunderland.At the same time, governments are taking steps to try to ease the pain of restructuring. Last month, Britain offered auto manufacturers and suppliers access to £1.3 billion, or $1.9 billion, in loan guarantees from the European Investment Bank, topped with an additional £1 billion from the Treasury, the business secretary, Peter Mandelson, said.The British auto industry adds about £10 billion a year to the economy and employs more than 800,000. But government aid to automakers is more controversial in Britain than in other countries because many manufacturers are foreign-owned. For example, Jaguar Land Rover, which employs 15,000 in Britain, is owned by Tata Motors of India, while General Motors owns Vauxhall.The governments in France, Germany, Italy and Spain have also recently announced aid plans for the auto sector. And Washington announced late last year a $14 billion plan to help G.M. and Chrysler.The classic Mini was first released in 1959 by the British Motor Corporation, the former state-owned automaker, and was subsequently sold under the Austin brand. Its small size and unusual design, with its wheels pushed all the way to the corners, helped make it the best-selling British car by the 1970s.BMW bought Mini in 1994 from the struggling British carmaker Rover and subsequently remodeled it and re-released the car in 2001. BMW sold Rover in 2000 but retained Mini as well as some other parts of the company.For the 10 months to October 2008, BMW said Mini sales climbed 10.5 percent, to 202,302 around the world. For January, Mini sales were down 34.5 percent from a year earlier, although BMW attributed this in part to a lack of availability of the Mini Convertible, which went out of production in mid-2008. A new model is scheduled to be released by late March.But BMW said this month that business globally had “deteriorated sharply again” in the fourth quarter, leading full-year revenue to drop 5 percent, to 53.2 billion euros.In January, BMW said it was cutting hours for 26,000 workers to reduce production by 10 percent. It had already cut its work force by 7 percent last year, to 100,041 employees at the end of the year. At Mini, 380 workers were laid off before Christmas.'"

"'09-02-18,'1','The long-awaited housing bailout will finally be announced on Wednesday.In a speech in Phoenix, a signature real estate boomtown gone bust, President Obama will explain his plan to reduce foreclosures. And the key to understanding that plan will be remembering that there are two different groups of homeowners who are at risk of foreclosure.The first group is made up of people who cannot afford their mortgages and have fallen behind on their monthly payments. Many took out loans they were never going to be able to afford, while others have since lost their jobs. About three million households  and rising  fall into this category. Without help, they will lose their homes.The second group is far larger. It is made up of the more than 10 million households that can afford their monthly payments but whose houses are worth less than what is owed on their mortgages. In real estate parlance, they are underwater. If they want to stay in their homes, they will have no trouble doing so. But some may choose to walk away voluntarily, rather than continue to make payments on an investment that may never pay off.Scratch beneath the details of any housing bailout proposal, and the fundamental issue is whether it tries to help the second group or just the first.Mr. Obama has evidently decided to focus on the first group, based on the previews of his speech that aides have offered. In coming weeks, his administration will begin spending $50 billion to entice banks to reduce the monthly payments of people who otherwise couldn’t afford to stay in their houses. In effect, the government will split the losses on these mortgages with banks.The $50 billion will come from the money Congress has already allocated for the bailout of the financial system. It is likely to be aimed at people who need a significant, but not an enormous, amount of help to meet their mortgage payments.There are some big advantages to this approach. Bailing out all underwater homeowners would be tremendously expensive. All told, about $500 billion in mortgage debt is already underwater, and it’s impossible to know in advance who is likely to walk away. So the government would have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to help millions of people who don’t need help staying in their homes.But the Obama approach also brings risks. The administration is betting that few of those 10 million underwater homeowners will walk away. (A year from now, the number will about 15 million, Moody’s Economy.com projects.) If they begin to abandon their homes in large numbers, however, they will aggravate the housing bust and the financial crisis  and probably force the administration to come up with a new, much larger housing bailout down the road.In that case, the speech that Mr. Obama is making in Phoenix could come to look like a rose-colored bit of incrementalism, which happens to be the very criticism that Obama advisers have leveled against the Bush administration’s response to the housing bust.Underwater homeowners clearly face a difficult choice. By walking away from a house and then renting a similar one in the same town, many could save themselves a lot of money. And those who need to move  to take a new job, for example, or to marry  may have little choice but to default. They may not get enough from a sale to pay off the mortgage.On the other hand, defaulting will wreck a homeowner’s credit rating. For families that don’t need to move, doing so will also bring other headaches and costs. They will be leaving behind their homes. Many other people may continue to make their payments simply because they think it’s the right thing to do.The current housing bust doesn’t have a good recent historical analogy. It’s too big. But there have been some serious regional housing slumps that may offer a window into how underwater homeowners will behave this time.Three economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston recently did an analysis along these lines, looking at the Boston area in the early 1990s. From early 1989 until late 1991, prices in Boston fell 15 percent. They did not return to their 1989 peak until 1997.Yet only 6.4 percent of homeowners who had been underwater at the end of 1991 were eventually foreclosed on. And the majority of these foreclosed homeowners weren’t merely underwater; they were also unable to make their monthly payments, because of the severe recession hitting New England at the time, as Chris Foote, an economist at the Boston Fed, told me. They are the kind of people the Obama plan is meant to help.In all, maybe only 1 or 2 percent of underwater homeowners walked away even though they could make their payments. Mr. Foote and his colleagues predict that the nationwide foreclosure rate over the next few years will be higher than it was in Boston, but not radically so.For most people, the Fed economists write, being underwater “is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for foreclosure.”'"
"'09-02-18,'1','“One thing we have known for many months is the spigot of defense funding opened by 9/11 is closing,” Mr. Gates said in Congressional testimony.Mr. Gates made clear that he did not intend to force each of the armed services to share equally in any budget cuts, which would be a departure from Pentagon practice. “We must have the courage to make hard choices,” he said.Personnel costs account for about two-thirds of all Pentagon and military spending, but there is little chance that money budgeted for salaries, training, health care and other benefits for military personnel and their families would be slashed while troops are fighting and dying in two wars.“At the core of our future success is our people,” Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said this month at Fort Drum, N.Y. He said any budget cuts should first look to trimming programs “where costs have spun out of control.”Mr. Gates convened a session last Friday with Admiral Mullen, all of the regional war-fighting commanders and the armed services chiefs and secretaries to focus specifically on budget priorities and financial challenges.Among those opposed to cuts, military industry lobbyists and members of Congress are likely to question whether cutbacks in arms purchases, with the threat of shutting down production lines, would be the proper response to an economic crisis already marked by deep job losses. Reading the Obama administration’s initial proposals for military spending will be tricky.Even if overall spending is reduced, the official Defense Department budget may actually grow over last year’s spending plan, because billions of dollars in emergency spending that now passes through Congress in separate legislation is to be rolled back into the regular budget.The Pentagon’s base budget request for 2009 was $515 billion ($513 billion was approved). Further, a separate bridge fund of $66 billion was approved to pay for the wars in 2009, and it has been expected that the Pentagon may offer another emergency spending bill of up to $70 billion for this year.Mr. Obama has promised to impose greater controls on government expenses not only for the military but for domestic programs, including the popular but increasingly costly entitlement programs, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.On Monday at the White House, the president will convene what he has called a “fiscal responsibility summit” with budget experts and members of both parties in Congress to discuss potential savings initiatives. The panels will include one that focuses on problems with military procurement. The summit will be followed Tuesday by Mr. Obama’s televised address to a joint session of Congress at the Capitol. While not officially a State of the Union address, the speech is routine for a new president and focuses on the initial budget.Two days later, on Feb. 26, Mr. Obama plans to release his budget outline for fiscal 2010, which begins Oct. 1. The blueprint will also have 10-year projections of spending and revenues, through fiscal 2019.That will provide the first clues about Mr. Obama’s long-range plans for national security, health care, energy and climate, education and taxes — and for how those plans will square with his promised deficit-reduction at a time when annual deficits are exceeding $1 trillion.'"
"'09-02-18,'1','But is four the right number?After all, most of its big competitors, including Toyota, Honda and Chrysler, build their businesses around three brands or fewer in the United States. Ford is moving to shed its foreign brands and plans to focus primarily on three — Ford, Lincoln and Mercury.“A volume brand and a premium brand can get the job done. Toyota has proven that,” said Karl Brauer, editor in chief of Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers car-buying advice. “Cadillac, Chevy, done.”The more brands a carmaker has, the more it must spread money around to develop vehicles and market them.As a result, “every brand suffers,” said A. Andrew Shapiro, a managing partner with the Casesa Shapiro Group. “No particular brand or brands can achieve the share of voice that they need.”Its extensive brand lineup has long been G.M.’s primary weapon. Founded in 1908 by William C. Durant, who brought together a collection of car companies, G.M. made the concept of “a car for every purse and purpose” its strategy during the 1920s for retaining buyers from their first car to their last.Brands were a crucial element in G.M.’s effort to thwart Ford, then the country’s biggest car company, whose founder joked that buyers could have any color they wanted, as long as it was black.G.M.’s strategy paid off during its best years, when it controlled more than half the American car market. But it held only 22 percent of United States auto sales last year, with more than half of its share coming from a single division, Chevrolet.G.M. found out last decade just how expensive it could be to unwind a brand. It spent more than $1 billion to buy out dealers at Oldsmobile, which built its last cars in 2004.Rick Wagoner, G.M.’s chief executive, said the automaker had set aside money to buy out dealers, but declined to specify a figure. “We have reserves in our plan to facilitate that,” he said.He cited the economic downturn as the reason G.M. was phasing out Saturn. “Frankly, the opportunity for any brand, and for our volume as a whole, just looks radically different,” he said. “It is unfortunate and it seems like a cruel twist of fate at a time when Saturn is loaded up with a fantastic product portfolio.”In a letter sent Tuesday to Saturn dealers, G.M. said it would entertain a plan from Saturn dealers or other investors for a spinoff of the division to keep it operating. It said it would provide information to potential investors.But it warned a spinoff would be “a difficult and complex task, and some of the issues that must be resolved include product sourcing, capitalization and financing issues,” G.M. said in the letter signed by Mark LeNeve, a G.M. vice president for North American sales, and Jill Lajdziak, the general manager of Saturn.When Saturn was started in 1990, as a “different kind of car, a different kind of car company” aimed at owners of small Hondas and Toyotas, its small cars were immediate hits. But G.M. executives decided in the mid-1990s that they needed to support G.M.’s other brands over Saturn, which by then had cost $5 billion.G.M. did not add any new vehicles to the Saturn lineup for five years, despite pleas from dealers for bigger vehicles. Earlier this decade, G.M. decided to start selling vehicles from its Opel division, with some design changes, as Saturns in the United States.Saturn sold 188,004 vehicles in 2008, down 21.7 percent from the previous year. Its best-selling vehicle was the Saturn Vue, a small sport utility vehicle.Strict franchise laws protect dealers across the country from seeing their operations shut down without advance notice.G.M. dealers said they were led to believe that the company was committed to the division.“G.M. is picking on Saturn,” said Sherrill Freeborough, who owns Saturn dealerships in Grand Ledge and Okemos, Mich. “I want G.M. to be successful but I don’t think that always happens the other way around.”In 1992, when G.M. began discussing the end of Oldsmobile, the division sold 412,000 vehicles. Except for Chevrolet, none of G.M.’s current brands sold that many vehicles last year.Mr. Shapiro, the analyst, said G.M. should have rethought its divisions in the 1980s, when a number of new brands appeared in the United States, including Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, the Japanese luxury brands, and the Korean makers Hyundai and Kia.“There were always good short-term reasons for not doing something,” Mr. Shapiro said.Ed Dena, a Pontiac dealer in Dinuba, Calif., said he would eventually have to focus on his other G.M. brands, including Chevrolet, Buick and GMC. “Of course we’re sad because Pontiac is an icon,” he said. “But right now, in this industry, nothing is a shock anymore.”'"
"'09-02-18,'1','MANY Americans are angry at banks for taking bailout money while still cutting back on lending. But the government is also to blame. For reasons that remain unclear, the Troubled Asset Relief Program has channeled aid to bank holding companies rather than banks. The Obama administration’s new Financial Stability Plan will have more influence on bank lending if it actually directs its support to banks.To see why, it’s important to understand the distinction between banks and bank holding companies. Banks take deposits and make loans to consumers and corporations. Bank holding companies own or control these banks. The big holding companies also own other businesses, including ones that execute trades both on their clients’ behalf and for themselves.It would seem obvious that helping banks, not holding companies, would be the most direct way to stimulate bank lending. But when TARP purchased preferred stock and warrants, it bought them from holding companies, not their bank subsidiaries.While TARP has been generous with bank holding companies, these companies have not been so generous with their banks. Four large holding companies — JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo — initially received a total of $90 billion in TARP money in the fall, but by the end of 2008 they had contributed less than $15 billion in equity capital to their subsidiary banks.The holding companies seem to have invested most of their TARP money in their other businesses or else retained the option to do so by keeping it in deposit accounts, even as the capital of their banks decreased. At the same time the banks, which provide the majority of loans to large corporate borrowers, drastically reduced lending to new borrowers.It’s easy to see why holding companies would withhold capital from their troubled banks. If a bank is insolvent — as many are now believed to be — and the government has to take it over, the holding company loses any capital it gave to the bank. Rather than take that risk, the holding company can opt to spend its money elsewhere, perhaps on trading of its own.'"
"'09-02-18,'1','What the central bank has not done for the new members yet to adopt the euro is to provide temporary currency swaps — along the lines of what the Federal Reserve did for Brazil, Mexico, Singapore and South Korea last October to enable those countries to convert their currencies more easily to dollars.And the central bank does not accept as collateral the bonds issued in zlotys, forints or the other local currencies in Eastern Europe.“This has made it unattractive for euro-area financial institutions to hold noneuro government bonds, thus contributing to their sell-off,” said Zsolt Darvas, a visiting fellow at Breugel, an independent economics research group in Brussels.The global financial crisis was slow to reach this part of Europe because its banks had few troubled assets. But when the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September sent new shock waves through the global banking system, Eastern Europe and other emerging markets were no longer spared.Hungary and Latvia were particularly vulnerable; Hungary because of its deep exposure to foreign lending, and Latvia because of its shaky banking system and overextended consumers. When foreign currency financing dried up, the domestic interbank money markets stumbled and currencies came under pressure. Both countries were rescued by the International Monetary Fund and the European Union, with a heavy price attached in the form of government spending cuts.Political and psychological factors also make attracting funds more difficult outside the euro zone, said Vasily Astrov, an economist at the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies.“Investors have become risk averse, at least with regard to financial markets,” he said. “They are opting for countries which hold the major currencies.”The extraordinary pace with which currencies have declined has only aggravated such problems. In Poland, the zloty has fallen in value by 50 percent against the euro.In theory, that should help exporters. But Aleksander Drzewiecki, chairman of the House of Skills, a consulting company, said many export-driven companies depend on imports in the first place. “The turbulence with the exchange rate is horrible,” he said. “We have no idea where we stand.”Poland, with almost 40 million people, is the biggest of the new member states. It lost an opportunity right after joining to quickly prepare to adopt the euro. The nationalist-conservative government then, led by Lech Kaczynski, was intensely skeptical toward the euro and resistant to abandoning the zloty.The new center-right government, led by Donald Tusk, which took office in late 2007, is more “euro friendly,” Mr. Astrov said. But its target entry date of 2012 is now called into question by the economic turmoil.Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, the Czech Republic is keeping its options about joining the euro zone open, although it would need support from President Vaclav Klaus, a euro skeptic.The Baltic states would like to join as quickly as possible, but their economies are contracting so much that it would be impossible to meet the criteria, which, among other things, stipulates that budget deficits should be below 3 percent of gross domestic product.Without its subsidiary in Germany, things could be a lot worse for Ergis-Eurofilms, the biggest manufacturer of plastic films and laminates in Poland, which last year had revenue of 150 million euros ($189 million at current exchange rates) and a profit of about 10 million euros.By contrast, Fiam, a family-owned company in Slovakia that specializes in recycling plastic materials, has its subsidiaries outside the euro zone, in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. As a result, Fiam has been protected from currency fluctuations in its home market, which has adopted the euro, but faces havoc when selling eastward.“Leaving aside the fact that many economies are all in recession, there is predictability inside the euro zone because there are no currency fluctuations,” said Ivan Saro, the company’s chief financial officer, whose father started the business in 1988.Andreas Tostmann, chairman of the board of Volkswagen’s subsidiary Skoda in Slovakia, said the elimination of exchange rates meant “higher stability in planning and not least, the simplification of transactions inside the VW Group.”But VW, similar to Fiam, has markets outside the euro zone area, where its products become more expensive. “It is a nightmare,” Mr. Saro said.The fluctuations have motivated the company to try to sell more to the euro zone area.But Mr. Saro is still facing problems with tight credit. The banks, he said, are stricter in granting loans and customers are paying late.“We get paid but we don’t know when,” he said. “The point is that having adopted the euro, it is some kind of guarantee. But don’t ask me to look beyond the short term. These times are just too crazy.”'"
"'09-02-18,'1','Re “To Spend or to Save? Trick Question,” by David Leonhardt (Economic Scene column, Feb. 11):The “paradox of thrift” is an idea that needs to be put out of its misery once and for all. It’s been losing support among economists for many years, and for good reasons.It’s never an act of patriotism for individuals or families to buy stuff they cannot afford. Whether it’s rainy or sunny outside, saving a portion of one’s income for future use is always a wise idea. There is nothing paradoxical about these concepts.At the heart of the alleged “paradox of thrift” is the belief that private citizens behaving unwisely (thriftlessly) can at times produce good societal results. That belief is false. The idea that overindebted, chronically undersaving American consumers would somehow be serving their country in its time of need by maxing out yet more of their credit cards is surely an idea whose time has passed.Yes, individuals can incur “good debt” — in general, current expenditures aimed at future gains, like the cost of education, or of winterizing a home. And yes, at the societal level, mainstream economic theory suggests that in times of economic downturn, government can legitimately engage in deficit spending to moderate the downturn (just as surpluses are called for in economic boom times). But again, there is no paradox here.The writer is president of the Institute for American Values and the author of a book about thrift.'"
"'09-02-18,'1','A billionaire who owns Italy’s largest private media empire, Mr. Berlusconi has been repeatedly convicted of corruption, only to see the charges overturned on appeal or wither when statutes of limitations lapsed. He has pleaded not guilty in each case. The more Mr. Berlusconi works the system to his advantage, the more Italians seem to admire him.“There is a part of Italian society that thinks it is scandalous that there is a prime minister who has faced so many charges, who has huge conflicts of interest,” said Sergio Romano, a columnist for the newspaper Corriere della Sera. “It’s probably a minority, but it is quite vocal.”He added, “I think that the real question we should ask is why there is a part of Italian society that isn’t scandalized?”Most Italians can barely keep Mr. Berlusconi’s many legal cases straight. It seems he barely can, either.“I’m the universal record-holder for the number of trials in the entire history of man — and also of other creatures who live on other planets,” he said last year.Roberto D’Alimonte, a political science professor at the University of Florence, said: “The only people who care is the anti-Berlusconi minority. Public opinion doesn’t — that’s part of the Berlusconi phenomenon.”There is also a kind of Catholic realpolitik, in which human beings are understood to be fallen.Alexander Stille, the author of “The Sack of Rome,” a critical account of the rise of Mr. Berlusconi, said most Italians have “talked themselves into the point of view that politics is a dirty business, that everyone has skeletons in the closet, judges have paid more attention to Berlusconi than to most people, therefore they found more skeletons.”Mr. Berlusconi entered politics in 1994, in the wake of a bribery scandal in which a third of the Parliament came under indictment. The judiciary was then seen as an admirable branch of government.But over the years, he has managed to transform public perceptions of the judiciary with his relentless accusations that they are left-wing ideologues unjustly singling him out.“There’s a part of the country that fears the left; they are afraid of the left, and Berlusconi preys on those fears,” Mr. Romano said.In December, prosecutors accused Mr. Mills of taking money in 2000 in exchange for providing false testimony in trials in 1997 and 1998 relating to offshore companies that Mr. Mills helped set up in the 1990s for Fininvest, Mr. Berlusconi’s holding company.Prosecutors said Mr. Mills failed to tell a court that two offshore companies involved in buying United States film rights had links to Mr. Berlusconi, The Associated Press reported. They also said Mr. Mills failed to mention a 1995 telephone call with Mr. Berlusconi in which the two discussed what were said to be illicit payments from Mr. Berlusconi to the Socialist leader Bettino Craxi, who died in 2000.On Tuesday, Mr. Mills was given a four-and-a-half-year sentence, but it is unlikely that he will serve jail time. Under Italian law, prison terms begin only after a definitive ruling. It is also unlikely that the two more rounds of appeals that are possible will end before 2010 — when the 10-year statute of limitations in such cases is up. Similarly, if Mr. Berlusconi stays in office until then, the case against him will die, too.Prosecutors in Milan began investigating Mr. Mills in 2004 after a tip from authorities in London, where Mr. Mills’s tax accountant had come forward with concerns about potential improper use of money.In 2004, Mr. Mills wrote to his accountant, Bob Drennan, about the tax status of a payment from associates of Mr. Berlusconi. In a letter to Mr. Drennan, Mr. Mills wrote, “I told no lies, but I turned some very tricky corners, to put it mildly, and so kept Mr. B. out of a great deal of trouble he would have been in had I said all I knew,” according to a widely published copy of the letter.In exchange for his testimony, he said, he received money that he “could treat as a long term loan or a gift.”In July 2004, Mr. Mills told prosecutors in Milan that the letter was accurate, and that he had received $600,000 from associates of Mr. Berlusconi in recognition for providing favorable testimony. Later Mr. Mills retracted his statement.Mr. Mills is the estranged husband of the British Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, who in a statement issued by her office on Tuesday said, “This is a terrible blow to David and although we are separated I have never doubted his innocence.”The prosecutor in the Mills trial, Fabio de Pasquale, has challenged the legality of the law granting Mr. Berlusconi and Italy’s highest elected officials immunity. The Constitutional Court of Italy has not yet ruled on the matter.News reports in the fall said Mr. Berlusconi was considering nominating Niccolò Ghedini, his own lawyer, to fill a vacancy on the Constitutional Court.In an interview last fall, Mr. Ghedini said that was unlikely, but not because of his involvement in the prime minister’s legal cases.“No, not at all,” he said then. “Because I like being a lawyer. I’d never want to be a judge.”'"

"'09-02-18,'1','Federer, who has not played the first phase of the Davis Cup since 2004, complained of a sore back near the end of last season. The injury forced him to retire during the Paris Masters Series, before facing Blake, and it visibly hampered him at the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai. There, he failed to advance past the round-robin phase for the first time.But he was healthy enough at the start of this season to reach the final of the Australian Open, where he was beaten in five sets by his archrival Rafael Nadal.Federer also announced Tuesday that he would skip next week’s tournament in Dubai, where he traditionally makes his return to the tour after Australia.“After injuring my back last fall, I did not have enough time to strengthen it completely,” Federer said in a statement posted on his Web site. “As a precautionary measure, I will use the next few weeks to make sure the back injury is fully rehabilitated.”Federer has said the injury is more a nagging concern than a major issue. His agent, Tony Godsick, said Federer was receiving treatment in Switzerland, but would soon return to train in Dubai, where Federer maintains a residence. “This was a difficult decision for him,” Godsick said. “Davis Cup means a lot to him. He’s close with his teammates, and he has a strong connection to Dubai.”Federer’s decision to discuss his back problems in some detail could have been intended to curtail speculation that his withdrawal from Dubai was linked to the political issues that have disrupted this week’s women’s tournament there.Shahar Peer, an Israeli who was scheduled to be in the women’s draw, was denied a visa by the Dubai authorities, generating criticism from players and tennis officials and prompting Larry Scott, the chief executive of the WTA Tour, to express doubts about the future of the tournament there.On Tuesday, tournament officials explained the reasoning behind denying Peer a visa, claiming in a statement that “public sentiment remains high in the Middle East, and it is believed that Ms. Peer’s presence would have antagonized our fans who have watched live television coverage of recent attacks in Gaza.”The tournament statement said that anti-Israel protests against Peer during a tournament last month in New Zealand raised security concerns for a prospective visit to Dubai.“Given public sentiment, the entire tournament could have been boycotted by protesters,” the statement said. “We do not wish to politicize sports, but we have to be sensitive to recent events in the region and not alienate or put at risk the players and the many tennis fans of different nationalities that we have here.”Peer said in an interview Tuesday with CNN that she had not been made aware of security concerns. “I’m sure none of you think that I would go to a country which is dangerous physically for me,” she said.Peer, ranked 45th, said the final-hour decision to deny her a visa “really hurts me professionally and personally.” She requested that the women’s tour allow her to keep the ranking points she won last year during the same week of the season in compensation for her being forced to miss Dubai.She also said in a statement released on the WTA Tour’s Web site that she supported the tournament’s going ahead this year without her because most of the other players were already in Dubai when she learned that she would not be allowed entry.Peer said in her statement that “denying them the right to play in this year’s tournament at the last moment would not make the wrong right.”She added: “In fact, it troubles me greatly that my doubles partner, Anna-Lena Grönefeld from Germany, will not be able to compete as we had planned. Going forward, I am confident that the tour will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future.”'"
"'09-02-18,'1','It was a prison where Duch’s word was final and an order like “kill them all” was a death sentence or “interrogate four persons, kill the rest” was one day’s assignment for his staff.The issue on Tuesday was whether to add a rare child survivor, Norng Chan Phal, now 38, to a list of civil parties in the case, although he had missed the filing deadline by two days.The argument of Duch’s lawyer, François Roux, amounted to a passionate rationale for defending people accused of the most terrible crimes, and of the primacy of legal principles in even the most emotionally charged cases. It was in effect an indictment of the methods and actions of the man he was defending.In a judicial proceeding, Mr. Roux said, rules are sacrosanct, the final line of defense of impartial justice.“We are defending a man, and although this man has acknowledged responsibility, he is entitled to a fair trial,” he said. “The work we are doing is hard work but essential, and we can only do our work if we respect the rule of law, respect the rights of the accused and respect the principle of an adversarial proceeding.”Duch, 66, in a crisp blue shirt and a new pair of glasses, leaned forward from time to time and conferred earnestly with his lawyers, lifting simultaneous-translation headphones from his ears.“I repeat that we respect the victims,” Mr. Roux said. “We also owe respect to the accused, and we also must respect the rule of law.”The child survivor was just discovered and presented to the press on Monday, adding his name to a very short list of people who through chance or good fortune had evaded the death sentence that was the first step in the judicial process of Tuol Sleng.The three other known survivors who are still alive attended the hearing, along with hundreds of diplomats, journalists, human rights workers and other victims of the Khmer Rouge who had joined the case as civil parties.“I could not sleep last night,” said one of the survivors, Vann Nath, 62. “I was waiting for the sunrise so that I could see Duch in the dock.”He added: “I think he is a very fortunate person, a very lucky person. Because when I was in jail, I could get three spoons of porridge a day and both my legs were put in shackles.”In an attempt to create an agrarian utopia, the Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as much as one-fourth of the population through starvation, exhaustion and disease, as well as torture and execution.Four other senior officials of the Khmer Rouge are in custody, waiting to follow Duch into court, perhaps next year. Their supreme leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998.'"

"'09-02-19,'0','That would leave the Treasury Department responsible for the vast majority of any financing for the carmakers. The largest DIP loan on record, made to Lyondell Chemical last month, was $8 billion, and that was obtained only after three weeks of breakneck negotiations.Mr. Altman had earlier thought that G.M. would need $50 billion in DIP financing to survive.Yet others contend that having that much financial cushion could assuage the fears of the creditors to the companies, leaving the carmakers with the cash necessary to keep the lights on and the factories running.DIP loans are actually relatively safe for the banks that make them, said Andrew O’Brien, co-head of syndicated and leveraged loans at JPMorgan Chase.That is because these loans typically mature within two years and must be paid back before other loans. Most professionals can recall only one big DIP loan, to Winstar Communications, that failed to be paid back.In fact, some experts, including Mr. Altman, have advocated pushing G.M. and Chrysler into bankruptcy with the government providing the DIP financing. That would help ensure that taxpayers are repaid first.The Treasury Department has already hired the investment bank Rothschild and the law firms Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and Sonnenschein, Nath & Rosenthal as advisers, largely to work on this very issue.Mr. Altman’s plan would most likely work by the government providing money through a bank or a financial firm like GE Capital. That, in turn, would be doled out in portions after G.M. hit certain milestones. He also suggested strong-arming banks that have received federal bailout money into contributing to the DIP package.The government could also benefit from the fees it would earn by providing DIP loans.According to lenders like GE Capital, the average interest rate on DIP loans has nearly doubled in the last two years, to 6.5 to 9.5 percent above benchmark interbank rates. Lenders have also doubled their fees.Lyondell, for instance, is paying more than 20 percent for its financing, a rate normally seen on credit cards.G.M. and Chrysler also have other options to a full-fledged Chapter 11 filing.The government could provide more bailout money or other aid while the companies try to restructure themselves outside of bankruptcy, a prospect that many see as an endless abyss.Another alternative is what is known as a prepackaged bankruptcy, in which the carmakers would line up restructuring agreements with their creditors and use the courts to make these accords binding.Yet such a plan would still require billions of dollars in financing, most of which would certainly come from the government.Some parts of the credit markets have begun to revive, but the market in bankruptcy loans remains a big worry for many.Despite the safety of DIP financing, many lenders are pulling back as they grapple with their own problems.“DIPs are no longer taken for granted,” said Deryck A. Palmer, the co-chairman of the financial restructuring practice at Cadwalader, which is representing Lyondell in its bankruptcy proceedings.The same financial turmoil that has pushed companies into bankruptcy is also taking a toll on the DIP market. Companies that gorged on debt in good times are struggling to pay that money back. Many pledged virtually all their assets as collateral on those debts, leaving little left to back DIP loans.“We haven’t changed the parameters by which we do a deal,” said Rob McMahon, the managing director of restructuring at GE Capital. “But companies have higher leverage and decreasing cash flow. They have more troubling prospects.”Some big players in DIP loans have run into trouble themselves. One big DIP financier was Lehman Brothers, which went bankrupt last September.Two others, Merrill Lynch and Wachovia, have sold themselves to other banks to avoid a similar fate. Hedge funds and private equity firms that also arrange such financing are suffering as well.Many of the biggest DIP lenders insist they are open for business. JPMorgan Chase, for example, is actively involved in the market, Mr. O’Brien said. GE Capital says it is too.But virtually everyone in the field says that the majority of loans are what are known as defensive DIPs, in which a company’s existing lenders provide new loans to protect their investment and their position in the capital structure. Companies and their bankers are more likely to piece together lending from existing lenders than seek fresh capital, or offensive DIPs, for some time.'"
"'09-02-19,'0','There are still palm trees, as in Vero Beach. But the complex lacks Dodgertown’s homey touch and is more corporate than rustic.“Growing up, you watch spring training Dodgers games in Vero Beach, but really, I think it makes the most sense to be out here,” pitcher Randy Wolf said. “A lot of Dodger fans want to come to spring training, and it’s really hard to get from there to Vero Beach. It’s a long flight. If you fly into Orlando, it’s a long drive to Vero Beach. But when you come out here, it makes it a lot more accessible to Dodgers fans.”The teams expect the stadium to be ready for its first spring training game March 1. But in a moribund economy, there is already concern over whether the Dodgers will reap the immediate financial benefits they sought by making spring training more accessible to their core fan base.It is that economic situation — and Ramírez’s age, 37 — that appears to limit his options and the Dodgers’ negotiating power with him. Boras and Ramírez rejected the Dodgers’ latest offer of $25 million for 2009; however, there appear to be no other legitimate suitors or offers waiting in the wings.“I don’t even want to think of the fact that he’s not a Dodger,” Torre said of Ramírez. “I just don’t want to think that way. The fact that I know that he enjoyed himself here last year and the fact that we want him back, hopefully, we can find a way to do it.”Colletti, the Dodgers’ general manager, said he had talked with Boras recently about Ramírez and would continue to do so.“There’s only so many things you control in life,” Colletti said. “I certainly don’t control him or Scott or anybody else. We do the best we can every day. We’re hopeful that we can get something figured out at some point in time. But if not, we’ll still play.”With the Boston Red Sox last season, Ramírez was ultimately ostracized because of his actions. But after he was traded, he lifted the Dodgers to a division title and nearly took them to the World Series.His former, and possibly current, teammates are in a wait-and-see pattern. The position players are now arriving in camp, so Ramírez’s absence and its potential effect have been negligible so far. The addition of Ramírez would transform an average and youthful lineup including Andre Ethier, James Loney, Matt Kemp and Russell Martin into a threatening one.“You can talk about it all you want, but either he’s going to sign with us or he’s not,” Martin said. “So, we’re just trying to not really think about it that much.”Torre said: “We’re all better if he’s here offensively because of what he brings to the table and how much he scares the opposition. I can give you a chapter and verse on scaring the opposition.”The chapters of Torre’s book created a considerable stir, particularly his unflattering comments about Alex Rodriguez and his somewhat uninhibited thoughts about other players and executives. But the Dodgers seem unconcerned about fallout from the book or the possibility that players might be less willing to confide in Torre.“Joe’s a veteran,” Colletti said. “Manager, veteran, human being. If he senses that there’s some anxiety or some uneasiness, I’m sure he’ll address it either one on one or as a group.”Bowa, who coached with Torre on the Yankees, said he had read the book.“If you just read snippets of it, you have a right to overreact,” he said. “But if you read it, I think it’s a good book, I really do.”Why shouldn’t Bowa put a positive spin on things? It is spring and change is in the air for the Dodgers. The overriding concern, though, is the locker with no nameplate — the one that sits both occupied and unoccupied.'"

"'09-02-19,'0','The United Arab Emirates will issue an entry visa to Andy Ram of Israel for next week’s Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships, Representative Anthony D. Weiner said Wednesday.“I’ve gotten the assurance from the ambassador,” Weiner, Democrat from New York, said by telephone, referring to Yousef Al Otaiba, the U.A.E.’s ambassador to the United States.The decision to grant Ram a visa to enter Dubai, one of the Emirates, comes after the government’s denial of a visa to another Israeli, Shahar Peer, the 48th-ranked women’s player in the world. She was to play in this week’s tournament in Dubai. The WTA Tour did not cancel the women’s tournament, but the Tennis Channel dropped its weekend coverage.Tournament officials cited local public opinion about Israel’s incursion into the Gaza Strip, the possibility of a spectator boycott and the security of Peer as reasons to deny her a visa.On Wednesday, Weiner said: “It was my sense from the ambassador that he was looking to do the right thing, but that’s small consolation to Miss Peer. He understood that they had made a mistake and they had a public relations problem.”The decision to grant Ram a visa could not be independently confirmed with the U.A.E. embassy in Washington or by the ATP Tour.Ken Solomon, the chairman and chief executive of the Tennis Channel, said the network was looking into its archive to find Peer’s best tournament performance to replay Feb. 28 or March 1, the dates of the men’s semifinals and final.'"
"'09-02-19,'0','Sakhalin 2 is the largest Russian energy project supplying Asia to come into production to date.Though partly nationalized by the state energy company Gazprom in 2006, it is still operated by its original developer, the British-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell. Two Japanese trading houses, Mitsui and Mitsubishi, are also partners.The development links three offshore platforms, hundreds of miles of pipelines and the liquefied natural gas plant along an isolated stretch of Pacific coastline. When it reaches full capacity in 2010, it will chill and ship about 5 percent of the world’s liquefied natural gas supply.President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia and Prime Minister Taro Aso of Japan attended the opening Wednesday.Apparently addressing worries in Europe over Russia’s use of energy as a political weapon, Mr. Medvedev struck a conciliatory tone, acknowledging that “mistakes” were made in Russian energy policy in the past.“At times we do not fully calculate political risks and practical consequences,” Mr. Medvedev said, without elaborating, according to the Itar-Tass news service.Still, Russia’s energy ambitions in the Asian Pacific are only gathering momentum.This week, Russia’s national oil company, Rosneft, and national pipeline operator, Transneft, completed a deal for $25 billion in loans from the China Development Bank. In exchange, the Russian companies agreed to provide 300,000 barrels of oil a day to China over 20 years through a trans-Siberian oil pipeline that is scheduled to reach China in 2010.Russia’s economic situation has so deteriorated that even typically upbeat financial analysts have been taking on a funereal tone.Chris Weafer, chief analyst for UralSib bank in Moscow, published a research note Wednesday describing the Russian equity markets as “a highway along which asset valuations and investor sentiments are being driven by the infernal troika of oil, ruble and economy. All three of which have reached the banks of the river Styx and are scrambling to find the appropriate number of kopeks to pay the ferryman.”In a measure of Russia’s economic troubles, corporations here must repay $117 billion in debt to Western banks this year, in a stark reversal from the inflow of foreign investor money that buoyed Russia’s economy in recent years.Thus, the $25 billion oil deal with China will offset nearly a quarter of this so-called capital account deficit in 2009. This deficit is one factor pushing down the ruble’s value and depressing the Moscow stock exchanges.If the global recession deepens, the Kremlin may be willing to put more on sale, economists say.“If the situation remains tense in Russia and the world economy, we will see more concessions to China,” possibly in metals or mining as well as energy, Vladimir I. Tikhomirov, chief economist at UralSib, said in a telephone interview.The Sakhalin 2 site, in the works since the early 1990s, has had a turbulent history. In 2006, a Russian environmental regulator threatened to halt work on a pipeline, claiming illegal logging and damage to salmon streams.After a tense few months, Shell and the Japanese trading houses agreed to sell 50 percent plus one share — a controlling stake — to Gazprom for $7.45 billion. After the sale, the environmental objections were lifted.'"
"'09-02-19,'0','He would have been eligible for parole in July. His early release was interpreted by his family, his supporters and political analysts as a purely political gesture. It came at a time of mounting pressure on Egyptian officials over their handling of the Gaza crisis, and the summary arrest of protesters, bloggers and Islamists. While his release was welcomed, it was also seen as evidence that Egypt’s justice system was ruled by decree, not law.“I am happy he is out, but I am sad that the executive power and the president can interfere directly in judicial outcomes,” said Alaa Aswani, a writer and sharp social critic of Egyptian society. “The president can put someone in jail and can pardon him and then look for a legal pretext. This is the sad part.”Mr. Nour’s imprisonment ended Egypt’s brief experiment with allowing opposition politics to flourish. His Al Gahd Party had become the only legal opposition with a growing, anti-establishment following. In 2005 Mr. Nour garnered 600,000 votes in his bid for the presidency, placing a distant second behind Mr. Mubarak in a race controlled by the president’s governing party.Mr. Nour’s wife, Gamila Ismail, said she had been running errands on Wednesday when the doorman in her building called and told her to rush home. He put her husband on the phone and he said, “I need the keys, I want to go home.” Absolutely stunned, she asked how he had got out. “ ‘I didn’t jump the wall,’ ” she said he replied.In an interview two days earlier, Mr. Nour’s wife held prison documents in her hand that she said proved that the government was planning to keep her husband behind bars beyond his earliest possible parole date, July 21. She said they had accused him of attacking guards and prison doctors.“They want to keep him until he surrenders and gets broken,” she said, wiping tears from her eyes. “It’s endless.”On Wednesday, she was happy, but also dumbfounded. “Nothing can be expected from this regime, good or bad,” she said, with a frozen smile and glazed eyes. “Even when it involves you personally.”The Egyptian government refused to budge on the Nour case when international pressure was strongest. Mr. Nour had served in Parliament for 10 years, but he gained prominence after his arrest. Condoleezza Rice, secretary of state at the time, postponed a trip to Egypt to protest his imprisonment.The Egyptian government bristled at the pressure and dug in.There was speculation on Wednesday that Mr. Nour’s release was delayed until after Mr. Bush left office, in part as a swipe at his administration and in part as a good-will gesture to the Obama administration.“All the pretexts for his release today are unacceptable, and no one can believe it,” said Salama Ahmed Salama, editor of an independent daily newspaper, Shorouq. “It can be seen in the framework of improving relations with the United States.”During his time in prison, Mr. Nour’s wife was his greatest advocate, traveling the world, fighting to keep his party alive and attending rallies, all in an effort to keep up pressure on the Egyptian government. She was also left alone to raise two sons. The state responded by filing charges against her and threatening her with prison.Then suddenly it was over. Mr. Nour rang his doorbell late in the day. No one answered, so he put his bag down in front of the door and went down to the doorman. His son, Shady, had been sleeping. He eventually got up, walked over to open the door, saw the bag and smelled his father’s cologne.“I called my girlfriend and said, ‘I think my father is free,’ ” Shady recalled. At that moment, the elevator door opened and Mr. Nour walked into his son’s arms.Within an hour, he was dressed in a neat charcoal suit with a peach tie and surrounded by dozens of reporters, photographers and cameramen. The crowd was frenzied, knocking over lamps and climbing on furniture, but Mr. Nour seemed happy, content to talk, to be jostled, to be free.“Jail changed me in that I read more in those four years than I have read in 40 years, and I have written more in those four years than I have written in 40 years,” he said. “I do not regret anything.”He then drove off to appear on one of Egypt’s most popular late-night talk shows.'"

Court officials said a new jury would be sworn in, and the case could resume this week. The trial centers on allegations that the defendants, in concert with organizers linked to Al Qaeda, plotted in 2006 to use liquid explosives concealed in soft-drink bottles to bring down several airliners as they flew from London’s Heathrow airport. The prosecutor, Peter Wright, said the police had recovered “martyrdom” videos made by six of the defendants in a raid on a house near London. A video played in court had Abdulla Ahmed Ali, who is suspected of being a ringleader, saying he would carry out a mission that would teach non-Muslims “a lesson that they will never forget.”'"

"'09-02-19,'0','In “The Help,” Kathryn Stockett’s button-pushing, soon to be wildly popular novel about black domestic servants working in white Southern households in the early 1960s, one woman works especially tirelessly. She labors long into the night. She is exhausted. Her eyes are stinging, her fingers bloody and sore.Is she ironing pleats? Scrubbing toilets? Polishing silver for an all-important meeting of the local bridge club? No way. She is Miss Skeeter Phelan, a white woman. And the white women of “The Help” don’t do those demeaning jobs. They don’t do much of anything else either.But brave, tenacious Skeeter is different. So she is slaving away on a book that will blow the lid off the suffering endured by black maids in Jackson, Miss. Skeeter’s going to call the place “Niceville,” but she won’t make it sound nice. All of Jackson’s post-sorority girls from Ole Miss will be up in arms if Skeeter’s tell-all book sees the light of day.The trouble on the pages of Skeeter’s book is nothing compared with the trouble Ms. Stockett’s real book risks getting into. Here is a debut novel by a Southern-born white author who renders black maids’ voices in thick, dated dialect. (“Law have mercy,” one says, when asked to cooperate with the book project. “I reckon I’m on do it.”) It’s a story that purports to value the maids’ lives while subordinating them to Skeeter and her writing ambitions. And it celebrates noblesse oblige so readily that Skeeter’s act of daring earns her a gift from a local black church congregation. “This one, this is for the white lady,” the Reverend of that church says. “You tell her we love her, like she’s our own family.”A brief word now about Ms. Stockett: When she moved to New York City from Jackson, she came to understand how deeply ambivalent she felt about her roots. If a New Yorker told her that Jackson must be beautiful, she would say it was fraught with crime. But if a New Yorker spoke contemptuously about Jackson, Ms. Stockett would rise to its defense. “Mississippi is like my mother,” she writes in an afterword to “The Help.” And you will see, after your wrestling match with this problematic but ultimately winning novel, that when it comes to the love-hate familial bond between Ms. Stockett and her subject matter, she’s telling the truth.Expectations notwithstanding, it’s not the black maids who are done a disservice by this white writer; it’s the white folk. The two principal maid characters, the lovingly maternal Aibileen and the angry, scrappy Minny, leap off the page in all their warm, three-dimensional glory. Book groups armed with hankies will talk and talk about their quiet bravery and the outrageous insults dished out by their vain, racist employers.The worst of these bosses, a woman known as Miss Hilly, treats Minny like a thief. And she campaigns to have Jackson households install extra toilets so that colored help will not have to use white families’ restricted bathrooms. With the kind of lead-footed linkage that runs throughout this novel  even though it may accurately reflect what Ms. Stockett witnessed in her Southern girlhood  Miss Hilly’s Junior League does its fund-raising for the sake of “the Poor Starving Children of Africa” while treating the poor African-Americans of Jackson as if they were subhuman.Miss Hilly is enough of a witch for readers to wait eagerly for a house to fall on her. She makes herself the nemesis of each of the book’s black characters and many of its white ones. Sounding decades older than Skeeter even though the two were college roommates, Hilly shrieks villainously about the virtues of segregation and the rectitude of Mississippi’s politicians.News of the real world seeps into the book only occasionally, with a brief televised glimpse of James Meredith integrating Ole Miss or other muffled rendered news. “There is a skirmish in Vietnam,” Skeeter notices. “The reporter seems to think it’ll be solved without much fuss.”The tide of soapsuds rises as Skeeter comes across a copy of Jim Crow laws and is galvanized into action; as Skeeter the liberal-minded spinster begins dating the son of an intolerant local politician; as Skeeter begins wondering what happened to Constantine, the maid who lovingly raised her; and as both Aibileen and Minny become increasingly privy to the secrets of their employers’ households.Though “The Help” might well have veered off into violent repression of these maids’ outspokenness (one character is blinded for having accidentally used a whites-only bathroom), Ms. Stockett doesn’t take it there. She’s interested in the affection and intimacy buried beneath even the most seemingly impersonal household connections.Aibileen is this book’s loveliest character, especially in scenes that have her raising Mae Mobley, the toddler now in her charge. Having endured the pain of raising white child after white child only to see them grow up and away from her, Aibileen is still ready to embrace another one. On the evidence of Ms. Stockett’s autobiographical afterword, this is the part of the story she knows best; she herself had an absentee white mother and was raised by a black woman named Demetrie. She loved Demetrie dearly without ever giving much thought to what Demetrie’s life was like, and she says that “The Help” was written to fill in that gap.Mae Mobley’s little games include pretending to stage a sit-in at a Woolworth’s counter and pretending to ride the bus with Rosa Parks. Or so it goes in this ultimately soft-pedaled version of Southern women’s lives, one in which real danger is usually at a distance.At one point Skeeter hears a strange new guy, Bob Dylan, singing a strange new song, “The Times They Are A-Changin’,” and finds herself full of optimism. Had she heard the same Bob Dylan singing “The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,” his accusatory song about the fatal caning of a 51-year-old black barmaid by a young white patrician, “The Help” might have ventured outside its harsh yet still comfortable, reader-friendly world.'"
"'09-02-19,'0','The Betty Kaplan Teams is one of the most enjoyable events on the Greater New York Bridge Association calendar. There are six nine-board matches, and a player must partner each of three teammates in two matches.This year’s event was held at the New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan on Feb. 7. The winners were David Moss, Andrew Rosenthal and Daniel Wilderman of New York and Robert Heitzman Jr. of Suffern, N.Y. Second were Rachael Moller, David Gurvich, Carleton Lett and Michael Lipkin of New York.The winners combined well to earn a swing in the diagramed deal.At the other table Moss (West), despite being vulnerable, overcalled the two-club opening with two hearts. As he hoped, when North passed, Wilderman (East) could raise to four hearts. South doubled, not willing to force to the five-level, and North passed, his only values being in the opponents’ suit.Declarer lost one spade, two hearts, one diamond and one club to go minus two.Six clubs by Rosenthal came down to a spade guess. After winning the first trick with his heart ace, South cashed three clubs and four diamonds. Then he crossed to dummy’s club nine and threw a spade on the heart king.West discarded one spade, the nine, which was, in theory, encouraging. This made declarer suspicious. Why would West advertise the spade ace? Surely he would not. Also, West might have started with the spade ace if he had it, or at least thought about it. He had led the heart jack surprisingly quickly.These conclusions would not have been valid against everyone, but Rosenthal, confident of his reading of this opponent, played a spade to his king to make the slam.'"

Judge Espinoza based his decision on Mr. Polanski’s fugitive status, but said the order would not become final until May 7, giving Mr. Polanski time to consider an appearance to plead his case. If Mr. Polanski, who lives in France, were to return to the United States, evidence that “substantial misconduct occurred” during the case would be considered, the judge said.'"
"'09-02-19,'0','NEW DELHI —India’s highest-level investigative agency agreed Wednesday to open an inquiry into the software outsourcing company Satyam Computer Services, a move that might complicate a quick sale of the company.The Central Bureau of Investigation, analogous to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States, will take over from the police in the state of Andhra Pradesh, where Satyam is headquartered, and a patchwork of ministries, regulators and agencies that are looking into the vast fraud at the outsourcing company.B. Ramalinga Raju, the founder of Satyam, confessed in January to padding the books and said he had fabricated holdings of some $1 billion in cash.The C.B.I., as the agency is known, “proposes to undertake an all-encompassing investigation into the scam,” it said in a statement. The bureau is establishing a “multidisciplinary investigation team” in Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh, and will be consulting daily with market regulators, the national Department of Revenue, the state government and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.Meanwhile, Satyam is pulling hundreds of employees out of the United States as business slows, a company spokeswoman said Wednesday. The spokeswoman, Archana Muthappa, said several hundred employees had been moved back to India, where they continued to work for the company. She said local newspaper reports that 1,500 employees had been relocated were false, but would not specify how many employees had been moved.'"
"'09-02-19,'0','Despite solid ratings at its flagship broadcast network, the CBS Corporation had a sharp drop in revenue and profit in the recent quarter as advertising deteriorated.Over all in the fourth quarter, CBS, a part of Sumner M. Redstone’s media empire, reported revenue of $3.53 billion, down 6 percent from last year’s fourth quarter. This was slightly below the $3.58 billion expected by Wall Street analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.Its net profit in the quarter was $136.1 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with $273 million, or 40 cents a share, in last year’s fourth quarter.To strengthen its finances and preserve cash as the economy deteriorates, CBS drastically cut its quarterly dividend, to 5 cents a share, from 27 cents. In the last three years — since Mr. Redstone split his empire into two public companies, Viacom and CBS — CBS has paid out $5.5 billion in dividends to shareholders.Last week, CBS had 12 of the top 20 shows in prime time, programs like “NCIS,” “The Mentalist” and “CSI,” according to Nielsen Media Research. Yet revenue at the company’s television segment declined 8 percent, to $2.2 billion, in the quarter. Operating income in television declined 40 percent, to $272.2 million.'"
"'09-02-19,'0','In the hush-hush world of Swiss banking, the unthinkable is happening: secrets are spilling into the open.UBS, the largest bank in Switzerland, agreed on Wednesday to divulge the names of well-heeled Americans whom the authorities suspect of using offshore accounts at the bank to evade taxes. The bank admitted conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and agreed to pay $780 million to settle a sweeping federal investigation into its activities.It is unclear how many of its clients’ names UBS will divulge. Federal prosecutors have been examining about 19,000 accounts at the bank, but UBS ultimately may disclose the identities of only a few hundred customers.But to some, turning over any names at all heralds the end of the secret Swiss bank account, whose traditions date to the Middle Ages.“The Swiss are saying that this is the end of Swiss banking as they knew it,” said Jack Blum, an offshore tax specialist. “Nobody will trust the security of the Swiss bank account.”As part of the settlement, UBS agreed to cooperate with a broad summons issued by the Justice Department to turn over the names. Under the terms of a so-called deferred prosecution agreement, the bank and its executives could be indicted if UBS didn’t identify the customers.UBS has said it is closing the offshore accounts of its American clients. But under the deal with the United States authorities, the bank must provide periodic written evidence of that to prosecutors. UBS earned $200 million annually from the business.Prosecutors suspect that from late 2002 to 2007, UBS helped American clients illegally hide $20 billion, letting them evade $300 million a year in taxes.In a striking admission, UBS said that from 2000 through 2007, some of its private bankers and managers had “participated in a scheme to defraud the United States” and the I.R.S. by helping American clients set up and conceal offshore accounts. The scheme involved falsifying or not properly obtaining or filing certain tax forms required of both the bank and its clients.UBS’s offshore private banking business once employed some 60 private bankers in Lugano, Zurich and Geneva. Prosecutors claimed UBS referred clients to lawyers and accountants who set up secret offshore entities to conceal assets from the I.R.S.UBS urged some American clients to destroy records and to stash watches, jewelry and artwork that they had bought with money hidden offshore in safe deposit boxes in Switzerland. The bank also encouraged them to use Swiss credit cards so the I.R.S. could not track purchases. In a statement on Wednesday, Peter Kurer, the chairman of UBS, said that “UBS sincerely regrets the compliance failures in its U.S. cross-border business that have been identified by the various government investigations in Switzerland and the U.S., as well as our own internal review. We accept full responsibility for these improper activities.”Marcel Rohner, the group chief executive of UBS, said in a statement that “it is apparent that as an organization we made mistakes and that our control systems were inadequate.”In January a senior UBS executive, Raoul Weil, was declared a fugitive, two months after being indicted by a federal judge in connection with the investigation of the bank. Mr. Weil, a Swiss citizen, oversaw the cross-border private banking operations from 2002 to 2007.UBS had fiercely resisted turning over the names, even after some executives were indicted and implicated in the offshore private banking business. Swiss law distinguishes broadly between tax avoidance, tax evasion and tax fraud. Unlike in the United States, tax evasion is not a criminal offense under Swiss law.The move by UBS to settle the case, on the eve of a Senate subcommittee hearing next Tuesday on the matter, signals how close the bank came to being indicted for not cooperating with prosecutors. Indictment is a near-certain death knell for corporations.Of the $780 million that UBS will pay, $380 million represents disgorgement of profits from its cross-border business. The remainder represents United States taxes that UBS failed to withhold on the accounts. The figures include interest, penalties and restitution for unpaid taxesAs part of the deal, UBS also entered into a consent order with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which it agreed to charges of having acted as an unregistered broker-dealer and investment adviser for Americans.The settlement caps a painful run for UBS, which suffered more than $50 billion in losses in the collapse of the American mortgage market and received a $60 billion bailout from the Swiss government last October.The bank will not have to pay additional fines and penalties, which could have brought the deal to more than $1 billion. People briefed on the issue said the banking crisis and the recession were factors in this decision by prosecutors.'"
"'09-02-19,'0','JOHANNESBURG — A magistrate in Zimbabwe on Wednesday ruled that Roy Bennett, the third-highest-ranking member of the political opposition, should be tried on terrorism charges and remain in prison for at least the next three weeks.Mr. Bennett, who was to be sworn in Wednesday as deputy agriculture minister in the new power-sharing government of the opposition and President Robert Mugabe’s party, was taken back to a prison cell, clad in the white shorts and khaki shirt issued to inmates. He and his party have denied the charges against him.His case has become the highest-profile test of whether the opposition party and its leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, the new prime minister, will have the clout to insist on a return to democracy and the rule of law. Over the years, Zimbabwe’s judicial system has been compromised by threats of violence against judges who went against Mr. Mugabe’s wishes, and by gifts of land and other luxury goods to compliant judges.Mr. Bennett, who after three years in exile returned only recently to Zimbabwe because his party agreed to join the government, sadly shook his head, with his hand over his mouth, when the provincial magistrate, Livingstone Chipadze, announced that the state had sufficient grounds to hold him on charges of possessing unlicensed firearms with the intent to commit acts of terrorism and sabotage against the state.Mr. Bennett’s lawyers said they would appeal the ruling.Even as his case took a discouraging turn for his party, another opposition official who had faced treason charges that were only recently withdrawn, Tendai Biti, the new finance minister, announced that the government would pay 130,000 soldiers, teachers and civil servants $100 a month in American dollars. Mr. Biti hopes it will get them back to work, but the move also seems intended to help win their loyalty to the new government.'"
"'09-02-19,'0','In a step that many investors hope will help unfreeze the municipal bond markets, the mortgage insurer MBIA said Wednesday that it had separated its traditional municipal business from its younger and more troubled line of insuring structured-finance products.In the future, MBIA said, an independent-operating subsidiary called the National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation would offer insurance for municipal bonds. Its headquarters will be in New York.MBIA’s chief executive, Joseph W. Brown Jr., said regulators and independent analysts had been stress-testing the company, as well as the old one, and were satisfied that each one could hold up under a variety of adverse conditions.“Both came to the same conclusion: that we would continue to have the resources to pay all expected claims as they came due,” Mr. Brown said in a letter to shareholders issued Wednesday. With the separation, he said, there was no reason to fear that the municipal bond company would end up subsidizing the structured-finance business.The ratings agency, Standard & Poor’s, said Wednesday that it had assigned the new company a double-A rating.'"
"'09-02-19,'0','The Comcast Corporation, the nation’s largest cable TV provider, said Wednesday that its fourth-quarter earnings fell 32 percent, hampered by a $600 million write-down of its investment in the Clearwire Corporation, the wireless technology provider.Comcast’s revenue and adjusted earnings beat Wall Street estimates, however, helped by growth in Comcast’s video segment.Comcast also raised its annual dividend by 2 cents a share, to 27 cents.In the fourth quarter, Philadelphia-based Comcast earned $412 million, or 14 cents a share, compared with $602 million, or 20 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago.The Clearwire write-down was expected; other investors like Google, the Intel Corporation and Time Warner Cable have recently taken similar charges against their earnings.Excluding items like the Clearwire charge, Comcast earned 27 cents a share, up 7 cents a share from the same quarter last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected an adjusted profit of 22 cents a share.'"
"'09-02-19,'0','Home values, which rose steadily for more than a decade, have fallen by an average of about 25 percent from their peaks, and economists expect that prices will continue to slide as more people lose their jobs and the economy slips deeper into recession.“Housing and the U.S. economy are still in a free fall,” said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight. “It’s clear that we haven’t done anything to stabilize housing. We haven’t stabilized the rise in foreclosures. And until we do that, I think we’re not going to see a bottom.”Investors seemed to take the housing report in stride.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.03 points, to 7,555.63, while the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 0.75 point, or 0.1 percent, to 788.42. The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.69 points, to 1,467.97.A day earlier, markets fell sharply on worries about the stability of banking systems in Eastern Europe and across the world, with the Dow sliding within reach of its lowest levels since the start of the credit crisis.Banking stocks continued to lose ground Wednesday, with shares of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America each falling more than 4.5 percent. Analysts say that investors are likely to remain wary of jumping back into stock markets until they see some sign of a turnaround in the battered financial system.The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 30/32, to 99 30/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.76 percent, from 2.65 percent.In January, the pace of housing starts was 56.2 percent below its levels in January 2008, a sign of how much builders have scaled back construction. Single-family housing starts fell 12 percent from December, to an annual pace of 347,000.Building permits, which offer a glimpse of future construction, were also lower in January, falling 4.8 percent, to a seasonally adjusted rate of 521,000.In normal times, builders need to construct 1.25 million to 2 million new housing units every year to keep pace with immigration, the natural growth of the country’s population and the demand for newer homes, said James Glassman, senior United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.If there is one bright spot to dwindling new-home construction, it is that supplies will eventually fall in line with demand. At the end of December, the inventory of unsold homes fell to a 9.3-month supply from an 11.2-month supply a month earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors.“Eventually that’s how you get your inventory in line,” Mr. Glassman said. “The problem with the builders is that they’re competing with property that’s coming to the market from foreclosures. There’s this tug of war going on between the resale market and the builders.”Following are the results of Wednesday’s Treasury auction of four-week bills:'"

He was 85.The cause was prostate cancer, said his daughter Jessica Lipschutz.Mr. Yavitz, who was known professionally as Bob, served as dean of Columbia Business School from 1975 to 1982. A popular professor since 1964, specializing in business strategy, he was appointed to the dean’s position by the university president, William J. McGill, who had been asked by the business faculty members to name one of their own to lead them. They had become frustrated and divided by a series of unsuccessful deans who had been appointed from outside the academic world.As dean, Mr. Yavitz was credited with increasing applications, re-establishing connections with the school’s alumni and enlarging and improving the faculty. Perhaps most important, colleagues said, he restored the spirit of the school after a chaotic period, unified a schismatic faculty and restored order to promotion and tenure.Mr. Yavitz was born on June 4, 1923, in Tbilisi, in what is now Georgia, but grew up through the age of 14 mostly in Tel Aviv. He attended boarding school in England, earned a degree at Cambridge and served in the British Navy during World War II.He moved to the United States at 23, earned a master’s degree in engineering at Columbia and started a land development company.

"'09-02-20,'0','Mr. Vranich warned that spreading the money around the country could dilute its power to build a true high-speed system, and he predicted that making incremental improvements to the speeds of trains around the country would not be enough to get large numbers of people to stop flying.Even with full financing, it could take a decade or more to build a bullet train line. The state now closest to building a true high-speed system is California, where voters approved borrowing $9 billion last fall to begin building a train that can go faster than 220 m.p.h.“The California high-speed rail project is the only genuine pending project,” said Judge Quentin L. Kopp, the chairman of the California High-Speed Rail Authority.Mr. Kopp has outlined plans to spend up to $2 billion of the stimulus money by the deadline of 2012 — one-quarter of the available federal money, but only a small part of the $45 billion the project is expected to cost.Many other states also have big plans. , which is part of the Southeast High-Speed Rail Corridor, will seek some of the stimulus money to speed rail service between and Washington. wants to use some of it on a line linking and , hoping to have trains running up to 110 m.p.h. Officials in want to be on a faster line connecting and .Many rail advocates said that it would make sense to move to higher-speed rail before building true high-speed rail, and that getting the nation’s long-neglected rail system into working order could lay the foundation for future high-speed projects.“You’ve got to walk before you can run, and we’ve just been crawling up to now,” said Ross B. Capon, the president of the National Association of Railroad Passengers, an advocacy group for riders.Many passenger trains run on tracks owned by freight companies, and they are slowed on long stretches of single track, where trains must pull onto sidings so others can pass.Federal transportation officials said that they were still drawing up guidelines for how the money would be spent, and cautioned that it was too early to predict what they would do. Transportation Secretary told reporters in Washington this week that he believed high-speed rail would be ’s transportation priority. Mr. LaHood said the department had recently given the White House a memorandum describing plans for high-speed rail in “at least six corridors” across the country.But people who were excited by that prospect may be surprised to hear that the federal government defines “high speed” as much slower than other countries do. A diesel train in the United States that can go 90 m.p.h. is still considered high-speed under the government’s definition.So some projects financed by the bill may simply get intercity passenger rail back to where it was earlier in the 20th century, rather than closer to the futuristic vision of the trains of and , like the magnetic levitation, or maglev, train that whisks passengers from to its airport 19 miles away in seven minutes, attaining a speed of 259 m.p.h.The Acela is the United States’ fastest train. But because the tracks it runs on are curvy, and are shared with many other trains, it is only able to reach its top speed of 150 m.p.h. on about 35 miles of track in and . Its average speed is 84 m.p.h. between New York and Washington. Still, has captured 62 percent of the combined air and rail market between New York and Washington, company officials said.High-speed rail has a long, tortured history in the United States, going back to 1965, when Congress passed the High-Speed Ground Transportation Act. Since then, it has been proposed by many governors and studied in countless plans, always holding out the promise of catching up with other countries.Voters in passed a constitutional amendment requiring the state to build a high-speed rail system, only to repeal it a few years later after several prominent businesses, along with , who was then the governor, complained of its expense.C. C. Dockery, who sponsored the campaign for the amendment, said in an interview that he and the other members of the Florida High-Speed Rail Authority were planning to meet late this month to discuss how to go about seeking some of the federal money.“It would be a huge benefit to Florida,” Mr. Dockery said.'"
"'09-02-20,'0','A federal judge on Thursday ordered the federal prosecutors whose investigation exposed former Gov. Eliot Spitzer’s involvement with a prostitute to unseal court records that may shed some light on the origins of the case, which led to his resignation in March 2008.The judge, Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan, ordered federal prosecutors to provide the records  sworn affidavits that were part of wiretap applications in the case  to The New York Times, which in December filed a motion to have the material unsealed.Prosecutors argued that the documents should not be released, citing the privacy concerns of the more than 60 apparent clients of the prostitution ring who were intercepted and the need for confidentiality of law enforcement investigations.But The Times agreed to the redaction of the names of the people who were apparently clients, and Judge Rakoff said there was no longer a need for confidentiality concerning the investigation, which has concluded with charges against four people involved in the ring. Mr. Spitzer was never charged with a crime.The judge, in ruling for The Times, wrote that “there is obvious interest in obtaining information about the origins of an investigation that led, ultimately, to the resignation of the governor.”Such documents generally detail the early stages of an inquiry and describe the investigative steps taken as part of the request that a judge sign a wiretap order. In this case, the government was seeking to tap the cellphones of two people involved in the escort service, Emperor’s Club V.I.P.The documents were not immediately released; Judge Rakoff ordered prosecutors to make the redactions and release them next week.According to the briefs filed by both sides, no federal judge has ordered the unsealing of such documents at the request of a news organization. A spokeswoman for the office of the prosecutor, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, would not say whether an appeal was planned.'"
"'09-02-20,'0','Business owners and their tax advisers are finding that a little detective work is needed to reap the full benefits of the law, which includes tax relief for businesses and individuals, as well as spending provisions.Todd Flemming, chief executive of the Advantor Systems Corporation, a military contractor, for example, said he found spending allocated to military construction. His company, based in Orlando, Fla., makes and installs high-security systems at military installations worldwide. “That’s spending that would be stimulative for us,” he said.Not everyone will be served directly, said Leonard Steinberg, who owns Steinberg Enterprises, a tax, financial and business advisory company in West Windsor, N.J. His clients, including mom and pop retailers, limited liability companies and S corporations — corporations that elect to have their income pass through to the shareholders — “won’t see the benefits of the stimulus,” he said.Even so, tax specialists say, those companies may be aided indirectly by the tax relief for individuals, which will give workers more money to spend and will help certain taxpayers avoid the alternative minimum tax.At the same time, some of the tax provisions for businesses, while they mean well, may not help in the way intended, said Barbara Weltman, a tax specialist and author of “J. K. Lasser’s Small Business Taxes 2009.”She cited one provision that allows businesses to deduct up to $250,000 for capital investments. “That sounds great,” Ms. Weltman said, “but you can’t benefit from it unless you are profitable.” She added that many businesses were having trouble securing financing, but, if that should free up, the incentive was there.Another provision gives companies a 50 percent bonus deduction on capital investments made in 2009 that normally would be deducted over many years. “Again, that only benefits those who are making capital investments,” Ms. Weltman said. “So many people are struggling to pay bills that they cannot go out and make purchases.”One tax measure she likes is the ability of companies to use losses from 2008 to offset profits in earlier years — any full year that is more than two but less than six years ago — and obtain an immediate refund. It is only for 2008, she pointed out, and for companies with annual revenue of up to $15 million.Mr. Fredrich said he had looked for a silver lining in the law but had yet to find one. “We certainly will have a loss to carry back, but we could do that before the bill passed,” he said. “It does not even move the needle. If you have no revenue, nothing else matters.”He said he had hoped in vain for a reduction in the highest personal tax rate, a change that would have allowed him to put the money back into his business.Now that the bill has been signed, he said he had not had time to read all 1,000 pages, but he was not optimistic about finding help for his company, which had its last production day of the week on Wednesday.Weekly orders at MCM used to generate $100,000 to $180,000, Mr. Fredrich said. Last week, the company took in $32,000, and this week $19,000. “We expect it to be worse,” he said. “You just have to gut it out.”'"
"'09-02-20,'0','“Our expectation is that this is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Diana Aviv, president and chief executive of Independent Sector, a trade association for nonprofit groups, pointing to a decline in donations and the difficulty such groups are having in getting loans.Performing arts groups typically are the nonprofits hit first in economic downturns, as donors devote more of their giving to charities that address basic needs and consumers cut spending on entertainment. Groups like the Baltimore Opera Company and the Spartans Drum and Bugle Corps in Nashua, N.H., are either reorganizing under bankruptcy protection or simply going out of business.Also among those seeking bankruptcy protection in the last six months are a rape crisis organization in Maine, a low-income housing group in Massachusetts and a nonprofit retirement community in Pennsylvania that took on too much debt.Under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, charities can get relief from creditors, obtain emergency financing, renegotiate leases and draw up a reorganization plan to let them emerge as financially viable.Some charities, however, have resorted to Chapter 7 of the code, under which organizations liquidate. The American Musical Theater of San Jose, Calif., for instance, took that route.Michael Miller, the theater’s chief executive and executive producer, said it had used the bankruptcy code rather than simply dissolve itself because it had loans it could not repay and needed a way to deal with creditors, including some 16,500 subscription ticket holders.“That’s one difference,” Mr. Miller said. “Even a large corporation might have only 100 or 200 creditors, while we have tens of thousands.”He took over the theater company about four years ago, when it had a $2 million deficit. It worked to increase donations and received a $1 million line of credit from the City of San Jose.Then it struck a deal to co-produce “Tarzan” and advanced $225,000 to Theater of the Stars in Atlanta, as did Dallas Summer Musicals, a theater company in Dallas.The Atlanta company “called us in late November and said not only that it didn’t have any money left, it had no production to deliver,” Mr. Miller said.Nick Manos, president of the Theater of the Stars in Atlanta, said his organization’s own financial straits had forced it to cancel the production. “We have returned all the money to Dallas and made an offer to San Jose to return the money, and they declined,” Mr. Manos said.But the San Jose theater had already sold more than $800,000 worth of tickets to the show, so recouping its initial investment would not begin to repair the damage, Mr. Miller said. With its subscription renewal period looming and two other shows falling short of revenue goals, the board decided to go dark.“We’ve gone through all the emotions here — shock, numbness, devastation, anger and tears,” Mr. Miller said. “Not only did everyone have to be laid off, they had to pack up their offices, give me their keys, and I had to change the locks on the doors the day before Thanksgiving.”Brockton Family and Community Services, a nonprofit group in Brockton, Mass., that deals with domestic violence, filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2007, after the Internal Revenue Service threatened to seize a building it owned because it had not paid payroll taxes.The organization had moved into rented offices with the hope of selling its building and using the proceeds to meet its tax obligations, said David B. Madoff, its chairman and the lawyer who helped with its bankruptcy. “The sale fell through twice in 2007, and the real estate market began going south,” Mr. Madoff said.Under court protection, Brockton Family moved back into its building, eliminating the need to pay rent, and it reduced some services. It emerged from bankruptcy protection in November.Copia, a nonprofit organization founded by the late Napa Valley winemaker Robert Mondavi to cultivate appreciation for fine food and wine, is not so lucky. Conceived as a destination that would draw hundreds of thousands of visitors a year with its organic herb gardens, a demonstration kitchen and a restaurant, it collapsed in November under $78 million of debt and initially sought to reorganize under Chapter 11.Instead, the presiding judge is forcing it to liquidate.Glass Youth and Family Services had been living off its credit cards for several months. “The Internet was down for two days last week because we couldn’t pay the bill, and a repo man showed up for one of the vans we use to transport the kids around,” Ms. DeCrescenzo said.The reasons for Glass’s financial woes are similar to those causing other nonprofits to go bankrupt. Ms. DeCrescenzo said the state of California, which accounts for almost 70 percent of the organization’s revenues, had not raised the rates it pays for services in nine years, while expenses had increased.Aggravating those problems was a decision Glass made some time ago to allow only six beds in its group homes.“We have held out for more than a decade against moving to a group home model with 12 beds or more because we thought smaller homes create a family environment that was better for the kids,” Ms. DeCrescenzo said. “That was a mistake.”American Express has been calling her repeatedly, she said, seeking payment of $100,000 that has been charged to the corporate credit card for hotel rooms for teenagers who had aged out of group homes; the company is also threatening to seek a lien against Ms. DeCrescenzo’s house.The I.R.S. also wants her house because Glass has failed to pay its payroll taxes.“The one thing I have is my home,” Ms. DeCrescenzo said, “and now I lay awake at night thinking someone is going to take it away from me.”'"
"'09-02-20,'0','WASHINGTON — If they were injected with truth serum, most politicians in Washington would admit they do not really care much who runs the Commerce Department. But many of the most astute politicians in both parties care very much who runs the Census Bureau.That is why Senator Judd Gregg’s withdrawal as President Obama’s nominee for commerce secretary provoked such a furor among Republicans: they had concluded that Mr. Gregg, a fellow Republican, had pulled out because of what they saw as White House plans to take control of the Census Bureau, part of the department he would have run. The White House denied it was trying to politicize the census, but the damage was done.While most Americans do not think much about the census, it looms large in the lives of the nation’s political leaders, with the next decennial nose count due next year. The constitutionally mandated “enumeration” determines how many seats each state gets in the House of Representatives and helps to determine where the district lines are drawn within each state. It will also shift billions upon billions of federal dollars over the next decade from some parts of the country to others because of population-driven financing formulas.The parties have been at loggerheads for years over how to conduct the census. Almost everyone agrees that the traditional method — mail-back surveys and door-knocking follow-ups — fails to count millions of Americans. Democrats argue that the solution is to use statistical sampling models to extrapolate figures for the uncounted people. If minorities, immigrants, the poor and the homeless are the most likely to be undercounted, then such sampling would presumably benefit the Democrats.Republicans, for their part, argue that statistical sampling is unreliable and that the Constitution mandates an actual count. In 1999, the Supreme Court ruled, 5 to 4, that under current law, sampling techniques could not be used to reapportion House seats from one state to another. But some experts still believe that sampling could be used in drawing district lines within the states and to determine money flows.After Mr. Obama announced Mr. Gregg’s nomination, the Congressional Black Caucus, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, and others complained about the prospect of having a Republican heading the department overseeing the census. The White House responded with a statement that was meant to assuage them but that in the end provoked a Republican outcry and may have helped precipitate Mr. Gregg’s withdrawal.'"
"'09-02-20,'0','Given all the hand wringing about the dire state of contemporary ballet, it is good to be reminded that new work is being made all the time and that much of it is of at least some interest. Genius choreographers might not come around very often; choreographers with potential do.Helen Pickett is one, judging by “Petal,” which had its New York premiere on Wednesday at the Joyce Theater courtesy of the Aspen Santa Fe Ballet. The small company (just 12 dancers) has adventuresome tastes, sampling from a range of choreographic languages. Though sometimes ragged, in both style and endurance, the performers gamely threw themselves into the disparate works with admirable verve.“Petal” combines a sophisticated sense of spacing with a resonant exploration of emotional discovery. Eddies of social groupings swirl within a stage bounded by large white screens and suffused by Todd Elmer’s gorgeously lush lighting design of Easter-egg yellows, pinks and oranges. A sense of restless female desire pervades the choreography, which sets intimate duets and solos within more formal group patterns, much as pockets of tenderness bloom within the relentless music by Philip Glass and Thomas Montgomery Newman.There are many styles in play here, including Twyla Tharp’s tough, sexy female athleticism and, most strongly, the aggressively buckling, rippling movement language of William Forsythe, in whose company Ms. Pickett danced for many years. But Ms. Pickett looks to be finding a voice of her own.This is a good thing, as Mr. Forsythe has far too many pale imitators, and none who manage the pacing and intelligence of such works as his pas de deux from “Slingerland,” performed handsomely on Wednesday by Sam Chittenden and Katherine Eberle. Here the push-and-pull drama of two dancers, isolated in a darkly illuminated world, serves as both a rich metaphor for relationships and a deconstruction of ballet’s reliance on that metaphor. Combining the theatrical and the theoretical, it’s a neat Forsythian trick.Tricks too abound in Jorma Elo’s dances. But they too often seem cheap. “1st Flash,” another New York premiere, had many of his hallmarks: the manic, slapdash phrasing; the busy, gesture-laden choreography, full of set pieces designed to momentarily wow; the haphazard connection to music. (Here Sibelius’s romantic, windswept vision is spliced, to little effect, with passages danced in silence.) There is lots going on, but little to hold onto (though Jordan Tuinman’s varied lighting design deserves a nod). While the eye scrambles to keep up, the imagination yawns.A more intriguing world is suggested in Itzik Galili’s “Chameleon,” a third New York premiere. In between preening and posing, five women present a smorgasbord of tics and twitches, accompanied by the meditative, moody John Cage work “In a Landscape.” They do so seated in a row of bright green chairs at the front of a mostly darkened stage, as if waiting for an audition or for someone to notice them.'"
"'09-02-20,'0','HOUSTON — The descendants of Geronimo have sued Skull and Bones, a secret society at Yale University with ties to the Bush family, charging that its members robbed his grave in 1918 and have kept his skull in a glass case ever since.The claim is part of a lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington on Tuesday, the 100th anniversary of Geronimo’s death. The Apache warrior’s heirs are seeking to recover all his remains, wherever they may be, and have them transferred to a new grave at the headwaters of the Gila River in New Mexico, where Geronimo was born and wished to be interred.“I believe strongly from my heart that his spirit was never released,” Geronimo’s great-grandson Harlyn Geronimo, 61, told reporters Tuesday at the National Press Club.Geronimo died a prisoner of war at Fort Sill, Okla., in 1909. A longstanding tradition among members of Skull and Bones holds that Prescott S. Bush — father of President George Bush and grandfather of President George W. Bush — broke into the grave with some classmates during World War I and made off with the skull, two bones, a bridle and some stirrups, all of which were put on display at the group’s clubhouse in New Haven, known as the Tomb.The story gained some validity in 2005, when a historian discovered a letter written in 1918 from one Skull and Bones member to another saying the skull had been taken from a grave at Fort Sill along with several pieces of tack for a horse.Ramsey Clark, a former United States attorney general who is representing Geronimo’s family, acknowledged he had no hard proof that the story was true. Yet he said he hoped the court would clear up the matter.'"
"'09-02-20,'0','“What on earth do we have to do with Hugo Chávez?” he snapped.Actually, on this subject, quite a lot. For many New Yorkers, there is enduring concern about the mayor’s self-serving ways on term limits. Legal and political tussles over the issue are not finished. Although a federal judge in Brooklyn has upheld the change in the law, that ruling is being appealed. In Albany, proposed legislation would effectively block any run for a third term unless voters first said in yet another referendum that it was O.K.Then again, as irritated as many New Yorkers are with the mayor and the Council, not all of them are convinced that salvation lies with Albany; it meddles in city affairs enough already, thank you.Perhaps the most intriguing test of the revised law lies with the Justice Department. Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it must give its blessing to election-law changes, to make sure that no harm comes to racial and ethnic minorities.Some question the need for New York to keep being subjected to this sort of federal scrutiny. Be that as it may, the city’s lawyers dutifully asked the department to approve the term-limits change, which they said was not discriminatory in “purpose or effect.” To bolster their case, they noted that more than two-thirds of the City Council’s nonwhite members voted for the revised law — i.e., this incumbency-protection act was color-blind.This week, critics of the mayor responded. In New York, they told the Justice Department, the odds have in effect been stacked for years in favor of white officeholders, who, thanks to incumbency, prevail even in districts where over time nonwhites have become the majority. Term limits pry seats open, the critics asserted, and thus enable racial and ethnic minorities to “translate favorable demographics into increased political representation.”Whether Washington accepts this reasoning or dismisses it as the legal equivalent of a Hail Mary pass remains to be seen. But it means that Mr. Bloomberg is not necessarily out of the woods on this issue.It has caused him more headaches than perhaps he anticipated. He had thumbed his nose at all political parties, pronouncing himself far too lofty for such riffraff. That was before he decided to run for a third term. Now he needs them — some of them, anyway — to get a decent spot on the November ballot.A safe bet is that the billionaire mayor will try to buy his way back into the good graces of one party or another, notably his old sponsor, the Republican Party. After having been kicked down the stairs by Mr. Bloomberg, Republican county leaders may have to decide which matters to them more: his money or their pride.They are most unlikely to consult Mr. Chávez. But he does have experience with matters of money and pride. He could advise them that you can’t always have both.'"
"'09-02-20,'0','The firm expects to lay off two or three of its more than 20 property lawyers soon, and already has moved five of them to real estate litigation, Mr. Howell said. That sector has boomed as deals and developments gone bad give rise to lawsuits, but the six- or seven-fold increase in that business has not been enough to make up for lost sales work, he said.Things are even worse for British-based Villapac, which for the last five years has been selling all- inclusive furniture packages — everything from sofas to silverware — for vacation and rental homes in Spain, Portugal and Morocco. The average sale used to be around 9,000 euros, or $11,600, now it's around 7,000 euros.""It's brutal. Disastrous,"" said Mark Wilman, the company's owner. ""We're fighting every day"" to keep the business alive.Villapac has laid off 75 of its 100 workers in four waves of cutbacks since August and has closed showrooms, he said. Earnings in January will total around 100,000 pounds, or $140,860, compared with 650,000 pounds in January 2008, with new customers hard to find and many of those who paid deposits trying to back out as they cancel or postpone pending property purchases.Mr. Wilman said he was trying to reorient the company toward selling furniture to retailers, rather than individual home buyers. ""The business we did with the small investor is finished,"" he said. ""I think it will be a long time before it will come back.""Help has long been available for those buying homes internationally, but it only became a big business after 2000, when the number of people seeking properties outside their home country jumped sharply, said Adam Samuel, director of the real estate Web site nubricks.com. ""Mass market-wise, all of these industries are relatively new,"" he said.Now, ""many companies are in dire straits,"" Mr. Samuel said, adding that he regularly hears of companies in the sector going under.The biggest drop-off in business has been among investors who once saw international property markets as a place to make easy money, said Simon Conn, of the British-based company Conti Financial, which connects buyers with overseas mortgages.With prices dropping nearly everywhere, investors like that are now hard to find, he said.Mr. Conn said business was off about 40 percent from a year ago, with many inquiries now coming from those who want to refinance homes rather than from new buyers.Those who are buying, now mostly people looking for someplace sunny to retire or cash-rich families hoping for a bargain on a vacation home, are far more cautious, he said, adding, ""People are being more selective now, they're not rushing in and buying the cheap properties, they ask more questions.""Adding to the trouble is the pound's slide against the euro, which makes Continental purchases more expensive for British buyers, who have been the largest segment of international house-hunters for decades.Sales volume and prices have fallen most precipitously in the cutting-edge markets that international buyers entered most recently, countries like Bulgaria, Romania, Egypt and Turkey, where investors sought to turn quick profits. They have slumped more slowly or stabilized in more traditional destinations still seen as relatively safe, places like France, Spain and Italy, as well as Mexico for American buyers.Simon Greenwood, whose company, A Life in Puglia, is based in that southern Italian region and helps English speakers find and buy homes there, said business at the end of 2008 was off by nearly a third. Since then, it has ticked up again following a new publicity campaign, but he said he feared for the future, as many potential buyers are just watching and waiting.""The people with money are thinking, 'Maybe if I hang around for six months, prices will go down even more,'"" he said.Mr. Greenwood and his partner, Charlotte Senior, started the business in 2006 to give up their fast- paced London lives for a quieter Italian existence. They charge 2 percent of a home's purchase price, up to 200,000 euros; and an additional 1 percent on anything over that amount.Paul Collins, property editor at the real estate Web site buyassociation.co.uk, said he was optimistic that while individual companies might fold, the hard economic times will not kill the entire industry.""It's going to reflect how the international property market is going to be when we get to the other side of this downturn,"" he said. ""The companies that are left are going to be very high quality, they're going to be lean, they're going to be able to give customers value.""'"
"'09-02-20,'0','The real world, alas, does not score success in that way.Consider how much money you would have left if you had put $100 into the stocks in the leading market indexes of major countries at the end of 2007, less than 14 months ago.In the United States, you would now have about $53. That fact — coupled with the reality that more Americans than ever are depending on the stock market to pay for their retirement — has severely depressed sentiment and spending.But it merits one of the top grades in this world. Among major markets, only Japan, at $59, has done better. In Britain, France, Spain and Germany, the figure would be around $45. In Italy, it would be $37. About a quarter of the money would still be there in countries like Ireland, Greece and Poland.Remember the BRIC countries, where growth possibilities seemed limitless not long ago? The stars there are Brazil and China, where about $46 or $47 remains. In India, the figure is $35, and in Russia it is $23. At least they have all done a lot better than Iceland, where you would have just $3 left of your hypothetical $100.All this failure, whether in markets or economies, is feeding upon itself. Imports and exports are falling nearly everywhere. “Our exports have been hurt more by the global recession than their exports have been hurt by our recession,” said Roger Kubarych, an economist at the Unicredit Group in New York.Nowhere does the situation appear more dire now than in Eastern Europe.Many of those countries had been running large current-account deficits, just as the United States has been doing. But the United States still has the ability to borrow all the dollars it wants — in part because lenders know the United States can print more of them if it needs to.Eastern European countries have no such printing presses, and those countries that can borrow show little interest in sharing the bounty.“Emerging Europe appears to be suffering a ‘sudden stop’ in financing, which could cause the region’s economy to contract by 5 percent to 10 percent this year,” said Neil Shearing, an economist at Capital Economics in London. “Markets in Eastern Europe appear to be in meltdown.” He says the Baltic economies could shrink 20 percent this year.The latest collapses are both a cause of and a result of worries about the health of banks in the region, many of which are owned by Western European banks. Some of those banks did a fine job of pushing “affordable” mortgages that are turning out to be just the opposite, endangering both borrower and lender.The details differed from the subprime lending that was a major cause of the destruction of capital in the American banking system. There were no “Ninja” loans (no income, no job or assets) that would produce exploding monthly payments within a couple of years. Instead, the banks pushed mortgages denominated in foreign currencies — largely the euro and the Swiss franc — where interest rates were much lower than in the local currency markets.The risk was obvious. What if the local currency lost value rapidly? That is just what is happening. The Hungarian forint is down by about a quarter this year against the Swiss franc, and by more than half since last summer.That means someone who bought a house in Hungary last summer, financing it with a Swiss franc loan, now owes more than twice as many forints as he or she borrowed, and has a monthly payment that has increased by a similar amount. Even if the home’s value has not fallen and the homeowner’s job is safe, he or she may be in desperate straits. In fact, unemployment is rising and house prices are falling.It has been noted in what Donald H. Rumsfeld called the “old Europe” that the European countries in the direst straits tend to be the ones that accepted American financial advice with the most enthusiasm. Now, however, few Americans seem to be interested.Part of the Obama plan to revive the American financial system is an expansion of the TALF program, announced but not carried out by the Bush administration. That program — short for Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility — is supposed to stimulate financing for things like credit cards and student loans.But the loans are not for just anybody. At least 95 percent of the money must go to American borrowers. “It is a ‘Lend America’ program,” said Mr. Kubarych.When world leaders gather, there is a lot of talk about coordinated policies. When the leaders go home, it is every country for itself. Unfortunately, as the United States ought to have learned, doing better than anyone else may not be nearly enough.'"
"'09-02-20,'0','As it posted a big quarterly loss, Playboy Enterprises indicated Wednesday that it would be willing to sell the company or change the direction of its flagship magazine, a surprise to some investors. But a Playboy spokeswoman, Elizabeth Austin, said Thursday that “this is no change in policy. We’ve always been open to discussion.”Ms. Austin emphasized that Playboy was not looking to sell the magazine by itself. “The magazine is not for sale,” she said.On Wednesday, as Playboy reported a fourth-quarter loss of $145.7 million, a steep decline from the $1.1 million it lost in the fourth quarter of 2007, analysts sensed a strategy shift. Christie Hefner, the company’s longtime chief executive and the daughter of the Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, resigned last December. She was replaced by an interim chief executive, Jerome Kern.When an analyst asked if Playboy was open to an overall sale of the company or change in the direction of the magazine since there was no longer a Hefner running the company, Mr. Kern responded, “Yes.” He added, “We’re willing to listen.”Playboy had long been under pressure from Wall Street analysts to consider selling the company or selling or licensing its magazine. But analysts had speculated that Mr. Hefner, 82, who is the controlling shareholder of Playboy Enterprises, would refuse to part with either the magazine or the company.'"
"'09-02-20,'0','The New York Times Company suspended dividend payments to shareholders on Thursday for the first time in four decades as a publicly traded company, another in a series of concessions because of sharply lower newspaper revenue.The decision by the board pre-empts a dividend payment that, on the usual schedule, would have been paid later this month. The annualized savings is just $34.5 million, because the dividend was already cut sharply last fall.“Today’s decision provides the company with additional financial flexibility given the current economic environment and the uncertain business outlook,” the company chairman, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., said in a statement.In May 2007, the company raised its quarterly dividend to 23 cents a share, from 17.5 cents. Newspaper advertising had already begun to slump by then, and the decision was second-guessed by some analysts.The industry’s troubles steadily worsened through 2007 and 2008. The Times Company’s overall revenue last year fell 7.7 percent, and its newspaper ad revenue dropped 14.2 percent.In November, the company cut the dividend to 6 cents, the lowest it had been since the 1980s.Cash flow remains positive, but it is shrinking, and the company faces significant debt payments over the next 13 months, so it has taken several steps to raise cash. The company is seeking a sale-leaseback of a portion of its headquarters building, it is trying to sell its investment in the Boston Red Sox and it recently borrowed $250 million from the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helú, an investor in the company.'"
"'09-02-20,'0','A region of about 425 square miles, the valley prides itself on its Old West heritage. It gets its name from the frontiersman Kit Carson, who passed through in the 1840s on a mapping expedition.The Carson Valley also played a role in the 1849 California gold rush. Not long after gold was discovered, wagon trains flooded into the valley, said Laurie Hickey of the Douglas County Historical Society in Gardnerville. The immigrants grazed their animals on the lush valley floor and stocked up on provisions before trying the trip over the Sierra.Some stayed. Mormon settlers opened a trading post in what is now Genoa in 1851, and about 50 years later, both Gardnerville and Minden, a few miles away, were established.“Pretty much everything in Nevada started in the Carson Valley,” Ms. Hickey said. “This is where people put down roots.”At an elevation of 4,700 feet, the Carson Valley has a high-desert climate — cool nights and warm days — but the foliage is thick and green in spring and summer. Near Genoa, the wooded foothills are often in shadows by midafternoon as the sun sinks behind the Carson range, which rises 3,000 feet above the valley. Just six miles away, where Minden and Gardnerville are linked by the north-south Highway 395, the contrast is stark — the sky opens up over large expanses of flat ranchland.Minden has a small historic district with a few antiques and gift shops, restaurants and an old-fashioned town square, complete with a gazebo. But its charm is offset by long stretches of sprawl along the main road.Gardnerville is much the same. Look closely, though, and you’ll find vestiges of its history. There are three Basque restaurants, for instance, serving dishes like oxtail or beef tongue stew, pigs’ feet and tripe. After the gold rush and up until the 1960s, many Basque immigrants came to the valley to work as sheepherders; they later opened boarding houses and restaurants.“We lost our last Basque boarder eight years ago,” said J. B. Lekumberry, who, with his sister, took over the operation of the J. T. Basque Bar and Dining Room from their parents.Genoa, less than a mile square, has been largely untouched by development. Many of its houses were built in the late 19th or early 20th century on lots of less than an acre. Residents still get together to make 4,000 pounds of candy every September for the Candy Dance Arts and Crafts Faire, a fund-raising event begun in 1919.There’s an upscale French restaurant, La Ferme, a bakery, and the red-brick Genoa Bar, opened in 1853, which claims to be the oldest bar in Nevada. Its owner, Willy Webb, said his clients ranged from bikers and ranchers to golfers and politicians.Though the region may have a small-town feel, world-class outdoor activities abound. In addition to the skiing and boating at Lake Tahoe, there is hiking, fishing in the Carson River, biking, hunting, horseback riding and especially golf — four courses in the valley alone, and several more within an hour’s drive.“We are big golfers,” said Sondi Goldstone, a human resources consultant from Fremont, Calif. “We had to have a place that had multiple golf courses.”In June 2007, Ms. Goldstone and her husband, Buddy, a financial planner, bought a 2,900-square-foot house in the East Valley area of Gardnerville on four acres for $750,000 — $125,000 under the asking price. They plan to retire there.The Carson Valley is also known as a destination for glider pilots. “The longest-distance flights in the Northern Hemisphere have been flown from Minden,” said Leo Montejo, a doctor and glider pilot from Fremont, Calif., who flies his own small plane to the Minden-Tahoe Airport to spend weekends in Genoa.Dr. Montejo and his wife, Carlota Fenes, bought an 1880 carriage house last June for $400,000 and spent $160,000 on renovations. Their 4-year-old twins, Leo and Adriano, love the wildlife in the backyard — deer, foxes, even the evidence of bears — and their parents appreciate the amenities. “Every morning we can walk to the bakery to get fresh French bread,” he said, “and right next door they have espressos that are as good as anywhere in Paris.”Carson Valley’s wide-open spaces will most likely stay that way. Residents in Douglas County, which includes Genoa, Minden and Gardnerville, recently voted for strict limits on residential development.Skiers leaving the valley for the Lake Tahoe ski resorts (Heavenly, half an hour away in South Lake Tahoe, is the closest) can face treacherous roads in winter. Drivers must carry chains, or have a four-wheel-drive vehicle.Home prices in Carson Valley have dropped about 35 percent since the peak in 2006, said Lori Raschilla, an owner of Century 21 Clark Properties in Minden.“You couldn’t even have bought a starter home for under $300,000 a couple years ago,” she said. “Now we have some in the very low $200,000 range.”Compared with communities on Lake Tahoe, where new homes cost at least $800,000 and an older home can’t be had for less than $600,000, Ms. Raschilla said, the valley has bargains. At the low end, she said, there are small two-bedroom ranch homes in subdivisions like Chichester in Gardnerville and Sunridge north of Minden on half-acre lots. In the East Valley in Gardnerville, houses range from $600,000 to more than $1 million and tend to be larger and set on lots of several acres.In and around Genoa, prices tend to be a bit higher, said Gina Gillmor-Coons, who owns Gillmor Coons Real Estate Group. They range from $284,900 for a 1,500-square-foot 1970s-era house on a half-acre in the Sheridan Acres subdivision to $8 million for a ranch on 203 acres.'"
"'09-02-20,'0','It remained unclear how quickly the United States would have to find an alternative. President Kurmanbek Bakiyev of Kyrgyzstan was expected to send Washington an official notice, but American officials said they still did not know when it would be received or when the six-month countdown would start.The bill in Parliament was approved by 78 of the 81 lawmakers present, with two voting against it and one abstaining.The Kyrgyz government in Bishkek had longstanding complaints about the base and had asked for more cash compensation. Tensions were exacerbated in 2006 when an American serviceman fatally shot a Kyrgyz truck driver.Mr. Bakiyev announced the move to close the base at a news conference with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, who this month promised to shore up Kyrgyzstan’s struggling economy with about $2.15 billion in loans and grants. Moscow has long complained about the continued American military presence in Central Asia, and many in Washington concluded that Russia had encouraged the move in an attempt to assert its dominance in the region.Although Russian and Kyrgyz officials say there was no connection between the Kremlin’s financial aid and efforts to kick out the Americans, senior American officials have complained that the Russians are trying to have it both ways — with the Kremlin expressing a desire to support the international military mission in Afghanistan while pressing the Kyrgyz government to end American access to its air base.In public comments as part of the vote, Kyrgyz lawmakers portrayed the action as the culmination of years of complaints and said the American presence in Central Asia had outlasted its usefulness.“It is impossible to make people of Afghanistan live by standards which are brought in from abroad,” said Kabai Karabhekov, a member of Parliament. “One has to give an opportunity to Afghan people to build their country themselves.”The shadow of Russian actions in Central Asia and Central Europe fell over the session of NATO ministers here, as Mr. Gates also was pressed on whether the Obama administration intended to move forward with a plan for missile defenses in Europe that had been a priority of the Bush administration’s foreign policy and that had brought threats of military retaliation from Russia.Mr. Gates, in his first overseas trip since he began serving the new president, said the missile defense bases planned in Poland and the Czech Republic would proceed if the technology proved it could work and was affordable.Neither of those two caveats were part of the Bush administration’s language when discussing requirements for the bases.But Mr. Gates also made it clear that the Obama administration had not yet met on the issue of missile defense policy, and that no decisions had been made on how to proceed.“The administration has not yet reviewed where it is on a whole range of issues,” Mr. Gates said, including the missile defense program and how to manage that within the relationship with Russia.Mr. Gates said the radar proposed for the Czech Republic and the 10 interceptor missiles for Poland were to counter a potential threat from Iran, and he reiterated that the United States would work with NATO and wanted Russia as a partner in the effort.To reassure his hosts here, Mr. Gates said that a series of new bilateral military cooperation efforts with Poland were proceeding even as the prospects for the missile defense site on Polish territory remained uncertain.Also Thursday, NATO officials confirmed that Germany had pledged 600 more soldiers to the mission in Afghanistan.“We welcome the commitment of additional German forces for the upcoming Afghan national elections,” said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary. “For those contests to be credible, voter turnout must be robust and representative, and improving the security situation is the key to making that happen.”Italy announced this week that it would add 500 troops to the alliance mission in Afghanistan by April.'"

"'09-02-20,'0','A senior Communist Party official has warned monks and nuns in Tibet to refrain from carrying out any political activity in the run-up to the first anniversary of the anti-Chinese uprising last March, according to an article published on Thursday in the Tibet Daily, an official newspaper. The official, Lobsang Gyaincain, a member of the standing committee of the regional Communist Party, said the clergy must not take part in activities aimed at “splitting the motherland.” The Tibet Daily also reported that senior leaders, in a conference held on Wednesday, called on security forces to crush any signs of support for the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Tibetans. Security forces have fanned out across the Tibetan region of China even as many Tibetans have been calling for a boycott of festivities during Losar, the Tibetan New Year, which begins Wednesday.'"
"'09-02-20,'0','Ms. Politkovskaya was a fierce critic of the Kremlin’s policy in Chechnya, and her killing in 2006 underlined the shrinking space allowed dissenters in Russian society. Investigators and colleagues concluded that someone had ordered her death to silence her, and Russia’s prosecutor general personally took charge of the case because of its importance.But two and a half years later, the three men who were tried on murder charges were peripheral figures: two young Chechen men accused of acting as a lookout and a driver for the suspected triggerman, who has never been found, and a former police investigator accused of organizing logistics for the killing.Sergei M. Sokolov, deputy editor of the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, where Ms. Politkovskaya worked, attributed the result to “resistance from the whole system,” in particular the refusal to prosecute members of law enforcement and special forces.“There were two verdicts delivered today,” he said. “One, de jure, was the acquittal of the defendants. But a guilty verdict was leveled against the corrupt system that exists here. Nothing works, not one governmental institution works.”The Russian Prosecutor General’s office announced plans to challenge the verdict.According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 16 journalists have been killed in Russia because of their work since 2000. The most recent was Anastasia Baburova, who was shot Jan. 19 along with the lawyer Stanislav Markelov as they left a news conference. Only one of those 16 cases has resulted in a conviction, and none of those who organized the killings have been found.“Russia is a country where for years and years now, journalists who cover human rights issues and corruption are being murdered and assaulted,” said Miklos Haraszti, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s representative for media freedom.“It has to be admitted, at the highest level of the country, that there can be no free speech in a country where the best journalists are afraid for their lives for doing their jobs.”The three-month trial took place in a cramped courtroom, where the murder suspects watched from behind the bars of an iron cage. Two were brothers, Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov, who prosecutors said had assisted their brother Rustam in stalking Ms. Politkovskaya to her apartment. Rustam, who prosecutors say was the gunman, is believed to be in hiding.A third murder suspect, Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, was accused of having hired the Makhmudov brothers, provided the weapon and coordinated the murder. A fourth defendant, Col. Pavel A. Ryaguzov, was accused of criminal ties to the killers, but no role in the killing itself. He was also acquitted Thursday.The prosecution offered thin evidence, relying heavily on cellphone billing records that showed that the suspects called one another from areas around the crime scene before and after the murder took place. The jury deliberated for two hours before returning its verdict.Friederike Behr, a researcher from Amnesty International who monitored portions of the trial, said she could “respect the decision of the jury because the evidence wasn’t clear.”When the verdict was read, the suspects were allowed to walk out of the metal cage and then onto the Old Arbat, Moscow’s grand pedestrian street. As he stepped outside, Ibragim Makhmudov threw his arm around his lawyer, looked up at the sky and shouted “Allahu akbar,” or “God is great,” several times.“We have received a principled and honest verdict,” said Murad Musayev, who defended Dzhabrail Makhmudov. “We are saying it not because this verdict is in our favor but because, without bias, there could be no other verdict in this case.”But at a news conference shortly afterward, both Mr. Sokolov and Ms. Politkovskaya’s son, Ilya, said they were convinced that the suspects acquitted Thursday were connected to her killing. “The level of their involvement should have been shown in court, but for some reason the prosecutors were not able to do this,” Mr. Politkovsky said.Ms. Politkovskaya, 48, distinguished herself covering Moscow’s war in Chechnya, which she characterized as “state versus group terrorism.” She documented torture, mass executions, kidnapping and the sale by Russian soldiers of Chechen corpses to their families for proper Islamic burial, concluding, “What response could one expect but more terrorism, and the recruitment of more resistance fighters?”On Oct. 7, 2006, she was found dead with a Makarov 9-millimeter pistol dropped at her side. Ms. Politkovskaya’s editor at Novaya Gazeta, Dmitri A. Muratov, has maintained from the beginning that she was killed because her investigations were threatening the financial interests of figures within Russia.But the authorities have said the murder was ordered from abroad by enemies of the present government. Yuri Chaika, the prosecutor general, said at a news conference in 2007 that the killers hoped to “create a crisis situation and bring about a return to the old management system in which money and oligarchs decided everything.”Thursday’s verdict suggests that Russian officials have little to show after two and a half years of investigation into this high-profile murder. Yet, as the courtroom emptied out into the clear, icy afternoon, Karinna Moskalenko, a lawyer for Ms. Politkovskaya’s family, seemed undaunted, bursting out with a battle cry.“We want the real killers, the real killers!” she said. “And we shall succeed in it.”'"
"'09-02-20,'0','JERUSALEM — Benjamin Netanyahu looked poised to become Israel’s next prime minister after earning the endorsement on Thursday of Avigdor Lieberman, head of the far-right party Yisrael Beiteinu.President Shimon Peres has yet to decide who should form Israel’s next government. After conferring with Mr. Peres, Mr. Lieberman expressed support for a government led by Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud Party but also urged that the government include Kadima, the centrist party led by Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni.Mr. Lieberman did not rule out participating in a narrow right-wing government, however, and that looked like a real possibility because Mr. Netanyahu had enough seats to set up such a coalition.Mr. Lieberman said there were “three possibilities, from our point of view: A broad government, which is what we want; a narrow government, that will be a government of paralysis, but we don’t rule out sitting in it; and the third option is going to elections, which will achieve nothing.”Ms. Livni, however, seemed uninterested in joining any government that she did not head, and told supporters on Thursday that Kadima would probably go into the opposition.“Today, the foundation was laid for an extreme right-wing government led by Netanyahu,” she told party members. “This is not our way, and there is nothing for us in such a government.”'"
"'09-02-20,'0','Stabilizing energy prices halted a five-month decline in producer prices last month, the government said Thursday, but inflation remained a remote concern amid a deepening recession.The Producer Price Index, which measures wholesale prices for goods ranging from food to automobiles to children’s toys, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent in January after months of declines, the Labor Department reported.Gasoline prices jumped 15 percent last month, an indication that a six-month slide in oil prices might have reached its bottom. Crude oil has fallen from its peaks of about $145 a barrel in July as a global economic downturn gained force, but prices have settled around $35 to $40 a barrel since mid-December.“The sharpest declines at the commodity level seem to be behind us for now,” said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclay’s Capital. “In this environment where the Fed is concerned with deflation, the firm core reading should help to allay some of those fears.”Despite the month-over-month increase, producer prices in January were still 1 percent lower than a year ago. And the prices for intermediate goods excluding food and energy, fell 1.1 percent in January.Some economists discounted the importance of the larger-than-expected increase in overall producer prices, saying that they still expected inflation to slip into negative territory in 2009 as the economy contracts, unemployment rises and demand for goods and services declines.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee cut its outlook for inflation this year to a range of 0.3 to 1 percent, from an October projection of 1.3 to 2 percent.Energy prices for finished goods rose 3.7 percent in January from a month earlier while food prices fell 0.4 percent. The wholesale price of beef fell 10.5 percent, and was 7 percent lower for dairy products and 2.7 percent lower for roasted coffee.The wholesale price of passenger cars rose a modest 0.3 percent even as American automakers experienced one of their worst sales months in decades. On Tuesday, two automakers, General Motors and Chrysler, asked the government for billions in additional bailout money. The price of light trucks rose 0.5 percent.The Labor Department also reported Thursday that first-time jobless claims were unchanged last week at 627,000 from the previous week’s revised figures.The number of people continuing to receive unemployment insurance claims rose 170,000, to a record 4.99 million, for the week ending Feb. 7.The national unemployment rate climbed to 7.6 percent in January as the economy lost 598,000 jobs and businesses began laying off workers by the thousands. Economists expect that unemployment could reach 9 or 10 percent by the time the economy emerges from recession.The Fed expects unemployment to reach 8.5 to 8.8 percent in 2009, a grimmer projection than its initial estimate that unemployment this year would be 7.1 to 7.6 percent.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia and the private Conference Board released two sharply different outlooks on Thursday.The Philadelphia Fed’s survey of manufacturing conditions in the region skidded to minus 41.3 in February, its lowest point since 1990 and a stark indication of contraction in new orders, shipments and the length of the workweek. The drop was sharper than expected and underscored a decline in overseas markets for American exports.But the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index rose for a second month January, increasing 0.4 percent on positive indications in real money supply, consumer expectations and new orders for consumer goods.'"

"'09-02-21,'0','IT does not take much to galvanize protest against a movie in India, but few thought the word “slumdog” would cause so much anger — especially as hundreds of Bollywood titles translate into much worse slurs. We had to pay attention, though, when friends from Mumbai’s sprawling Dharavi area joined hands with those demonstrating against the Oscar-nominated film “Slumdog Millionaire.” The Indian media widely reported that the outrage was over the word “dog.” But what we heard from Manju Keny, a college student living in Dharavi, was something else. She was upset at the word “slum.” We could not agree more.In truth, the movie never claims to be a portrait of Dharavi, though some of the most spectacular scenes were shot there, including depictions of the anti-Muslim riots of 1992. The director, Danny Boyle, constructs a cinematic slum out of many pockets around Mumbai. The opening sequence has children playing near the airport, being chased by policemen and ending up — in a moment of pure Hollywood magic — a few miles away in Dharavi.The imagery represents what most middle-class residents of Mumbai (and now all over the world) imagine Dharavi to be. The urban legend of its squalor has taken root because few Mumbaikers have ever been there — just as most Manhattanites still avoid stepping anywhere near Bedford-Stuyvesant, that beautiful neighborhood in Brooklyn. Times may have changed since the mid-’70s, when the community worker Barry Stein described Bed-Stuy as the “largest ghetto in the country,” but prejudices die hard, in New York and India.Its depiction as a slum does little justice to the reality of Dharavi. Well over a million “eyes on the street,” to use Jane Jacobs’s phrase, keep Dharavi perhaps safer than most American cities. Yet Dharavi’s extreme population density doesn’t translate into oppressiveness. The crowd is efficiently absorbed by the thousands of tiny streets branching off bustling commercial arteries. Also, you won’t be chased by beggars or see hopeless people loitering — Dharavi is probably the most active and lively part of an incredibly industrious city. People have learned to respond in creative ways to the indifference of the state — including having set up a highly functional recycling industry that serves the whole city.Dharavi is all about such resourcefulness. Over 60 years ago, it started off as a small village in the marshlands and grew, with no government support, to become a million-dollar economic miracle providing food to Mumbai and exporting crafts and manufactured goods to places as far away as Sweden.'"
"'09-02-21,'0','This is going to take some really powerful persuasion. We’re pretty sure that a bunch of foreclosed homes in Coral Gables have value, even if the water in their swimming pools has turned a disturbing shade of green. But they’re all scrambled in those financial instruments that Alan Greenspan can’t get a grip on.One problem with the government plan is that nobody is ever going to have any confidence in a savior called “public-private investment fund.” The term aggregator bank has been floated around; the should consider stealing it, since it sounds like a kind of Transformer. In a crisis, Treasury Secretary could just yell “Aggregator, we need help!” And a normal-looking office building would instantly change into an enormous avenger who clumps down the street squashing the nasty little toxic assets that scurry around, making unpleasant squeaks.If the banks and investors don’t get together and make deals, the Aggregator could always threaten to step on them.Is any of this necessary? What if the government just decides to stay out of it? Why doesn’t stick to putting people to work building unnecessary highways and wait for capitalism to right itself?That’s a nonstarter because we’d wind up like did in the ’90s, and nobody wants to be like Japan in the ’90s. It is true that we all wanted to be like Japan in the ’80s, in every possible way. But now, that is so over.The financial community wants the government involved, but it hates, hates, hates the Obama approach. This is partly because the details are fuzzy and partly because it is not Wall Street’s own favored option, which involves giving the banks tons and tons and tons of money until there is so much cash sloshing around that the financial markets bob up and start to float.We are trying not to get too fixated on the fairness aspects of the bailout. However, this approach seems to resemble a plan in which you fix a classroom that’s distracted by one disruptive pupil by sending said troublemaker to a private school in equipped with an on-campus lift while the rest of the kids stay at Millard Fillmore Elementary, sharing textbooks.Also, if you just prop up dead banks, they could turn into zombie banks. That is definitely something you want to avoid. Imagine walking down the street and there’s a zombie bank plunked on the corner, gazing emptily at the passing traffic and making strange grunting noises. Occasionally, it will snatch up some pedestrians and feed them to the toxic assets.Instead of dancing around the problem, can’t we just have the government take over the impacted banks, hire all the unemployed bond traders to figure out how much the toxic assets are worth, dispose of them for whatever the market will bear and then sell the newly reconstituted banks back to private investors? That was ’s approach, and it worked rather well.The answer is that Americans will never do anything that Sweden does. Never have, never will. Don’t argue with me. It’s a rule.'"

"'09-02-21,'0','Like G.M., Chrysler said that if Canada provided aid, it would not close any plants in the country.On Tuesday, the two Detroit companies raised the amount they were seeking from the Treasury Department to nearly $40 billion. The presidential panel reviewing the requests held its first meeting Friday.More industry requests to government officials are likely to come. G.M. said Friday it would need more than the $2.3 billion in loan guarantees it discussed with the German government for its Opel division. A reorganization plan for Opel, G.M.’s second-biggest brand behind Chevrolet, is expected at the end of next week.G.M. said earlier this week that it wanted to cut Saab loose by 2010, as it tries to restructure. G.M. said in a report to the Treasury Department that it planned to end financial support for Saab by next year.Saab went to a Swedish court for protection from its creditors, and said it would — with assistance from the Swedish government — reorganize to pave the way for private investors to buy all or part of the company.After exploring Saab’s options, “it was determined a formal reorganization would be the best way to create a truly independent entity that is ready for investment,” Saab’s managing director, Jan-Ake Jonsson, said in a statement.Saab said it would need financing during its three-month restructuring “from both public and private sources” and “would continue to operate as usual.”Elisabeth Thand Ringqvist, a spokeswoman for the Swedish industry ministry, said Saab would be eligible for help through loan guarantees provided to the Swedish auto industry as part of a support package the government approved in December.“This could be interpreted as the government supporting Saab in the reorganization phase,” Ms. Ringqvist said. But she said guarantees for working capital, like what G.M. is seeking in Germany, were not on the table.A bailout for Opel is politically contentious in Germany, with politicians calling for strict conditions on the package. Some have even called for Opel to be taken out of American hands, but it is tightly integrated into the G.M. supply and technology chain. For example, G.M. uses Opel underpinnings for vehicles sold by Saturn, although G.M. plans to dissolve the Saturn unit by 2012.In Canada, Mr. Bryant said the Ontario and Canadian governments were negotiating with G.M. over whether the government would provide additional help in financing a pension shortfall.In its plan, General Motors of Canada said that it expected to employ about 7,000 workers next year. The company had about 20,000 employees in 2005. It also intends to have 450 to 500 Canadian dealers, compared with the current 700.Professor Grimes said government leaders the world over would face enormous public pressure to aid the auto companies. “Politically, I don’t think they will have a choice,” he said.But, “the automakers could become quasi-government agencies,” he said. “It will be up to the government to determine what wages the workers get paid, what holidays they get and what benefits they receive.”Swedish officials have repeatedly resisted efforts to nationalize Saab, which came to life as part of the Svenska Aeroplan, a firm founded in 1937 to build military planes. The first Saab cars were built after World War II.Saab, long known for quirky vehicles with ignition in the floor and a griffin insignia, became a more conventional brand under G.M. It borrowed the underpinnings from some of Opel’s cars for its lineup, which includes sedans, wagons and a sport utility vehicle.Saab, however, is G.M.’s smallest brand in the United States, selling 21,383 vehicles in 2008, down 34.7 percent from 2007. Its best-selling vehicle is the 9-3, of which G.M. sold just over 10,000 cars last year.Nonetheless, dealers said they were optimistic about Saab’s future. “It’s probably a great time for someone to get a bargain deal on a car company,” said Annette Adams, owner of Iowa City Saab.Her dealership sells about 50 Saabs a year, while her husband’s Saab dealership, Saab Meyer Garage, sells a similar number.She predicted Saab would thrive under new ownership. “I look for good things to come,” she added. “We just have to step across the hot coals to get there.”'"

"'09-02-21,'0','Renaming a basketball court after a legendary coach is not the easiest event to arrange. Dignitaries have to be brought in, donors and boosters must be kept happy, ceremonies and get-togethers have to be arranged, and the news media need to be alerted.At Princeton, which is about to rename Jadwin Gymnasium’s basketball court Carril Court, in honor of the Hall of Fame coach Pete Carril, many of those duties fell to Lorin Maurer. The renaming ceremony will take place Saturday before Princeton’s game against Dartmouth — nine days after Maurer was among the 50 people killed in the crash of Continental Connection Flight 3407.“She was given the task of organizing the event and coordinating the efforts of the athletic department with the development department to make sure we could pull this off in a way befitting Coach Carril and Princeton University,” Gary Walters, the Princeton athletic director, said. “She was doing an outstanding job.“It’s been difficult this week because we’ve been mourning the loss of Lorin while understanding at the same time that the show must go on. There’s a real sense of loss because Lorin won’t be here to enjoy this.”Maurer, 30, was responsible for managing the official friends groups for each of Princeton’s 38 sports teams, dealing with alumni, supporters and donors. She was a behind-the-scenes person who made sure that events ran smoothly and that the athletic department and the Tigers teams worked in concert with the university’s development office.'"
"'09-02-21,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — The picturesque Victorians and brightly painted apartment buildings where thousands of city residents live and work are especially vulnerable during earthquakes, according to a report issued Friday by the San Francisco Department of Building Inspection.The report said that an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 or higher could render unlivable as many as 85 percent of the city’s “soft-story” apartment buildings — those that are less structurally sound because their ground floors are open space, often used as retail stores or garages. At least 65,000 people live and work in the 2,800 most vulnerable buildings studied in the report.The cost to retrofit those wood-framed buildings would be about $260 million. The expense would be borne by the landlords and the city, which is facing a $576 million budget shortfall.“A big earthquake is overdue in the region, and we’re not naïve to that reality,” said Mayor Gavin Newsom, who ordered the report in July and is working on legislation to make earthquake safety upgrades mandatory on soft-story buildings. “We cannot wait five years. We should have done this 35 years ago, 100 years ago.”Mr. Newsom said that he recognized the economic realities facing the city and its 744,000 residents and that he did not want retrofitting to put building owners “at risk of insolvency.”'"
"'09-02-21,'0','The Monday strike, officials say, was aimed at a camp run by Hakeem Ullah Mehsud, a top aide to the militant. By striking at the Mehsud network, the United States may be seeking to demonstrate to Mr. Zardari that the new administration is willing to go after the insurgents of greatest concern to the Pakistani leader.But American officials may also be prompted by growing concern that the militant attacks are increasingly putting the civilian government of Pakistan, a nation with nuclear weapons, at risk.For months, Pakistani military and intelligence officials have complained about Washington’s refusal to strike at Baitullah Mehsud, even while C.I.A. drones struck at Qaeda figures and leaders of the network run by Jalaluddin Haqqani, a militant leader believed responsible for a campaign of violence against American troops in Afghanistan.According to one senior Pakistani official, Pakistan’s intelligence service on two occasions in recent months gave the United States detailed intelligence about Mr. Mehsud’s whereabouts, but said the United States had not acted on the information. Bush administration officials had charged that it was the Pakistanis who were reluctant to take on Mr. Mehsud and his network.The strikes came after a visit to Islamabad last week by Richard C. Holbrooke, the American envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan.In a telephone interview on Friday, Mr. Holbrooke declined to talk about the attacks on Mr. Mehsud. The White House also declined to speak about Mr. Mehsud or the decisions that led up to the new strikes. A C.I.A. spokesman also declined to comment.Senior Pakistani officials are scheduled to arrive in Washington next week at a time of rising tension over a declared truce between the Pakistani government and militants in the Swat region.While the administration has not publicly criticized the Pakistanis, several American officials said in interviews in recent days that they believe appeasing the militants would only weaken Pakistan’s civilian government. Mr. Holbrooke said in the interview that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and others would make clear in private, and in detail, why they were so concerned about what was happening in Swat, the need to send more Pakistani forces to the west, and why the deteriorating situation in the tribal areas added to instability in Afghanistan and threats to American forces.Past efforts to cut deals with the insurgents failed, and many administration officials believe that they ultimately weakened the Pakistani government.But Obama administration officials face the same intractable problems that the Bush administration did in trying to prod Pakistan toward a different course. Pakistan still deploys the overwhelming majority of its troops along the Indian border, not the border with Afghanistan, and its intelligence agencies maintain shadowy links to the Taliban even as they take American funds to fight them.Under standard policy for covert operations, the C.I.A. strikes inside Pakistan have not been publicly acknowledged either by the Obama administration or the Bush administration. Using Predators and the more heavily armed Reaper drones, the C.I.A. has carried out more than 30 strikes since last September, according to American and Pakistani officials.The attacks have killed a number of senior Qaeda figures, including Abu Jihad al-Masri and Usama al-Kini, who is believed to have helped plan the 1998 American Embassy bombings in East Africa and last year’s bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.American Special Operations troops based in Afghanistan have also carried out a number of operations into Pakistan’s tribal areas since early September, when a commando raid that killed a number of militants was publicly condemned by Pakistani officials. According to a senior American military official, the commando missions since September have been primarily to gather intelligence.The meetings hosted by the Obama administration next week will include senior officials from both Pakistan and Afghanistan; Mrs. Clinton is to hold a rare joint meeting on Thursday with foreign ministers from the two countries. Also, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the Pakistani Army chief, will meet with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Lt. Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the head of Pakistan’s military spy service, will accompany General Kayani.ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — The police on Friday blamed a suicide bomber for a powerful explosion that killed more than 30 people and wounded at least 50 in the Pakistani city of Dera Ismail Khan, according to residents and Pakistani television reports.The bombing, aimed at the funeral of a Shiite man who had been shot, set off chaos in the city of a million people on the edge of Pakistan’s tribal areas. Mobs attacked security forces, ransacked shops and surrounded hospitals said the mayor, Abdur Rauf.'"
"'09-02-21,'0','Mr. Safi said that renaming Abu Ghraib as the Baghdad Central Prison and changing its mission to rehabilitation would help remove some of the stigma.Mr. Safi said that he personally oversaw the renovation of the cellblocks where the worst of the abuses were committed by American soldiers and contractors, and that the prison now had classrooms, a library, plots of land for gardening and hothouse farming, and workshops where inmates would be taught sewing, hairdressing and computer skills.Abu Ghraib, designed by an American architect, Edmund Whiting, and built by British contractors in the late 1960s, occupies a site of nearly 280 acres about 15 miles west of Baghdad.Mr. Safi spoke with pride about the Iraqi government’s ability to complete the limited renovation of Abu Ghraib for about $1 million, as opposed to the millions of dollars being spent by American government agencies on similar projects around the country.Reading from a document on his desk, Mr. Safi listed American-financed prison renovations and projects in Basra, the Kurdistan region, Nasiriya and Ramadi at a total cost of about $100 million.Mr. Safi said there were about 17,000 inmates in prisons under the administration of the Ministry of Justice, adding that this figure did not include those being held by the Ministry of Interior and other security organs of the government.The American military is holding about 14,500 inmates as what it calls “security detainees.” Mr. Safi said their cases were being examined in batches of 1,500 for release or referral to Iraq’s judicial system, as called for in the security agreement signed between Baghdad and Washington in the fall.Mr. Safi estimated that 5,000 of those in American custody would ultimately be convicted in Iraqi courts and sent to prison. That influx, in light of the already overcrowded Iraqi prison system, makes reopening Abu Ghraib all the more pressing, Mr. Safi said.But the reopening is stirring unease among many Iraqis, who associate the prison not only with American abuses but also with a long history of government brutality and repression.In a report issued in December that underscored those concerns, Human Rights Watch warned that long pretrial detentions and the prevalence of abuse in Iraqi prisons — including the coercion of confessions and arrests made based on testimony by secret informants — “show disturbing continuity” with the abuses of Mr. Hussein’s era.Hassan al-Azzawi, who spent seven months in the prison in 2004 when it was under American control, said the reopening showed the government’s lack of commitment to reconciliation, or perhaps betrayed an intention to stuff the prison with its opponents.Mr. Azzawi, 50, is among more than 300 former inmates suing two American contractors, CACI International and the Titan Corporation, for torture and abuse in American courts. The companies supplied the military with interrogators and translators.Another plaintiff, who wished to be identified only by his first name, Asaad, because his case is pending, described in detail the tactics used by the interrogation teams.He said he was made to stand for hours under a freezing cold shower until he collapsed. He was then dragged to the cellblock’s hallway, where he said he had to crawl naked on the hard floor as he was punched by guards and threatened with rape. Asaad, 36, said he was once shackled to his bed for more than a day.“I am an average citizen, I have no say, but it is better to turn it into a museum,” Asaad said. “Horrible things happened in Abu Ghraib.”Balkis Sharara cringes when she recalls how her husband, Rifat Chadirji, one of Iraq’s most prominent architects, was incarcerated there 30 years ago after being sentenced to life in prison for “economic sabotage” and “grand treason” after declining to work on a government-financed project.“These were the darkest days of our lives,” she said by telephone from the couple’s home in Lebanon.Mr. Chadirji, now 83, recalled hearing torture sessions nearly every night, and the execution in one day of 180 fellow inmates in the cellblock for political detainees. He was pardoned in late 1981 by Mr. Hussein, and the couple left Iraq for good the next year.'"
"'09-02-21,'0','BERLIN — The investigation into an audacious multimillion-dollar jewelry heist here at Germany’s largest department store took a strange twist last week when DNA found in a glove at the crime scene led investigators to not one, but two suspects. The question facing prosecutors — one that could undermine their case against the pair — is whose DNA it is, since the suspects are twins.In the early morning hours of Sunday, Jan. 25, masked thieves climbed onto a second-floor awning at a famous department store, Kaufhaus des Westens, then forced open a window. The three men, who were caught on surveillance tape, lowered themselves to the main floor of the store with a rope ladder.The criminals managed to avoid setting off the store’s security systems, including motion detectors, while breaking into cabinets and showcases at an outlet of the jewelry store Christ. They made it out of the building undetected, with jewelry and watches reportedly worth millions of dollars.In the process, the burglars left behind the rope ladder as well as the glove that would provide investigators with the crucial clue, albeit a more complicated one than it first appeared.The robbery alone was enough to transfix the German capital. Not only was it a spectacular crime, but Kaufhaus des Westens, which is also known as KaDeWe and is the second largest department store in Europe after Harrods, is a Berlin icon. The store, near the famous Kurfürstendamm shopping avenue and the Zoological Garden train station, opened in 1907 and became synonymous with luxury in the nation’s capital.The break-in was discovered the following Monday morning, when the store opened. The jeweler offered a reward of up to 100,000 euros, about $128,000, for the recovery of the jewelry and the watches.'"
"'09-02-21,'0','A. R. Rahman knows how big a deal it would be if he wins an Oscar on Sunday.One of the most prolific and successful film composers in India, he has three nominations, all for “Slumdog Millionaire”: best original score and best original song, for both “Jai Ho” and “O ... Saya,” a collaboration with the Sri Lankan-British rapper M.I.A. (The film, by Danny Boyle, has 10 nominations, and last month Mr. Rahman won a Golden Globe for best score.)“It would be a great honor,” Mr. Rahman said with characteristic diffidence in a phone interview this week from Los Angeles, where he was preparing to perform at the ceremony. “It would help me to do bigger things.”Ask him what those bigger things might be, however, and he grows even quieter. Naming some Western directors he would like to work with, he sounds distracted, almost bored, as if the future is just too abstract to worry about.“Baz Luhrmann,” he said. A beat, then: “Ridley Scott. I’m a big fan of Ridley.”But when it comes to his music Mr. Rahman, who is 43 but with his cherubic cheeks could pass for less than 30, turns surprisingly chatty. His work has been in more than 100 films since 1992, and after scoring Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Bollywood-themed stage musical “Bombay Dreams” in 2002 he enjoyed had a steadily growing profile in the West. One of the first major composers in India to embrace digital technology, he is in his natural habitat at the computer, and he maintains the manic, multitasking rhythm of a true 21st-century techie.“I like to see a film and then start scoring it in my mind, while doing something unrelated,” he said. “You just grasp a film and start working, and something unpredictable comes out from a third element. The mind, the more active it is, the more productive it is.”Productivity, along with a gift for golden melody and a cosmopolitan touch that reflects the new, globally conscious India, have given Mr. Rahman, who lives and works in Chennai (the city formerly known as Madras), a kind of national-hero status. “Rah Rah Rahman,” The Times of India proclaimed on its front page after the Oscar nominations were announced.'"
"'09-02-21,'0','The Lone Star Regional was played in Houston the first week of February. An extensive daily bulletin, unusual for a regional, was edited by Donna Compton. The diagramed deal, which was in the Friday bulletin, featured an excellent recovery by Jeff Meckstroth, one of the world’s most imaginative players.A competitive auction ended with South in three spades. Meckstroth (West) led the heart four.Declarer, after winning with dummy’s ace, would have done best to play a diamond toward his king. But instead he led a club to his ace, collecting East’s jack. Now South played the spade seven from his hand.If West had stepped in with his ace and led back the club ten, the contract might have been beaten by two tricks. But declarer would probably have played low from the board. Then Eric Rodwell (East) would have had to discard, not ruff. East would have ruffed the next club and played a high heart. Eventually declarer would have lost two spades (West gets his spade jack on a trump promotion when East gets in with the diamond ace and leads another high heart), two diamonds, one club and the club ruff.Note also that if West cashes the club king before leading the club ten, declarer can escape with eight tricks if he does not cover with dummy’s queen.However, West played low on the trump, and so did declarer from the dummy.West took the second spade with his ace and led ... what?'"
"'09-02-21,'0','De Beers, the world’s largest diamond producer, said Friday that sales in the fourth quarter slowed and that 2009 would remain “challenging.”Strong demand for diamonds in the first three quarters of last year helped De Beers increase yearly sales to $6.89 billion, from $6.84 billion. But sales in November and December were “below expectations,” Gareth Penny, the company’s group managing director, said.As recently as September, De Beers could not get diamonds out of the ground fast enough. But since the financial crisis took a sharp turn for the worse after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in mid-September, De Beers has had to reduce production by shortening workweeks, introducing more flexible hours and shifting workers away from digging to mine maintenance.De Beers, in which the mining giant Anglo American owns a 45 percent stake, controls about 40 percent of the diamond market. The company said in January that it would reduce the production of rough gems by about 50 percent through April.A De Beers unit also recently shelved a deal to acquire half of a Russian gem miner because of the financial crisis; another subsidiary just terminated a production agreement at a mine in South Africa.Other producers are also suffering. Alrosa, the Russian state-run diamond miner, sharply reduced its annual profit forecast in December, citing falling demand. And the jewelry retailer Fortunoff and a smaller rival, Shane, have filed for bankruptcy protection.But the seeds of the diamond industry’s troubles were planted even before the downturn, as producers accumulated a large inventory and took on excessive debt.The production overhang is mainly the result of a strategic change at De Beers about 10 years ago. When Cecil Rhodes, the swashbuckling British-born businessman, founded De Beers in the 19th century, the company established a tight grip on the diamond market and kept the price of diamonds on a steady upward arc by buying excess supply.The system worked wonders for decades but became unsustainable as competition from smaller miners increased and demand for other luxury goods replaced consumer appetite for gemstones. De Beers changed its strategy and started to sell rough diamonds at 10 annual auctions, but it was still stuck with a stockpile of roughly $4 billion in diamonds.The immediate outlook is grim. Chaim Even-Zohar, manager of Tacy, an industry consulting firm in Israel, said he expected demand for rough diamonds to decline by at least 60 percent this year, leading to a further price drop of about 25 percent.Recent price declines prompted Angola and other countries whose economies rely heavily on the industry to consider buying diamonds to keep them off the market. Indeed, Russia has already bought some products from Alrosa.In Botswana, where the mining giant Debswana is a joint venture between De Beers and the government, lawmakers have warned of the devastating effects a mine closure or a fire sale of assets could have on the country’s economic, social and development projects, since diamonds account for about two-thirds of its exports.The $20 billion industry is grappling with corporate debt levels that ballooned to a combined $22 billion in 2008. The reluctance of banks to lend coincides with a drop in the value of diamonds that companies use as a security for loans.The immediate outlook for the industry might look bleak, but some analysts said that once the production overhang worked itself through the system, prices would recover. Without new discoveries, Mr. Even-Zohar expects the world to run out of new diamonds within 20 years.As demand recovers, any diamond shortage would drive up prices and revive mining. “The long-term fundamentals look good,” Mr. Even-Zohar said. “But in the meantime countries and populations will suffer.”'"
"'09-02-21,'0','Ms. Politkovskaya was a fierce critic of the Kremlin’s policy in Chechnya, and her killing in 2006 underlined the shrinking space allowed dissenters in Russian society. Investigators and colleagues concluded that someone had ordered her death to silence her, and Russia’s prosecutor general personally took charge of the case because of its importance.But two and a half years later, the three men who were tried on murder charges were peripheral figures: two young Chechen men accused of acting as a lookout and a driver for the suspected triggerman, who has never been found, and a former police investigator accused of organizing logistics for the killing.Sergei M. Sokolov, deputy editor of the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, where Ms. Politkovskaya worked, attributed the result to “resistance from the whole system,” in particular the refusal to prosecute members of law enforcement and special forces.“There were two verdicts delivered today,” he said. “One, de jure, was the acquittal of the defendants. But a guilty verdict was leveled against the corrupt system that exists here. Nothing works, not one governmental institution works.”The Russian Prosecutor General’s office announced plans to challenge the verdict.According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 16 journalists have been killed in Russia because of their work since 2000. The most recent was Anastasia Baburova, who was shot Jan. 19 along with the lawyer Stanislav Markelov as they left a news conference. Only one of those 16 cases has resulted in a conviction, and none of those who organized the killings have been found.“Russia is a country where for years and years now, journalists who cover human rights issues and corruption are being murdered and assaulted,” said Miklos Haraszti, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s representative for media freedom.“It has to be admitted, at the highest level of the country, that there can be no free speech in a country where the best journalists are afraid for their lives for doing their jobs.”The three-month trial took place in a cramped courtroom, where the murder suspects watched from behind the bars of an iron cage. Two were brothers, Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov, who prosecutors said had assisted their brother Rustam in stalking Ms. Politkovskaya to her apartment. Rustam, who prosecutors say was the gunman, is believed to be in hiding.A third murder suspect, Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, was accused of having hired the Makhmudov brothers, provided the weapon and coordinated the murder. A fourth defendant, Col. Pavel A. Ryaguzov, was accused of criminal ties to the killers, but no role in the killing itself. He was also acquitted Thursday.The prosecution offered thin evidence, relying heavily on cellphone billing records that showed that the suspects called one another from areas around the crime scene before and after the murder took place. The jury deliberated for two hours before returning its verdict.Friederike Behr, a researcher from Amnesty International who monitored portions of the trial, said she could “respect the decision of the jury because the evidence wasn’t clear.”When the verdict was read, the suspects were allowed to walk out of the metal cage and then onto the Old Arbat, Moscow’s grand pedestrian street. As he stepped outside, Ibragim Makhmudov threw his arm around his lawyer, looked up at the sky and shouted “Allahu akbar,” or “God is great,” several times.“We have received a principled and honest verdict,” said Murad Musayev, who defended Dzhabrail Makhmudov. “We are saying it not because this verdict is in our favor but because, without bias, there could be no other verdict in this case.”But at a news conference shortly afterward, both Mr. Sokolov and Ms. Politkovskaya’s son, Ilya, said they were convinced that the suspects acquitted Thursday were connected to her killing. “The level of their involvement should have been shown in court, but for some reason the prosecutors were not able to do this,” Mr. Politkovsky said.Ms. Politkovskaya, 48, distinguished herself covering Moscow’s war in Chechnya, which she characterized as “state versus group terrorism.” She documented torture, mass executions, kidnapping and the sale by Russian soldiers of Chechen corpses to their families for proper Islamic burial, concluding, “What response could one expect but more terrorism, and the recruitment of more resistance fighters?”On Oct. 7, 2006, she was found dead with a Makarov 9-millimeter pistol dropped at her side. Ms. Politkovskaya’s editor at Novaya Gazeta, Dmitri A. Muratov, has maintained from the beginning that she was killed because her investigations were threatening the financial interests of figures within Russia.But the authorities have said the murder was ordered from abroad by enemies of the present government. Yuri Chaika, the prosecutor general, said at a news conference in 2007 that the killers hoped to “create a crisis situation and bring about a return to the old management system in which money and oligarchs decided everything.”Thursday’s verdict suggests that Russian officials have little to show after two and a half years of investigation into this high-profile murder. Yet, as the courtroom emptied out into the clear, icy afternoon, Karinna Moskalenko, a lawyer for Ms. Politkovskaya’s family, seemed undaunted, bursting out with a battle cry.“We want the real killers, the real killers!” she said. “And we shall succeed in it.”'"
"'09-02-21,'0','He insisted that the recession was far less a problem than a $6 million construction cost overrun that forced the museum to severely cut marketing. He said an ill-conceived ad campaign resulted in “95 percent of residents of New York City never hearing of us.”Schwalb said that for the past six weeks, after efforts to restructure the bond debt failed, the board tried to sell the museum for $10 million, one-tenth of the total cost of the venture, including seed money that was invested earlier.He said the deal now being offered potential buyers is an 85 percent stake in the museum, with the rest retained by the original equity investors. He said he would prefer that the old investors retain 25 percent. Schwalb was the original chief executive, but the board asked him to surrender the role last year.Unsuccessful acquisition talks were held, he said, with Magic Johnson Enterprises and a small group of the original investors.“I think we’ll have to sell within about three weeks,” said Schwalb. “The concept is still strong and the subject matter is as compelling as the Museum of Arts and Design in Columbus Circle, and it’s not in the middle of Times Square, either.” The arts and design museum opened last September.David Warburg, the lead lawyer of the unsuccessful effort to restructure the museum’s debt, said the museum will probably liquidate its assets and return memorabilia to their owners. He said that Schwalb “never appeared with any investor that was concrete and, quite frankly, he didn’t do much to advance things.”Schwalb’s plan from its earliest conception was to create a Smithsonian-like museum of sports that would be more central to fans and tourists than individual sports halls of fame.He believes the site, near the World Trade Center and where tourists head to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, is as viable as the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum at 12th Avenue and 46th Street, or the popular Bodies exhibition at the South Street Seaport. But the museum was hamstrung by not being in a stand-alone building; it is inside the old Standard Oil building and lacks the exterior signage that would define it as a major attraction.The museum’s demise is likely to make the Heisman Trophy an orphan again. The Downtown Athletic Club, its longtime former home, shut its doors in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. A large gallery in the museum is devoted to the Heisman and its history.Bill Dockery, president of the Heisman Trophy Trust, said: “We’re disappointed and find it unfortunate that the traffic flow didn’t allow the museum to continue as it was expected. A new buyer would be fine if they treat the Heisman with integrity. I know Philip had his heart in this, and I’m sure this is taking a lot out of him.”'"
"'09-02-21,'0','On Thursday, the government reported that wholesale prices halted five months of declines to rise a larger-than-expected 0.8 percent in January. Slumping oil prices hit a plateau last month, and gasoline prices jumped 15 percent.“The boost to purchasing power from falling energy prices is basically over,” the chief economist at T. Rowe Price, Alan D. Levenson, said.The average price of a gallon of gasoline fell from its summertime high of $4.11 to less than $1.70 this winter as the price of oil collapsed. In January, retail gasoline prices rose 6 percent while transportation costs rose 1.3 percent, their first increase since July, the government reported.The cost of airfare, however, fell 2.1 percent last month as business and leisure travelers continued to cut back on vacations and business trips.Consumer prices were flat in August and September and then dropped sharply in the last three months of 2008 as the credit crisis erupted, deepening a broad downturn. As consumers slashed their spending and businesses cut jobs, orders and output, prices fell at an annualized rate of 12.7 percent from October through December.Retailers also slashed prices during the holiday season, hoping that discounts of 70 percent and offers of free merchandise would lure customers to spend and help clear inventories.For economists and policy makers, months of slumping consumer prices raised the specter of deflation, a spiral of falling prices, falling employment and lower economic growth.“The Fed will not take kindly to a world in which the unemployment rate is rapidly increasing and yet core inflation has collapsed to zero,” said Abiel Reinhart, an economist at JPMorgan Economic Research. “They may act more aggressively.”The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates to nearly zero, and it has signaled that it will print more money to try to right the economy. Several members of the Fed’s Open Market Committee were worried that the country was heading into a period of “excessively low inflation,” and some others saw a risk of deflation, according to the minutes of its most recent meeting, in late January.The Fed cut its inflation outlook for the year to a range of 0.3 to 1 percent, from an earlier estimate of 1.3 to 2 percent.'"
"'09-02-21,'0','As the recession drags on and banking losses pile up, investors have been concerned that the administration could step in and take over some large banks, effectively wiping out stockholders, analysts said. Those concerns gripped markets on Friday after Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, told Bloomberg Television that a short-term nationalization might be necessary.Bank of America fell slightly, and Citigroup fell by 22 percent, to $1.95 a share, down 90 percent from its share price a year ago. Regional banks fell. Shares of the Ohio-based Fifth Third Bancorp, which has been granted more than $3 billion under the federal financial bailout, closed at $1.03.“All these banks are becoming insolvent,” David Kovacs, chief investment officer of quantitative strategies at Turner Investment Partners, said of the broad banking system. “These banks are undercapitalized.”Still, some analysts said the chatter about nationalization highlighted deepening investor pessimism.“I think it is a cause du jour for taking down financial stocks,” said Michael Holland, chairman of Holland & Company. “When people see a reason for selling, they go ahead and sell some more.” In another signal of growing investor fear, gold prices rose $25.70, to $1,001.80 an ounce, as investors ran for cover in a metal thought to have intrinsic value. Gold prices tumbled to near $700 an ounce last autumn as the economy slowed, but analysts say investors have bid up the precious metal as they worry about long-term inflation and huge government spending plans.Demand for United States. debt was strong as well. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 19/32, at 99 22/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.79 percent, down from 2.85 percent late Thursday.Crude oil prices in New York fell 54 cents, to settle at $38.94, up from $35 a barrel at the start of the week. Shares of energy companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Total closed lower.“We thought the low points of last fall were behind us, but we seem to be in for more disappointments,” said a strategist at ING Investment in Brussels, Vincent Juvyns. “The markets have lost all sense of direction, which makes it hard to take a position.”Markets largely discounted a report from the Labor Department that consumer prices increased 0.3 percent in January, rising for the first time since July. Consumer prices remained flat year-over-year, a sign of continuing pressure on prices as the recession deepens.“It’s not terrible to see a break in the disinflationary spiral we’re in even if such a break is only temporary,” Dan Greenhaus, an analyst with the equity strategy group of Miller Tabak, wrote in a note.'"
"'09-02-21,'0','It remained unclear how quickly the United States would have to find an alternative. President Kurmanbek Bakiyev of Kyrgyzstan was expected to send Washington an official notice, but American officials said they still did not know when it would be received or when the six-month countdown would start. Mr. Bakiyev signed the legislation on Friday.The bill in Parliament was approved by 78 of the 81 lawmakers present, with two voting against it and one abstaining.The Kyrgyz government in Bishkek had longstanding complaints about the base and had asked for more cash compensation. Tensions were exacerbated in 2006 when an American serviceman fatally shot a Kyrgyz truck driver.Mr. Bakiyev announced the move to close the base at a news conference with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, who this month promised to shore up Kyrgyzstan’s struggling economy with about $2.15 billion in loans and grants. Moscow has long complained about the continued American military presence in Central Asia, and many in Washington concluded that Russia had encouraged the move in an attempt to assert its dominance in the region.Although Russian and Kyrgyz officials say there was no connection between the Kremlin’s financial aid and efforts to kick out the Americans, senior American officials have complained that the Russians are trying to have it both ways — with the Kremlin expressing a desire to support the international military mission in Afghanistan while pressing the Kyrgyz government to end American access to its air base.In public comments as part of the vote, Kyrgyz lawmakers portrayed the action as the culmination of years of complaints and said the American presence in Central Asia had outlasted its usefulness.“It is impossible to make people of Afghanistan live by standards which are brought in from abroad,” said Kabai Karabhekov, a member of Parliament. “One has to give an opportunity to Afghan people to build their country themselves.”The shadow of Russian actions in Central Asia and Central Europe fell over the session of NATO ministers here, as Mr. Gates also was pressed on whether the Obama administration intended to move forward with a plan for missile defenses in Europe that had been a priority of the Bush administration’s foreign policy and that had brought threats of military retaliation from Russia.Mr. Gates, in his first overseas trip since he began serving the new president, said the missile defense bases planned in Poland and the Czech Republic would proceed if the technology proved it could work and was affordable.Neither of those two caveats were part of the Bush administration’s language when discussing requirements for the bases.But Mr. Gates also made it clear that the Obama administration had not yet met on the issue of missile defense policy, and that no decisions had been made on how to proceed.“The administration has not yet reviewed where it is on a whole range of issues,” Mr. Gates said, including the missile defense program and how to manage that within the relationship with Russia.Mr. Gates said the radar proposed for the Czech Republic and the 10 interceptor missiles for Poland were to counter a potential threat from Iran, and he reiterated that the United States would work with NATO and wanted Russia as a partner in the effort.To reassure his hosts here, Mr. Gates said that a series of new bilateral military cooperation efforts with Poland were proceeding even as the prospects for the missile defense site on Polish territory remained uncertain.Also Thursday, NATO officials confirmed that Germany had pledged 600 more soldiers to the mission in Afghanistan.“We welcome the commitment of additional German forces for the upcoming Afghan national elections,” said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary. “For those contests to be credible, voter turnout must be robust and representative, and improving the security situation is the key to making that happen.”Italy announced this week that it would add 500 troops to the alliance mission in Afghanistan by April.'"

Last week, he said federal authorities wanted to talk to him about their investigation of Mr. Blagojevich. Mr. Burris said his attorneys had been trying to set up the meeting for some time.The Chicago Tribune, The Chicago Sun-Times and the television station WMAQ, citing people they did not name, reported that the meeting occurred at the Chicago offices of Mr. Burris’s lawyer. Messages left Saturday for the lawyer, Timothy Wright III, were not immediately returned.A spokesman for Mr. Burris, Jim O’Connor, declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the United States attorney’s office, Randall Samborn.The reports said the meeting had been delayed for weeks and was not related to investigations into Mr. Burris’s testimony before state lawmakers last month about his contacts with people close to Mr. Blagojevich.

"'09-02-22,'0','Alfred J. Kahn, a social-policy scholar and an educator who turned a critical eye on failures of local and state governments in child development and family support, and who later argued for a European-style social-welfare system available to all citizens, died on Feb. 13 in Hackensack, N.J. He was 90 and lived in Cliffside Park, N.J.The death was confirmed by his daughter, Nancy Valerie Kahn.Mr. Kahn, who taught at the Columbia University School of Social Work for 57 years, was a one-man watchdog organization who monitored the social services offered by the city and state of New York, most visibly as a longtime consultant to the Citizens’ Committee for Children, for which he wrote dozens of reports on matters like truancy, children’s courts and child-guidance programs.“I represent a concern for what is being accomplished, rather than what is being done,” he told The New York Post in 1965. “‘Services rendered’ are not enough. I want to know what’s going on.”Beginning in the 1970s, when social policy makers largely ignored developments in other industrialized countries, he carried out pioneering studies on social-welfare systems in Europe and their possible implications for the United States.“He introduced comparative social policy to the United States,” said Sheila B. Kamerman, his collaborator on numerous reports by the Cross-National Studies Research Program at the School for Social Work.'"
"'09-02-22,'0','Reading the news that General Motors and Chrysler are now lining up for another $20 billion or so in government aid — on top of the billions they’ve already received or requested — leaves me with the sick feeling that we are subsidizing the losers and for only one reason: because they claim that their funerals would cost more than keeping them on life support. Sorry, friends, but this is not the American way. Bailing out the losers is not how we got rich as a country, and it is not how we’ll get out of this crisis.G.M. has become a giant wealth- destruction machine — possibly the biggest in history — and it is time that it and Chrysler were put into bankruptcy so they can truly start over under new management with new labor agreements and new visions. When it comes to helping companies, precious public money should focus on start-ups, not bailouts.You want to spend $20 billion of taxpayer money creating jobs? Fine. Call up the top 20 venture capital firms in America, which are short of cash today because their partners — university endowments and pension funds — are tapped out, and make them this offer: The U.S. Treasury will give you each up to $1 billion to fund the best venture capital ideas that have come your way. If they go bust, we all lose. If any of them turns out to be the next Microsoft or Intel, taxpayers will give you 20 percent of the investors’ upside and keep 80 percent for themselves.If we are going to be spending billions of taxpayer dollars, it can’t only be on office-decorating bankers, over-leveraged home speculators and auto executives who year after year spent more energy resisting changes and lobbying Washington than leading change and beating Toyota.I’ve been traveling all across the country on a book tour, and every evening I return to my hotel with my pockets full of business cards from inventors in clean energy. Our country is still bursting with innovators looking for capital. So, let’s make sure all the losers clamoring for help don’t drown out the potential winners who could lift us out of this. Some of our best companies, such as Intel, were started in recessions, when necessity makes innovators even more inventive and risk-takers even more daring.'"

"'09-02-22,'0','DIYARBAKIR, Turkey — Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey took his message of inclusion into the center of Turkey’s Kurdish heartland on Saturday, telling this city, once the center of Kurdish resistance, that its people were “first-class citizens.”Turkey’s Kurds are at least a fifth of this country’s population and have long been repressed by the Turkish state. Mr. Erdogan told a cheering crowd here that they had equal rights with other citizens, and that his party would devote the same resources to their region in southeastern Turkey, as to the more developed, affluent western part. The speech was part of a campaign tour before nationwide municipal elections on March 29.For years, Turkey’s mostly Kurdish southeast was ignored by mainstream political parties, in part because Turkey’s authorities were fighting an all-out war against a Kurdish separatist group, the Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the P.K.K. But in 2007 Mr. Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party campaigned aggressively to win the Kurdish vote, a strategy that paid off in elections that year, when they swept the southeast.Still, Mr. Erdogan’s party has not yet managed to conquer Diyarbakir, the largest and most important city in the region.The issue of Kurds here is delicate, and Mr. Erdogan, who in the past shocked nationalist Turks by publicly acknowledging that Turkey had not always treated its Kurdish population fairly, knows that better than anyone. In his hour-and-19-minute speech, he spoke carefully, deftly avoiding giving precise names to the problems of inequality he was describing.'"
"'09-02-22,'0','A few days each week, Ms. Rohr teaches a course on character development. She stresses what she calls “consequence trails” and encourages students to recognize the suffering and pain unleashed in the wake of bad decisions.Ms. Rohr says she believes the focus on character is essential. Without it, the program might, as she puts it, “take an old dope dealer, equip him with a skill set and help him to become a better dope dealer when he gets out.”P.E.P. also sponsors comprehensive post-release programs for its graduates in Houston and Dallas. Services include housing, free or low-cost dental and medical care and an evening entrepreneurship school taught by volunteers who also serve as professional mentors.Since the program’s inception, 441 men, roughly a quarter of whom had been incarcerated for violent crimes, have graduated. Just over 8 percent have returned to prison — nationally, the recidivism rate exceeds 25 percent.A low recidivism rate can be a misleading measure of success, warns Shawn Bushway , a criminologist at the School of Criminal Justice at the University at Albany. Prison-based work programs can be effective, he explains, but their success may say as much about the cross-section of participants as the programs themselves.Ms. Rohr happily acknowledges cherry-picking the most talented prisoners who want to change their ways. She says that P.E.P. accepts only about 20 percent of its applicants. Moreover, fewer than half the students accepted last year graduated from the program. Most graduates put their business skills to work for someone else, but 57 men have begun their own businesses. These range from painting and automotive repair to catering; 32 of the 57 businesses are still operating.One of the entrepreneurs is Nathan Dangerfield, owner of Promised Land Lawn Service in Houston. Mr. Dangerfield, who was released from prison in October 2006, after serving 21 months for possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, started the business in March 2008. A low-interest $2,000 loan and a $500 seed grant, both from P.E.P., financed the company.Mr. Dangerfield, who has two part-time employees, declined to disclose current revenue, but says he hopes to gross $250,000 this year by expanding the number of commercial customers. He consults weekly with a mentor he met through P.E.P. Mr. Dangerfield calls the program “the best opportunity I could have had at a second chance.”ANOTHER P.E.P. graduate, Jeffrey Doucette, began Save the Day Restoration and Carpet Care, in Wylie, Tex., in December. He was released from prison in January 2008, after serving 42 months for drug dealing, and says P.E.P. gave him not just business knowledge, but also honesty and integrity. “If I don’t clean the spot of carpet behind a door, I can’t live with myself,” he said.Many in the corrections business are wary of entrepreneurship programs, according to Deborah Mukamal, director of the Prisoner Reentry Institute at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Entrepreneurs must thrive in unstructured environments, and many ex-offenders do better with more structure, she says. In addition, failure rates among new companies are high.Ms. Mukamal nonetheless commends P.E.P. and similar programs, like the Coffee Creek Prison Project in Wilsonville, Ore., and the Workshop in Business Opportunities in New York, which offers a course to introduce inmates to the basic concepts of owning a business.“These are new, bold ideas,” she says, “and there are too many people going into prison and coming home not to try new ideas.”'"
"'09-02-22,'0','The popular response to vivid accounts of past depressions is partly psychological, but it has a rational base. We have to look at past episodes because economic theory, lacking the physical constants of the hard sciences, has never offered a complete account of the mechanics of depressions.The Great Depression does appear genuinely relevant. The bursting of twin bubbles in the stock and real estate markets, accompanied by huge failures of financial institutions and a drop in confidence, has no more recent example than that of the 1930s.This isn’t the first time that the Great Depression has become an active story. It also was heard during the recession of 1981 and 1982, which resulted in unemployment rates of nearly 11 percent.Hyman Minsky wrote a 1982 book, “Can ‘It’ Happen Again?,” that raised the possibility of a new depression. But the widespread perception then was that the decline was caused by the Federal Reserve, which had clamped down on the money supply to end out-of-control inflation. Depression fear did not take off.The Great Depression also received some attention after the market crash of 1987. But then the stock market crisis was widely perceived as having been caused by a technical strategy called program trading, and again there was no huge banking crisis or loss of confidence.This time is different: the Great Depression appears truly relevant, and many people have been spooked by the story.To understand the story’s significance in driving our thinking, it is important to recognize that the Great Depression itself was partly driven by the retelling of earlier depression stories. In the 1930s, there was incessant talk about the depressions of the 1870s and 1890s; each of those downturns lasted for the better part of a decade. Christina Romer, now the chairwoman of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, has shown that the unemployment rate stayed above 10 percent for each of the five years from 1894 to 1898.In his influential 1909 book, “Forty Years of American Finance,” Alexander Dana Noyes (who would later be financial editor of The New York Times) argued that the depressions of the 1870s and the 1890s might have lasted much longer, except for accidents of history — a “European famine and a bumper crop at home” which stimulated the domestic economy through its agricultural sector.EARLY in the Great Depression, people were concerned that, as one observer put it in 1931, we may “pass through a long period of mediocre business activity like that of the 1890s.”Also early in the Depression, Forrest Davis worried in “What Price Wall Street?” that weakness after the panic of 1907 might have led to a prolonged depression if not for the accident of the World War. In 1932, a review of this book in The Times lamented that Mr. Davis had given us “no especial assurance that any of the traditional accidents can save us once more. The last war showed how terrible the next war will be.”Should President Obama have reinforced the Great Depression story? Perhaps he had to take that risk to promote the economic stimulus plan, and not just hope for some accident to save us. The story was already entrenched in our consciousness, and will be with us until we see a real, solid boost from the stimulus package and its likely successors.'"

"'09-02-22,'0','Most everyone agrees that something is very wrong with the six-page federal form for families seeking help with college costs.Created in 1992 to simplify applying for financial aid, it has become so intimidating  with more than 100 questions  that critics say it scares off the very families most in need, preventing some teenagers from going to college.Then, too, some families have begun paying for professional help with the form, known as the Fafsa,a situation that experts say indicates just how far awry the whole process has gone.“We’re getting thousands of calls a day,” said Craig V. Carroll, chief executive of Student Financial Aid Services Inc., whose fafsa.com charges $80 to $100 to fill out the form. “Our calls for the month of January are up about 35 percent from last year. There’s been a huge increase in the desperation of families.”Last year, Congress ordered the form streamlined, but in the very same bill it added seven new questions. Critics say that even when all those questions are answered, the form does a poor job of assessing financial worth, both because it excludes assets like cars, boats, the family home and some family businesses, and because it does not factor in the high cost of living in areas like New York.On the campaign trail, President Obama promised to eliminate the form  officially, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. And his secretary of education, Arne Duncan, talked about the problem at his confirmation hearing, saying, “You basically have to have a Ph.D. to figure that thing out.”But whether it will be replaced soon, and with what, remains an open question.Between the recession and the rising cost of college, more families than ever are filing the forms this year, their first step toward Pell grants, Stafford loans, Perkins loans, work-study programs and much state aid. As of Feb. 15, the Department of Education had already received 2,213,408 forms, 20 percent more than at this time last year.Some researchers have found that the form could be drastically simplified without any great impact on students’ aid eligibility. But experts warn that if the form becomes too simple, some states and universities might create new forms to get additional information.“In the long run, I think the Fafsa will get easier,” said Lauren Asher, acting president of the Institute for College Access and Success. “But not this year.”The Department of Education is considering two approaches to simplifying the form, said Robert Shireman, founder of the institute and currently a consultant to Mr. Duncan. One, proposed by former Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings in a Jan. 16 letter to Congress, would cut out most financial questions, asking only for adjusted gross income and the number of tax exemptions. Her sample form is two pages and has fewer than 30 questions. (The current form, with accompanying instructions, has more than five times as many words as this article.)The other approach, favored by Ms. Asher and others, would let taxpayers direct the Internal Revenue Service to share information from their tax returns with the Education Department.“It’s not yet been decided which way to go,” Mr. Shireman said. “One way is simple, using very few data elements, and the question is whether that’s enough. The other approach gets a little more data, but has the drawback that not everyone files taxes, especially lower-income people. And it raises some timing questions, since the Fafsa starts in January, and the information the I.R.S. has at that point is from the prior tax year.”While some pilot projects may be ready for next year’s application season, he said, transforming the whole system will not be that quick, particularly since some changes would require Congressional action.“One thing we will have, by August, is a Government Accountability Office analysis of the effects of the different options,” Mr. Shireman said.The form becomes available each year on Jan. 1, and counselors urge families to file early because some aid is first come first served.Free help for filing is widely available, from the Education Department, counselors and workshops like College Goal Sunday offering line-by-line guidance.“It’s daunting,” said Janette Logan, a Connecticut mother who had her daughter, Kate Brown, in tow recently at College Goal Sunday at Norwalk Community College. “Kate met her deadlines in applying for college, and now this is mine.”But after about an hour in the computer room, Ms. Logan realized that she did not have all the necessary information, so she and her daughter left without submitting the form. As the afternoon wore on, many families drifted away without finishing.“I didn’t bring everything I need, but at least I know what to do now,” said Gary Curto, who had researched the form on the Internet, landed at fafsa.com, assumed it was the official government site and nearly paid for help.“I was just about to pay, but my wife knew it was supposed to be free,” he said.But Brigid Duffy, a mother of four in Lynn, Mass., decided the help was worth the cost.“I know it sounds silly, but what appealed to me was that you could be done in 20 minutes,” said Ms. Duffy, who used fafsa.com for her son Griffin’s form. “I’d done the Fafsa myself in the past, for my 22-year-old, and it took five or six hours. It’s not fun.”Without help, however, many give up. “Students who would be eligible for aid see how complex the form is, get what I call ‘form fright’ and just stop,” said Pat Watkins, director of financial aid at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Fla.Many affluent families now use high-priced financial advisers to maximize their eligibility for financial aid. Kalman A. Chany, the president of Campus Consultants Inc., attracts many families to his $1,450 service through financial aid presentations for parents at dozens of New York schools, including Dalton, Horace Mann and Brooklyn Tech.“We’ve had a lot more people sign up this year, especially since October,” said Mr. Chany, whose clients’ children often apply to private colleges that require both the Fafsa and an even more detailed form, the College Board’s CSS Profile.“We’re not like the services that just take the data and put it on the form,” said Mr. Chany, author of “Paying for College Without Going Broke.” “We analyze the clients’ situation and then tell them, ‘If you change this, your financial aid picture could be different.’ ”Each current proposal for revising the federal aid form has drawbacks  and detractors.“The financial aid community wants precision, and a formula that accurately assesses ability to pay, so there’s resistance to any approach that’s simpler but less precise,” said Mark Kantrowitz, president of finaid.org, a financial aid site. “There’s also a very real concern that if you discard the questions the states, or certain institutions, wanted answered, they’ll create their own financial aid forms, putting us right back where we were before the Fafsa.”'"
"'09-02-22,'0','In the most recent national poll on the issue, conducted in 2003 by The New York Times and CBS News, 62 percent of respondents said the public should be allowed to see photographs of the military honor guard receiving coffins at Dover, in Delaware, while 27 percent opposed the idea. The poll questioned 1,042 people and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.Since Mr. Obama’s announcement, Families United for Our Troops and Their Mission, which represents 60,000 families of military personnel, including some who have died, has publicly opposed lifting the ban. The group also asked its members in an e-mail message whether they favored keeping or changing the ban.Of the roughly 600 people who responded, the group said, 64 percent said the policy should not be changed; 21 percent said that if the ban were changed, the families should be able to determine news media access on a case-by-case basis, and 12 percent said the policy should be changed to allow cameras.Among the respondents, the group said, was a mother, whose name it withheld to protect her privacy, who wrote: “When our son arrived into Dover A.F.B., my husband had arranged to be there as they took him off of the plane ... we couldn’t imagine him being all alone. It was a very private and emotional moment and one that should have belonged only to us. We were inundated by press at our home, at the funeral and for months after, and we were generous with their access, but were very grateful that they weren’t allowed to be present at Dover. ... This was our precious son, not a political statement.”But another mother who had lost her son said she favored lifting the ban.“I am in favor of controlled media coverage at Dover because I feel people need to be made aware of the sacrifice my son and so many other brave men and women have made for their freedom,” she wrote.But if the views of military families suggest the repatriations should be closed, the policies of allies may suggest they be open. Repatriation is more of a national event in Britain and Canada.In Canada, families decide whether the news media can cover the arrival ceremonies on the tarmac at the air base at Trenton, Ontario. “They can’t be under the nose of the family, but they can capture the event,” said Capt. Isabelle Riche, the public affairs officer for the base.In Britain, the Defense Ministry usually takes photographs of the arrival ceremonies at the air base at Lyneham and releases them to the news media. Reporters are sometimes admitted but are also kept at some distance from the families. Accepting government photographs has irritated some British journalists who want more editorial control, particularly if something out of the ordinary happens during the ceremony. Either way, the public sees the pictures.In Canada and Britain, a cortege leaves the air base for a mortuary about 100 miles away, and television often shows the procession live.The Canadian procession travels to a morgue in Toronto along Highway 401. That stretch of roadway has been renamed the Highway of Heroes, and hundreds of people often come out and pay their respects as a convoy passes.The procession in Britain, from Lyneham to a mortuary in Oxford, first passes through Wootton Bassett, a small town that has become the nation’s funeral parlor. Hundreds of people line the streets there in silent tribute.At Dover the repatriation process takes place out of public view. The mortuary is on the air base, so no public procession takes place. When they first banned representatives of the news media, military officials said that if cameras were allowed at Dover, most families would feel compelled to go there, often under emotional and financial duress. Many wait instead for a military escort to bring their loved ones home, where there is often an outpouring of support by local residents, and some families allow news coverage of the funeral.In April 2006, Canadian officials briefly imposed a news blackout on the arrival ceremonies for the coffins, saying they wanted to protect the families’ privacy. Critics said the government was trying to protect itself from antiwar sentiment; they included several families who said the public ceremonies and shows of sympathy had given them some comfort.A month later the government reversed course and allowed families to decide for themselves. The only caveat was that all immediate next of kin had to agree on the decision. If they did not, access was denied.'"
"'09-02-22,'0','He said the recession was far less a problem than a $6 million construction cost overrun that forced the museum to severely cut marketing. He said an ill-conceived ad campaign resulted in “95 percent of residents of New York City never hearing of us.”Schwalb said that for the past six weeks, after efforts to restructure the bond debt failed, the board tried to sell the museum for $10 million, one-tenth of the total cost of the venture, including seed money that was invested earlier.He said the deal now being offered is an 85 percent stake in the museum, with the rest retained by the original equity investors. He said he would prefer that the old investors retain 25 percent. Schwalb was the original chief executive, but the board asked him to surrender the role last year.Unsuccessful acquisition talks were held, he said, with Magic Johnson Enterprises and a small group of the original investors.“I think we’ll have to sell within about three weeks,” Schwalb said. “The concept is still strong and the subject matter is as compelling as the Museum of Arts and Design in Columbus Circle, and it’s not in the middle of Times Square, either.”The arts and design museum opened in September.David Warburg, the lead lawyer on the unsuccessful effort to restructure the debt, said the museum would probably liquidate its assets and return memorabilia to the owners. He said that Schwalb “never appeared with any investor that was concrete and quite frankly, he didn’t do much to advance things.”Schwalb’s plan from its earliest conception was to create a Smithsonian-like museum of sports that would be more central to fans and tourists than individual halls of fame.He said he believed that the site, near the site of the World Trade Center and where tourists head to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, was as viable as that of the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum at 12th Avenue and 46th Street, or the Bodies exhibition at the South Street Seaport. But the sports museum was not in a stand-alone building; it is inside the old Standard Oil building and lacks the exterior signage that would define it as a major attraction.The museum’s demise is likely to make the Heisman Trophy an orphan again. The Downtown Athletic Club, its longtime former home, shut its doors after the 9/11 attacks. A large gallery in the museum is devoted to the Heisman and its history.Bill Dockery, the president of the Heisman Trophy Trust, said: “We’re disappointed and find it unfortunate that the traffic flow didn’t allow the museum to continue as it was expected. A new buyer would be fine if they treat the Heisman with integrity. I know Philip had his heart in this, and I’m sure this is taking a lot out of him.”'"
"'09-02-22,'0','Although the transformation has been predicted for many years, residents and real estate agents say the Financial District is now truly on the verge of becoming a 24-hour, seven-day neighborhood that is genuinely family friendly. They point to trendy children’s clothing boutiques, ample diaper supplies in neighborhood markets, new preschools, and the construction of public schools and playgrounds.Denise Courter, who moved to 80 John Street from the Upper West Side with her husband, Matt, in 2007, said: “Our friends thought we were crazy to move down here. They said it would be a ghost town.” But the Courters knew that they could get much more square footage for their dollar here than in other parts of the city. They bought a two-bedroom apartment.Many two-bedroom apartments at the building, known as the South Star, sold for under $1 million in 2007. The median sales price for two-bedroom condos throughout Manhattan that year was $1.505 million, according to the appraisal firm Miller Samuel.Ms. Courter said that as they settled in, it became clear that they were among many other couples with the same plan: buy a bigger apartment than they could afford elsewhere in the city, have children and grow into the space. “At first we felt like pioneers,” she said. “Then once I got pregnant, it was amazing to see how many other pregnant women were coming in and out of our building.”She gave birth to their son, Luke, four months ago. While at the hospital on the Upper East Side, she befriended another new mother who also lives at 80 John Street. “It was crazy to meet someone at 2 a.m. in the morning so far away from our immediate neighborhood and then discover that we’re actually neighbors,” she said.Luis Vasquez, an agent at Brown Harris Stevens who moved to 80 John Street because he and his partner were considering starting a family, said that the neighborhood still had plenty of bar-hopping 20-somethings, “but now, there’s a quiet, family side, too.”The residents of the building are part of a population wave in the Financial District. According to community surveys conducted by the Alliance for Downtown New York, which covers the Financial District, Battery Park City and parts of TriBeCa, the percentage of households with children under age 18 downtown grew from 19 percent in 2004 to nearly 25 percent in 2007.When asked about the future, 4 out of 10 childless couples said that they were very likely to have children within the next three years. This means that as many as a third of all the households in Lower Manhattan could have children by 2010. The percentage of households with children under 18 for all of Manhattan in 2007 was just under 20 percent; for all five boroughs it was 32.4 percent.The surveys also showed that while 39 percent of the area’s households in 2002 were made up of single people, the number had decreased to 33 percent in 2004 and was down to 25 percent by 2007. The overall population downtown has more than doubled since 2001, from 22,961 to 56,354 in the third quarter of 2008.The population growth has been prompted by new residential construction and conversions, both spurred by tax abatements and post-9/11 building incentives.The alliance estimates that Lower Manhattan had about 13,000 residential units in 2001 and now has more than 27,000. Many of the recently built and currently planned buildings are condominiums that include apartments with two or more bedrooms. Another 3,000 units, most of them in condos, are under construction and expected to open by 2011, although the market slowdown may diminish that number.Elizabeth H. Berger, the president of the alliance, said that most of downtown’s growth had been in the Financial District. One of the area’s most ardent boosters, Ms. Berger has lived in the Financial District for 27 years and has two children who are now in the fourth and seventh grades. “It’s unbelievably family friendly here,” she said. “You have large floor-plate apartments, a safe community.”This is not to say that there isn’t room for improvement. The alliance reports that 60 percent of the area’s residents feel there is a need for better retail options and about half are dissatisfied with the restaurant options.Jane Berk, who lives on the western edge of the Financial District, is one person who sees those flaws. But over all, she has found the area a wonderful place to raise her 15-month-old daughter and to network with other families. The biggest drawback, she said, is that “everybody hates to come to visit.”Many of the people who are starting families in the Financial District first moved to the area as single people or as childless couples.Tamra and Tim Healey, for example, moved into a rental in the neighborhood in 2006 from TriBeCa. “We just walked down and saw so many apartment buildings with signs outside offering great deals,” she said. A year later, when they decided to buy their first apartment, they looked in Brooklyn and elsewhere in Manhattan, but they wound up around the corner from their rental, at 80 John Street.By the time their son, Henry, was born in November, Ms. Healey had seen many signs that the neighborhood was evolving. In 2007, she noticed that the Montessori School of Manhattan was opening a branch at 2 Gold Street, a rental building that has been voted the “Manhattan building with the best-looking tenants” by readers of the real estate blog Curbed.com, which cited the building’s “sunbathing 20-somethings and the dudes/dudettes who love them.”Less than two years later, Montessori’s “Wall Street campus” is filled to capacity with 250 children, ages 2 to 6. Bridie Gauthier, head of the school, said that the school this year received hundreds of applications for just a handful of openings.Next month Bright Horizons, a national company with more than 600 child care centers, will open a branch at 20 Pine Street that can handle up to 170 children, ages 6 weeks to 5 years old.The company’s market research showed that while there are several preschools in Lower Manhattan, there are very few facilities for infants, said Dave Lissy, the chief executive of Bright Horizons. “The demand is definitely there to support this center and even more capacity,” he said.Kerry McAleer Hurley, who lives a few blocks from the center and works in Times Square, has already enrolled her year-old son, Quinn. “I’m hoping we’ll meet other kids growing up in the neighborhood this way,” she said.In her first year as a mother, she has noticed that TriBeCa and Battery Park City tend to be more child-oriented, from playrooms in apartment buildings to the children’s hour at the Barnes & Noble in TriBeCa.“But I feel like the Financial District is trying to follow,” she said. Last month, she took Quinn to a music class at the South Street Seaport offered by Downtown Babies, which runs classes for infants and toddlers in TriBeCa and the East and West Villages and just recently added Financial District classes.In fact, to meet the growing need, many other services in TriBeCa and Battery Park City have expanded into the Financial District. The Hudson River Park Mothers Group, a message board that offers advice and organizes play groups, has broadened its focus beyond TriBeCa and Battery Park City; about 30 percent of its 1,000 members are now from the Financial District.Anna Grossman, the group’s director and a mother of two who lives in TriBeCa, said: “A lot of people that I know from the group lived in rentals in TriBeCa and Battery Park City, and when it came time to buy, they couldn’t afford to stay where they were, but the Financial District offered more space for less money.”The infrastructure to meet the growing population of children is well on its way.One new playground is planned and two major playground overhauls are on the drawing board. The Imagination Playground will break ground this spring near the South Street Seaport. Designed by the architect David Rockwell, it will be among the first in the city designed around moveable items like wheelbarrows and stackable foam blocks rather than traditional fixed equipment like swing sets and monkey bars.A playground on Pearl Street, also near the South Street Seaport, will be rebuilt beginning this summer. “With the huge expansion of families in the area, it’s probably one of the most crowded playgrounds in the city,” said Adrian Benepe, the commissioner of the Department of Parks and Recreation.At the tip of the island in Battery Park, the parks department will also start work on a carousel later this year and Frank Gehry will redesign a playground nearby, with work to begin in 2010.For several years, overcrowding has been an issue at Public School 234, a celebrated elementary school that takes in children from the Financial District and TriBeCa. The Department of Education opened an annex this year to handle the overflow.Two new schools will open in 2010: the Spruce Street School in the Beekman Tower, a 76-story apartment building designed by Mr. Gehry, which will serve 630 children; and the Battery Park City School, to serve 950. Both schools will be kindergarten through eighth grade. To meet the growing need for kindergarten, the city has also decided to offer new kindergarten classes even before the buildings are completed. Six kindergarten classes will open in classrooms at the Tweed Courthouse next fall; those children will move into the new buildings in 2010.All of these developments are good news to people like Ericka and Caleb Pitters, who live at 80 John Street and have a 7-month-old son named Caleb.“I’ve been very pleasantly surprised by what I’ve found down here,” said Ericka Pitters, adding that when she and her husband moved from Chelsea last May, she feared she would spend much of her time jumping into cabs to go elsewhere to find things to do with the baby.But setting up play dates with mothers nearby has been much easier than she expected, she said, and TriBeCa and SoHo have proven to be just a quick walk away.“When you get up early and look outside,” she said, “you’ll see nannies out walking their babies right alongside people rushing to their offices. It’s a weird mix of baby carriages and people rushing to the rat race, but it works.”'"
"'09-02-22,'0','Loan officers will more carefully scrutinize applications now, to ensure that borrowers can qualify for a loan, according to Mr. Moskowitz and Matthew Hackett, Equity Now’s underwriting manager.“Nowadays,” Mr. Hackett said, “a high percentage of people don’t have the income or assets or equity in their homes to qualify for a mortgage.”He says he requires a recent pay stub to help prove a borrower’s income. And a pay stub showing big overtime payments may not help much, he added, because companies are likely to cut back on overtime pay as the recession deepens.Before the credit crunch, an oral estimate of borrowers’ earnings and home values was often enough for many lenders and brokers.Mr. Hackett says he also conducts an informal appraisal of the home’s value before offering to lock in a rate. Lenders typically rely on industry sources for such information, though they will sometimes also check online sites like Zillow.com or Realtor.com to create rough estimates.The cost of a rate lock is usually built into the lender’s fee, which is expressed in “points.” An up-front charge, a point is equal to 1 percent of the loan amount. For a 30-year mortgage of $250,000, for instance, Equity Now’s borrowers with good credit would have received an interest rate of 5.125 percent earlier this month and would have paid a point, or $2,500, to lock that rate for 30 days.Thirty days is usually enough time for borrowers and lenders to compile and process the documents needed to complete a loan. But Mr. Hackett says more complicated loans, like those involving co-ops, can often take longer. This is also the case, he said, for so-called consolidation and extension mortgage agreements, used by those who are refinancing their loans.Before the credit crisis deepened last year, Mr. Hackett said, borrowers would have paid 1.25 points to guarantee an interest rate for 60 days. Now, he said, the price is 1.75 points.Consumers can help avoid delays, and more costly rate locks, Mr. Hackett said, by gathering their W-2 documents from employers from the last two years, plus a pay stub.“You’ll get locked much quicker that way,” he said.Debra Killian, the chief executive of Charter Oak Lending Group, a mortgage brokerage in Danbury, Conn., says she gathers full loan applications from clients, who then wait for rates to drop into a comfortable range before committing. “I’ve got 40 files sitting here, waiting,” she said.She noted that some lenders recently started charging an extra half point to lock a rate beyond 15 days on refinance loans, and an extra point to lock a rate for 45 days.And if rates happen to fall while the application is being processed? Borrowers are still required to accept the rate they locked in. They can go elsewhere, and forfeit any fees already paid, but in the current economic climate, there is no guarantee that their new application will get approved.'"

"'09-02-22,'0','As Peggy Orenstein points out (The Way We Live Now, Feb. 8), there’s nothing like the suggestion of a cancer risk to freak out a parent. Can we really blame parents for overprotecting when those in charge are negligent? This negligence becomes even more obvious in cases where there isn’t just a suggestion of risk, but clear evidence. Take formaldehyde. Just this month the E.P.A. was reportedly “considering” regulating formaldehyde as a toxic substance, which would be momentous except that the World Health Organization declared it as “carcinogenic to humans” back in 2004, and the E.P.A. itself listed formaldehyde as a “probable human carcinogen” back in the 1980s. If being concerned about a more-than-20-year delay in regulating a carcinogenic substance that is ubiquitous in clothing, carpeting, furniture and paint marks me as a helicopter parent, then watch your head. We can’t raise kids in a bubble, but going out of our way to protect them is the only intelligent choice, because there’s no one else looking out for their well-being.In the midst of Peggy Orenstein’s wonderful description of the many conundrums facing health- and safety-conscious individuals, I was reminded of one I face daily in my practice: the Sunshine Conundrum. Orenstein is slathering her children with sunscreen, but there is an epidemic of vitamin D deficiency in the United States, perhaps in the entire Northern Hemisphere. Subnormal vitamin D levels have been implicated in a wide range of diseases, including multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease and mental illness. Canadian pediatricians have seen fit to raise the recommendations for daily vitamin D consumption, but medical and government communities in the United States have not come to an agreement. Although much research has been done that would confirm the necessity of vitamin D, even if it is absorbed from the sun, it seems incomprehensible to many that sunburn is to be avoided, while sun as a source of vitamin D is to be cherished.'"
"'09-02-22,'0','THE filmmaker Brett Ingram remembers the first time he saw Renaldo Kuhler. Mr. Ingram was riding a bus here in 1994 when a tall man with a white beard and ponytail boarded. The man greeted the driver in a loud, affable growl with a hint of a German accent. Mr. Ingram was struck by his outfit: snug shorts, high white socks, a handmade bolo tie, a military-looking jacket and a railroad cap.Two years later Mr. Ingram took a job in the media department of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh. Touring the staff rooms on his first day, he was surprised to be introduced to the odd man he had seen on the bus. Mr. Kuhler had been a scientific illustrator at the museum since 1969, drawing hundreds of gorgeously detailed portraits of snakes and spiders, bats and shrews, for display, and as illustrations in natural history books.But it was Mr. Kuhler’s private work, revealed a little at a time as the two became friends, that intrigued Mr. Ingram. From cartons stacked around his desk Mr. Kuhler shyly pulled pen-and-ink drawings and watercolors of fantastic-looking cities peopled by men and women in Victorian-looking dress, cartoonishly rendered yet startlingly vibrant. There were also dozens of notebooks filled with a strange language rendered in ornate script.Mr. Ingram said he gradually realized he was seeing fragments of an astonishing imaginary universe, epic in scope and minutely observed. Mr. Kuhler called it Rocaterrania, an homage to Rockland County in New York, where he grew up, and had been secretly, obsessively creating it for 50 years. “The level of detail was staggering,” Mr. Ingram said. “There were hundreds of characters. It conveyed the emotional energy of someone who had spent years and years literally in his own world.”The secret world of Renaldo Kuhler is about to go public. “Rocaterrania,” a feature-length documentary that Mr. Ingram began shooting in 1997, will have its premiere on Feb. 28 at the Cinequest Film Festival in San Jose, Calif. And in October Rocaterrania will have its first museum exhibition, part of a yearlong group show at the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore.“Renaldo’s extremely talented,” Roger Manley, the show’s curator, said. “He’s very much in the mold of somebody like Henry Darger,” the Chicago janitor who over a half-century created his own private world, which wasn’t discovered until his death in 1973.At 77 Mr. Kuhler is something of a local legend in Raleigh for his eccentric dress and manner. On an evening in late January he sipped a glass of vodka in the 42nd Street Oyster Bar here under a framed photograph identifying him as a “Famous Customer.” Warmly greeted by the staff and patrons, he introduced denizens by playful nicknames. (Mr. Ingram is addressed as Spike.)He flirted gallantly with the women, telling them, “You have beautiful teeth” or “You are a horse’s ears,” high praise in his personal code.In Mr. Ingram’s film Mr. Kuhler describes how fantasy and reality intertwined in his life. Rocaterrania “directly tells the story of my life and my struggle to become what I am today,” he said. “I am Rocaterrania.”Born in 1931 and named Ronald by his parents, Otto and Simonne, Mr. Kuhler grew up in Blauvelt, N.Y. Otto Kuhler, a German immigrant, was a prominent designer of streamlined locomotives in the 1930s and ’40s and a landscape painter. Simonne was Belgian. “They were introverted and very critical,” Mr. Kuhler said, sipping his vodka. “Very few people were good enough for them.”Himself a gifted painter, Otto Kuhler did little to encourage his son’s talent, Mr. Kuhler said: “I mostly taught myself.”His parents sent him away to boarding school. “Those were miserable years,” he said. He was desperately shy and starved for affection, a chronic bed-wetter teased by other students. His only escape was the occasional trip to visit his father’s industrial design offices on Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he loved to ride the Sixth Avenue El.'"

That's news to no one in this room.But we want to be clear: As we take the steps that we must to get through the crisis we're in now, we will not lose sight of the long term. We will not lose sight of the need to tackle unmet needs for health care reform, to deal with the energy policy that we need, and so many others challenges that are going to determine what the 21 century looks like.We must be direct with the American people about the budget difficulties and the choices we have to make, and we should be straightforward with them throughout this whole process.I've always believed that in the toughest moments we are presented with the greatest opportunities as a nation. There is no question this is a very tough moment. But it's also a real opportunity to both put our economy back on track and restore fiscal responsibility. That's why we need all of you.Our first speaker today will be Dr. Mark Zandi. Dr. Zandi is the chief economist and co-founder of Moody's Economic -- excuse me, Moody's Economy.com -- where he directs the company's research and consulting activities. He's one of the best big picture guys in the business. His most recent book, ""Financial Shock,"" was widely praised for its lucid explanation of the housing bust. What's less well known about Mark is that he donated the royalties from that book to a fund to invest in low-wealth neighborhoods. He's also an economic adviser to John McCain's campaign. And I'm glad he's -- he's here with us today.Following Mark will be Robert Greenstein, founder and executive director of the invaluable Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Bob and the center are very well-known to us, as they have been the go-to resource for consistently reliable analysis on matters of budgets and fiscal policy at every level of government.Bob was awarded the MacArthur Fellowship in 1996, and last year he received both the John W. Gardner Award for independence -- from Independent Sector and Heinz Award for Public Policy in recognition of his work to improve the economic outlook for many Americans of -- many of America's poor citizens.And as I understand it, we're going to -- I'm now turning the program over to -- to Mark, if I'm not mistaken.MR. ZANDI: Thank you for that very kind introduction. It was greatly appreciated, and the opportunity to speak this afternoon at this important meeting, to address the nation's daunting long-term fiscal challenges.I'll make two broad points in my remarks.First, the Obama administration has inherited the worst fiscal situation in the nation's modern economic history.In the year ending this January, the federal budget deficit was approaching $1 trillion, equal to nearly 7 percent of the nation's GDP. This is the largest budget deficit since in the midst of World War II.Our fiscal problems reflect in significant part the rapidly eroding economy. The current economic downturn is on track to be the longest, most severe, and broadest-based recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.More than 3.6 million jobs have been lost since the economy began losing jobs a year ago, and recent job losses have intensified, to nearly over half a million per month. Job losses are occurring in nearly all occupations, every industry, and across all regions of the country.Forty-two states by my reckoning are in recession, and those states not in recession are not too far behind. Nearly everyone is being affected by this downturn, either through a lost job, lost hours and wages, a lost home, or a cracked nest egg.Job losses are undermining personal income and payroll tax revenue. Corporate tax revenues have collapsed with corporate earnings. And the reeling stock market is undermining capital gain revenues.Government outlays are increasing -- increasing quickly, as economically distressed households put increasing demands on government services.By facilitating loan modifications that significantly reduce mortgage payments for hard-pressed homeowners, these households now have a fighting chance to hold on to their homes.The unprecedented economic financial crisis requires an equally unprecedented policy response. This does carry substantial costs. The federal budget deficit, which topped $450 billion in fiscal year 2008, is expected to rise, by my forecast, over $1.5 trillion in fiscal 2009, and remain equally as high in 2010. Borrowing by the Treasury will be even higher.There will also be substantial long-term costs to extricate the government from the financial system. Unintended consequences for all these actions, taken in such a short period, will be considerable.These are a problem -- problems for another day, however. The financial system is in disarray, and the economy's struggles are intensifying. Policy-makers must be aggressive. Whether from a natural disaster, a terrorist attack or a financial calamity, crises of the magnitude of the current one only end with overwhelming government action.The cost to taxpayers of all this will be significant, but a less aggressive response would tax payers measurably more. Only if our economy soon finds its bearings will addressing problems so important to writing our long-term fiscal situation, such a the rapidly rising cost of health care, energy independence, and comprehensive tax reform be within our reach.MR. GREENSTEIN: Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, distinguished guests, I'm honored to be here. I have a lot to cover in just a few minutes, so with your indulgence, I'll get right to it.The Center on Budget and Policy priorities recently analyzed the fiscal outlook through mid century, and our results are similar to those of the Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office and others. Simply put, the long-term fiscal picture is unsustainable.If we do not change current policies, the national debt, which now equals about 45 percent of the gross domestic product, will soar to about 300 percent of GDP by the year 2050. By then, interest payments on the debt alone would consume 14 percent of GDP -- more than we spent on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and all other entitlements combined.We must avoid such an explosion of debt. To do that, we must make sure that the debt does not consistently faster than the overall economy which, in turn, means that over time annual deficits should not average more than 2 to 3 percent of GDP.But under current policies, even after the economy starts to grow again, deficits will never fall below 4 percent of GDP, and eventually will go much higher. So, we are on the path to the very debt explosion we must avoid.What's driving this problem? Let me start with what's not driving it. First, the recent Economic Recovery Package is not driving the problem. That package is temporary and it increased the size of the long-term fiscal gap by only about one-tenth of 1 percentage point of GDP. Its costs are dwarfed by the bigger, longer lasting factors I'm about to describe.Second, entitlement programs in general are not driving the problem. Entitlements other than the three big ones, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, have actually been falling as a share of the economy and will continue to do so.So, what is driving the problem? The increases projected in federal spending in coming decades as a share of the economy are due entirely to the projected growth in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security which, in turn, is driven by rising health-care costs and the aging of the population.The single biggest factor is rising health-care costs, not just in Medicare and Medicaid, but throughout our health-care system.For more then 30 years, costs per patient in Medicare, Medicaid, and private healthcare have all risen at about the same rate, and much faster then the economy.If healthcare costs per patient were somehow to rise at the same rate that the economy grows on a per capita basis, rather than growing faster, the vast majority of the long-term fiscal gap would disappear. So we face a daunting systemwide healthcare problem.Most experts agree that we cannot hold Medicare and Medicaid costs over time, to a significant lower rate of growth then private sector healthcare growth. The public and private sectors use the same providers and the same treatments.Holding the growth in just the public sector to a much lower rate, would lead either to rationing by income, or more likely, to lots of cost shifting. Providers would raise prices even more on private healthcare to compensate for the lower public sector reimbursement.Two more points about healthcare on which most budget and healthcare experts agree. First, if we want to slow the rate of growth in healthcare costs system wide, then Medicare needs to help lead that effort. To institute payment and delivery system reforms that the private sector then picks up.And second, because healthcare costs are rising mostly due to advances in medical technology, many of which do improve health and prolong life.We almost certainly won't be able to slow health care cost growth so much that it rises no faster than the economy, and that means we also need to make other significant changes in budget and tax policy to avoid a debt explosion.What else must we do?We will need to restore the long-term solvency of Social Security. Some people assume that Social Security benefits are very generous and there's plenty of room to reduce them, and a balanced Social Security solvency plan should certainly look at all aspects of the program.Yet, the room for benefit reductions is likely to be more modest than you may think. Social Security checks now replace about 39 percent of the average worker's pre-retirement wages, less than similar programs in other Western countries.And, because of the scheduled increase in the retirement age, which operates as an across-the-board benefit reduction and the projected growth in Medicare premiums, which are deducted from Social Security checks. that figure will gradually fall from 39 percent to about 32 percent over the next two decades.In addition, we cannot overlook the impact that recent losses in 401(k)s and other retirement plans that supplement Social Security will have on retirees' incomes.Finally, revenues: The long-term fiscal problem is, of course, the mismatch between spending and revenues. And with such a large long-term gap, it's hard to see how to avert a debt explosion without major policy changes in both spending and revenues.Current tax policies would produce revenues somewhat below the historical average of 18.4 percent of GDP.Yet, revenues at that level would have fallen short of balancing the budget in every year over the past 30 years. In fact, in all four years of that period when we did balance the budget, revenues totaled between 20 and 21 percent of GDP.So all of this suggests that to address the daunting long-term fiscal problem, everything, on both the spending and tax sides of the budget, will have to be on the table; and that we will need to place a particular emphasis on health care costs and health care reform.It seems inescapable that shared sacrifice is going to be necessary.In conclusion, we will need to act before mounting debt and interest payments make the challenge of addressing this problem even bigger and more painful than it already is.It's now my honor to introduce someone who for years I've said and thought was part of my hope for the future of the country and whom President Obama has had the great wisdom to name as director of the Office of Management and Budget, Peter Orszag.And thank you all for coming to this summit.Our nation is being forced to grapple with a pair of trillion- dollar deficits. One is the trillion-dollar deficit between what the economy is producing each year and what it could produce. And the other is the trillion-dollar budget deficits that this administration is inheriting.The first deficit, the trillion-dollar income gap this year, is an urgent crisis. The longer it persists, the more jobs that are lost, the more income that households lose, and the more businesses that are closed.The recovery act that was enacted earlier this month is intended to address that crisis.And I thank all of you for working on that recovery act.The second deficit, the budget deficit, may be somewhat less urgent, but it's no less important. Over the medium to long term, the nation is on an unsustainable fiscal course, and to be responsible, we must begin the process of fiscal reform now.That's why the president convened this summit today, because we can no longer let the urgent get in the way of the important.In charting a new fiscal course, we need to be clear in diagnosing the problem. The single most important thing we can do to put this nation back on a sustainable long-term fiscal course, is slow the growth rate of health care costs.As Bob Greenstein already emphasized, health care is the key to our fiscal future.So, to my fellow budget hawks in this room and in the rest of the country, let me be very clear. Health care reform is entitlement reform. The path to fiscal responsibility must run directly through health care.We also must recognize that reforms to Medicare and Medicaid will only succeed in the context of slowing the overall growth rate of health care costs.Improving the efficiency of the health system so that we get better results for less money is therefore not just or even primarily a budget issue. It would also provide direct help to struggling families, since health care costs are reducing worker's take-home pay to a degree that is both underappreciated and unnecessarily large.And for many states, health care is increasingly crowding out other priorities like higher education, which, in turn, is leading to higher tuition and painful cutbacks at state universities.All of this is why the president had said, time and again, that he is committed to reforming the health system this year. And with his leadership and the hard work of everyone in this room, we can reform health care, start to bend the curve on long-term costs, and get our economy back on a path of long-term fiscal sustainability.Ladies and Gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the president of the United States, Barack Obama.Thank you. Thank you, everybody.Thank you. Please have a seat. Thank you very much.Thank you to Mark and Bob and to Peter. It is wonderful to see the speaker here, and we've got our -- I don't see Harry, here, but we've got Dick Durbin in his stead.Mitch, thank you for being here.John Banner, to all the congressional leadership. Thank you.My administration came into office one month ago in the depths of an economic crisis unlike any that we've seen in generations. And we recognize that we needed to act boldly and decisively and quickly and that's precisely what we did.Within our first 30 days in office, we passed the most sweeping economic recovery package in history, to create or save 3.5 million new jobs, provide relief to struggling families, and lay the foundation for long-term growth and prosperity. And I have the opportunity to talk to the nation's governors today, both Republicans and Democrats had ideas about how they're going to use that money to make sure that people are put back to work and that we can stem some of the job loss that's taking place.I also laid out my housing plan -- to break the cycle of falling home values and rising foreclosures that's devastated so many communities. And we put forth a financial stability plan to start shoring up our banks, so we can free up credit and jumpstart lending and restore confidence in our financial system.These are all extraordinary, but necessary measures to address this economic emergency. And as has already been noted, they will come at a cost. This administration has inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit -- the largest in our nation's history and our investments to rescue our economy will add to that deficit in the short-term.We also have long term challenges: healthcare, energy, education, and others, that we can no longer afford to ignore. But I want to be very clear if the message was not effectively delivered by the three previous speakers.We cannot and will not sustain deficits like these without end.Contrary to the prevailing wisdom in Washington these past few years, we cannot simply spend as we please and defer the consequences to the next budget, the next administration or the next generation.We are paying the price for these deficits right now. In 2008 alone, we paid $250 billion in interest on our debt: One in every 10 taxpayer dollars. That is more than three times what we spend on education that year; more than seven times what we spent on V.A. health care.So if we confront this crisis without also confronting the deficits that helped cause it, we risk sinking into another crisis down the road. As our interest payments rise, our obligations come due, confidence in our economy erodes and our children and our grandchildren are unable to pursue their dreams because their saddled with our debts.That's why today, I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office. Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taken responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.We'll start by being honest with ourselves about the magnitude of our deficits. For too long, our budget process in Washington has been an exercise in deception; a series of accounting tricks to hide the expense of our spending and the shortfalls in our revenue and hope that the American people won't notice. Budgeting certain expenditures for just one year, when we know we'll incur them every year for five or 10; budgeting $0 for the Iraq war -- $0 -- for future years, even when we knew the war would continue; budgeting no money for natural disasters, as if we would ever go 12 months without a single flood, fire, hurricane or earthquake.We do ourselves no favors by hiding the truth about what we spend. In order to address our fiscal crisis, we're going to have to be candid about its scope.And that's why the budget I will introduce later this week will look ahead 10 years, and will include a full and honest accounting of the money we plan to spend and the deficits we will likely incur.To start reducing these deficits, I have committed to going through our budget line by line to rout out waste and inefficiency, a process that Peter and our administration, our team, has already begun. And I'll soon be instructing each member of my Cabinet to go through every item in their budgets as well. And already we've seen how much money we can save, just in the last 30 days.Take one example: The Department of Agriculture has moved some of its training programs online, saving an estimated $1.3 million a year. They're modernizing their financial management system, saving an estimated $17.5 million. They're saving tens of thousands of dollars by cutting back on conferences and travel and other small expenses that add up over time.So we will replicate these efforts throughout the federal government, eliminating programs that don't work to make room for ones that do, and making the ones that we keep work better.We'll end the payments to agribusiness (ph) that don't need them, and eliminate the no-bid contract that have wasted billions in Iraq. We'll end the tax breaks for companies shipping jobs overseas, and we'll stop the fraud and abuse in our Medicare program.And we will reinstate the pay-as-you-go rule that we followed during the 1990s, the rules that helped us start this new century with a $236 billion surplus.In recent years, we've strayed from this rule, and the results speak for themselves.The PAYGO approach is based on a very simple concept: You don't spend what you don't have. So if we want to spend, we'll need to find somewhere else to cut.This is the rule that families across this country follow every single day, and there's no reason why their government shouldn't do the same. Now, I want to be very clear. While we are making important progress towards fiscal responsibility this year, in this budget, this is just the beginning. In the coming years, we'll be forced to make more tough choices, and do much more to address our long-term challenges. From the rising costs of health care, that Peter described, which is the single, most pressing fiscal challenge we face, by far, to the long-term solvency of Social Security. In the end, however, if we want to rebuild our economy, and restore discipline and honesty to our budget, we will need to change the way we do business here in Washington. We're not going to be able to fall back into the same old habits, and make the same inexcusable mistakes, the repeated failure to act as our economy spiraled deeper into crisis.The casual dishonesty of hiding irresponsible spending with clever accounting tricks, the costly overruns, the fraud and abuse, the endless excuses -- this is exactly what the American people rejected when they went to the polls. They sent us here to usher in a new era of responsibility in Washington; to start living within our means again, and being straight with them about where their tax dollars are going, and empowering them with the information they need to hold all of us, their representatives, accountable.So, that's why I've called this summit, today, and why I've invited leaders from both sides of the aisle, because we all have a role to play in this work. I believe it is time for a frank conversation about the fiscal challenges we face. They are challenges that concern every single one of us no matter where we are on the political spectrum. So, today, I want to -- I hope that all of you will start talking with each other and exchanging ideas.I want you to question each other, challenge each other, question me and my time, challenge us. And work together not just to identify problems, but to identify solutions. That's the purpose of the break- out sessions that are starting right now. I know that each of you bring a wealth of experience and expertise on a broad range of topics. I appreciate your willingness to participate in these sessions. I expect that this process will be engaging and productive. And I look forward to hearing the results when you report back later on this afternoon.So, thank you very much, all of you, for participating.'"

The heavy show of star power was meant to make good on a promise that the broadcast would deliver entertainment value that reached far beyond that offered by the nominees., in a widely anticipated development, posthumously won the best supporting actor prize for his performance as the Joker in Mr. Ledger’s parents afterward said his Oscar statuette would be held in trust by the .Many other awards also went to those favored in the preshow betting.Dustin Lance Black won the best original screenplay Oscar for “Milk,” about the gay-rights advocate . Mr. Black, who is openly gay, said Mr. Milk’s story had given him hope that one day he might “fall in love and even get married.”Mr. Beaufoy, whose “Slumdog” screenplay was based on a novel by Vikas Swarup, rattled off a list of places he never expected to be — “the moon, the South Pole, the Miss World podium and here” — as he accepted that award for his work on a film that captured many of the movie industry’s pre-Oscar honors and was widely viewed as a preordained winner of the evening’s final award, for best picture.Also in the first wave of awards, “Wall-E” was named best animated film, though it had been denied the best picture nomination that its backers at the and its Pixar Animation unit had sought.Overall, Sunday evening’s Oscar show became a struggle between the ambitions of a producing team — headed by the veteran film producer Laurence Mark and the filmmaker — that aimed for an evening full of surprises and the apparent determination of 5,810 voters in the academy to bestow honors largely where they were expected to go.A much-discussed new format for the show opened with a loosey-goosey showbiz number and proceeded along very self-referential lines, with lots of inside jokes that drew substantial laughs from the crowd inside the Theater here., the evening’s host, started with a very short comic monologue that poked fun at his own failure to get nominated for his performance in He then plunged into a comic song-and-dance number that poked fun at serious movies that were nominated for best picture, including “Milk” and “Frost/Nixon,” and less serious movies that were not, including “The Dark Knight.”An early appearance by the screenwriting winners helped give the evening a story line of its own: the awards categories were arranged in blocks intended to reflect the process of building a film, beginning, in the first segment, with a blinking cursor tapping out the beginning of a script on a blank screen.In another departure, the celebrity presenters were not identified in advance, partly in the hope that a larger-than-usual audience would tune in to see who actually showed up.Last year’s broadcast, with the smallest domestic audience in the ceremony’s history, had only about 32 million viewers in the United States.The show’s stage sets, overseen by the New York architect , were bathed much of the time in blue and included a vast crystal curtain. And the show was punctuated by deliberate references to movies that had played well with ticket-buying audiences last year but were often not in the running for awards, the nominations for which went overwhelmingly to relatively little-seen movies.To some extent, the show’s elements collided with themselves, as songs, cinematic retrospectives and actor after actor working Hollywood in-jokes crowded the screen. One sequence, directed by , of was squeezed out altogether but was shown to the in-theater audience during a commercial break.In keeping with the self-referential tone of the night, the best live action short was teed up with a live action short from , with and , in character from their film, in starring roles.“This is almost a surreal moment to me,” said the German filmmaker Jochen Alexander Freydank as he accepted the award for his “Spielzeugland,” which had not much to do with the antics that preceded it.A reconfigured auditorium made it much easier for the celebrities to mingle during commercial breaks. The mood was lively and chaotic. Mr. Rourke sat on the edge of the stage kicking his legs during several breaks, with a stage manager coming to shoo him back to his seat.Mr. Jackman came across less as comic than as cabaret performer. Along the way, he did his best to try to keep the troops entertained during the commercial breaks, serenading his dad in the audience, reading a note from his wife (“you’re doing good so far, babe”) and even going into the aisles to hand out .Still, all the showmanship seemed only to highlight the basic challenge of a ceremony whose producers were hoping to capitalize on movies’ strong commercial appeal: The best picture candidates — “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Frost/Nixon, and “Slumdog Millionaire” — altogether had fewer than half the viewers of “The Dark Knight,” an audience favorite that was praised by many critics but still did not make the cut.In the end, “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” which had been the evening’s most-nominated film, with 13 nominations in all, won for its direction and makeup but not in the crucial acting and directing categories. “Frost/Nixon,” directed by , was the only best picture nominee to come away with no prizes at all.“Slumdog Millionaire,” though it had no actors nominated for prizes, swept many awards other than those on the top line, including prizes for cinematography, sound mixing, score and film editing. “Slumdog’s” eight Oscars was the largest total won by a single film since “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” won 11 in 2004.Hopes of using the evening to celebrate the enduring popularity of films were complicated by the grim economic realities of the moment. The academy has been trying to celebrate a year in which movie attendance remained buoyant without looking as if the industry is out of touch with the misery elsewhere.Walking in among the stars who lined the red carpet, , a founder of the Weinstein Company, said a bit of glamour was needed to help “overcome the ” that hung over matters more real. “If we and the movies don’t create an illusion, we’ve failed,” said Mr. Weinstein, whose company released “The Reader.”Phillipe Petit, the French tightrope walker from — which won for best documentary feature — walked into the ceremony on the carpet and said, “I haven’t been looking at the red carpet, I’ve been looking above and thinking of what it would be like to be on a wire above all this.”In one of the night’s few surprises, the best foreign language film went to a drama about an unemployed cellist, from . Many observers had predicted “Waltz With Bashir,” an Israeli animated drama about that country’s past war in , would take that prize.In addition, the standard segment took on special significance this year because one of the nominees for best supporting actor, Mr. Ledger, died unexpectedly of a drug overdose early last year, before “Dark Knight” was even released. sang a familiar ballad, from the Broadway musical “Right This Way,” during the memorial segment.The glittering event at the Kodak is generally a pretty grown-up affair, but this year children from halfway around the world made a splashy appearance. The kids from “Slumdog Millionaire” had no trouble adjusting to the head-snapping cultural shift from to the red carpet.“I want to see , , and , Robert Downey,” said Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, who played the young Salim in the film. “Seeing any of them would be cool.”He was surrounded by seven co-stars who played the main characters at various ages. When asked how they felt about their film being among the nominated, they all backed up as if on cue and shouted, “Jai ho,” which translates roughly as “Victory.”Another child from India was Pinki Sonkar, whose cleft was the story behind “Smile Pinki,” which won the documentary short film category., the 82-year-old comedian who has devoted much of his time to raising money for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award from , who had reprised one of Mr. Lewis’s most famous roles,“The humility I feel will stay with me for the rest of my life,” Mr. Lewis said. “To all of you people from the movie business, it is such a joy being part of you and of everything you do.”'"
"'09-02-23,'0','The company has been negotiating for the better part of a year with the banks, led by Citizens Bank. It had not been in compliance with its debt covenants since mid-2008, and it suspended payment on the debt last fall. Most recently, executives of Philadelphia Media said the original investors offered to put $25 million into the company, but a meeting with the banks on Friday produced no resolution.The sale of the Philadelphia papers was one of a flurry of deals made in the two years before the recession began, with buyers — many of whom had no background in the field — paying prices for newspapers that were called exorbitant even at the time. Revenue for most newspapers has dropped more than 20 percent since then, leaving the new owners struggling with debt.The Tribune Company, which was taken private in December 2007 by Sam Zell, a real estate mogul, filed for bankruptcy less than a year later. The Minneapolis Star Tribune, bought in late 2006 by Avista Capital Partners, a private equity firm, filed for bankruptcy last month. (The Journal Register Company, which was not part of the buying spree of a few years ago, filed for bankruptcy on Saturday.)The McClatchy Company bought the Knight Ridder chain in 2006, and has struggled with the debt from that deal. McClatchy quickly sold some of its papers, including those in Philadelphia and Minneapolis.Mr. Tierney, a public relations executive, and his partners paid $562 million for the papers, including about $412 million in borrowed money. There remains about $390 million in debt.Executives say that with debt payments suspended, the papers continue to generate cash flow, in part because of significant cost-cutting. One said that last year, they had earnings before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $36 million.Philadelphia Newspapers is being advised by the investment bank Jeffries. Its bankruptcy lawyers are from Proskauer Rose and Dilworth Paxson.Over the months of talks with the banks, Philadelphia Media executives have been frustrated by the consortium charging the company for fees paid to the banks’ lawyers and consultants, and for interest penalties — bills that the newspaper group says total $13.4 million. The executives said they had arranged $25 million in debtor-in-possession loans to continue operations.'"
"'09-02-23,'0','No one really knows whether new toys are safe — and that’s a disgrace.After being severely weakened and mismanaged over the last eight years by appointees sent from a hostile White House, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a tiny agency with a critical safety mission, has been battered into a shell of its former self, unable to protect consumers from dangerous products found on store shelves.The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 provides the agency with desperately needed resources and authority — but the same old crowd is still in charge and still making a mess of things.Until President Obama appoints a top-level leadership team that will use the law to protect consumers, the current fiasco will continue, and consumers will continue to be at risk. Along with new leadership, however, the agency must actually receive the financing promised in the new legislation for hiring staff to inspect the market and test for safety. Without it, the agency cannot do its job.The writer, a senior vice president and technical director at Consumers Union from 1982-2005, was a member of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, 1973-82.The Toy Industry Association was and is a strong supporter of the concepts contained in the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act.

"'09-02-23,'0','David Brooks’s statement “To stabilize that communal landscape, sometimes you have to shower money upon those who have been foolish or self-indulgent” is right on target.Many of us have done nothing wrong. Some are still renting because we were too responsible to buy a house we could not afford while others struggle to faithfully pay for ones they could.The foolish should not have taken on mortgages they had no realistic possibility of paying. But reality is not what should have been, nor is it what we wish for. Reality is only what currently is.If the foolish go under in droves, the wise and responsible will quickly follow. In saving them, we also save ourselves.David Brooks’s assertion that “our moral and economic system is based on individual responsibility” is an excellent example of his ability to turn language inside out.There is no system that is both moral and economic. Individual responsibility in a moral system is based on ethics and good behavior. Individual responsibility in an economic system is based on financial success. The amorality of our economic system, with its indifference to the social consequences of its actions, is the problem.'"

"'09-02-23,'0','How extreme? Falk said he believed Stern, the commissioner, would push for a hard salary cap, shorter contracts, a higher age limit on incoming players, elimination of the midlevel cap exception and an overall reduction in the players’ percentage of revenue. And, Falk said, Stern will probably get what he wants.“The owners have the economic wherewithal to shut the thing down for two years, whatever it takes, to get a system that will work long term,” he said in an extensive interview to discuss his new book. “The players do not have the economic wherewithal to sit out one year.”Falk’s comments will surely irritate the players union and many of his fellow agents. But then, his new book is called “The Bald Truth” for reasons beyond his smooth head.In 35 years as an N.B.A. agent — and for much of that time, its most powerful agent — Falk has earned a reputation for brutal honesty. In fact, Chapter 3 of his book is titled, “Blunt is Beautiful — Stay True to You.”In recounting the twists and turns of his career, Falk critiques N.B.A. owners, other agents, former clients and even his mentor, Donald Dell, who gave Falk his start at ProServ in 1974.Nothing is as striking, however, as his bleak assessment of the N.B.A.’s economic system. Falk’s view matters more than most. Throughout the 1980s and ’90s, he was the N.B.A.’s top power broker, as the adviser to Jordan, Ewing, Alonzo Mourning, Dikembe Mutombo and a host of other stars. He sold his agency, FAME, for $100 million in 1998, but he reopened it in 2007 as a boutique agency.Falk despairs over the current state of the agent industry, saying “there’s rampant cheating going on” and “the quality of the representation is low.” He blames the union, which certifies agents but provides almost no oversight. A union spokesman declined to comment.While Falk is no longer the most active agent, he remains highly influential. He is still close to Jordan — now a minority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats — and represents a handful of stars, including Mutombo, Elton Brand and Mike Bibby. (His client list also includes Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski and the former Georgetown coach John Thompson.)Sometimes a foe of Stern, Falk is also an unabashed admirer, calling him “the greatest commissioner in the history of professional sports.” Falk does not seem nearly as impressed with Billy Hunter, the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association. The two have had a tense relationship. Falk foresees a rout in the next round of negotiations.In a joint appearance during All-Star weekend, Stern and Hunter acknowledged the dire state of the economy and its effect on the N.B.A. Stern said publicly for the first time that the salary cap — which is tied to league revenue — would probably decline next season. Privately, league officials are bracing for a major decline in the cap in the 2010-11 season. Stern and Hunter said they had begun preliminary talks for a new labor deal.Their conciliatory tone sounded promising, but Falk seemed skeptical. In his view, the union botched negotiations in 1998, which led to the three-month lockout, the only labor stoppage in league history. The union tried to stave off a luxury tax and maximum player salaries but ultimately had to accept both in order to strike a deal in January 1999 and save the season.“The players lost 40 percent of their salaries, and they got a worse deal in January,” Falk said. “So as we approach 2011, my overwhelming feeling is, let’s not make the same dumb mistake as in 1998.”The players, he said, must recognize that the owners have the ultimate leverage. Many are billionaires for whom owning an N.B.A. team is merely a pricey hobby. Some of them are losing “enormous amounts of money” and would rather shut down the league for a year or two than continue with the current system.So Falk is urging the union to take a more cooperative approach.“And if we don’t do that, in my opinion, there’s an overwhelming probability that the owners will shut it down,” he said.Naturally, Falk has strong opinions about what is ailing the league. He believes too many average players make too much money, while the stars — Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade — do not make enough. Falk would eliminate the cap for the superstars and, at the other end, abolish the midlevel exception, which allows teams to give $30 million deals to role players.Unlike most of his peers, and the union leadership, Falk is an advocate of the age limit, which Stern won during collective bargaining negotiations in 2005. Falk said the limit, now 19 years old, should be raised to 20 or 21.His reasons are purely practical. The influx of underclassmen to the N.B.A. has eroded fan familiarity and the quality of play, Falk said. An age limit will create more polished and prepared rookies, while the N.C.A.A. provides free advertising for future N.B.A. stars.“The single biggest factor contributing to the success of the N.B.A. over the last almost 30 years has been the N.C.A.A tournament,” he said, listing a dozen great moments in tournament history. “Every guy in that era, from ’79 to about ’95, who came in the N.B.A., all the fans knew on a first-name basis. It got to the point, when Duke won twice in the ’90s, people said they knew how Grant Hill wore his socks.”Changes to the salary cap and the age limit sound like sacrifices from the player’s side. Falk does not see it that way. To understand his view, consider an early chapter from his own career.Early in his relationship with Jordan, Falk offered to drastically cut his marketing fee in exchange for an upfront payment on his negotiating fee. Jordan was initially resistant, but he agreed when he realized the arrangement would save him $10 million over the long term.As Falk tells it, his boss, Dell, was aghast. But to Falk, the gesture was about gaining Jordan’s trust and loyalty, which would pay dividends in the long term.“There wasn’t anything better I could have done with $10 million at that time,” Falk writes.That, essentially, is the message he has for the players union. The players and the owners have effectively been partners since the salary cap was instituted in 1982. The players’ earnings are dependent on the league’s financial health. And in Falk’s view, the players will have to make short-term concessions if they want the league to thrive.“The only logical way over the next 25 years that players are going to make more money is to grow the pie,” Falk said.Of course, in his opinion, the players will have little choice but to give the owners what they want. The situation, Falk said, is analogous to the negotiations he conducted on Jordan’s behalf with the Chicago Bulls in 1984. Jordan held all of the leverage, and the Bulls knew it.Falk recalls the statement made by Rod Thorn, then the Bulls’ general manager, on the occasion of Jordan’s signing: “There was a lot of give and take in these negotiations. We gave, and they took.”'"
"'09-02-23,'0','Less than a year later, Chiacchia, 44, is competing almost every weekend. Last week, Chiacchia and his most accomplished horse, Windfall II, placed second in an advanced division at the Rocking Horse Advanced and Training Horse Trials in Altoona, Fla. He said he hoped to compete at the London Olympics in 2012.Despite his progress, Chiacchia brushes off questions about the novelty of his remarkable comeback. Returning to the sport he has loved since he was 12 had never been in question, he said. “Sitting and watching TV and eating bonbons for two years isn’t going to make this easier,” he said. “You need to engage the brain and make it work.”Dr. Peter Kinkel, Chiacchia’s neurologist, said his progress stunned the nurses and physical therapists who have worked with Chiacchia. “It’s amazing to watch him,” Kinkel said, adding that the accident injured both hemispheres and multiple lobes of Chiacchia’s brain. “He has recovered in leaps and bounds.”When the accident occurred, on March 15, 2008, Chiacchia was one of the sport’s top riders. He helped the United States win a bronze medal in eventing at the 2004 Games and was earning a comfortable income from teaching the sport and from selling horses from his farms in Ocala and in his hometown, Springville, N.Y., about 35 miles south of Buffalo.Like many of his colleagues, Chiacchia had lived through his share of bone-crunching spills, with a list of injuries that included two broken hips, a broken arm, a broken hand, a broken ankle and a twice-fractured skull. But the fall at the Red Hills Horse Trials last year was by far the most serious.Chiacchia had been riding an up-and-coming horse, Baron Verdi, during the cross-country portion of the event when the horse tripped over a jump and flipped on top of him. The horse was not seriously injured, but Chiacchia was airlifted to a hospital in Tallahassee, where doctors delivered a grim prognosis to his mother, Evelyn Chiacchia.“When I first got to the hospital, they told me they didn’t know if he was going to live,” she said. “They didn’t know what was going to happen.”Chiacchia and his family give conflicting accounts of what happened in the weeks that followed. Chiacchia says his coma lasted 42 days and ended when he opened his eyes and remembered nothing about the accident.“I was very confused,” he said. “Literally, I woke up as if I had taken a nap. I didn’t even know I wasn’t at the competition anymore.”But his mother and a sister, Kimberly Fraser, said he regained consciousness within about a week, although it took longer for him to understand what had happened to him and to regain cognitive functions. Chiacchia has no memory of the first weeks after the accident, even though his mother and sister said he was able to talk and move around. He could not recognize some people, and had to relearn basic motor functions like walking and tying his shoes.“When he first came out of the coma, he was very childlike,” Fraser said, adding, “We were fully prepared that he might be like that for the rest of his life, considering the injury.”Then, with a suddenness that took nearly everyone by surprise, the old Chiacchia returned to them. His mother said it was as if some internal switch had been flipped. “He finally said one day, ‘I just woke up,’ ” she said.About two months after the accident, Chiacchia climbed onto Windfall II, the horse he rode at the Athens Olympics. He took it easy at first, letting a groom lead him around the farm. But he progressed quickly and in July, he competed in his first event, the Genesee Valley Hunt Horse Trials in upstate Geneseo, N.Y.While Chiacchia was recovering, a debate was churning in the eventing community. Chiacchia’s accident followed 12 deaths in eventing competitions worldwide over the previous year and a half, all of them the result of falls similar to the one in which Chiacchia was involved.“Darren is such a skilled rider and obviously an Olympic medalist, a high-profile rider,” said Kevin Baumgardner, president of the United States Eventing Association. “I think that it had an impact on people, to see that happen.”Since Chiacchia’s accident, the United States Equestrian Federation, the sport’s governing body, has enacted several changes, including reducing the number of jumps during the cross-country phase and giving increased authority for officials to discipline reckless riders. They also started identifying problem riders, putting them on a watch list.The eventing association recently awarded a $30,000 grant to the University of Kentucky to study the use of jumps that are designed to break apart on impact.“The sport has looked at itself very seriously, and has made some adjustments that had been looked at before,” said David O’Connor, the president of the equestrian federation. “And those are having an effect worldwide, as well as in our country.”Chiacchia said the safety measures did not go far enough, were too slow in coming, and focused too much on the behavior of riders, something that did not contribute to his fall. He said he would like to see the sport mandate the use of breakable fences, for example, rather than put money toward studying them.“To make the sport safer, we have to make some fairly aggressive changes, and unfortunately the leadership of the equestrian community does not feel the same way,” he said.Baumgardner said that he believed research was the best first step. “You should not implement technologies that haven’t been researched adequately,” he said.Chiacchia said he had struggled to come to terms with the accident’s toll on his personal life. While recuperating, he said, he learned his companion of 10 years had left him, as had his secretary of 26 years. Several students had also found new teachers.Chiacchia has restructured his business to emphasize selling horses. He is pursuing a side business in real estate.Because he still does not fully trust his organizational skills, he has hired a business manager, Lisa Marong. “He just wasn’t sure what he could handle,” she said.Marong, a friend since childhood, said she thought the naturally ambitious, energetic Chiacchia should get more rest. “He’s called me at 6 in the morning and said, why aren’t you up?” Marong said. “If you talk to Darren and see him operate on a daily basis, he seems to appear as normal as you or I. He doesn’t always let everyone know what’s going on.”Evelyn Chiacchia said the accident had changed her son. “He’s different in certain ways, but I can’t put my finger on exactly what it is,” she said.Ralph Hill, an Olympic rider who spent eight weeks in a coma after a similar accident in 2007, said he was impressed with Chiacchia’s drive. “What Darren did was he acted like a competitor; he wanted to show everybody that he could still compete,” said Hill, who is back riding and teaching but has not yet returned to competition. “Right now, if you saw him riding, I believe that you would probably say he’s a good rider, but wonder how many years he’s been in the sport.”Chiacchia said he had not returned to full strength and struggled with lingering pain in his left side. He works out regularly at a gym and has been playing tennis to regain his coordination and balance, his mother said.“When I first woke up, I remember saying and feeling, I just want my life back,” Chiacchia said. “And then I thought, you know, that was a good life. But I don’t want that life back. I have the opportunity to create a new life. And that’s the essence of my being now.”'"
"'09-02-23,'0','Illegally converted rooms have long been a fact of life in some of the city’s poorest communities.Some rooms, like those in the Bronx case, are carved up by tenants hoping to turn their apartments into a source of income. Others, in Chinatown in Manhattan and Jackson Heights in Queens, were converted by building owners to generate more rent. All are constructed without regard for the city’s building and housing maintenance codes, which govern maximum permitted occupancy, means of exit, ventilation and lighting.In their room in Bushwick, Guadalupe and her husband, Pedro, have no stove, just a microwave oven on top of a big television. They keep their clothes and shoes on a metal rack. They have no lease and no mailbox. They give the money for the rent and electricity to a first-floor tenant with a lease, who slips their mail underneath their door.For all of this, Guadalupe said she feels lucky. The couple have their own bathroom. In a nearby building where they used to rent a room, they often had to wait in line to use the toilet.“Have you ever been to the Lower East Side Tenement Museum?” asked Javier Valdes, who visited Guadalupe’s room recently and who is deputy director of Make the Road New York, a community services group of which Guadalupe is a member. “It’s like a repeat of history. It’s just a different group of people going through it.”Throughout the city illegal units make for ad-hoc living arrangements, and are not always done for financial reasons. Last week, the superintendent of a building in the Bronx owned by the nonprofit Fordham Bedford Housing Corporation saw a tenant carrying construction materials into an apartment. The tenant in the one-bedroom apartment had split the living room in half by erecting a wallboard partition, to make two bedrooms for family members who had moved in.“What goes on behind tenants’ doors, we don’t always know,” said Robert Donovan, the group’s director of construction services, who told the tenant to take the wall down.Often, little construction is required. Tenants or landlords simply put locks on bedroom doors to rent them out as rooms. Residents of illegal units sometimes pay not for rooms but for the use of mattresses in those rooms, in a practice known as “hot sheeting.” It means several people share a bed at different times of the day.“We have heard of those cases,” said Mr. Valdes of Make the Road New York.A firefighter in East Harlem recalled the day several years ago when he found himself in an apartment crowded with plywood bunk beds where men were sleeping in rotating eight-hour shifts, “like on a submarine,” he said.A report released last year that analyzed census data from 1990 and 2000 found 114,000 “unaccounted-for” units in New York City, housing 300,000 to 500,000 residents. These illegal units included private homes carved into rooming houses and two-family homes with unauthorized basement apartments.Researchers with the two groups that prepared the report, the Pratt Center for Community Development and Chhaya Community Development Corporation, said the 114,000 units made up roughly 4 percent of the city’s housing stock. A majority were in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx, with Queens having the most of any borough with 48,000.The report described many of the units as reasonable options for low-income tenants struggling to find affordable places to live, a view shared by many housing advocates. The two groups called for the city to legalize many of the units and to offer landlords technical and financial assistance to make needed repairs.“We really have effectively a ‘Don’t ask, don’t tell’ system,” said Brad Lander, director of the Pratt Center. “The only remedy is to vacate the unit, and that’s what we’re looking for a way out of.”Another group, Coalition for the Homeless, has criticized the city for helping to fill dozens of illegal and overcrowded boarding houses. The coalition has identified more than 100 unregulated rooming houses where the city’s homeless services agency and its contract shelters have placed homeless adults, even though many buildings were found to have hazardous conditions.For Guadalupe, the $650 rent is getting hard to pay. She makes and sells tamales, and Pedro works in construction. They had to borrow $200 from cousins to pay this month’s rent.Their time in the room is nearing an end. Because the tenant to whom she pays rent is moving out soon, she said he told her that she must go, too. She bought a receipt pad and makes him fill it out when she pays the rent, one small way she tries to impose some order on a precarious situation.“On any given day,” she said, “I feel I can get kicked out.”'"
"'09-02-23,'0','The Journal Register Company, publisher of The New Haven Register in Connecticut and other newspapers, filed for Chapter 11 protection on Saturday.“We intend to emerge from the Chapter 11 process stronger, leaner and more financially viable in the current environment,” James W. Hall, the company’s chief executive, said in a statement on its Web site. “Our business will continue its normal operations.”In the filing in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, the publisher proposed canceling its stock and becoming a concern controlled by its lenders.It reported $596 million in assets as of Nov. 30 and $692 million in debt, including unpaid interest. Revenue has fallen more than 20 percent since 2006, the company said in the filing.The Journal Register owns 20 daily and 159 other newspapers, serving parts of Philadelphia, Michigan, Connecticut, the Cleveland area and New York. It has about 3,500 employees.'"
"'09-02-23,'0','BERLIN — The leaders of Germany, Britain, France and other European nations called Sunday for the resources of the International Monetary Fund to be doubled, to $500 billion, to help head off new problems in countries already hit hard by the global economic and financial crisis.And in a statement clearly aimed at hedge funds and other big private pools of capital, the leaders said that “all financing markets and participants” must be regulated in the future. They also vowed to press for sanctions against tax havens.The leaders met in an effort to hammer out a common European position ahead of the April meeting of the Group of 20, the group of industrialized economies and developing countries, in London. The meeting on Sunday also included leaders from Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, the current holder of the European Union’s rotating presidency.Eyeing a contagion that is rapidly spreading to Eastern Europe and even countries that use the euro, the leaders highlighted the crisis-prevention role of the monetary fund, an institution whose relevance to the global economy seemed in doubt only a few years ago.In Germany, a growing unease that the crisis is about to strike close to home has contributed to a shift away from a reluctance to bankroll efforts to ease the financial crisis — whether in the form of bank bailouts or stimulus packages — for fear of paying for other countries’ mistakes.'"
"'09-02-23,'0','LOS ANGELES — Finally, some good news for Lionsgate: The studio, under pressure from investors to turn around its slumping movie division, opened “Tyler Perry’s Madea Goes to Jail” to a record-setting $41.1 million in sales at domestic theaters.The movie, the latest to star Mr. Perry in drag as a gun-toting grandmother, easily delivered the best opening-weekend results in Lionsgate’s 12-year history, said Steve Rothenberg, president for distribution. “Tyler Perry’s Madea Goes to Jail” also marks a high-water point for Mr. Perry, opening with 35 percent more sales than “Tyler Perry’s Madea’s Family Reunion” in 2006, the previous installment of the franchise.“Tyler greatly improved the percentage of young people who attended and the number of Hispanic ticket buyers,” Mr. Rothenberg said. “We are extremely pleased.”Despite the best efforts of Lionsgate marketers to broaden Mr. Perry’s audience to white moviegoers — still the sweet spot of the North American box office — patrons for the picture, featuring a predominantly African-American cast, were only 6 percent white. That percentage is on a par with Mr. Perry’s previous films, Mr. Rothenberg said.Lionsgate’s releases have, for the most part, performed poorly in recent months despite a surge in moviegoing, leading the company recently to report a quarterly net loss of $93.4 million. Complicating matters, Carl C. Icahn, feared for his reputation as a corporate raider, has more than doubled his stake in the company over the past year, to about 13 percent. Mr. Icahn has not publicly indicated his intentions. Peter Wilkes, a studio spokesman, said, “Mr. Icahn has a superb track record for finding value, and we welcome his continued investment and support.”'"

"'09-02-24,'1','The Supreme Court cleared the way Monday for the Environmental Protection Agency to issue new regulations on emissions of mercury, lead, arsenic and other pollutants from the nation’s coal-fired power plants.Environmental groups hailed the action as a final blow to Bush administration efforts to frustrate tight regulation of the emissions, but any new Obama administration rules may draw their own court challenges.The justices’ action involved a suit brought by environmental organizations, Indian tribes and 14 states including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The suit charged that the Bush administration had acted improperly in trying to create a separate regulatory regime for the coal-fired plants rather than subjecting them to the general requirements of the Clean Air Act.The groups prevailed last year in a lower court, but the Environmental Protection Agency in the Bush administration, with the support of industry groups, appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court. On Monday, the court declined to hear that appeal. Obama administration lawyers had filed papers seeking the appeal’s dismissal.Coal-fired plants produce about half the nation’s electricity, but they are a major source not just of heat-trapping gases but of pollution as well. Mercury is a particular concern. While airborne concentrations are usually low, when mercury falls to earth it enters streams, rivers and estuaries and can accumulate in the form of methyl mercury in the flesh of fish.'"
"'09-02-24,'1','With so many parties in the talks — and with many unwilling to yield much ground to the car companies — executives and advisers in the negotiations have said that reaching a consensus would be hard without an overseer with the power of a car czar.“We are obviously at a critical moment in our nation’s history, particularly with regard to our economy, and I am honored to have this opportunity to serve my country in a meaningful way,” Mr. Rattner wrote in an e-mail message to friends on Monday.For years, Mr. Rattner has cultivated a reputation as a major player in New York’s political and charity circles, though he is less known in Washington and Detroit. Mr. Rattner was a financial reporter for The New York Times who later entered investment banking, becoming a deal maker in the media and communications sectors for the likes of Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Lazard.In 2000, he was a co-founder of the Quadrangle Group, the media-focused private equity firm that he is now leaving to take the Treasury position. Quadrangle’s investments include Metro Goldwyn Mayer, the movie studio, and Maxim magazine. From Quadrangle’s offices in the Seagram Building in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Rattner has courted the city’s power players, often over lunch at the Four Seasons restaurant downstairs.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, whose blind trust is managed by Quadrangle, said in a statement on Monday: “Steve has a unique understanding of the incredibly complex relationships between government and markets. I congratulate President Obama for making a great choice.”Mr. Rattner has long harbored political ambitions. A longtime Democratic contributor, he backed Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s presidential campaign, and some speculated that he sought the Treasury secretary post in a Clinton administration. His wife, Maureen White, was Mrs. Clinton’s finance co-chairwoman.For all his success in dealing with media moguls, Mr. Rattner now faces a different test in negotiating with the carmakers and other parties. His close ties to corporate America led some to oppose him as car czar. Ron Gettelfinger, the president of the United Automobile Workers, has suggested that Mr. Rattner was not qualified for the post.His experience as a corporate consigliere on the Treasury team will in some ways be counterbalanced by that of Ron Bloom, senior adviser on the auto crisis, a former investment banker who specialized in advising unions in industrial bankruptcy cases. Mr. Bloom was a senior executive at the United Steelworkers union a decade ago. Mr. Rattner and Mr. Bloom briefly worked at Lazard at the same time.Quadrangle said on Monday that Mr. Rattner would be succeeded by Michael Huber and Joshua Steiner, who will become co-presidents of the firm, effective immediately.“The Obama administration’s selection of Steve represents a distinct honor for him and a rare opportunity for him to help facilitate our country’s economic recovery,” Quadrangle said in a statement. “While we will clearly miss Steve, we recognize the utmost importance of this appointment.”Quadragle is expected to begin raising a new leveraged buyout fund within the next year, without Mr. Rattner’s involvement, and its asset management arm will keep one of its highest-profile clients: Mr. Bloomberg.'"
"'09-02-24,'1','RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — Dubai’s stock market rallied Monday, a day after the United Arab Emirates announced a $10 billion bond purchase to shore up the debt-ridden city-state, which had been hit hard by collapsing real estate prices and tight credit in recent months.The Dubai government issued a statement on Sunday saying that it would issue $20 billion in long-term bonds, and that the Emirates’ central bank, based in Abu Dhabi, had agreed to buy the first installment of $10 billion.Analysts had long predicted that oil-rich Abu Dhabi might bail out its neighbor emirate Dubai, whose economy is based largely on real estate and has suffered far more than Abu Dhabi has in the current downturn.Dubai, which had financed its growth largely through international borrowing, said Sunday that the bond sale would allow it to “meet its financial obligations and continue its development program.”But the bond program may be only a temporary fix for Dubai, where scores of major construction programs, including one planned to be the world’s tallest building, have been put on hold. Many foreign workers, who make up about 90 percent of Dubai’s population, have lost their jobs and left, and real estate prices have dropped by 50 percent or more.'"
"'09-02-24,'1','For Central and Eastern Europe, which enjoyed breakneck growth thanks to a wave of credit from these banks, the squeeze could not have come at a worse time. Already bruised by the global downturn, they are on the verge of a downward spiral as the flow of credit dries up. Average growth among countries in the region slid to 3.2 percent last year, from 5.4 percent in 2007. This year, it is forecast to contract by 0.4 percent — and very likely more.“These numbers will be coming down,” said Charles Collyns, deputy director of the research department at the International Monetary Fund.Add to that a new worry: International finance officials fret that the worst regional economic crisis since the Berlin Wall came down could set off a contagion among the region’s currencies, with echoes of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. Then, emerging markets like Thailand borrowed in foreign currencies to fuel growth, but suddenly owed more than they could afford to pay back once their own currencies lost value.Since peaking last summer, Poland’s currency has slumped 48 percent against the euro; Hungary’s has fallen 30 percent and the Czech Republic’s is off 21 percent. “Very simply, Eastern Europe has become Europe’s version of the subprime market,” said Robert Brusca of FAO Economics in New York.On Monday, the central banks of Poland, Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic sought to restore calm by issuing statements arguing that the recent sell-off was not justified by economic fundamentals.In addition, Western banks could very likely suffer a further increase in nonperforming loans. “Most of the banks in this region are from the euro countries and will have to undergo further recapitalization,” Gillian Edgeworth, an economist with Deutsche Bank in London, said.Another problem is that big institutional investors in Western Europe — banks, pension funds and insurance companies — have large holdings of East European debt. If the banks need further infusions of capital from Western governments already straining to pay for stimulus packages and to maintain their social safety nets, it could put additional pressure on the euro as well.“The threat to more developed economies goes through the banking channel,” Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the monetary fund, said in a recent interview.As the downturn worsens across the Continent, Mr. Rogoff explained, risk aversion can quickly spread to other parts of the world. Some investors hurt by plunging markets in Europe are having to sell American assets to raise money, adding pressure to a United States stock market already weakened by fears of nationalization.“It’s one big trans-Atlantic money market out there, and these banks lend money to each other all the time,” said Simon Johnson, another veteran of the monetary fund who is a now a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Deutsche Bank and UBS and Goldman Sachs and Citi are all intertwined.”In Eastern Europe itself, the risks for Western companies doing business there have also surged.Until recently, for example, Eastern Europe and Russia were rare bright spots for the beleaguered American automakers Ford Motor and General Motors. In Poland, where G.M. has a major factory, sales rose 10 percent last year to 38,000 cars, while sales in Russia soared 30 percent to 338,000 vehicles.Since then, demand has fallen sharply. In the Baltic countries, which were among the first to feel the chill, G.M.’s sales dropped an average of 57 percent in the final months of 2008.Among the biggest victims of the crisis are tens of thousands of workers who had clawed their way to more prosperity, only to see their dreams crumble as jobs and the financial system eroded.Because their declining currencies make it more expensive to import goods and to pay off foreign debts, governments have cut spending and reduced public services, leading to a wave of increasingly violent protests across the region that is threatening governments.On Friday, the coalition government in Latvia — where the economy contracted more than 10 percent on an annualized basis last month — became the second European government, after that of Iceland, to collapse.Meanwhile, in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, demonstrators took to the streets Friday as depositors rushed to pull their money out of local banks.The crisis has forced the monetary fund to step into the breach. In recent months, it has extended Ukraine, Iceland, Hungary and Latvia billions in aid. “I’m expecting a second wave of countries to knock at the door,” Mr. Strauss-Kahn said.Two years ago, “the idea was very, very consistently projected that the I.M.F. would not have to help emerging countries any more,” and that the “financial markets would take care of it,” Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, said Friday. Now, he said, this has proved to be “totally false.”For Mr. Johnson and other students of financial history, the latest developments in Europe — especially in Austria, whose banking industry is heavily exposed to its Eastern neighbors — raise eerie parallels with the 1930s. Mr. Johnson notes that it was the failure of a Viennese bank, Creditanstalt, in 1931 that was a turning point in what became the Great Depression.Mr. Johnson said he did not expect a repeat of that calamity, but he does foresee a long period of minimal growth, akin to Japan’s “lost decade” of the 1990s, in both the United States and Europe.And while the United States may have been the trigger for this international financial crisis, it is hardly alone in shouldering the blame. “We set off the sticks of dynamite, but a lot of people had tinderboxes under their houses,” he said.'"
"'09-02-24,'1','The deepening global downturn is dragging down all kinds of businesses, and, with no bottom to the recession in sight, investors sent the the Dow industrials down 250.89 points, or 3.7 percent, to 7,114.78, a 3.7 percent drop for the day and a loss of about 50 percent from their peak in the fall of 2007. Asian markets followed suit on Tuesday by flirting with the lows they hit last October, with stocks in Hong Kong dropping more than 3 percent, and Japan's Nikkei 225 index dropping more than 2 percent before rebounding slightly.In an unexpectedly assertive joint statement after two weeks of bank stock declines, the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and federal bank regulatory agencies announced that the government might demand a direct ownership stake in major banks that do not have enough capital to weather a deeper downturn. The government will begin conducting a test of the banks’ financial health this week.Administration officials emphasized that any of the major banks was their least favorite solution to the banking crisis, but they acknowledged that some banks might be both too big to fail and too fragile to endure another round of shocks without substantial help.Banks that fail the test will have to raise additional capital. If they are unable to raise capital in the private market, they would have to take money from the government in exchange for preferred stock that would be convertible into common shares, thus giving the government a bigger stake.The administration is debating how big a role to play in the auto businesses, what concessions the companies should make in return for aid and whether bankruptcy should be considered, though it prefers a private sector solution.On Monday, , co-founder of a private equity firm, the Quadrangle Group, was named an adviser to the Treasury on the auto industry.As the administration takes bigger stakes in companies, the value held by existing shareholders is being diluted, which could make it even harder to attract private money in the future., the secretary of the Treasury, recently outlined a bank recovery plan that included a program to attract a combination of public and private money to buy troubled and other assets.A.I.G. serves as a cautionary note about the difficulty of luring private investors when the size of the losses is unknown. In the months since the government initially stepped in last fall to take an 80 percent stake in the insurer, the company has suffered deepening losses and has been forced to post more collateral with its trading partners.The company, according to a person close to the negotiations, is discussing the prospect of converting the government’s $40 billion in preferred shares into common equity.The prototype could turn out to be Citigroup, which is negotiating with regulators to replace the government’s nonvoting preferred shares with shares that are convertible into common stock.“We absolutely believe that our private banking system is best off being in private hands and we are trying our best to keep it that way,” said one senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But, he continued, the government is already deeply involved in propping up the banking system and may have no choice.Officials said they were bracing for the possibility of new problems that might indeed require the government to take a more aggressive stance.“Given our involvement at this particular stage, there is an element, a possibility over time, that we will end up with some ownership of these institutions,” the official said. “This is really about aggressive anticipatory action. It is an acceptance that the future is uncertain, but that we can plan on a certain basis for it.”Acquiring common stock would give the government more control, but expose it to more risk. Armed with voting shares, government officials would have more power to replace management and change company strategy. But the Treasury would lose its claim to dividend payments, which in Citigroup’s case amount to more than $2.25 billion a year.A.I.G. declined to provide details of its new financial problems, citing the “quiet period” just before it issues fourth-quarter results. But some people familiar with A.I.G.’s negotiations said it was on the brink of reporting one of the biggest year-end losses in American history.Such losses lead to a bigger problem. A further rating downgrade would force the company to raise more capital, according to a person involved in the negotiations. The losses appeared to be across the board, unlike the insurer’s losses of last September, which were confined mostly to derivative contracts called .A.I.G. has not been writing new credit-default swap contracts, and had tried to put the swaps disaster behind it. In November the company worked out a relief package with the , in which the most toxic of its swap contracts were put into a kind of quarantine, so they could no longer hurt its balance sheet. But A.I.G. had written several other classes of credit-default swaps, which it kept on its books.If the latest round of losses severely weaken A.I.G.’s capital and its creditworthiness, then its swap counterparties may be entitled to demand that A.I.G. come up with a large amount of cash for collateral — precisely the problem that brought the company to its knees last September.“They stand, unfortunately, to bring others down with them if they go down,” said Donn Vickrey of Gradient Analytics, an independent research firm.The difficulty of shoring up A.I.G. must weigh on the administration at this moment. The administration’s banking statement amounted to a plan of action demonstrating a way to demand a major and possibly a controlling stake in systemically important banks like Citigroup and .“They are desperate to not nationalize the banks,” said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG. “They know what happened when they took and they would just as soon not take over the banks, because if you own it, you gotta fix it.”'"
"'09-02-24,'1','WASHINGTON — One thing known before Monday was that John McCain would never have a new Marine One helicopter at his disposal. One thing known after Monday is that Barack Obama might not either.At their first public appearance together since Inauguration Day, President Obama and Senator McCain found themselves in agreement that a project to build 28 new helicopters for the White House has gone way off course.The encounter between the victor and the vanquished came at the end of a “fiscal responsibility summit” at the White House. As a ranking senator, Mr. McCain joined other lawmakers at the opening session, taking a seat in the sixth row in the East Room, where he remained silent and unacknowledged.In a little salt in the wound, the opening session was addressed by Mark Zandi, a McCain campaign adviser who has become the Democrats’ favorite economist because, unlike Mr. McCain, he backs their stimulus spending.Mr. McCain, a stern expression fixed on his face, did not seem to be having a good time. During a smaller breakout session, an account provided by a reporter who was present noted that he “appeared irritable and close to losing his temper at one point.”'"
"'09-02-24,'1','WHEN I started flying a lot for work about 20 years ago, it was all very glamorous. Of course, it’s not so glamorous today.I still remember the days when I could get to the airport one hour before flight time. Now, like everyone else, I’ve lost so much of my business day getting to the airport early and then waiting, sometimes hours, for my flight to either arrive or be canceled.On the upside, the airports are much different today compared with when I started out. Nowadays, airports are like lifestyle centers, with so many different choices of food, drinks, shopping and even a few spas. So if a flight is canceled or delayed, I do try and make the most of the experience.Also, when I started out, there weren’t that many women flying for business. Now, that’s changed, and it really makes me feel good.I have somewhat of a routine for all of my business trips.Once I get to my destination, I always try to experience the local culture. Fire dancing in Bali, cliff diving in Hawaii, tea ceremonies in Asia and wine tasting in California have all been part of my business travel experience. I even learned how to pour the perfect Guinness, complete with a shamrock drawn in the foam on top, while in Dublin.But as all business travelers know, there’s usually not a lot of time to experience that culture.When I was in Egypt for a development deal, the game plan was to quickly change into casual clothes so I could see some sights.I think in total I got about one hour, which included seeing the pyramids and taking a quick camel ride. At least I can say I’ve been there, done that. And as far as that camel goes, I never even knew his name. There simply wasn’t time to get that attached.I’ve traveled so much that I try and put mishaps in perspective.When I was visiting one of our hotels in San Juan, I wound up being stranded for three days. A hurricane hit the island, and all flights were canceled.I was totally unprepared for three days of no power, which meant no air-conditioning, no lights, no nothing. Including a drink. At a time when everyone could have used a little libation, the governor suspended all liquor sales. In the end, I experienced a hurricane and was no worse for the wear.I generally try to get some work done on flights. Seatmates often notice my hotel papers or glance at my laptop, which sports a screen with our logo emblazoned on it.I have found that people have strong opinions about hotels. So I try to think of it as a captive focus group. Fortunately, I’ve never been seated next to someone who had a bad experience with us. And it’s kind of fun to meet people on the plane who have had a great experience, since I usually e-mail guests or talk with them on the phone.About 10 years ago in Tokyo, two business travelers who frequently stayed at the Westin met and fell in love. A few years later, they came back to the hotel, as our special guests.One morning, the female half of the couple came to the lobby and said that she was trying to locate her young son.None of us quite understood though why this woman was walking through the lobby yelling the hotel’s name. Fortunately, her son was found a few minutes later. And then we realized that she had named her son Westin.It was an interesting, and flattering, choice.'"
"'09-02-24,'1','JPMorgan Chase & Company, the investment bank, cut its common stock dividend 87 percent on Monday, a surprise move by a lender considered among the strongest in the financial sector.The bank also said it has been “solidly profitable” this quarter, and that the outlook for the three-month period is “roughly in line” with analyst forecasts. Shares rose 5.5 percent in after-hours trading.JPMorgan said its decision to lower its quarterly dividend to 5 cents per share from 38 cents will save $5 billion of common equity a year. It hopes the lowered payout will help it pay back the $25 billion of capital it got in October from the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program faster.“Extraordinary times must call for extraordinary measures,” the chief executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call. He said JPMorgan was “not asked by anybody” to cut the payout, but did so out of a “normal abundance of caution.”Shares of JPMorgan, a Dow Jones industrial average component, rose $1.08 to $20.59 after-hours, after falling 39 cents during regular trading. The New York-based lender announced the dividend cut after U.S. markets closed.'"
"'09-02-24,'1','Yet the museum is only one institution in a place where little functions as it should — not electricity or even sewerage — nearly six years after the beginning of the war that toppled Saddam Hussein. The museum, like life here, may be more secure than at any other time since then, but it is not normal.Heavily armed soldiers patrolled the museum’s roof and watched from sandbagged redoubts as Mr. Maliki, other senior officials and foreign diplomats arrived. Helicopters thudded in the sky, and the police blocked streets for miles around.Inside, in stark contrast, visitors filled 8 of the museum’s 26 galleries, engaged in hushed conversations before glass cases displaying ancient pottery and sculptures, cuneiform tablets from Sumerian and Babylonian times, and the stunning 2,700-year-old stone reliefs from the palace of the Assyrian king Sargon II at Khorsabad. (In size and shape, the stonework eerily recalls the blast walls that protect buildings and divide streets in today’s Baghdad.)Welcoming the diplomats as a bagpipe ensemble played in the garden outside, Iraq’s minister of state for tourism and antiquities, Qahtan al-Jibouri, said Iraq wanted visitors “to see that Baghdad is still the same as it was in their eyes and has not turned to ruins, as the enemies of life wanted.”On Monday average Iraqis — that is, those not invited — could get only as close as the wrought-iron fence that surrounded the museum’s collection of buildings, offices and warehouses at the corner of Qahira and Nasir Streets in central Baghdad. Dozens clutched the fence’s bars and shouted out appeals, in vain, to the prime minister or other officials who came and left in armored convoys.Among those at the fence was Zahrah Latif, a 40-year-old woman without a home. “God willing, Iraq will be better,” she said, the museum a mere afterthought, “but we’re here to see Maliki.”When Iraqis may actually see for themselves a collection of relics and art that spans millenniums was a question even the museum’s deputy director, Muhsin Hassan Ali, dared not answer, even when pressed.The museum’s directors have twice before ostentatiously opened the doors. In July 2003, the American civilian administrator in Iraq at the time, L. Paul Bremer III, toured some displays a few months after Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld dismissed the looting by saying, “Stuff happens.” In December 2007, the museum’s director allowed a group of journalists and politicians inside for a few hours.The museum remained closed, though, battened down against the violence swirling outside. Not until now has Iraq’s government officially declared it a working institution again.Monday’s event itself proved controversial, provoking an unusually pointed dispute between ministries of Mr. Maliki’s fractious government, each with its own agenda.Mr. Jibouri’s tourism agency announced the reopening ceremony two weeks ago and issued invitations, only to be challenged by the Ministry of Culture, whose officials argued that the museum and its collection were not yet ready for the public. They complained that the holdings were in disarray, many of them waiting to be cataloged, and that the museum’s basic security remained in doubt.“It is a risk to open the museum at this time,” Jabir al-Jabiri, the ministry’s senior deputy, said in a telephone interview.The museum’s former director, Donny George Youkhanna, who fled in 2006 after threats against him and his family, said the museum required years’ more preparations to reach international standards of curatorship, conservation and security before it could safely accommodate museumgoers.“I believe the museum is being used in this case for political reasons only,” he wrote in an e-mail message from Long Island, where he is now a visiting professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.Mr. Maliki’s government, though, overruled such objections, and Monday’s ceremony went ahead — without Mr. Jabiri and other Culture Ministry officials, who boycotted it.Another deputy, Fawzi al-Atroshi, later said that the ministry, which officially oversees Iraq’s museums, was considering opening the museum at first only for one day a week and only for foreigners, students and V.I.P.’s.For a day at least, once Mr. Maliki’s entourage departed, people, if lucky enough to have been invited, once again walked freely through the museum’s galleries, which still showed wear in places, despite the new paint.The museum, also known as the Iraq Museum, has been extensively, if not completely, refurbished, with financial assistance from Italy and the United States, including a $14 million grant announced last fall by Laura Bush. It still requires a heating and cooling system, security systems and training for a staff that has remained in professional limbo for years.One hall that opened on Monday was devoted to objects taken during the looting and since returned, having been seized by customs officials at the borders. Other halls displayed works that had been in storage and were only now being seen, including two smaller-than-usual versions of the mythical winged, human-headed bull created during the Assyrian empire, as long as 3,000 years ago.The museum’s workers, who witnessed the looting and then endured a closing of nearly six years and uncertainty inside and outside the building, sounded elated simply to have company again in what for years were deserted galleries.“You can tell by our faces how we feel,” Thamir Rajab, a conservation specialist, said, beaming as he pointed out several of his favorite sculptures.The staff learned two months ago that the museum would reopen in February. As Mr. Rajab put it, it then crammed two years’ work into those two months.“We did the best we could,” he explained, wistful that the museum remained less than what it once was. “This is what we could do now. God willing, one day we will do more.”'"
"'09-02-24,'1','Scientists measured blood levels of the vitamin in a representative sample of 1,766 people over 65 and assessed their mental functioning with a widely used questionnaire. About 12 percent were cognitively impaired, and the lower their vitamin D level, the more likely they were to be in that group. Compared with those in the highest one-quarter for serum vitamin D, those in the lowest were 2.3 times as likely to be impaired, even after statistically adjusting for age, sex, education and ethnicity. Men showed the effect more strongly than women.“The cause of dementia is not vitamin D deficiency,” said David Llewellyn, a research associate at Cambridge University and the study’s lead author. “It’s a very complicated disease. But while further research is needed, vitamin D supplementation is cheap, safe and convenient, and may therefore play an important role in prevention.”According to background information in the study, which appears online in The Journal of Geriatric Psychology and Neurology, vitamin D receptors are present in a variety of cells, including neurons and the glial cells associated with them. That suggests that the vitamin may play a role in brain development and the protection of neurons.'"
"'09-02-24,'1','Seldom can a book stretch to accommodate both its author’s and its publisher’s fondest hopes: that it be original yet universal, artistic yet practical, and likely to sell briskly for centuries to come.To understand why Rachel Kauder Nalebuff’s “My Little Red Book” manages all of the above, you need only muse for a moment on the fact that your local Victoria’s Secret, that high temple of undress, has private dressing rooms. Or that “Hair” on Broadway features full frontal nudity on stage and the usual segregated men’s and ladies’ rooms at intermission. Or that sex education still routinely proceeds in single-sex classes.In other words, for all our public exploration of everyone else’s bodies, our own personal specimens remain quite private. So when it comes to the onset of menstruation, it is the rare girl who will launch an enthusiastic dialogue with family or friends on the subject. Far more typical is she who enters the feminine-products aisle alone (and returns there alone for the duration).To 18-year-old Rachel Nalebuff, this particular privacy made no sense. Reasoning that every lonely soul wandering through Walgreens has a story to tell, she was inspired to assemble a collection of 92 short reflections by women on the subject of their first period.At this point, male readers may want to go outside and toss a ball around for a while. No matter how sympathetic, how curious or how deeply interested in life’s little yuck factors you are, this collection is unlikely to hold more than the mildest intellectual appeal for you. But it is hard to imagine any woman, from the most straitlaced and body-denying to the most uninhibited and body-embracing, who will not read right through it with pure enjoyment, small flashes of recognition and the urge to buy it for every female preteen in sight.Contributors range in age from teenagers to the very old, and they come from all over the world. Either Ms. Nalebuff or her editors had the good sense to prohibit all of them, especially the well-known writers, from droning on. Most pieces are a few crisp paragraphs that manage to avoid both the chirpy “You are a woman now” song of the Tampax box and the lugubrious musings on blood, moons and fertility of the feminist academic.Ms. Nalebuff’s Great Aunt Nina, for instance, got her first period on a train out of Poland at the onset of World War II, while being strip-searched by guards at the German border. Her first napkin was a railroad-issue toilet paper roll, and her first intimation of a better life ahead was her mother’s hissed promise that sanitary products in France, where they were headed, were far better than Polish versions.Sixty years later, Ms. Nalebuff herself spent a horrific afternoon waterskiing in a stained yellow bathing suit stuffed with paper towels, in the company of her tongue-tied grandfather. Her younger sister Zoe, on her day, simply text-messaged her best friend a big red dot and a sigh: “Only 40 more years.”The author Patricia Marx was furious at her first period, having decided by age 15 that she was going to be lucky enough to skip the whole thing. Cecily von Ziegesar, author of the “Gossip Girl” series, was one of untold thousands to be flummoxed by a box of applicator-free O.B. tampons. The runner Kathrine Switzer had to prime the pump with calories: only after she gained 15 pounds with peanut butter and chocolate milk did she begin to menstruate.Even Gloria Steinem makes an appearance, with a reprint of her hoary 1978 classic, “If Men Could Menstruate.” (“Congress would fund a National Institute of Dysmenorrhea to help stamp out monthly discomforts. Sanitary supplies would be federally funded and free.”)Like other menstruating women in Bangalore, India, in 1962, Shobha Sharma was banished from the family home to an isolated room in the back garden. In New York in 1942, Thelma Kandel was forbidden to water the houseplants (scientists once claimed that menstruating women secreted potent plant-killing “menotoxins”). More than one immigrant mother slapped her daughter across the face, for reasons none of them can quite remember.Ms. Nalebuff, who will enter Yale this fall, has established a Web site for readers to contribute stories, but one suspects that a giant menstruation chat group will be just a little too much. The discipline of hard covers here is perfect for letting the reader sense themes without being bludgeoned by them.Two surface over and over. First is the remarkably durable adolescent conviction that no matter who you are, where and when you were born, you are freakishly abnormal  too young, too old; your flow too thick, too scanty, too brown. The writer Joyce Maynard sums it up: “Before I started being ashamed of getting my period I was ashamed of not getting my period.”More intriguing is that even among the carefully prepared adolescents of the late 20th century, one contributor after another writes of her utter conviction that the stain on her underwear meant that she was dying.The book’s great beauty is that these themes are left unexplored. No one draws a moral (see, everyone thinks she’s different!), or offers up the poet’s lament that all life’s landmarks spell a step to death. The reader is left alone to absorb it all in privacy.'"

They’ve had enough.”Stock markets fell more than 6 percent last week on worries about the solvency of the country’s banks.On Monday morning, the Treasury Department tried to reassure nervous investors with a message supporting the financial system that laid out details of the coming “stress tests” of major banks.But after a brief rise in early trading, stock indexes fell into the red and sank lower throughout the afternoon.The Dow Jones industrial average declined 250.89 points, or 3.41 percent, to 7.114.78, hitting a point not seen since May 7, 1997.Of the Dow’s 30 blue-chip stocks, only Bank of America, Citigroup and General Motors did not close lower.Shares of Bank of America rose 12 cents, or 3.17 percent, to $3.91; Citigroup was up 19 cents, or 9.74 percent, to $2.14; while G.M. was flat at $1.77.The broader S.& P. 500 fell 26.72 points, or 3.47 percent, to 743.33.The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index declined 53.51 points, or 3.71 percent, to 1,387.72.With the losses on Monday, two of the major indexes erased the three months of fitful gains they had made since Nov. 20. (The Nasdaq is still above its late November lows).Analysts said that the draining cycle of losses, rebounds and more losses would probably continue until the government offered a detailed plan to bail out the banks or the economy showed some signs of stabilization.“In lieu of anything the market sees as positive, it’s going to continue its easiest path, and the path it sees is down,” said Joseph Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading, based in Chatham, N.J. “That’s where we’re stuck right now, and who’s going to get out in front of it?”Analysts said that after fevered speculation last week about bank nationalization, many investors expected the government to move in that direction, despite statements from the White House supporting a privately held banking system.Now, with the government set to begin the “stress tests” on Wednesday, investors want to know which banks will be deemed healthy and which will not, analysts said.“We need to know how they stand right now,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams, a financial services firm. “The uncertainty of waiting for the results of these stress test is just killing the markets.”Two weeks ago, stock markets tumbled after the Treasury Department announced plans to form a public-private partnership to take troubled mortgage-related assets off the balance sheets of banks. Investors said the government’s plans were short on details and left too much uncertainty about how those assets would be valued, or how private investors would be enticed to bid on them.“There is a total lack of confidence in Washington to do anything to get us out of this problem,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “It’s a never-ending cycle.”Crude oil fell $1.59, to $38.44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Gold prices, which have risen as investors seek a safe-haven for their money, also fell slightly, to $991.75 an ounce.The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 9/32, to 99 31/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 2.75 percent, from 2.79 percent late Friday.Following are the results of Monday’s Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:'"

"'09-02-24,'1','For Central and Eastern Europe, which enjoyed breakneck growth thanks to a wave of credit from these banks, the squeeze could not have come at a worse time. Already bruised by the global downturn, they are on the verge of a downward spiral as the flow of credit dries up. Average growth among countries in the region slid to 3.2 percent last year, from 5.4 percent in 2007. This year, it is forecast to contract by 0.4 percent — and very likely more.“These numbers will be coming down,” said Charles Collyns, deputy director of the research department at the International Monetary Fund.Add to that a new worry: International finance officials fret that the worst regional economic crisis since the Berlin Wall came down could set off a contagion among the region’s currencies, with echoes of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. Then, emerging markets like Thailand borrowed in foreign currencies to fuel growth, but suddenly owed more than they could afford to pay back once their own currencies lost value.Since peaking last summer, Poland’s currency has slumped 48 percent against the euro; Hungary’s has fallen 30 percent and the Czech Republic’s is off 21 percent. “Very simply, Eastern Europe has become Europe’s version of the subprime market,” said Robert Brusca of FAO Economics in New York.On Monday, the central banks of Poland, Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic sought to restore calm by issuing statements arguing that the recent sell-off was not justified by economic fundamentals.In addition, Western banks could very likely suffer a further increase in nonperforming loans. “Most of the banks in this region are from the euro countries and will have to undergo further recapitalization,” Gillian Edgeworth, an economist with Deutsche Bank in London, said.Another problem is that big institutional investors in Western Europe — banks, pension funds and insurance companies — have large holdings of East European debt. If the banks need further infusions of capital from Western governments already straining to pay for stimulus packages and to maintain their social safety nets, it could put additional pressure on the euro as well.“The threat to more developed economies goes through the banking channel,” Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the monetary fund, said in a recent interview.As the downturn worsens across the Continent, Mr. Rogoff explained, risk aversion can quickly spread to other parts of the world. Some investors hurt by plunging markets in Europe are having to sell American assets to raise money, adding pressure to a United States stock market already weakened by fears of nationalization.“It’s one big trans-Atlantic money market out there, and these banks lend money to each other all the time,” said Simon Johnson, another veteran of the monetary fund who is a now a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Deutsche Bank and UBS and Goldman Sachs and Citi are all intertwined.”In Eastern Europe itself, the risks for Western companies doing business there have also surged.Until recently, for example, Eastern Europe and Russia were rare bright spots for the beleaguered American automakers Ford Motor and General Motors. In Poland, where G.M. has a major factory, sales rose 10 percent last year to 38,000 cars, while sales in Russia soared 30 percent to 338,000 vehicles.Since then, demand has fallen sharply. In the Baltic countries, which were among the first to feel the chill, G.M.’s sales dropped an average of 57 percent in the final months of 2008.Among the biggest victims of the crisis are tens of thousands of workers who had clawed their way to more prosperity, only to see their dreams crumble as jobs and the financial system eroded.Because their declining currencies make it more expensive to import goods and to pay off foreign debts, governments have cut spending and reduced public services, leading to a wave of increasingly violent protests across the region that is threatening governments.On Friday, the coalition government in Latvia — where the economy contracted more than 10 percent on an annualized basis last month — became the second European government, after that of Iceland, to collapse.Meanwhile, in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, demonstrators took to the streets Friday as depositors rushed to pull their money out of local banks.The crisis has forced the monetary fund to step into the breach. In recent months, it has extended Ukraine, Iceland, Hungary and Latvia billions in aid. “I’m expecting a second wave of countries to knock at the door,” Mr. Strauss-Kahn said.Two years ago, “the idea was very, very consistently projected that the I.M.F. would not have to help emerging countries any more,” and that the “financial markets would take care of it,” Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, said Friday. Now, he said, this has proved to be “totally false.”For Mr. Johnson and other students of financial history, the latest developments in Europe — especially in Austria, whose banking industry is heavily exposed to its Eastern neighbors — raise eerie parallels with the 1930s. Mr. Johnson notes that it was the failure of a Viennese bank, Creditanstalt, in 1931 that was a turning point in what became the Great Depression.Mr. Johnson said he did not expect a repeat of that calamity, but he does foresee a long period of minimal growth, akin to Japan’s “lost decade” of the 1990s, in both the United States and Europe.And while the United States may have been the trigger for this international financial crisis, it is hardly alone in shouldering the blame. “We set off the sticks of dynamite, but a lot of people had tinderboxes under their houses,” he said.'"

"'09-02-25,'0','Syria has built a missile facility on the ruins of a possible nuclear reactor that Israeli warplanes bombed in 2007, European diplomats quoted a Syrian official as saying Tuesday.Ibrahim Othman, Syria’s nuclear chief, told a closed technical meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna about the missile facility, officials said. “He made a reference to a missile, one missile,” said a European diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under usual diplomatic protocol.Soon after the bombing, Syria raced to level the desolate site and build a structure there that resembled the site’s former main building. Syria conceded that the site was military in nature but denied conducting any nuclear activities there.Last April, the Bush administration released detailed photographic images to support its assertion that the building that Israel destroyed was a nearly completed nuclear reactor constructed with years of help from North Korea. It said the reactor, once finished, would have been able to produce plutonium fuel for nuclear weapons.The new Syrian disclosure was made to the atomic agency’s 35-nation board, which is preparing for a quarterly meeting that begins next week.The agency has found traces of uranium at the site but has not been able to confirm or refute the claim that there had been a reactor there. Syria has insisted that the uranium came from Israeli bombs, but in a report made public last week, the agency said its analysis found that the shape and composition of the particles were “inconsistent with what would be expected from the use of uranium-based munitions.”'"
"'09-02-25,'0','WASHINGTON  The District of Columbia took a significant step toward winning a full vote in the House on Tuesday as the Senate cleared the way for legislation that would permanently expand House membership for the first time in almost a century.The Senate voted 62 to 34 to begin debating a measure that would also grant an additional House seat to Utah, enlarging the House to 437 seats. In 2007 supporters of the bill fell three votes short of overcoming a Senate filibuster against it.Sponsors of the voting bill were optimistic they could win Senate approval by the end of the week after consideration of changes proposed by Republican opponents. The Senate would then begin to work out differences with the House in hopes of quickly sending a bill to President Obama, who has indicated he would sign it. A court challenge is considered a certainty.Its backers said the fact that the 600,000 or so residents of the district do not have a voting representative in the House was a continuing injustice similar to civil rights violations of the past.“The district has a population roughly equal to or in fact greater than the states of Alaska, North Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming,” said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, a chief sponsor of the legislation. “But, sadly, its residents have not been allowed to be full participants in our democracy.”Even if the legislation is enacted soon, the two new representatives of the House would not be seated until the beginning of the next Congress in January 2011. The premise of the bill is that the new seat for the heavily Democratic district would be offset by one of solidly Republican Utah.Anticipating a court challenge, the measure seeks to speed a final decision on whether the new seat for the district is legal.Critics of the measure, pointing to the Constitution’s requirement that House members be chosen “by the people of the several states,” say that it is blatantly unconstitutional and that the District of Columbia can win a voting seat in the House only through a Constitutional amendment  a route that has been tried unsuccessfully in the past.“Only states may be represented in the House of Representatives,” said Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona. “Not territories, not districts or other federal possessions.”The current number of seats in the House was set in 1911 with 433 members, with a provision for two more when Arizona and New Mexico gained statehood. Currently, the delegate from the District of Columbia can vote in committee but not on final passage of bills. The district would not be entitled to a Senate seat under the bill.'"
"'09-02-25,'0','SAN FRANCISCO  Accusing Microsoft of unfairly sidelining competitors, Google said on Tuesday that it would apply to join a European Union antitrust case against Microsoft over the company’s Web browser.The case, initiated by the E.U. in January, accused Microsoft of illegally tying Internet Explorer to Windows to stifle competition in the browser market, breathing new life into issues that were at the core of the landmark Department of Justice antitrust suit against Microsoft a decade ago. The E.U. acted after it received a complaint from Opera, an Oslo-based maker of a competing browser. Mozilla, which makes the Firefox browser, applied to join the case earlier this month.Google, which last year rolled out Chrome, a competing browser, said it was also applying to become a “third party” in the European proceeding.“Google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive, which holds back innovation for users,” Sundar Pichai, a vice president for product management, wrote in a Google blog. “This is because Internet Explorer is tied to Microsoft’s dominant computer operating system, giving it an unfair advantage over other browsers.”Google declined to make anyone available to discuss its announcement. By becoming a party to the case, it would participate in the proceedings and gain access to the confidential “statement of objections” that European regulators sent to Microsoft last month. Google could also argue for remedies it prefers.Microsoft declined to comment on Google’s announcement. In January it said that it was still studying the European complaint. Microsoft later revealed that the European Commission was threatening a “significant fine” against Microsoft. The company also said regulators might force it to include rival browsers on computers that sold with the Windows operating system.Antitrust experts said that it was not surprising for a competitor like Google to join the case, but they questioned the timing of the European action, which came as rival browsers were steadily gaining market share.Microsoft’s share of the browser market had decreased to 68 percent in January, from about 80 percent two years ago, according to Net Applications, a research firm. Firefox had about 21.5 percent of the market, while Safari, made by Apple, 8.3 percent, and Google’s Chrome, 1 percent.“This new complaint is not necessary and actually seems like it is instigated to protect particular competitors rather than the competitive process,” said Samuel R. Miller, a partner at Sidley Austin in San Francisco who acted as special trial counsel for the Justice Department’s first antitrust case against Microsoft. “The browser has changed fundamentally from a decade ago.”This is not the first time that Google and Microsoft have been on opposite sides of antitrust claims. In 2006, Google complained to the Justice Department and to European regulators that Microsoft was using Internet Explorer to unfairly drive users to its search service, at the expense of Google’s. The Justice Department determined that the design of Microsoft’s browser did not pose a threat to competition.Google also lobbied against Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Yahoo, which fell apart after Yahoo repeatedly rejected Microsoft’s offers in 2008.Microsoft, for its part, lobbied against Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick and a proposed advertising pact between Google and Yahoo, which Google abandoned after the Justice Department said it planned to file suit to block it.'"
"'09-02-25,'0','DreamWorks Animation SKG, the film producer, said Tuesday that its fourth-quarter profit fell as revenue sank 31 percent.The company, based in Glendale, Calif., said it earned $51.6 million, or 58 cents a share, down 45 percent from $94.1 million, or 98 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago.

"'09-02-25,'0','As organized by Klaus Biesenbach, the chief curator in the department of media at the Museum of Modern Art, the show is not arranged chronologically, though its earliest work, from 1990, does come first. It’s a film of a single word, “Maxell,” projected on a screen.The name of a leading brand of videocassettes, it represents a type of recording technology on its way to obsolescence, and Mr. Horowitz has physically enacted its demise by copying the logo repeatedly on tape until, like generations-old photocopies, it dissolves into a blur.Obsolescence, often in the form of death, is a theme that runs through the show, as in the two-channel video piece titled “The Soul of Tammi Terrell.” One monitor plays a 1967 tape of this pop singer, who died of a brain tumor at 24 three years later, performing her hit “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” with Marvin Gaye; the other monitor shows Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts singing the same song in the 1998 Hollywood weepie “Stepmom,” in which Ms. Sarandon played a character dying of cancer.Whether the piece is about art imitating life or exploiting death is a Warholian question left unresolved. But there is no doubt about the moral message intended by a 2004 photographic piece in the same gallery. It has three parts: two vintage New York Post front pages honoring Ronald Reagan at the time of his death, and a single photograph of a man dying of AIDS. The title of the work sums up its didactic content: “Archival Iris Print of an Image Downloaded From the Internet With Two Copies of The New York Post Rotting in Their Frames.”Much of the show is about queerness, political and personal. A 2005 piece called “Three Rainbow American Flags for Jasper in the Style of the Artist’s Boyfriend” recreates the famous 1958 painting “Three Flags” by the gay artist Jasper Johns, but in different colors and coated with glitter, a decorative material that Mr. Horowitz’s partner, the artist Rob Pruitt, used in sculpture at the time.And on the principle that queerness is as much a matter of attitude as of biology, Mr. Horowitz has installed a double bed in the show, supplied with mix-and-match pairs of monogrammed pillowcases: Mom and Dad, Mom and Mom, Dad and Dad, John and Yoko, Kirk and Spock, Narcissus and Narcissus, and so on. The pillows will be changed periodically during the show, who knows in what combinations.But sexual politics is only one issue on the political spectrum. In 1997 Mr. Horowitz turned Michael Jackson’s music video “The Earth Song,” with its image of the performer as a black messiah healing the world through suffering, into a racially charged piece of “green” art.In 2002 he did an exhibition of pro-vegetarian, anti-slaughter work. And in a more recent series titled “Rome,” he wrapped up Italian Fascism, American foreign policy, the Vatican and Hollywood films into one hilariously prickly visual essay that cast imperialist blame all around without accusing anyone of anything in particular.Vagueness was one of Warhol’s not-so-secret weapons, deployed to ensure that no one ever knew where, if anywhere, he stood on any public issue. Sure, he made portraits of liberals like Robert F. Kennedy and Jimmy Carter. But he also made portraits of Ronald Reagan, Richard M. Nixon and the Shah of Iran.The Nixon picture, produced for the 1972 presidential elections, came with a perverse little twist. Under Nixon’s face, Warhol wrote “Vote George McGovern.” But when people congratulated him for making a subtly partisan joke, he said, “The idea was you could vote either way.”By playing all sides and no sides, Warhol kept the very concept of ideological commitment and political hero worship in a state of imbalance. And given the machinations of global politics, that seems like a healthy notion. How can anyone be anything but a skeptic?This brings us to the most recent work in the P.S. 1 show, a 2008 election poster designed by Mr. Horowitz that endorses Barack Obama for president. The poster doubled as an announcement for the artist’s election-themed solo show at Gavin Brown’s Enterprise gallery last fall. And while that exhibition had its share of jokes — extravagant red-and-blue decor and a life-size bronze cartoon figurine titled “Hillary Clinton Is a Person Too” — its basic tone was notably gibe-free.The poster, with Mr. Obama’s portrait punctuating a long line of white presidential faces, delivers a thumbs-up message of change too direct to be missed. And the exhibition itself culminated at the gallery in an all-out cheers-and-tears election night celebration. Can Andy’s grandkids turn out to be cockeyed optimists, after all?Well, maybe not. It says something that the single most compelling — in the sense of emotionally persuasive — piece in the retrospective is the 1997 Jackson video. Mr. Horowitz has tweaked it so that the soundtrack runs in reverse, but its heroic, heart-pulling, hokey vision of a redeemed world still comes through.And thanks to the passage of time, so does the real-life story of a black artist who played the role of popular hero only to have his career undone by a combination of racism, sex panic, personal hubris and changes in consumer fashion. In Mr. Horowitz’s retrospective, the Obama poster and the Jackson video both represent the American political present. And the future? As the extremely knowing Andy might say, “Oh, gee, I don’t know.”'"

Mr. Browne said in his suit that Mr. McCain and the committee had infringed on his copyrights by using “Running on Empty” in a presidential campaign commercial without Mr. Browne’s permission. Mr. McCain and the committee had argued that First Amendment and fair-use rules permitted the use because the song occurred in a political context, but Judge R. Gary Klausner was unconvinced. Judge Klausner also set a late-April date for a hearing to set a schedule for a jury trial.'"
"'09-02-25,'0','The Wednesday concert at Carnegie is vintage Hellsberg. For 20 years the Vienna Philharmonic, perennially stretched by opera performances and concerts back home, has followed an almost invariable formula in New York, arriving for three concerts beginning on Friday night and flying out immediately after on Sunday (with exceptions, as when members of the orchestra stayed to give a Sunday evening concert at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in 2002 in memory of 9/11).But for the 20th anniversary of the Carnegie concerts this year, Mr. Hellsberg wanted to do more. He suggested adding a fourth concert as a benefit. Carnegie Hall readily accepted, and the Wednesday concert will benefit the National Academy Foundation, a network of urban high school academies established by Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Carnegie’s board.The philharmonic musicians readily signed on, Mr. Hellsberg said in a recent interview in New York, because “we are focused very much on education programs, not only for professional musicians but also for children in general.”As for that nettlesome female issue, the barometer that seems to hover over the orchestra’s New York appearances still speaks more to tradition than to change. Of 149 players in the Vienna State Opera Orchestra, seven are women; of 120-some full-fledged members of the Vienna Philharmonic (the numbers shift regularly because of the probation period), three are women.The Danailova case is special, and not only because of the prominence of her position. Among other aspects of its tradition, the philharmonic is adamant on the subject of its distinctive Viennese style of playing and sound, and has often suggested that the likeliest candidates for admission are Vienna-born and -bred.A cynic might think that as a Bulgarian, Ms. Danailova is set up to fail. Mr. Hellsberg begs to differ.“I would say that for the concertmaster, some attributes are necessary which are not typically Viennese,” he said. “Leadership, for example. And knowing when one has to accept some facts but also knowing when to react at the moment in relation to the conductor. I don’t think that it is a problem that she did not study in Vienna, and the decisive point is the willingness, the openness to accept the way we play music. And I must tell you that she is very smart, and she has the ability to integrate her sound but to stay also within her own personality.”Mr. Hellsberg, in fact, is to some extent staking his leadership on this choice. In recent years the Vienna Philharmonic has established a mentorship program, with veteran members taking responsibility for probationary candidates.“I never thought I would be a mentor,” Mr. Hellsberg said, “because that has nothing to do with my function. But in this case, when she was engaged, I said, ‘I will take over this mentorship for her, because it is a very specific moment and situation, and I have to take a certain responsibility.’ ”The orchestra is not putting Ms. Danailova forward for interviews because, Mr. Hellsberg said, whatever is said about her in public would only add to the pressure of a difficult situation.Asked whether he is content with the pace of change in general, Mr. Hellsberg said: “I must say what has changed is that even the fact that we have a female concertmaster does not afflict anybody. I was always convinced that the only point which has to be discussed is the musical and artistic point.”So check back in a couple of years.'"
"'09-02-25,'0','A huge study of nearly half a million people found that older men and women who consumed large amounts of dairy foods and calcium were at reduced risk of developing digestive cancers, especially colorectal cancer. The findings have reignited a long-simmering debate over calcium’s potential to fight colon cancer.Among women, high calcium intake was associated with a reduced overall cancer risk as well, the study found.Previous studies have produced mixed results regarding the link between calcium and colon cancer.The latest report, an observational study in which researchers reviewed dietary profiles for possible links to cancer, was published on Monday in The Archives of Internal Medicine. Such studies are not considered as reliable as randomized, controlled trials that compare a treatment in one group with a placebo in a similar group. “Our key finding is that higher total calcium intake is associated with a decreased risk of digestive system cancers,” said first author Dr. Yikyung Park, a cancer epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute, who noted that current dietary recommendations to consume calcium are intended to promote bone health, not prevent cancer.“Our study is just one study,"" she added. ""We need to look to other studies to confirm the finding.”The study examined the relationship between dairy and calcium intake and cancers among 293,907 men and 198,903 women ages 50 to 71 who participated in the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study. Participants filled out a dietary questionnaire when they enrolled in the mid-1990s, noting how often they consumed dairy and other foods and whether they took supplements. Researchers then linked the participants’ records with state cancer registries to identify new cases of cancer diagnosed through 2003.'"
"'09-02-25,'0','A former trader who admitted to participating in an insider-trading scheme that made millions was sentenced Tuesday to more than five years in prison.David Tavdy, 40, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud a year ago after he admitting to buying tips from a former UBS executive who sold him nonpublic information about the bank’s stock recommendations. Mr. Tavdy worked for Assent, a broker-dealer.“I made a mistake, and I regret it,” Mr. Tavdy told Judge Deborah A. Batts of Federal District Court in Manhattan before she sentenced him to 63 months.Mr. Tavdy and the former UBS AG executive, Mitchel S.

All 13 pleaded guilty.In handing down the sentence, Judge Batts noted that from 2002 to 2006 Mr. Tavdy made “millions of dollars for himself and others by abusing insider information.” She added, “this is not a case of an isolated incident.”'"
"'09-02-25,'0','As required, Mr. Bernanke addressed the Fed’s dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment in the first installment of his twice-annual report to each house of Congress. The former part of the Fed’s mission has largely been met, with prices more or less where they were a year ago, and inflation expected to glide under 1 percent this year.But the job market continues to deteriorate. The unemployment rate, which rose to 7.6 percent in January, will probably reach 8.5 to 8.8 percent by the end of the year, according to Mr. Bernanke’s report to Congress. The gross domestic product, which fell at an annual rate of 3.8 percent in the last quarter of 2008, will contract 0.5 to 1.25 percent this year.Two barometers of the economy, the housing market and consumer attitudes, turned in dismal readings the morning the chairman appeared on Capitol Hill.Home prices in the fell at the fastest pace on record in December, according to the Standard & Poor’s . The value of single-family homes in 20 major metropolitan areas was 18.5 percent lower in December than a year earlier.According to a report by the private Conference Board, consumers described their current situation and their expected situation in six months in harsh terms. The group’s index of consumer confidence dropped to a new low of 25 in February, from 37.4 a month earlier. That was the lowest since it began tracking consumer sentiment in 1967.Mr. Bernanke acknowledged there was a risk that the economy would become even worse than the Fed is currently forecasting.The global nature of the economic slowdown, as well as a “so-called adverse feedback loop” — the idea that economic and financial conditions become mutually reinforcing — threaten to delay recovery, he said.He urged support for the significant — and sometimes unpopular — fiscal and monetary interventions being made by the government.Some senators, like , a Democrat from , questioned whether it was fair or even wise for the government to continue bailing out financial institutions and homeowners who had behaved irresponsibly.In response, Mr. Bernanke compared the government’s situation to one in which a neighbor smoked in bed and accidentally caught his house on fire. You could punish the neighbor for his irresponsibility by not calling the fire department, Mr. Bernanke said. But by the time the neighbor learned his lesson, the entire neighborhood would have burned down.He said policy makers should look at their task as two-pronged. The first goal is to prevent the economy from worsening in the near term. The second is to devise substantial, longer-term reforms of the financial regulatory system, to prevent future irresponsibility.Mr. Bernanke repeatedly advocated revamping federal oversight of financial institutions, which are now supervised by a patchwork of federal agencies that monitor different functions and, he said, never get a full picture of a company’s overall financial health.The Fed, he suggested, should look at the smaller companies underneath the umbrella of a bank holding company so that the various risks a financial institution takes do not “get out of the line of vision of regulators.”In a joint program with other federal regulatory agencies, the Fed announced Monday that the nation’s 20 biggest banks would have to undergo a “stress test” to determine their viability. The test will be used to measure whether banks have enough capital to survive a worsening downturn.To Mr. Bernanke’s first goal of shoring up the economy, the Fed has taken extraordinary steps in recent months to increase the flow of credit to businesses and households.When it comes to setting interest rates, it has nearly exhausted its options. In December the Federal Open Market Committee lowered its key interest rate to virtually zero, to encourage lending.The Fed has also been buying -backed securities that have been guaranteed by the federal government.It has expanded its lending operations to banks.

"'09-02-25,'0','SEOUL — North Korea announced Tuesday it was preparing to send a satellite into orbit in what American and South Korean officials believe will be a provocative test of a long-range missile capable of reaching parts of North America.The announcement came only days after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and South Korea’s foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, urged the North not to carry out the test, calling such a move “very unhelpful” and “provocative.”During her trip to Seoul last week, Mrs. Clinton called the North Korean government’s rule “tyranny,” but offered to normalize ties and provide economic help if it abandoned its nuclear weapons program. Officials in the region were awaiting the North Korean response when the announcement came on Tuesday.“The preparations for launching experimental communications satellite Kwangmyongsong-2 by means of delivery rocket Unha-2 are now making brisk headway,” North Korea’s Committee of Space Technology said in a statement carried by the government news agency, KCNA.The statement marked the first time North Korea had confirmed its activities at a missile-launching base at Musudan-ri on its east coast. It did not say when the launch would take place, but it was the clearest sign so far that it may be imminent.'"

Gary Locke of Washington State on Wednesday entered a political gantlet that has felled two other prominent politicians as President Obama formally tapped him as the latest nominee for secretary of commerce.“I’m sure it’s not lost on anyone that we’ve tried this a couple of times,” Mr. Obama said with a smile as he introduced Mr. Locke. “But I’m a big believer in keeping at something until you get it right. And Gary is the right man for this job.”Mr. Locke is the third right man for this job after the withdrawals of Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire. Mr. Richardson pulled out, citing a federal investigation into state contracting, while Mr. Gregg, a Republican, changed his mind after deciding that he was not in tune enough with the president.In turning to Mr. Locke, Mr. Obama recruited a low-key, pro-trade Democrat who was the nation’s first Chinese-American governor, from 1997 to 2005. With Mr. Obama behind him, Mr. Locke noted that his grandfather moved from China to Washington State a century ago and worked as a houseboy in exchange for English lessons just a mile from the Governor’s Mansion.“It took our family 100 years to move that one mile, a journey possible only in America,” Mr. Locke said.Since leaving office, Mr. Locke has worked as a partner in the Seattle office of the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine, where he has represented Microsoft and other firms doing business in China. The White House said he had not been a registered lobbyist.'"
"'09-02-26,'0','Marriage belongs to churches. It does not belong to government. Therefore, a far simpler solution than the one proposed by David Blankenhorn and Jonathan Rauch is to get the government out of church business and get the government out of the business of being a church. The next thing you know, the government will start telling churches whom to baptize.The solution is to permit the government, a civil body, to perform only civil unions, not marriages, while allowing churches to do both at the request of a couple.David Blankenhorn and Jonathan Rauch go astray in proposing a broad and unspecified religious exemption for those opposing marriage equality.But they do point to a long-overlooked problem with civil unions: they will be revealed as weak substitutes for marriage if and when the federal Defense of Marriage Act is repealed. That’s why the writers propose “federal civil unions.”The movement toward so-called virtual marriage equality is gaining momentum, with states ranging from New Mexico to Hawaii proposing that same-sex couples be granted what they call “marriage in all but name”: civil unions or domestic partnerships.But these laws, which are in place in several other states, provide only those comparatively few benefits that are the state’s to confer: inheritance rules, hospital visitation and powers of attorney, the right to sue in tort for injury or death to one’s spouse, to name perhaps the most significant.Many of the substantial financial benefits of marriage, including the right to file income taxes jointly and to collect Social Security death benefits, come from the federal government, but qualification usually depends on the state’s definition of marriage.The Defense of Marriage Act, however, disqualifies even those same-sex couples legally married in their home states. Thus, even a gay couple married in Massachusetts or a lesbian couple wed in Connecticut have no right to federal benefits. Under the act, marriage and civil unions really are the same, at least as far as federal benefits are concerned: same-sex couples lose in both cases.If, as President Obama has pledged, the Defense of Marriage Act is repealed, civil unions will stand unmasked as poor surrogates for marriage. For then same-sex couples in Massachusetts and Connecticut will have access to full federal benefits, while those in “civil unions” will have — nothing.The federal civil union is one effort to deal with this problem, and deserves to be taken seriously as a stopgap measure until full marriage equality is achieved.The writer is a professor and the director of the Health Law Institute at Widener University School of Law.David Blankenhorn and Jonathan Rauch make some good points about the need for “cooler heads” to have a frank conversation about gay marriage and reach a reasonable compromise.But the agreement that the writers support, which would allow organizations with religious missions to not recognize gay unions, could have dangerous repercussions, particularly as it pertains to hospitals with religious missions.If a gay person is brought to a Catholic (or other religious) hospital by an ambulance for emergency treatment, that hospital would have the power to refuse visitation rights or, worse, rights of attorney to the patient’s legal spouse or partner.Ambulances rarely ask patients which hospital they want to go to — they take them to the closest one possible. Enabling an organization like a religious hospital, which provides necessary services to people who do not directly choose to be there, to deny such basic rights is not a reasonable reconciliation.David Blankenhorn and Jonathan Rauch propose a compromise that would ensure an array of rights, including Social Security survivor benefits, tax-free inheritance and protections against mutual incrimination.But what about households with committed relationships that in no way resemble marriage? Where are their rights?In my years of work as a psychologist in nursing homes, I learned there are many other types of enduring relationships that embody commitment without a hint of romance. There are brothers and sisters, parents and children, and platonic roommates who have lived together for decades, not once thinking marriage. Yet when the time comes to make a crucial medical decision for a patient in a coma or with severe dementia, nonfamily household members may never be consulted.A blood relative fares only marginally better. A sister who has lived with her brother for decades — a very common household — will likely be called upon to make medical decisions if her sibling becomes incompetent. But if he had worked and she had managed the home, she’s out of luck for Social Security survivor benefits.There is precedent for Social Security survivor benefits to unmarried members of the same household. Both children and dependent parents have been eligible for survivor benefits since 1939. Why not extend these and the other benefits of marriage to any household with committed relationships?'"
"'09-02-26,'0','Only rarely does one solution solve a lot of problems. One that does — or at least could — is New York’s Bigger Better Bottle Bill. Potentially one of the most productive items on Albany’s legislative menu, the bill would expand the list of cans and bottles that could be redeemed for a nickel. It would include bottles used for noncarbonated and nonalcoholic beverages, such as water, sports drinks and juice.The bill would reduce litter in rivers and on highways, encourage recycling, save on natural resources and help replenish environmental programs whose budgets have been cut during the economic downturn.Right now, a consumer can redeem beer cans and soda bottles for the original nickel deposit. By enlarging the list to include the increasing number of drinks that don’t have bubbles, the Bigger Better Bottle Bill would add as many as five billion more cans and bottles to the nine billion that now carry the nickel deposit.That adds up to a lot of money, but here’s the real bonus. It’s what the bill says about the so-called missing nickels. Right now, when consumers pay a nickel per bottle upfront and then fail to redeem that bottle, the forgone nickel goes to the beverage industry. The stores obviously deserve a reasonable handling fee, but the beverage companies, which have powerful friends in Albany, deserve less than the windfall they are getting now.The latest bill would reroute a large chunk of this money to the state’s Environmental Protection Fund — which, among other things, helps purchase open space. Gov. David Paterson estimates that the missing nickels could bring in $118 million a year for the environment; the Container Recycling Institute, which studies such matters, says that revenue could reach $218 million.There is a balance to this deal. Those who can afford the extra nickel per drink and don’t redeem the bottles help pay to maintain a cleaner state. Those who can’t afford the 5 cents and need to redeem their containers not only get their nickel back but assure that the cans and bottles get recycled.'"
"'09-02-26,'0','WASHINGTON — Newly changed political realities were on vivid display on Wednesday as the Senate Judiciary Committee met to question Dawn Johnsen, President Obama’s nominee to head the Office of Legal Counsel.Ms. Johnsen, a law professor at Indiana University, had once worked as legal counsel to an abortion rights group and was once of the most outspoken critics of the Bush administration’s interrogation and detention policies. She has been sharply criticized by some conservatives and was expected to be given a rough ride by the Judiciary Committee’s Republicans, but their appetite for combat seemed stilled on Wednesday.Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who ran the hearing, noted how the Office of Legal Counsel under President Bush produced legal memorandums, later repudiated, that appeared to condone torture and violation of international law.She said Ms. Johnsen, who was a critic of those memorandums, would serve as “the conscience of the Justice Department.”Ms. Johnsen had said earlier in the hearing that she believed torture was, in all cases, illegal and that the procedure known as waterboarding was torture.'"
"'09-02-26,'0','WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles on Wednesday indicted a Jordanian businessman with connections to the Florida Republican Party on charges of funneling illegal contributions to three former presidential candidates and Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida.The indictment of the businessman, Ala’a al-Ali, 37, shines a spotlight on the role of a business associate who the complaint asserts helped collect the donations. The associate, Harry Sargeant III, is a major Republican fund-raiser who owns an oil company with government contracts in Iraq and who recently resigned as finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party. Mr. Sargeant raised more than $500,000 for the 2008 Republican presidential campaign of Senator John McCain.News organizations raised questions last summer about suspect donations to Mr. McCain from Arab-Americans that the campaign initially linked to Mr. Sargeant’s fund-raising before attributing them instead to another one of his Arab associates.The indictment charges that those suspect donations were in fact illegally orchestrated and reimbursed by Mr. Ali to circumvent caps on individual contributions as well as a ban on donations from foreign citizens. (Mr. Ali is a citizen of both Jordan and the Dominican Republic, where he lives, according to a statement from the United States Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles.)A Web site for Mr. Sargeant’s company, Sargeant Marine, lists Mr. Ali as sales coordinator. Mr. Sargeant, referred to in the complaint only as “H.S.,” declined to comment on Wednesday.People briefed on the case say prosecutors charge that Mr. Ali arranged a total of $60,000 in illegal donations to the campaigns of Mr. McCain, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton, and $5,000 to Mr. Crist.'"
"'09-02-26,'0','Representative Barney Frank, the chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, is not a fan of stadium naming-rights deals like the Mets’ Citi Field agreement or the corporate hospitality that is a hallmark of sports sponsorships.“Marketing expenses should be for real marketing, not ego boosts, which is what I think naming rights are,” Frank, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said Wednesday in a telephone interview. “Important men, in particular, like to hang out and ingratiate themselves with sports figures, and after the fact try to figure out how to make sense of the sponsorships as marketing or economic development.”But as much as he thinks Citigroup’s 20-year, $400 million deal with the Mets was a mistake — “I don’t think anybody has ever opened a bank account or decided to buy a CD because a bank’s name is on the stadium,” he said — Frank is not demanding that the bank break a valid contract that the Mets have said has no escape clause.“If there’s some cancellation fee, fine, but if it’s binding, it’s binding,” he said.Citigroup is negotiating for a third bailout — in addition to the $45 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program funds it has received — that would increase the federal government’s stake in it to 30 to 40 percent from about 8 percent.“We can’t force them to break an existing contract” with the Mets, Frank said. “But we can put in some pretty strict conditions on them going forward.”'"
"'09-02-26,'0','A federal appeals court affirmed the insider trading conviction of Joseph P.

It also revokes his release on $2 million bond.The acting United States attorney, David M. Gaouette, said in a statement that ruling “reaffirms what the government has believed from the beginning, that the jury verdict finding Mr. Nacchio guilty was indeed correct.”Maureen Mahoney, Mr. Nacchio’s lawyer, said the defense team was “profoundly disappointed” by the opinion and would ask the United States Supreme Court to review the case.Last year a three-judge panel of the same court voided Mr. Nacchio’s conviction and ordered a new trial, finding that Judge Edward W. Nottingham of Federal District Court in Denver had wrongly barred a consultant, Daniel R. Fischel, from testifying as an expert witness.Mr. Fischel was prepared to present a study of Mr. Nacchio’s trading patterns that showed they had been inconsistent with insider trading.But the majority said Wednesday that Mr. Nacchio’s lawyers had first disclosed plans to call Mr. Fischel three days before the start of the trial, giving the government inadequate time to review Mr. Fischel’s qualifications.'"
"'09-02-26,'0','Victor Zarnowitz, a noted economist and expert on business cycles who for decades traced the history of economic predictions — and often found the forecasting faulty — died Saturday in Manhattan. He was 89 and lived in Manhattan.The cause was a heart attack, said Frank Tortorici, a spokesman for the Conference Board, for which Dr. Zarnowitz had been a senior fellow and economic counselor since 1999. The board is the nonprofit research organization that compiles, among other data, the nation’s monthly Consumer Confidence Index as well as the leading economic indicators for 10 countries, including the United States.Dr. Zarnowitz, an emeritus professor of economics at the University of Chicago, was also a research associate for the National Bureau of Economic Research, and in that capacity was one of the seven economists who officially determine when the United States is in a recession.In 1952, Dr. Zarnowitz came to the United States from his native Poland and soon was analyzing the pitfalls of economic prediction. In 1975, he released a study of the findings reached by more than 50 forecasters from 1962 to 1974. Preliminary figures showed that their predictions about shifts in the gross national product had generally been off by margins that Dr. Zarnowitz said would make a difference between a boom and merely good business, or between good business and a recession.The forecasters had incorrectly predicted the size of changes in the gross national product, erring by more than 1 percentage point — a significant error — four times. Twice, in 1970 and 1974, they had predicted that the G.N.P. would rise when it actually dropped.'"
"'09-02-26,'0','Israelis often focus on intent in drawing a distinction between Israel and Hamas — saying their forces kill civilians only as an unfortunate consequence of war while Hamas aims attacks at civilians. “The Israeli military effort is to neutralize the forces of aggression that have been used against its civilians, and there sometimes can be collateral damage,” said Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. “That happens in every war and every conflict.”That argument convinces no one here, where the public is outraged that Hamas is labeled a terrorist organization by the United States, while Israel is treated as a close friend.“If you are with the Americans, you are a legitimate fighter, you are a hero, but if you are fighting against a country supported by America then you are a terrorist,” said Abdel Bari Atwan, editor of the Palestinian newspaper Al Quds Al Arabi.President Obama told his envoy, George J. Mitchell, to go to the Middle East and listen. But when the United States refers to Hamas, or the Lebanese group Hezbollah, as a terrorist organization, the popular view here is that Washington still is not listening.The case may be even more tangled with Hezbollah, which is credited across Lebanese factions with forcing Israel to abandon its 20-year occupation of southern Lebanon, defeating Israel in a 2006 war and placing its members in Lebanon’s government and Parliament.“If Obama thinks these organizations are terrorists, there will never be peace,” said Hany Hassan, 29, who was selling flowers from his uncle’s shop in the quiet Cairo suburb of Maadi. “Bin Laden, he is a terrorist. These organizations, if America thinks they are terrorists, they will have to convince us.”There are certain cases where there is a greater consensus over what is terrorism, such as the Sept. 11 attacks by Al Qaeda, the attack on a school in Beslan, Russia, bombings in Bali, Spain and London (though even here, it is not unanimous). But in this region, for example, the invasion of Iraq is often referred to as a terrorist act.The issue of who is a terrorist often stirs strong emotions and fuels diplomatic conflicts. Iranian officials, for example, recently excoriated ambassadors from the European Union for having removed the People’s Mujahedeen Organization of Iran from the list of banned terrorist organizations. Iran considers it a terrorist group committed to overthrowing the state.“The Islamic Republic of Iran strongly condemns the double standards of the European Union regarding the phenomenon of terrorism,” Deputy Foreign Minister Mehdi Safari told the ambassadors in Tehran.Ron Pundak, director of the Peres Center for Peace in Israel, said, “I accept that Hamas and Hezbollah are terrorist organizations, but I think we should speak with them to pursue our objectives.” He acknowledged his view was out of sync with Israeli public opinion.What has happened, he and other regional analysts said, is that the use of the term “terrorist” has become a simplistic point, counterpoint offensive of its own, reflecting the growing influence of radicalism on both sides. It is often used to cloud issues, to avoid having to talk and to try to appear to take the moral high ground, they said.Mr. Pundak said it was useful to recall, for example, that while the United States and Israel recognized Mahmoud Abbas of the Fatah faction as the legitimate leader of the Palestinians, not long ago Fatah and its leader, Yasir Arafat, were considered terrorists. He said that like the Irish Republican Army, Fatah was ultimately induced to be more pragmatic by being brought into the political process, not by being shunned and isolated.“We are fueling each other’s paranoia by the simplistic discourse we are pursuing,” Mr. Pundak said.People interviewed in Egypt, Gaza, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon said they saw nothing but hypocrisy in the way the West applied the terrorist label — a feeling tied very closely to a belief that the West reserved the term for Muslims. President Obama has tried to counter that perception with his outreach to the Muslim world, but with the memory of Gaza so fresh, and with Washington still defining Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist groups, opinions have not shifted.“You ask what we feel about this word, how to define it,” said Imad Jalal, 35, as he stood selling cellphone chargers in Gaza City last week. “First, let me tell you how we perceive it when it’s used by Americans and Israelis. We feel like you use it as another word for Muslim. In your mind, every Muslim is a terrorist, and that’s it. It has rarely been used for anybody who’s not Muslim, recently.”In Cairo, Wafaa Younis was seated on a curb, selling bread and green onions and mint leaves, as goats ate trash strewn across the street. She was asked what advice she would give Mr. Obama as he tried to repair the Arab perception that Washington was the enemy.“You have to understand everyone’s opinions and demands, and negotiate,” she said. “There will be no peace without this.”'"
"'09-02-26,'0','Federal authorities suspect the scandal over Americans’ secret offshore accounts at UBS, the big Swiss bank, runs far deeper than they believed only a week ago.While UBS admitted last week that it had failed to properly withhold American taxes on 17,000 accounts held by affluent Americans, the authorities are now investigating how the bank and its intermediaries handled taxes for an additional 35,000 accounts, according to two people briefed on the investigation.At issue is whether UBS withheld taxes, as required by American law, and, if so, where the money went, these people said. If UBS failed to collect taxes on all 35,000 accounts, the bank could owe the Treasury Department as much as $800 million in taxes, interest, fines and penalties, according to a tax lawyer briefed on the investigation, who spoke on the condition he not be named because he is representing UBS clients.Federal authorities are stepping up their investigation into the Swiss bank’s activities and pressing UBS to divulge the names of tens of thousands of American clients. The effort is drawing sharp criticism from the Swiss, who say disclosing the names would violate Swiss law.There are two main parts of the federal investigation. The first concerns the individuals who may have used UBS accounts to evade taxes. The second involves whether the bank itself properly collected tax money and forwarded it to the Treasury Department. UBS stunned the secretive world of Swiss banking last week by agreeing to pay $780 million and identify about 250 clients to settle claims that it had defrauded the Internal Revenue Service. But the I.R.S. is demanding that UBS divulge the names of 52,000 account holders as part of an investigation into individual tax evasion. The Justice Department is conducting a separate investigation.'"
"'09-02-26,'0','Dr. Woloshin and Dr. Schwartz are scheduled to present the results of two randomized trials, published last week in Annals of Internal Medicine, in which they examined how well drug fact boxes worked on several hundred people. The studies indicated that most people presented with comparative risk and benefit information were able to identify the more effective of two drugs.The F.D.A. would not comment on the merits of the Dartmouth proposal before the hearing on Friday, Sandy Walsh, an agency spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail message to a reporter. The hearing is focused on improving drug information for patients, she said.But on its Web site, the agency acknowledges receiving complaints that drug ads provide inadequate information for consumers. Ms. Walsh said the agency was studying how to improve drug advertising.At least one executive involved in drug marketing said he agreed with the Dartmouth effort and was enthusiastic about the prospect of the public’s knowing how well a drug works and the odds of having side effects.That marketing executive, Robert Ehrlich, the chief of DTC Perspectives, a publishing and consulting company specializing in pharmaceutical marketing, said he also had urged the F.D.A. to ask for risk statistics in ads.The Dartmouth researchers, in one example, used data from a published study of the insomnia drug Lunesta to create a benefit box showing that volunteers who took the sleeping pill nightly for six months typically fell asleep 15 minutes faster than people on a placebo. The table, e-mailed to a reporter, also indicates that volunteers taking Lunesta typically slept for six hours and 22 minutes — or only 37 minutes longer than the placebo group. There was no difference in life-threatening side effects among the groups.In 2007, Sepracor, the maker of Lunesta, spent about $293 million on advertisements for the sleeping pill, the highest ad spending that year among drug brands, according to Nielsen.The doctors’ sample drug box is based on a study from 2003 in which patients themselves reported on how long they had slept, Amy Trevvett, a spokeswoman for Sepracor, wrote in an e-mail message. A subsequent study, using a more scientific method of measuring sleep duration, reported that patients taking Lunesta slept for seven hours or more, she wrote.Federal law requires that drug ads include a brief summary about the possible side effects of a medication and about who should not take a certain drug. In television and radio commercials, this summary often takes the form of a hastily read list of hazards that can run the gamut from dizziness to death. The back side of print ads typically provides the material in small print, sometimes in dense medical language.But ads are not required to — and seldom do — spell out how well a drug works or how often volunteers in clinical studies had side effects. In a highly anecdotal sampling of a dozen current issues of glossy magazines, a reporter found only one pharmaceutical ad, for the smoking cessation drug Chantix, that quantified its advantages over a placebo.The pharmaceutical industry spent nearly $4.8 billion last year on television and print ads, according to Nielsen Media Research.Critics, including some doctors, legislators and health advocates, have called the current format of drug ads misleading. In the absence of effectiveness statistics, critics say, ads may influence people to seek prescriptions for drugs that are of only marginal benefit. Meanwhile, the lack of data on the likelihood of side effects could scare consumers into avoiding highly effective drugs if they overestimate the risks.The Dartmouth researchers said their benefit boxes could provide an answer to such criticisms at a time when some members of Congress have vowed to restrict drug advertising, even as the industry argues that such marketing is a valuable consumer education tool.Dr. Schwartz said it would not be onerous for F.D.A. experts to fill out a form containing statistics for use in drug fact boxes. The agency regularly vets clinical trials, submitted by manufacturers seeking drug approvals, which contain data necessary for such information tables.The general idea of a drug fact box is not new, said Alan Goldhammer, the vice president for science and regulatory affairs for PhRMA, a pharmaceutical industry trade group. Although packaging for over-the-counter drugs like Claritin does not typically include statistics on efficacy, Dr. Goldhammer said packages contained information panels with facts about active ingredients and directions. He added that drug makers over the last few years had greatly improved the medical explanations in print ads.But Mr. Ehrlich, of DTC Perspectives, said he thought current ads were too vague about risks. “If you mention fatality in an ad, what does it mean to a consumer — one in 100, one in 1,000, one in 100,000?” Mr. Ehrlich said. “If you mention fatality, you owe the consumer some kind of odds of occurrence. I am not talking about a sneeze.”Consumers armed with more numerical information might avoid less effective drugs, he said, but the new approach might be good for the industry.“If there is high benefit and low risk, doctors will prescribe more of the drugs,” Mr. Ehrlich said. “If there is low benefit and high risk, the drugs probably should not be on the market.”'"
"'09-02-26,'0','The judge overseeing the probate of the hotelier Leona Helmsley’s will has ruled that, contrary to her wishes, the billions of dollars that will flow into the charitable trust she created do not have to be spent solely for the care and welfare of dogs.The judge, Troy K. Webber of Surrogate’s Court in Manhattan, said that the trustees who control the trust may distribute the money as they see fit. “The court finds that the trustees may apply trust funds for such charitable purposes and in such amounts as they may, in their sole discretion, determine,” Judge Webber wrote in a ruling dated last Thursday.Experts in trusts and estates had warned that Mrs. Helmsley’s order that her fortune be spent promoting canine well-being may not have been legally binding. The two-page “mission statement” that contained her instructions also gave the trustees discretion in spending the money, and it was never incorporated into her will or the trust documents.The trustees  Mrs. Helmsley’s brother, Alvin Rosenthal; two of her grandsons, Walter and David Panzirer; her lawyer Sandor Frankel; and her longtime friend John Codey  had filed a lengthy motion in court arguing that the mission statement did not limit use of the money, and the New York attorney general’s office filed a similar argument.In a statement issued on Wednesday, Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for the trustees, said they planned to begin making grants from the trust next month. “In the hope that this would be the court’s decision, the trustees have been diligently working to identify potential grantees so that the trust’s funds would be put to optimal use as soon as possible in such areas as health care, medical research, human services, education and various other areas,” Mr. Rubenstein said, pointedly avoiding the mention of dogs.The trustees, who are also the executors of Mrs. Helmsley’s will, had fretted about the terms of the mission statement, and the public discussion it incited. News that the biggest named beneficiary in Mrs. Helmsley’s will was Trouble, her Maltese, led to death threats against the dog, who now has a security detail costing the estate $100,000 a year. The judge’s decision does not affect Trouble’s inheritance.Animal lovers around the world were delighted when the terms of the mission statement were reported last year, and many of them wrote the trustees with suggestions about which organizations and programs the trust might support in fulfilling Mrs. Helmsley’s wish. Major animal welfare organizations applauded Mrs. Helmsley, who was known for her sharp tongue and imperious manner. She died in August 2007.Bernard Unti, senior policy adviser at the Humane Society of the United States, said the judge’s decision was disappointing, though not entirely unexpected. “Whatever the legal status of the mission statement, it certainly signaled a clear intent on Mrs. Helmsley’s part to see the money used to help dogs,” Mr. Unti said. “The animal welfare sector in the United States and abroad is chronically underfunded, and just the annual interest thrown off by an estate this large could do a tremendous amount of good.”Mrs. Helmsley drafted the mission statement in 2003 to establish goals for the multibillion-dollar trust that would disburse her assets after her death. The first goal was to help indigent people, the second to provide for the care of dogs. A year later, though, Mrs. Helmsley struck the first goal from the statement, effectively devoting the estate primarily to the welfare of dogs  though she did add “and such other charitable activities as the trustees shall determine.”Mr. Unti noted that bequests made for the purposes of furthering animal welfare generally have a hard time surviving the probate process. As far back as the latter half of the 19th century, a bequest of real estate valued at more than $100,000 to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was contested by the donor’s heirs, who claimed he was insane. In that case, the court upheld the donor’s wish.In another prominent example, Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress, left her money to support the arts and for the prevention of cruelty to animals or children. “The trustees apparently said, ‘Oh, well, she said animals or children, not animals and children, so let’s do just children,’ ” Mr. Unti said.'"

"'09-02-26,'0','Such widespread reorganization, with some firms firing brokers and others hiring them, has disrupted continuity and thus made consistent communication — never easy in the first place — even harder. So companies are trying new ways to reach out to their customers.“We are talking to our clients in every proactive and responsive way possible to let them know where they stand, what we think about markets and current events and our thoughts on defensive and opportunistic investing,” said Alexander Samuelson, a spokesman for Smith Barney.Among other initiatives, he said, the firm has used an intranet site to post the information financial advisers need to answer clients’ questions. And it has begun inviting clients to listen in on weekly conference calls with well-known investment managers and economists.The wealth management divisions of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, still operating separately, have employed similar strategies. “We have further increased the frequency of communication during this challenging time,” said Jon Goldstein, a spokesman for Bank of America. One example was a webcast in January that focused on the state of the markets and attracted 9,000 clients.In spite of these efforts, there is still plenty of anecdotal evidence that clients feel neglected. Matt Doyle, senior investment consultant at CapTrust Financial Advisors in Tampa, Fla., recalled a client who had come to him after seeing $2 million become $1 million at a big brokerage firm.“He said: ‘It wasn’t the fact that I was down. It was the fact that I was down 50 percent without a phone call,’ ” Mr. Doyle said.CapTrust sells itself on the personal attention it gives to each client, but with minimum investments of $1 million it gets by with fewer, larger accounts.One midsize adviser has resurrected a crisis communication strategy that it used at the start of the Iraq war in 2003, sending out weekly market reports. After the market collapse last year, PNC Bank, based in Pittsburgh, added monthly conference calls. The first one in September drew 1,200 clients, three times what the company had expected.PNC does not plan to slow down, said James P. Dunigan, executive vice president of the wealth management division.“Our point of view is, we won’t take a breath even when the market has improved — that’s when we need to ramp up our efforts,” he said. “This time there will be a lot of money in motion.”'"
"'09-02-26,'0','PARIS — The European Commission presented on Wednesday a framework for governing state aid to European carmakers, hoping to avoid a hodgepodge of measures that would create an uneven playing field on the Continent.European countries have offered billions of euros to support carmakers as sales dry up, but so far there has been little coordination on how the money should be distributed.The French government added to that support Wednesday by announcing that its sovereign wealth fund had spent 18.7 million euros, or about $24 million, to buy a 2.35 percent stake in Valeo, an auto parts maker that earlier reported a fourth-quarter loss of 313 million euros. When added to the Valeo stake already held by Caisse des Dépôts et des Consignations, the government-controlled bank, the state owns 8.33 percent of the company.In addition, Le Figaro reported Wednesday that a capital infusion would soon be announced for Trèves, which makes seats, interior upholstery and other equipment for clients like Ford, Volkswagen and Daimler. The company said executives were unavailable to comment on the report.But governments’ acquisition of company shares was not addressed by the European Union in its latest aid guidelines, which focused on credit for companies unable to secure loans, grants to help companies improve their environmental performance and measures to encourage demand — mainly programs that would pay people to scrap their old cars for new, environmentally friendly models.'"

"'09-02-26,'0','ALAN TOWN loves the view from his new Florida condominium. Floor-to-ceiling windows in his 23rd-floor unit overlook downtown St. Petersburg and offer a water view stretching from Tampa Bay to the Gulf of Mexico. Shoreline parks filled with pink bougainvillea are set against a backdrop of sailboats moored in the bay.The vacation condo has other touches you would expect in a luxury development  a large kitchen with granite counters and marble floors, a private elevator lobby, a pool and concierge service.But the real selling point for Mr. Town was something less visible: a deeply discounted price. His 3,086-square-foot unit first sold in March 2008 for $1.79 million, according to property records. Mr. Town and his wife, Cheryl, picked it up in December for $1.3 million.“This is the nicest unit south of a penthouse,” said Mr. Town, whose permanent home is in Sarasota, Fla. “I never thought we could get something so swank, with this kind of view, at this price.”By many accounts, the Towns’ recent happy experience is a rare one. Very few people are buying resort condos these days, and some who have done so ran into well-publicized trouble. Buyers lost hefty deposits in new developments that stalled. Association fees rose in others. People who expected to sell units for quick profits discovered that no one wanted them.But now there are tempting deals on luxury condos. In Ocean City, Md., for example, a three-bedroom, three-bath unit in a development was listed for $742,390 in mid-February, about 36 percent below comparable sales there in 2007.In vacation areas around the country, real estate agents report that sellers are willing to accept offers well below listing prices. And these deals are being offered at stable projects, outside the riskier rock-bottom market of distressed properties being sold at auction.“There are good, solid developments with just a huge number of great buys right now,” said Kathy Panco, an associate broker at Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Ocean City.So how can a buyer get a good deal but avoid the pitfalls? Short-term investors face a myriad of challenges in evaluating condo purchases in this unpredictable market. But for those interested in long-term vacation homes, or permanent condo residences in vacation areas, some simple due diligence can minimize the risks.Traditionally, condo buyers acquired the latest luxury units at the best prices by signing purchase contracts and making a 20 percent down payment, long before the foundations were poured. The sales closed when construction was complete.But many buyers who signed preconstruction contracts two years ago now find themselves obligated to pay much more for their units than they are worth in today’s market. In a standard contract, that purchase obligation stands, even if the buyer cannot get financing, said Jared H. Beck, a Miami lawyer. Mr. Beck represents many buyers who do not want to close these deals. There are rarely easy ways out of them, he said.Other developers who sold preconstruction units abandoned projects because they could not raise construction financing. Some of those early buyers got their deposits back. Some did not.To avoid these problems, make sure the developer has successfully completed a similar project, Mr. Beck said. Then examine the purchase contract for reasonable construction deadlines. A missed deadline gives the buyer a valid reason to break the contract, he said, just as making the sale contingent on financing gives buyers dependent on it a way out.Buyers should also look at how the deposit money will be used. Money held in escrow tends to be returned if the project dies before construction, Mr. Beck said. Deposits used for construction costs often are not.Generally, a buyer will get a better price today by buying from someone reselling a unit than from a developer selling a new one, said Doug Labor, who represents buyers at Buyer’s Resource Real Estate agency in Steamboat Springs, Colo. Buyers can still pick up new units this way, he said, often by buying from investor-owners who never used the property.In St. Petersburg, Mr. Town said he considered but rejected a condo project under construction because the developers “were not negotiating at all.” Instead he bought a unit in a recently finished development a few blocks away, negotiating with disillusioned investors who wanted to cut their losses.'"
"'09-02-26,'0','Other works being returned, however, belonged to Valentin’s brother, Nicu, a much-loathed figure when he was the dictator’s heir apparent. He died of cirrhosis in 1996, at 45. (Ceausescu’s third child, a daughter, Zoe, who also had some works of art, died from lung cancer in 2006, at 57.)Ultimately, of course, everything that belonged to the family of Ceausescu, a onetime apprentice shoemaker from a peasant village, derived from the privileges of power.The case went through many convolutions over seven years. Valentin argued in court that what had been confiscated from him after his father was overthrown was not state property — never mind if, as the state argued, none of the Ceausescus ever bothered to document properly what was in their possession, as the Ceausescu regime required every Romanian to do.An eyebrow or two might have been raised when the court then agreed with Valentin, at least among Romanians who could recall how the dictator enriched his homes, his family members and others close to him by seizing art and property from innumerable countrymen.But the ho-hum response here speaks volumes about this struggling country’s cash-versus-culture climate. With most barely scraping by, Romanians admire private enterprise more than they value some vague notion of shared artistic heritage.“Since the revolution the country is only about private enterprise,” said Cristian Stanescu, a journalist who covered the trial for the local newspaper, The Guardian. He echoed what others here say: “Romanians sympathize with Valentin because he worked the system to his advantage. Our idea of culture now is making money. We still have too many basic needs to worry about elevated ones like art and the state.”Alin Ciupala, a thoughtful young historian of Romanian history at Bucharest University, put his countrymen’s indifference to their artistic heritage another way: “In Romania under Ceausescu there didn’t exist, as there did in the Soviet Union or Czechoslovakia, any underground cultural movement. There was no samizdat culture. And so there never was a tradition here of cultural liberalism, of cultural resistance. Intellectuals were opportunistic. The instinct to survive has always been highly developed in this country.“If Valentin had obtained from the courts big castles, or land, it might have provoked a reaction and reduced public sympathy for him. But paintings and prints, works of art? They don’t mean that much for most Romanians.”The art the court agreed should be handed over to Mr. Ceausescu is still in storage in the National Art Museum, where it has been since being seized years ago. One estimate put the price tag for the lot of pictures, some 40, at somewhat less than $1 million, but that was only a wild guess.Goya aside, the best-known artists among the work being returned, Victor Brauner and Theodor Pallady, aren’t exactly big names outside the country. Like Valentin Ceausescu and his wife, but for very different reasons, Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu also amassed works by Romanian artists, in their case pre-modern and Socialist Realist, although for a while, while the Communist leader was courting Richard M. Nixon and Charles de Gaulle during the 1960s, the state officially tolerated modern art for the sake of Western consumption. Briefly Romanian artists had a window onto what was happening in America and Western Europe.But then, culture having only been a political tool, the window eventually shut. After Ceausescu visited Pyongyang in North Korea, he decided to rebuild his own capital city. The result was to wipe out much of historic Bucharest to make way for grotesque and gigantic building projects that still spoil the city center, and sycophants kept a virtual army of state-approved artists busy painting portraits of Ceausescu and his wife, thousands of them. These ended up in public buildings and in the various homes of the dictator, who loved to receive as birthday gifts pictures of himself showing how much the Romanian people loved him. Ceausescu constructed a whole building to store these portraits.As it happened, the National Museum of Contemporary Art here had some of them on view the other day. Mihai Oroveanu, the museum’s director, hung them in one gallery — diagonally, to make clear that the show was not actually a tribute.Big, brightly colored scenes of Communist kitsch, they showed the dictator and his wife smiling before reverent mobs of workers, receiving flowers from ruddy-cheeked female soldiers, and wearing white 1970s leisure suits that, like the peaked winter hat Ceausescu made de rigeur for all loyal apparatchiks, became the height of Romanian fashion once upon a time.Radu Filipescu, a former dissident imprisoned and beaten under Ceausescu for distributing antigovernment leaflets, recalled Romanian life back then. “The most interesting books I read were in prison,” he said one recent evening, with a laugh. “There was not a lot else to do.” But he was also half-serious.“Today Romanians are totally consumed by competition and money,” he explained. “It’s easier for them to keep warm memories of the past, when life certainly was not better, but in some ways it was not as difficult. They don’t want to concern themselves with Ceausescu at the moment.”All of Europe wrestles with the last century, at different speeds. A generation of Spaniards is just getting around to unearthing the graves of Republicans killed under the rule of Francisco Franco, more than three decades after his death; France and Poland still haven’t quite confronted their conflicted roles during World War II. Germany struggles with addressing the legacy of its division, 20 years after the Wall fall.Here, Ceausescu and his wife aside, few Romanians were prosecuted for what happened during the Ceausescu era. Nobody served more than a few years in jail.“It is incredible to give back paintings to the son of a dictator,” said Stejarel Olaru. He oversees the government-sponsored Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes in Romania. “But people don’t care.”And so it’s left to Valentin Ceausescu, of all people, to deal with the past. He agreed to meet one afternoon in a nearly empty restaurant outside Bucharest. Nervous and defensive, he stressed that the art his parents had in their homes was borrowed from state-owned museums. The works he fought to recover, the only ones he really cares about, he said, were collected by him and his former wife, a private affair.“I was defending my name,” he said. “These works were part of my past, my life. Some were gifts from a painter who was a friend.”If the museum abides by the court order and turns the pictures over, which he said he still doubts, Mr. Ceausescu plans to give most of the works to Iordana, keep two or three for himself, but sell none.The issue was never profit, said the son of the dead dictator. It was justice.“I’m not pressed for money,” he wanted to make clear. “The whole point was that there should be a fair trial.”'"
"'09-02-26,'0','“It’s a conscious awakening of an entire people,” said Woeser, a popular Tibetan blogger.Tibetans here and in other towns, including in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, say government officials have handed out money to Tibetans to entice them to hold exuberant new year parties. On Wednesday, state-run television showed Tibetans in Lhasa dancing, shooting off fireworks and feasting in their homes.At the same time, the government has drawn a curtain across Tibet. Officials have shut down access to many Tibetan regions to foreigners and sent armed guards to patrol the streets.Here in eastern Qinghai Province, near the Dalai Lama’s birthplace, the boycott of festivities began as early as January, during the Chinese Lunar New Year. On Wednesday in Tongren, called Rebkong by Tibetans, one of the few bursts of firecrackers took place outside a Chinese paramilitary compound.“The government thinks we should celebrate this holiday properly,” said Shartsang, the abbot of Rongwo Monastery. “Certainly this year people haven’t celebrated it in the same way they did in past years.”Shartsang was one of more than a dozen monks interviewed over three days at Rongwo, called Longwu in Chinese. The 700-year-old monastery is a sprawling complex of golden-eaved temples and labyrinthine alleyways that is home to 400 monks. It draws pilgrims from across the Tibetan plateau.The government has stepped up security across Tibet. Here, more than 300 security officers with riot shields were seen training in the stadium on Wednesday afternoon. On Monday night, a unit of officers marched in formation along a cordoned-off road.Chinese officials are wary of the boycott’s mushrooming into larger protests, and of Tibetans taking to the streets next month, which marks the 50th anniversary of the uprising that led to the Dalai Lama’s flight from Lhasa. Most Tibetans revere the Dalai Lama, who advocates autonomy, but not secession, for Tibet.Last March, China was convulsed by the largest Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule in decades. It began when the suppression of protests by monks in Lhasa led to ethnic rioting by Tibetans. Eighteen civilians and one police officer were killed, according to Xinhua, the state news agency. Riots and protests flared up across western China. Tibetan exile groups say hundreds of Tibetans died in the crackdown.Rongwo Monastery was a locus of resistance. Even before the riots in Lhasa, monks joined Tibetan townspeople to protest the way the police had handled a dispute between Tibetans and ethnic Hui Muslims. More than 200 monks were detained in that incident. During the March uprising, security forces surrounded the monastery, only to be met by stone-hurling monks.Over the summer, leading monks were detained in a nearby school and forced to undergo patriotic education, which meant studying Chinese law and being told to denounce the Dalai Lama.“They broke into my room and took away all my photos of the Dalai Lama,” said one monk, 53, as he held up a pile of five empty glass picture frames. “Then they led monks away with their wrists bound by wires.”Like almost all the people interviewed for this article, the monk asked that his name not be used to avoid government reprisal. The monastery is under surveillance — cameras have been installed throughout, monks say, and security officers dressed in monk’s robes wander the alleys.Nevertheless, the monks have put photographs of the Dalai Lama back up in prayer halls and in their bedrooms. One monk held up an amulet of the Dalai Lama dangling from his neck.“The Chinese say this is all one country,” he said. “What do we think? You don’t know what’s in our hearts. They don’t know what’s in our hearts.” The monk tapped his chest.Some of the greatest hostility comes from 30 or so monks from the Drepung and Sera monasteries in Lhasa who have sought refuge here, even as some monks from Rongwo have tried fleeing across the Himalayas to India. Last spring, after the uprising, security forces in Lhasa cleared out monasteries and jailed monks for months. About 700 were sent to a camp in Golmud, in Qinghai, for patriotic education, then ordered to return to their hometowns, said three young monks who were at the camp.“We want to go back to our monastery in Lhasa, but the police would check our ID cards and evict us,” one of them said. “We came here because we wanted a good opportunity to study.”To try to maintain calm in the monastery, government officials meet regularly with a council of eight older monks. In early February, they had a frank discussion with the council, a senior monk said.“They said they don’t want any trouble from us,” he said. “They said they punished us last year by putting us in jail. This year, the punishment will be this — ” The monk held up a thumb and index finger in the shape of a pistol.Eager for the pretense of calm, government officials handed out nearly $100 to some families in surrounding villages to hold Losar celebrations. But Tibetans came up with a strategy.“A lot of village leaders got together and said, ‘If the government comes around, we’ll tell them that a lot of Tibetans and Chinese were killed in the earthquake last year, so we can’t celebrate now,’ ” said a 31-year-old Tibetan man from the area.He said that not a single firecracker had been heard in his village.'"

"'09-02-26,'0','It’s a challenge many investors face, judging from the amount of cash on the sidelines. According to Fidelity Investments, in September 2007 money market accounts made up 15 percent of stock market capitalization in the United States. By December 2008, it was 40 percent.“In 2008 people took money out of equities and took money out of bond funds,” said Steven Kaplan, a professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago.He cited figures showing that in 2007 investors put $93 billion into equity funds. By contrast, in 2008 they took out $230 billion.Michael Roden, a consultant to the Department of Defense from the Leesburg, Va., area, joined the ranks of the cash rich after a sense of déjà vu washed over him in August 2007, as the markets continued their steep climb. “I had taken quite a bath when the tech bubble burst,” he said. “I would never let that happen again.”With his 2002 drubbing in mind, he started with some profit taking in the summer of 2007, but as the market turned he kept liquidating his investments in an orderly retreat. But he was not quite fast enough.“When Bear Stearns went under I realized something was seriously wrong,” he said. The market was still in the 12,000 range at that time. When the Federal Reserve announced it would back Bear Stearns in March 2008, there was a brief market rebound. “I used that rally to get everything else out,” he said.Mr. Roden said he had taken a 6 percent loss by not liquidating sooner, which still put him ahead of the current total market loss. Now he has about $130,000, with about 10 percent in gold mutual funds, 25 percent in foreign cash funds and the rest in a money market account.“I am looking for parts of the economy where business is not impaired by the credit crunch or changes in consumer behavior,” he said. He is cautiously watching the energy markets, he said, but his chief strategy is “just trying not to lose money.”As chief financial officer of Dewberry Capital in Atlanta, a real estate firm managing two million square feet of offices, stores and apartments, Steve Cesinger witnessed the financial collapse up close. Yet it was just a gut feeling that led him to cash out not only 95 percent of his personal equities, but also those of his firm in April 2007.“I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was happening in the financial industry, and I came to the conclusion that people weren’t fessing up,” he said. “In fact, they were going the other way.”Now, he said, “We have cash on our statement, and it’s hard to know what to do with it.”Having suffered through a real estate market crash in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, Mr. Cesinger is cautious to the point of re-examining the banks where he deposits his cash. “Basically, I’m making sure it’s somewhere it won’t disappear,” he said.The F.D.I.C. assurance doesn’t give him “a lot of warm and fuzzy,” Mr. Cesinger said. “My recollection is, if the institution goes down, it can take you a while to get your money out. It doesn’t help to know you’ll get it one day if you have to pay your mortgage today.”His plan is to re-enter the market when it looks safe. Very safe. “I would rather miss the brief rally, be late to the party and be happy with not a 30 percent return, but a bankable 10 percent return,” he said.Not everyone is satisfied just to stem losses. John Branch, a business consultant in Los Angeles, said his accounts were up 100 percent from short-selling — essentially betting against recovery. “The real killer was, I missed the last leg down on this thing,” Mr. Branch said. “If I hadn’t missed it, I would be up 240 percent.”Mr. Branch said he had seen signs of a bubble in the summer of 2007 and liquidated his stocks, leaving him with cash well into six figures. Then he waited for his chance to begin shorting. The Dow was overvalued, he said, and ripe for a fall.Shorting is a risky strategy, which Mr. Branch readily admits. He said he had tried to limit risk by trading rather than investing. He rises at 4:30 a.m., puts his money in the market and sets up his electronic trading so a stock will automatically sell if it falls by one-half of 1 percent. “If it turns against me, I am out quickly,” he said. By 8, he is off to his regular job.Because Mr. Branch switches his trades daily based on which stocks are changing the fastest, he cannot say in advance where he will put his money.And if he did know, he’d rather not tell. “I hate giving people financial advice,” he said. “If they make money they might say thank you; if they miss the next run-up, they hate you.”'"

Maxx, HomeGoods and Marshalls, rose 7.34 percent, or $1.58, to $23.12 a share, after reporting a 17 percent drop in fourth-quarter profits.The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.93 percent, from 2.80 percent late Tuesday.In Europe, more concerns about Eastern Europe underscored fears that a severe contraction in less-developed economies could ripple through banks in Western Europe and further drag down the global financial system.Following are the results of Wednesday’s Treasury auction of five-year notes and 294-day cash management bills:'"
"'09-02-26,'0','In an attempt to forestall the coup, Mr. Sharif had ordered that an aircraft carrying the head of the army, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, into Pakistan not be allowed to land. The coup succeeded, and Mr. Sharif was convicted on hijacking charges and forced into exile in Saudi Arabia.Mr. Musharraf served as president until last year and appointed the Supreme Court that made the ruling Wednesday under an emergency decree two years ago. Mr. Sharif has called the court illegal. Mr. Zardari has supported it. Their coalition government came apart over the issue last fall. On Wednesday the court also barred Mr. Sharif’s brother, Shahbaz, from holding elected office, leading him to step down immediately as chief minister of the Punjab.Nawaz Sharif denounced the court decision as a politically motivated ruling orchestrated by his archrival, Mr. Zardari. “It’s an edict, not a verdict,” Mr. Sharif said. Without offering proof, he also alleged that Mr. Zardari had tried to offer a business deal to his brother if he supported the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.Hours later, Mr. Zardari retaliated, ordering the governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, a member of the president’s political party, to administer the province for two months until the appointment of a new chief minister.Punjab is the heartland of popular support for the Sharif brothers and is the most populous province in Pakistan.Nawaz Sharif does not enjoy as much popularity in Pakistan’s other three provinces, and one of the tests in the coming weeks will be whether he can muster significant support outside Punjab.The appointment of Mr. Taseer, a major ally of the president, to oversee the province appeared aimed at trying to weaken the hold of the Sharif brothers over the bureaucracy and key law enforcement posts.The ruling by the Supreme Court against the Sharif brothers had been anticipated for weeks. Their assessment that the court decision was political rather than judicial had also been expected. The Pakistan Peoples Party said in a statement that the ruling was “a court decision and has nothing to do with the government.” It urged the Sharif brothers “to control their supporters in the interest of democracy.”A spokeswoman for the government, Sherry Rehman, said, “It’s unfortunate the ferocity of the reaction and the personalized attack on the president has soured the atmosphere.” She urged the Sharif brothers to join the government in the spirit of “reconciliation” to tackle the nation’s economic problems.The standoff between Mr. Zardari and Mr. Sharif was considered so combustible that the “government’s future is uncertain,” said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a columnist for The Daily Times, an English-language newspaper that is owned by Mr. Taseer. But it would take at least a month to see an outcome, he said.The Obama administration, which is currently conferring with the Pakistani government on new strategies to fight the insurgency, would be “very concerned and upset” by the political turmoil, Mr. Rizvi said.The prospect of a popular movement stirred up by Mr. Sharif was worrying because in the past such efforts in Pakistan had “always resulted in a system that isn’t democratic,” Mr. Rizvi said.Among the factors adding to the political volatility were the relative showings of Mr. Zardari and Mr. Sharif in recent public opinion surveys.According to a poll taken in October and released in December by the International Republican Institute, a Washington-based outfit affiliated with the Republican Party, Mr. Sharif’s approval ratings outstripped Mr. Zardari’s by large margins.When asked who they would prefer to have as president, 59 percent of the respondents said they preferred Nawaz Sharif, and 19 percent said they preferred Mr. Zardari.The poll was taken among 3,500 people between Oct. 15 and Oct. 30 in the four provinces of Pakistan, according to Robert Varsalone, the manager of the survey. The margin of error was 1.66 percentage points, he said.After the ruling on Wednesday, Nawaz Sharif said he would join a protest march of the lawyers’ movement on March 12 intended to force the reinstatement of the former chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, whom Mr. Musharraf removed.Mr. Sharif has argued that Mr. Zardari was intent on keeping his replacement, Abdul Hameed Dogar, because Mr. Dogar would leave in place an amnesty on corruption charges that benefited Mr. Zardari. Mr. Zardari rejects the argument and has refused to reappoint Mr. Chaudhry last year.'"
"'09-02-26,'0','Only rarely does one solution solve a lot of problems. One that does — or at least could — is New York’s Bigger Better Bottle Bill. Potentially one of the most productive items on Albany’s legislative menu, the bill would expand the list of cans and bottles that could be redeemed for a nickel. It would include bottles used for noncarbonated and nonalcoholic beverages, such as water, sports drinks and juice.The bill would reduce litter in rivers and on highways, encourage recycling, save on natural resources and help replenish environmental programs whose budgets have been cut during the economic downturn.Right now, a consumer can redeem beer cans and soda bottles for the original nickel deposit. By enlarging the list to include the increasing number of drinks that don’t have bubbles, the Bigger Better Bottle Bill would add as many as five billion more cans and bottles to the nine billion that now carry the nickel deposit.That adds up to a lot of money, but here’s the real bonus. It’s what the bill says about the so-called missing nickels. Right now, when consumers pay a nickel per bottle upfront and then fail to redeem that bottle, the forgone nickel goes to the beverage industry. The stores obviously deserve a reasonable handling fee, but the beverage companies, which have powerful friends in Albany, deserve less than the windfall they are getting now.The latest bill would reroute a large chunk of this money to the state’s Environmental Protection Fund — which, among other things, helps purchase open space. Gov. David Paterson estimates that the missing nickels could bring in $118 million a year for the environment; the Container Recycling Institute, which studies such matters, says that revenue could reach $218 million.There is a balance to this deal. Those who can afford the extra nickel per drink and don’t redeem the bottles help pay to maintain a cleaner state. Those who can’t afford the 5 cents and need to redeem their containers not only get their nickel back but assure that the cans and bottles get recycled.'"

"'09-02-27,'0','WASHINGTON — The Senate approved a bill on Thursday to provide the nation’s capital with a voting representative in the House, but it came with a hitch. A controversial amendment was added that would repeal most of the city’s gun-control regulations.Approved by a 61-to-37 vote, the D.C. House Voting Rights Act would expand the House for the first time since 1913, providing a vote for Washington and an additional seat for Utah, which narrowly missed getting one after the last census.The measure is likely to end up in the courts, however, even if a similar bill passes the House, as is expected next week. President Obama has said he will sign the legislation.The gun amendment makes the Senate measure significantly different from the bill in the House, which could slow passage. However, some members of Congress said the amendment was unlikely to survive the negotiations between the House and Senate over a final version of the bill.The amendment was a major victory for the pro-gun lobby, which has battled against the city’s tough gun laws.'"
"'09-02-27,'0','CHICAGO — The 250 workers who staged a December sit-in at a Chicago window factory to protest losing their jobs were celebrating Thursday, after another window manufacturer announced plans to reopen the plant and start hiring back the displaced workers within months.The sale of what had been Republic Windows and Doors to a California company, Serious Materials, for $1.45 million, was completed in bankruptcy court this week, with company officials promising United Electrical Workers Local 1110 to rehire all the laid-off workers at their former rate of pay.“We see this opportunity to expand our operations in direct relation to the stimulus package, which includes the greening of federal buildings and the weatherization assistance program,” said Sandra Vaughan, the chief marketing officer for Serious Materials, which also manufactures energy-efficient windows and building products in Boulder, Colo., and Vandergrift, Pa.Ms. Vaughan said it could take months to get the company’s equipment up and running in Chicago, but to former Republic Windows workers like Armando Robles, a father of five who lost his health insurance in January, the prospect of the factory’s reopening was “a dream come true.”“They are promising to hire all of us back sooner or later, but they will start with a small crew,” said Mr. Robles, 39, who had been a maintenance technician. “Having another company reopen the factory was always our hope when we occupied the factory in December.”Serious Materials’ acquisition of the 125,000-square-foot warehouse that housed Republic Windows comes just days after Republic Windows’ former owner, Rich Gillman, ceased operations at his new window plant in Red Oak, Iowa. Mr. Gillman opened that factory late last year as a nonunion plant, after abruptly shuttering the one in Chicago.'"
"'09-02-27,'0','All told, the show is an eyeful.The Brücke artists were among the Peter Pans of Modernism. They refused to grow up or pipe down. Their art had a palpable Dada swagger before Dada, but their dreams had not yet been trammeled by World War I. Theirs was still a fairly cheerful barbarism. They were wary of the alienation and fragmentation of city life. At least until they relocated to Berlin in 1911, they thought they could regain what was good and natural if they just took off their clothes, danced around a bit and made art. Their idea of a good time was a communal painting session using several nude models who didn’t assume static poses, but lounged or cavorted at will.They began by mixing together some Jugendstil, bits and pieces of Impressionism, Post-Impressionism and Fauvism, along with a soupçon of Arts & Crafts. (Kirchner took up tapestry weaving and introduced the group to woodcut printmaking, one of its strengths. He also made his own furniture, none of which is in the show. The most visible signs of the group’s handicraft are the marvelous frames Pechstein carved for two of his paintings here.) The Brücke artists, like Picasso and Matisse, learned crucial lessons from Oceanic and African sculpture, and from peasant and children’s art.They networked energetically, soliciting members, including their hero Edvard Munch, who declined. They enlisted a group of “passive” members who contributed financially in return for a yearly portfolio of prints. They organized a total of 70 exhibitions that toured more than 30 Germany cities. In 1913 the group commissioned Kirchner to write its history. When it was rejected as too Kirchner-centered, the author resigned, and the group dissolved, ending the Brücke era.The show, installed thematically with most works made in 1909 or later, offers only a glancing notion of how the Brücke became the Brücke. Still, it took the group’s members time to get their artistic act together, and if you connect the dates, you understand something of their path to maturity.Among the show’s three galleries of paintings, that path is clearest in the one titled “Experience of Nature.” The show’s only painting from 1905 is Heckel’s charming “River Landscape With Bridge and Train,” whose coarsened dabs of paint suggest van Gogh looking at Monet. Kirchner’s nearby “Trees in Autumn” (the only painting from 1906) is all jangly nerve: van Gogh smashing into Cézanne, with a bit of Chaim Soutine foreshadowed. Also here: Pechstein’s “Red Fisherman’s House” suggests Munch’s thin, stained paint in van Gogh’s hands, while his 1908 “March Snow” is mostly van Gogh, except for the preponderance of pale lavender.Schmidt-Rottluff’s “Corner of a Park” from 1910 is classic Expressionist: a broad, red road heaves between clumps of blue, green and yellow. But it is Kirchner who pushes furthest, with black boats outlined in red parked on a pea-soup Elbe; in a landscape of crowded patches of greens and blues (including light turquoise) edged in black rickrack scribbles; and especially in a painting of a big pink lighthouse seen from a gull’s-eye view, against a sharply curved horizon. The planet seems too small for this amazing structure.In “Urban Transformation” you see Kirchner’s rapid maturation between 1908 and 1914, especially in street scenes done in Dresden, with softer, Munch-like figures, and in Berlin, with splintery, spiky figures. He hovers between the two options in “Dodo and Her Brother,” started in 1908. In shades of green, yellow, black and red, it shows a man and a woman dressed for an evening out: she is self-possessed, steady. He, with a green face, is a spectral puppeteer. Another treat here: a wall of paintings of town and/or country by Heckel, Pechstein and Kirchner in which each artist’s scrappiness achieves its own distinct discord, barely held together.Often the standout paintings have the economy of woodcuts, as proved by “Communal Studio,” with its array of nudes, portraits and interiors. The four cavorting nudes of Heckel’s “Studio Scene” of 1910-11 might almost be little paper dolls pasted to the surface.Even sparer is his larger “Young Girl With Doll” of 1911, where the doll’s black skirt cuts across the pelvis of the young, nude model like a knife, but also provides some cover. The subject, the 13-year-old Fränzi Fehrmann, was a studio favorite; she also appears in several adjacent paintings by Kirchner, including the colorful and jazzily painted “Fränzi in Front of Carved Chair.”Kirchner is particularly economical in a full-length portrait of Milly, an African model, and his double portrait of Otto Mueller (who shared much of the Brücke style but only joined its ranks in 1911) and his wife, Maschka. But he’s a spendthrift in “Two Nudes” and “Portrait of a Man (Hans Frisch),” both large, mottled and from around 1907. Here he mixes up a pastiche of Seurat, van Gogh and Matisse and ladles it on with a palette knife.Luckily, this section also includes some of Kirchner’s sculpture: an expressive head and two nudes in carved wood. Here rawness coexists with nuance, distortion with a real sense of gesture and emotion. These works truly dance, and offer further proof that Kirchner’s phenomenal career is a mine of exhibition possibilities.The Brücke approach to art lacked Cubism’s structural clarity or maybe any structure at all. But the movement’s rowdy leaders compensated with attitude, abandon and an unrepentant faith in artworks that were as much events as objects, collisions of a certain personality in a certain mood with a certain kind of material and image.This volatile mixture has been the special pride of German artists ever since, among them Sigmar Polke, Martin Kippenberger and John Bock. But it guides artists everywhere, not just bad boys, in mediums the Brücke never dreamed of.'"
"'09-02-27,'0','A.I.G. promised to sell assets to pay off the $60 billion loan. That always seemed like an ambitious goal given the troubled state of the economy and financial markets. Many potential buyers are short of capital. And no buyer is going to offer top dollar for an asset when they know the seller is under pressure.A.I.G. has already sold assets for $2.2 billion — including its private bank, its life insurance business in Canada, the HSB Group, Unibanco and some other units. MetLife made a preliminary offer of $11.2 billion for the American Life Insurance Company, according to news reports — an asset that last fall might have fetched nearer to $20 billion.That $2.2 billion doesn’t move the needle much. And the sales of A.I.G.’s most valuable assets seem to be stalled or are, like its life insurance business in the United States, bringing in disappointing offers.If buyers just don’t have the cash, A.I.G. could hand businesses over to the government as a way of repaying its bailout. But government ownership of operating businesses isn’t a good idea, and fairly valuing them could be tricky. Interested buyers could perhaps buy some A.I.G. units for stock, but then the government could end up owning those interests, too.So much for the loan. The government’s equity investment also looks like a loser. A.I.G.’s troubles selling assets and the low offers are forcing it to put more businesses up for sale than it originally anticipated. That means there is likely to be even less left for shareholders.Stock market investors seem to agree that A.I.G. does not have enough assets to cover its private and government liabilities. The outstanding shares the government doesn’t own are worth only $1.5 billion or so.That means the government’s approximately 80 percent interest, for which it paid $40 billion, is now worth only about $6 billion. Even if A.I.G. does pay back the government’s $60 billion loan and the “bad bank” vehicles break even, the implication is that, at best, a quarter of taxpayers’ $150 billion won’t be coming back.Meanwhile, the insurer still had $92 billion of privately held debt on its balance sheet as of the end of September. If the government were to inject more funds into it as preferred or common stock, taxpayers would be behind those lenders in the long line for A.I.G.’s assets. All that suggests that giving the company more cash or guarantees would be throwing good money after bad.Of course, A.I.G.’s well-known and widespread role as an insurer may convince the government that it shouldn’t be allowed to go under. But for taxpayers’ sake, remaining shareholders and other creditors need to shoulder part of the cost. Creditors and trading partners have, after all, had nearly six months since the original bailout to reduce or hedge their exposure. If there’s a way to cauterize A.I.G.’s wounds, the pain of doing so should be shared.'"
"'09-02-27,'0','Superintendents and school board members at several local districts said that the audits had tightened financial controls and had made employees at every level more careful about spending taxpayer money, but that they also took up a lot of time and resources. Some also complained that the audits could be too focused on relatively minor infractions and accusatory in tone.“For the most part it was helpful, but in some areas we felt that they took gratuitous shots at the district in a way that was self-serving for the comptroller’s office,” said Alan B. Groveman, superintendent of the Connetquot district on Long Island.The audit cited Connetquot’s multimillion-dollar surplus as evidence of lax budget oversight, but Dr. Groveman said the district had been purposely trying to build up reserves.“Our explanations were ignored,” he said. “They said it was poor budget planning, and we said it was intentional. It would be dumb and inappropriate to spend every dollar we budgeted just because it’s budgeted.”Complicating the audit process is a lawsuit by the state’s charter schools, which are publicly financed but independently operated, arguing that the state comptroller lacks the authority to investigate them. An appellate court ruled in favor of the state last month, but the charters are appealing the case. Mr. DiNapoli has suspended audits of charter schools until the case is resolved.The state comptroller routinely audited school districts until the 1970s, when budget cuts led the office to limit them to a handful a year. The new law, passed in 2005, came with $5.4 million to hire 90 new auditors, and two years later, another $2.4 million for 45 more. In addition, nearly every district is required to submit an independent audit, using local funds, to both the comptroller and the state’s Education Department.The state auditors started with districts where they had received complaints about financial problems, then selected others randomly. A typical audit lasts about 40 work days. William Reynolds, a spokesman for Mr. DiNapoli, said that “school officials are given ample opportunity to respond to these audits, and their responses are included in the audit reports for the public to see.”In the Grand Island district, northwest of Buffalo, an auditor sat in a spare room near the business office from June until December last year, reading through attendance records, purchasing orders and payroll accounts. At the auditor’s suggestion, the district has started requiring school employees who travel for workshops or conferences to submit the agendas along with reimbursement requests.“It’s not gross change; it’s fine-tuning, what we should be doing anyway,” said Robert W. Christmann, the superintendent.Mr. Christmann said that he and other superintendents had paid attention as their neighbors were audited to make sure they did not make the same mistakes, and were generally being more careful with their finances and record-keeping. He said he had noticed more sign-in sheets at educational meetings across the state lately that people were “signing because at some point you may be asked to prove that you were there.”Because of the sheer size of the New York City school system, the comptroller has been auditing those schools on an continuing basis. Recent reports have cited inaccurate records of textbook inventories and special education services and inconsistent use of green cleaning products required by law.Robert N. Lowry Jr., deputy director of the New York State Council of School Superintendents, said the audits have too narrow a focus because they look only at compliance rather than larger fiscal issues. For instance, he said, state law prohibits districts from putting more than 4 percent of their budget into a general reserve fund — a cap that school officials have said could hamper their ability to avert budget problems in the future.“It would be helpful if state leaders like the comptroller would question some of these mandates and restrictions,” Mr. Lowry said. “If you do these audits and criticize districts for failing to comply with all these detailed requirements, it reinforces the presumption that they all make sense. In some cases, it would be missing the forest for the trees in terms of what would be most helpful to taxpayers.”Mr. DiNapoli said the purpose of the audits was to evaluate compliance and not to debate policy, though his auditors also assess districts financial condition and suggest ways to save like turning off computers at night. In addition, the auditors will review criminal background checks of employees.In Vestal, auditors found that district laptops had been used to play children’s games and casino games, and in one case, to visit pornography sites. Vestal officials said that the administrator responsible for the laptop had lent the laptop to a family member who then used it inappropriately off school property.After auditors found that the Niagara Falls district had overpaid employees, they were asked to repay the money or give up days off. Cynthia Bianco, the interim superintendent, said the audit was helpful but used overly harsh language in presenting its findings.“I think a lot of it was instructive, but the tone of it was almost accusatory,” said Mrs. Bianco, who added that many of the issues cited were corrected before the audit was released. “We agreed with much of what was said in the audit. It’s been years since there was this kind of oversight, and many laws have changed during that period.”'"
"'09-02-27,'0','BEIJING — Chinese authorities reacted caustically on Thursday to an annual State Department report on global human rights that called China’s respect for rights not only “poor,” but also worsening in its persecution of ethnic minorities and dissidents.The state news agency Xinhua called the report’s section on China groundless and irresponsible, saying it “willfully ignored and distorted basic facts” about human rights conditions and the nation’s ethnic, legal and religious systems. “The report turned a blind eye to the efforts and historic achievements China has made in human rights that have been widely recognized by the international community,” the Xinhua statement said. It called the annual report an American pretext for interfering in the domestic affairs of other nations.The State Department document was issued just days after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, in her first official visit to China, said publicly that American concern over China’s human rights practices would not impede cooperation on strategic issues like the economic crisis and global warming. Human rights groups and some others expressed dismay at her remarks, which they said undercut the United States’ ability to influence China’s human rights policies and its treatment of dissidents and other persecuted individuals.At the release of the report on Wednesday, Karen B. Stewart, the State Department’s senior human rights official, said that the document’s pointed criticism of China’s record neither ran counter to Mrs. Clinton’s remarks nor was likely to damage cooperation between the nations.As for China’s reaction, she said, “I think we’ll have a full dialogue with the Chinese on all areas” of policy.'"
"'09-02-27,'0','In a statement after the settlement, Mr. Rohner said, “It is apparent that as an organization, we made mistakes and that our control systems were inadequate.”As part of the settlement, UBS agreed to disclose the names of 250 clients from the United States to American authorities, undercutting decades of the traditional bank secrecy for which Switzerland is famous. The I.R.S. is now pressing the bank to divulge the identifies of up to 52,000 Americans who had tried to take advantage of offshore accounts.On Monday, Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, the Swiss Justice minister, is set to meet in Washington with Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general of the United States, to discuss the case.The chairman of UBS, Peter Kurer, said Thursday that Mr. Rohner, 44, had told directors in January that he intended to step down after UBS’s broader effort to reduce risk, restructure its investment bank to become profitable again and refocus UBS on the wealth management business.With the appointment of Mr. Grübel, 65, UBS is trying to put both the tax scandal and the $53 billion in subprime-related write-down behind it, while delivering the fundamental break with the past that Swiss shareholders and other have been demanding.Last fall, the Swiss National Bank was forced to come to the aid of UBS, agreeing to buy $39.1 billion in so-called toxic assets, removing them from UBS’s balance sheet. The central bank also gave UBS a $6 billion injection of cash.Analysts praised the return of Mr. Grübel, one of the few globally known bankers left untarnished by the financial crisis. “Grübel is one of the few executives pretty much worldwide who have real experience turning around an investment bank,” said Dirk Hoffmann-Becking, an analyst with Bernstein Research in London.Mr. Grübel, who fled East Germany as a child, started at Deutsche Bank in 1961. Ten years later, he joined an investment banking unit of Credit Suisse, where he started as a bond trader in Zurich. He was chief executive from 2004 to 2007.At Credit Suisse, his success came by focusing the firm on a few core strengths like underwriting, equity trading and advice on mergers and acquisitions, Mr. Hoffmann-Becking said. He was also known for keeping a lid on expenses in an industry known for excess.As an outsider in UBS’s close-knit executive suite, Mr. Grübel will not have an easy time repeating his success at Credit Suisse. His boss, Mr. Kurer, served in top management roles during both the tax and subprime debacles, and is known for his keen command of UBS’s sprawling bureaucracy. Mr. Kurer became chairman last April after Marcel Ospel stepped down amid the subprime losses.Also, Credit Suisse and UBS are rivals. “It’s very strange because Credit Suisse and UBS are competitors and they hate each other,” said Charles Wyplosz, director of the International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies in Geneva. “They are the two big institutions in a small pond, they are constantly competing, one against the other.”'"

"'09-02-28,'0','Re “The Big Test Before College? Filling Out the Financial Aid Form” (front page, Feb. 22):As the parent of a high school senior, I was faced this year with the daunting task of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. I was fortunate to know about College Goal Sunday, a nonprofit program that provides free information and assistance to families applying for financial assistance for higher education.In January, I attended a session at a local high school. We were given a list of materials we should bring, if available. We were then walked through a worksheet, one question at a time, with ample opportunity to ask for clarification. As a result, this daunting project became easy to do.I filled in the online form the next day, only having to add a handful of exact figures once our tax returns had been completed. I would like to express my gratitude to College Goal Sunday for making my life just a little easier in these tough times.Yes, by all means let’s simplify the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. But let’s also commit ourselves to putting the emphasis in awarding financial aid back on aiding financially needy students.The free application is intended to provide a common framework for assessing a student’s ability to pay for college — to award need-based financial aid. But over the last two decades, colleges and universities, and the states and the federal government, have been shifting financial aid away from need and toward merit.While “merit aid” sounds good, it is aid awarded to those who probably have more ability to pay for a college education. And that means less aid is available for those without the ability to pay.'"
"'09-02-28,'0','TEJADA WILL PLAY IN W.B.C. Houston Astros shortstop Miguel Tejada has changed his mind and will play for the Dominican Republic in the World Baseball Classic. Tejada said earlier this week that he had decided to skip the event because the Dominican team had asked him to play first base. The Astros said Friday that he reconsidered and would most likely be used at shortstop, third base and as a designated hitter.PHILLIES RELEASE EATON The right-handed pitcher Adam Eaton was released by Philadelphia, which owes him $9 million.Eaton, 31, originally selected by the Phillies in the first round of the 1996 amateur draft, was 10-10 with a 6.29 earned run average in 2007, his first season after agreeing to a three-year contract worth $24.5 million.He won the fifth starter’s spot in spring training last year but was 3-8 with a 5.71 E.R.A. in mid-July and accepted a minor league assignment after the All-Star break. He finished 4-8 with a 5.80 E.R.A. in 19 starts and 2 relief appearances. He was left off the postseason roster for the second straight year. Any club can sign Eaton for the $400,000 minimum, with the Phillies paying the rest of what he is due.DYKSTRA’S SON IMPRESSES Cutter Dykstra drove in a run with a double and scored in his first action in a big league uniform, helping the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Oakland Athletics, 8-5, in Phoenix.“I remember going with my dad to the Mets’ camp when I was in the seventh grade and was sitting near the on-deck circle thinking, Maybe one day I’ll be out there,” said Dykstra, the 19-year-old son of Lenny Dykstra. “I’ve tried to model my game after him. I want to leave the field with people saying, ‘He plays the game just like his dad.’ My dad played the game right.”JOHNSON’S DEBUT WITH GIANTS Kansas City catcher Miguel Olivo attempted to steal home against Randy Johnson, but Johnson threw him out to end his spring debut with the San Francisco Giants. Kansas City scored one run in two innings off Johnson. Ryan Shealy was hit by a pitch to lead off the second inning and scored on Mitch Maier’s groundout.“Other than the senior moment I had with my splitter by hitting the first batter and throwing another one in the dirt, I felt pretty good, considering the last two years at this time I wasn’t pitching in games,” Johnson said.'"
"'09-02-28,'0','Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Budget Committee, said Mr. Obama’s call to raise federal dollars by limiting income tax deductions for families earning above $250,000 might have to be rethought. “That may be a bridge too far,” Mr. Conrad said.Other lawmakers and some advocacy groups warned that the limits could cut donations to already struggling charities by reducing the value of deductions for contributions from donors in the upper tax brackets.While most Americans would get a slight tax cut under Mr. Obama’s plan, the budget would also allow Bush-era tax breaks for the wealthy to expire. Some Democrats said they were uneasy about that as the country struggled to end a recession.“I am certain that it is going to be very difficult and doesn’t work to be raising taxes in a time when we are experiencing major adjustments in our economy,” Senator Nelson said.Administration officials emphasized their push to halve the deficit in Mr. Obama’s first term and noted that the central tax increases would not take effect for two years, when a rebound of the economy is expected to be under way. Some Democrats said that seemed acceptable when balanced against the tax cuts for the middle class.“The increases in most cases, as I see it, restore the tax burden that existed in 2000,” said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota. “And it seems a perfectly reasonable thing to do.”Representative Steve Cohen, another Tennessee Democrat, said: “People want to see equity and fairness. You have to have some taxes to balance the budget. You can’t have all the services that are required — defense, energy, education, health care — and not have taxes.”Leaders of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of House Democrats who push against deficit spending, called the budget “a good starting point” and indicated they would argue for deficit reduction, a position shared by Mr. Conrad.“Cutting the deficit in half in the first five years is the right order of magnitude,” Mr. Conrad said. “The investments in reducing our dependence on foreign energy, excellence in education and health care reform are right on target in terms of priorities.”But while there was general support among Democrats for the broad outlines, specific provisions are already dividing the party, in some cases exposing longstanding policy rifts that tend to cut along geographic rather than party lines.Mr. Conrad said he was troubled by a proposal that would eliminate so-called direct payment farm subsidies for producers with more than $250,000 in revenues. (A threshold of $500,000 in revenues, widely reported earlier, was an incorrect figure given in the printed version of the president’s budget summary.) The current cap on eligibility is $750,000 in farm income; Mr. Obama’s plan could end subsidies for farmers who have high revenues but no income after expenses.But Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the Agriculture Committee, said he was pleased that Mr. Obama was moving to curtail a subsidy program Mr. Harkin had long opposed. “I have never been a fan of direct payments,” the senator said.To some, the debate was reminiscent of 1993, when President Bill Clinton narrowly forced through a five-year economic plan that raised taxes, limited military spending and funneled money to favored Democratic initiatives.Republicans stood united in their opposition and ended up wresting control of Congress from the Democrats in 1994.But Democrats and others say the comparison is flawed because there was no economic crisis when Mr. Clinton increased gas taxes and raised income tax rates on affluent Americans. In addition, Congressional Democrats were unraveling in 1993, while in the November election, the party increased its majority in both chambers.Republicans, while raising objections to the budget plan, did credit the White House for a bold proposal that laid down a clear ideological marker. “They are really swinging for the fences,” said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota.Mr. Cooper said the budget was a provocative plan that could spur needed debate in Congress about just what the government pays for and how it pays for it. “We have an opportunity to find federal programs that are wasteful and eliminate them,” he said. “I am ready to do that in programs big and small.”Representative Charlie Melancon, a Blue Dog Democrat from south Louisiana, said he had already begun explaining to wealthy constituents that the looming tax increases represented a rebalancing after President George W. Bush’s tax cuts.“Why do they want to tax the rich?” he said, quoting some of his well-off constituents who benefited from the Bush tax cuts. “I said because they gave you all your money back for a couple of years.”Mr. Melancon said he believed that honest budgeting would eventually lead to fiscal responsibility. “It’s not going to be a fun period in my life nor anyone else that’s in the Congress,” he said. “But we must do these things to reform the spending habits of the federal government.”'"
"'09-02-28,'0','“The game had become heavily reliant on one-on-one and two-on-two basketball,” said Stu Jackson, the league’s executive vice president for basketball operations. “The game was not being played the way most experts felt it should be played and that a more free-flowing, up-tempo type of game should be showcased.”Dismayed by the slowed game and sluggish scoring, the N.B.A.’s competition committee convened in Phoenix, looking to pick up the pace. Owners endorsed changes that trimmed the time allotted to move the ball to the frontcourt to 8 seconds from 10 and eliminated the illegal-defense rules.“No one knew what illegal defense was,” said Jerry Colangelo, a former owner of the Suns who was the chairman of the committee. “It was kind of left to the eye of the beholder.”Zone defense, widely used in high school and college basketball, was also introduced with a significant caveat. The committee instituted a three-second rule for defenders in order to prevent teams from parking taller players in the post. The goal was to free the lanes and encourage cuts and drives through the paint.With those changes, among other factors, offenses have opened up, and scoring has climbed. Teams are averaging 99.7 points a game this season, up from 94.8 in 2000-1, the season before the new rules were introduced. Still, the zone defense has not been embraced in the N.B.A. It is mildly effective in spurts, but often dismissed.“When you see it in the league, they do it because they can’t guard somebody,” Quentin Richardson of the Knicks said. “If they’re having a hard time stopping this person or that person or a team in general, and they can’t do anything, teams play zone.”The laundry list of the zone’s shortcomings in the N.B.A. is relatively deep. Long-range shooters are truer in the N.B.A. than at any other level, and open shots are more easily found in the holes of zone defenses. N.B.A. players are better passers, so it is easier for them to whip the ball around the court to find the open man. Teams can grab offensive rebounds more effectively against a zone because opposing players have no set assignments on block-outs.Asked how much zone defense the Cavaliers used, Cleveland Coach Mike Brown said none.“It almost says, Hey, we can’t guard these guys,” Brown said. “To a certain degree, psychologically, it makes you feel like you’re conceding, and it could be a downer if it doesn’t work.”Beyond that, some say that N.B.A. coaches are hesitant to install a zone defense simply because they do not have a longstanding history with it or an encompassing knowledge of its intricacies.“You still have a lot of coaches, general managers and assistant coaches that are old-school former players,” Lakers guard Derek Fisher said. “And the league is based on solid man-to-man principles. That’s how they were taught the game. That’s how they grew up playing the game. And it’s difficult trying to teach something that you don’t necessarily have a great feel for yourself.”Earlier this season, the Denver Nuggets looked to add wrinkles to their defense, and briefly experimented with zone defenses.“We practiced one for one week, and it was awful,” Nuggets Coach George Karl said.The Nets, the Golden State Warriors and the Dallas Mavericks are among the teams incorporating zone defenses to throw offenses off their rhythm or to guard an inbounds pass.“You spend time teaching your zone and cleaning up your zone,” Nets Coach Lawrence Frank said. “But unless you’re totally committed to zone, you’re not going to spend nearly as much time on zone as you do your man defense. There’s not enough time in the N.B.A. workweek.”When a team switches to a zone, its opponent can become somewhat flustered. Most N.B.A. teams continue using the offense they would have used against a man-to-man defense.The reason? If teams do not have enough time to practice a zone defense, they surely do not have time to introduce offenses to attack it.“When teams do zone, offensively, we’re not ready for it,” Atlanta Hawks Coach Mike Woodson said. “That’s the crazy part behind it. Because you don’t see zone that much, when you do see it, you’re caught off guard.”Karl said: “My zone offense is to put three guys on the court who can make 3s and have them make a couple.”But for Jackson, the N.B.A. executive vice president, how much teams use the zone is irrelevant. The goal was to open the floor and encourage a more balanced game.“Our game today is more five-man orientated,” Jackson said. “The game looks better. There’s not as much standing around.”'"
"'09-02-28,'0','Q. Which hotel brands do you work with and what is your business arrangement with them?A. We do all the One & Only hotels and all the Leela hotels in India. We do most Peninsulas, a lot of Ritz-Carltons, we work with Mandarin Oriental, Four Seasons, Bulgari. We have an operating contract for a period of usually about 15 years, and we get a base fee and a percentage on turnover and profit.Q. Why did you sell 40 percent of Espa to Istithmar World Capital, a private equity arm of Dubai World, last year?A. The spa industry isn’t as profitable as people think, and to manufacture very high-quality products is also expensive. It’s not like mass toiletries. So we built the infrastructure of our company and our team and our global presence very slowly and very solidly. When Istithmar approached us, we felt that the opportunity to maximize that a little bit quicker would make it much easier.Q. How is the recession affecting Espa’s business?A. We decided to go out and see all our clients, because our clients are huge international developers. We wanted to work out which sites were literally happening. The sites that were in planning that are on hold while they refinance are Kazakhstan, Costa Rica, Dubai, Macao, Las Vegas.The recession is the worst I’ve ever seen because it’s so totally global. There’s not a market that hasn’t been affected. I don’t have a client that’s not affected.Clever developers are doing the design phases of everything, of the whole resort, and then they’re waiting because they think all bids from construction companies will go down. They may wait for another year or two. Projects have been canceled altogether because they can’t be financed or the company’s gone down. We have 10 projects that are on hold temporarily, there are probably 10 that have gone permanently, but then we gained others in December, in London, Marrakesh, Paris and another in Las Vegas. And 11 spas are opening in 2009.Q. What are the trends now in the spa business?A. More people are going to spas in groups. There’s an increase in male treatments, a lot of our city spas are 45 percent men. We’re seeing the medi-spa. In the States, it does noninvasive procedures including fillers, microdermabrasion, Botox. We’re seeing a big increase in spa cuisine.Q. What treatment do you recommend for stressed-out Americans?A. What I recommend is they don’t do this thing of running in for a 50-minute massage and then running out back to the office, which does them no good whatsoever. What we’ve found in the United States is that once somebody has felt the physiological advantage of using a steam room or heated jet pool, having a little sleep with an herbal tea, having a massage and having another little sleep, they just feel so totally different that they start then to think in a different way. You’ve got to try and slow people down and ground them.'"
"'09-02-28,'0','The other controversial video in the Turin show, “Usine,” depicting a fight among scorpions, snakes and spiders, as well as roosters and dogs, was also shot in Mexico, where animal fighting is legal. It is a crime in Italy, which has strict laws regarding the treatment of animals. “Usine” (the title means factory in French) and some of the other works protested in Turin are among those to be shown in New York.“It’s inopportune to show such things,” said Domenico Mangone, Turin’s environment councilor, who sent the videos to the prosecutor’s office. “It could induce people to imitate them.” For now, signs posted throughout the foundation warn that the works could be upsetting to some viewers (should there ever be any).Some have suggested that inviting this controversial artist was little more than a publicity stunt to generate buzz around the foundation, a private center for contemporary art that opened in a working-class neighborhood here in 2002. But Mr. Bonami dismissed such assertions.“The fact is that you never know what is going to trigger a reaction in contemporary art,” he said.He emphasized that the violence was committed by others, and that the animals would have died whether the artist had borne witness to the deaths or not.Irene Calderoni, a junior curator at the foundation, said: “All of Adel’s works engage the visitor with a strong emotional reaction — that’s what he does. He’s raw.”Given that images of violence are prevalent in society today, from cartoons to movies to video games, she said, Mr. Abdessemed is “merely trying to touch the reality of violence in an unmediated way.” Themes of displacement, exile and failed immigration policies in Europe also figure prominently in Mr. Abdessemed’s work. Several photographs in the Turin show depict wild animals on a Paris street, an artistic reflection on the situation of the immigrant as an unwelcome guest in Europe.“They play on the idea of fear, the stranger who is threatening among us,” Ms. Calderoni said of the photographs of lions, wild boars and snakes on a Parisian sidewalk. “They are totally out of place, just as any immigrant is.”Some animal-rights groups objected more to those images than to the videos showing animals being clubbed to death. “If African animals were forced to travel 1,000 kilometers for an installation in the city center of Paris, it should be condemned,” said Gualtiero Crovesio of the Italian Anti-Vivisection League, one of the groups protesting the show.“We are against the use of animals for artistic ends,” he said. “If he tampered with the lives of animals, if he had a hand in their existence, then before he is an artist, he is someone who mistreats animals.”Mr. Crovesio said that if Mr. Abdessemed wanted to denounce the practice of butchering animals, he should replace “Don’t Trust Me” with one of the anti-vivisection group’s far more gruesome slaughterhouse videos. “Though of course they are not art,” he acknowledged.The foundation can expect vigorous protests if the show is allowed to proceed, Mr. Crovesio said. A recent such protest in Italy turned nasty: so-called ecoterrorists attacked a bird sanctuary about 20 miles from Turin this week with Molotov cocktails, burning down structures and setting dozens of birds free. It was an unusually violent act in this northern Italian region.The Turin prosecutor examining the foundation’s case could not be reached, but Mr. Bonami said he expected a decision soon.He said he was unsure whether the foundation would shut down the show or substitute other works if criminal wrongdoing were established. “I think it’s an important show, a vehicle to say a lot about present-day reality, and I’d rather see it remain untouched,” he said.But Mr. Bonami, who is chief curator for the next Whitney Biennial, scheduled for March 2010 in New York, said the outcry had made him think twice about inviting Mr. Abdessemed to show at the Whitney Museum of American Art. “I don’t want to terrify the institution,” he said.'"
"'09-02-28,'0','Since Alice Tully Hall is actually part of the Juilliard School building, it was only fitting that the school’s students and faculty figure into the hall’s reopening festivities. Some of Juilliard’s players performed in the opening sampler concert on Sunday, and on Wednesday afternoon, the school presented a Schubert chamber concert. But its main contribution was a Thursday evening performance of Messiaen’s work “Des Canyons aux Étoiles” — “From the Canyons to the Stars” — by the Juilliard Orchestra, with David Robertson conducting.It was an inspired choice. Alice Tully commissioned the piece, which had its premiere in 1974 at the hall named for her, long before any of the students who played on Thursday were born. The work has taken on a life of its own since then; you can find it now on a handful of recordings. And with Mr. Robertson, an expert Messiaen conductor at the helm, it was a worthy contribution to the Messiaen centenary celebrations that have taken place all season.If you’re looking for music to test both an orchestra’s mettle and a hall’s acoustics, this 12-movement score has everything: as a way of evoking natural grandeur and his own peculiar brand of Roman Catholic mysticism, Messiaen packed the work with kaleidoscopic percussion writing, themes built on a vast catalog of bird songs (commonplace and exotic) and technically demanding material for every section of the ensemble.Textures are often startlingly transparent, yet Messiaen was not reluctant to marshal a solid mass of sound, as he did in the choralelike passages of the finale, or in much of the third movement, “Ce Qui Est Écrit sur les Étoiles” (“What Is Written in the Stars”). The Juilliard players maintained those distinctions faithfully for Mr. Robertson.The score also includes two entrancing movements for solo piano — the honors were split here, with equal deftness, by Matthew Odell and Conor Hanick — and a perilous movement for solo horn. The horn movement, “Appel Interstellaire” (“Interstellar Call”), is particularly striking, because it requires a hornist to produce an array of colors and textures, from haunting, muted pianissimos to gritty loud passages and gracefully singing lines. And it keeps the hornist on the spot for nearly eight minutes. Molly Norcross, the orchestra’s principal hornist, gave a magnificent performance: precise, passionate and supple.All this taxed the hall in ways very different from the early-music, chamber concerts and small orchestral works that have been heard in it so far. The orchestra used a fully extended stage configuration, and because parts of the score are both loud and sharp-edged — there is lots of high piccolo and pitched percussion writing — 18 sound-absorbing panels (nine on each side of the hall) were deployed to soak up some of the sound.'"
"'09-02-28,'0','For the first time since the Depression, General Electric will cut its dividend, striving to preserve cash in uncertain times, the company announced on Friday.Starting in July, the quarterly dividend will drop to 10 cents a share from 31 cents — a powerful signal that one of the nation’s most profitable corporations does not anticipate a quick end to a recession that has deepened rapidly and spread worldwide.“We believe it is the right precautionary action at this time to further strengthen our company for the long term, while still providing an attractive dividend,” Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chairman, said in a statement.Dividend cuts are usually announced closer to the effective date, but downward pressure on the company’s stock and concern that the main rating agencies — Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service — would lower the company’s credit rating prompted the early announcement, analysts said.Shares of G.E. fell 59 cents, to $8.51. As the credit crisis and recession have unfolded, the stock price has fallen from $30 a share in the late summer. The company’s giant lending arm, GE Capital, has been hit hard, but the recession is also eating into profits from the conglomerate’s industrial operations.'"
"'09-02-28,'0','PARIS — Two American employees of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing were among nine people killed when a Turkish Airlines jet fumbled its landing at Amsterdam international airport on Wednesday and crashed into a field just short of the runway, officials said on Friday.A third Boeing employee was among 63 people still in hospital in the Netherlands, while the company was still awaiting confirmation of the condition of the fourth, according to Samantha Solomon, a Boeing spokeswoman in London.Earlier this week Boeing identified its four employees as Ronald A. Richey, John Salman, Ricky E. Wilson and Michael T. Hemmer, all from the Seattle region. On Friday Boeing declined to specify which ones were killed or injured.In all, five Turks and four Americans died when flight TK1951 from Istanbul lost altitude on its final approach to runway 18R and slammed into a field, where the fuselage ripped into three parts. The plane’s two pilots and a junior pilot perished in the cockpit, and a flight attendant was also killed.Investigators continued to comb through the crash site on Friday, as the plane’s flight data and cockpit voice recordings were being analyzed in Paris. Sandra Groenendal, spokeswoman for the Dutch Safety Authority, said a first assessment of what went wrong according to the black box data would likely be released by Wednesday.Pieter van Vollenhoven, head of the Dutch agency investigating the crash, said in remarks quoted by Dutch state television NOS on Thursday that the plane had fallen almost directly from the sky, which pointed toward its engines having stopped. He said a reason for why that had happened had not yet been established.Ms. Groenendal, however, said engine failure was still only “one of the possible scenarios” for the crash. Other possible causes range from weather-related factors to insufficient fuel, loss of fuel, navigational errors, pilot fatigue or bird strikes, The Associated Press reported.'"
