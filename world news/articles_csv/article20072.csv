"'07-02-01,'1','They advise against closing state borders or airports because crucial deliveries, including food, would stop. They did not offer guidance on wearing masks, but Dr. Cetron said the C.D.C. would issue advice on this soon.The guidelines are only advisory, since authority for measures like closing schools rests with state and city officials; but many local officials had asked for guidance, Dr. Cetron said.The federal government has taken primary responsibility for developing and stockpiling vaccines and antiviral drugs, as well as masks and some other supplies.Today’s guidelines are partly based on a recent study of how 44 cities fared in the 1918 epidemic conducted jointly by the C.D.C. and the University of Michigan’s medical school. Historians and epidemiologists pored over hospital records and newspaper clippings, trying to determine what factors partly spared some cities and doomed others.While a few tiny towns escaped the epidemic entirely by cutting off all contact with outside, most cities took less drastic measures. These included isolating the sick and quarantining homes and rooming houses, closing schools, churches, bars and other gathering places, canceling parades, ball games, theaters and other public events, staggering factory hours, barring door-to-door sales, discouraging the use of public transport and encouraging the use of face masks.The most effective measure seemed to be moving early and quickly. For example, said Dr. Howard Markel, a medical historian and one of the study’s leaders, Philadelphia, the worst-hit city, had nearly three times as many sick and dead per capita as St. Louis, which had was hit weeks later by the virus moving inland from the Eastern Seaboard and had time to react as soon as flu cases rose above averages.“No matter how you set up the model,” Dr. Markel said, “the cities that acted earlier and with more layered protective measures fared better.”Any pandemic is expected to move faster than a new vaccine can be produced; current experimental vaccines against H5N1 avian flu are in short supply and based on strains isolated in 2004 or 2005. Although the government is creating a $4 billion stockpile of the antiviral drug Tamiflu, it is only useful when taken within the first 48 hours, and Tamiflu-resistant flu strains have already been found in Vietnam and Egypt.“No one’s arguing that by closing all the schools, you’re going to prevent the spread,” Dr. Markel added. “But if you can cut cases by 10 or 20 or 30 percent and it’s your family that’s spared, that’s a big deal.”School closures can be very controversial, and picking the right moment is hard, because it must be done before cases soar.Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the Trust for America’s Health, a health policy organization, noted that in poor city neighborhoods, 30 to 60 percent of all children get breakfasts or lunches crucial to their nutrition at school.“What are you going to do about that?” he asked.Dr. Markel said it might be possible to keep the cafeterias open and transport food to points where parents could pick it up, a move that would also keep cafeteria workers and bus drivers employed.Several public health experts praised the C.D.C. guidelines, although there were some quibbles with aspects of them.Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said he saw no point in fretting over exactly when to close schools, because his experience in meningitis outbreaks convinced him that terrified parents would keep their children at home anyway.“I don’t think we’ll have to pull that trigger,” he said. “The hard part is going to be unpulling it. How do the principals know when schools should open again?”Other experts pointed out that children out of school often behave in ways that are nearly as contagious. Youngsters are sent to day care centers, and teenagers gather in malls or at each others’ houses.“We’ll be facing the same problem, but without the teaching,” said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “They might as well be in class.”Also, he noted, many employed people cannot afford to stay at home and the financial stress from not working could increase domestic violence. And he said most states and cities lacked the money to carry out the suggested guidelines or to stage drills of them.Dr. Cetron argued that caring for children in groups of six or fewer cut transmission risks. He also argued that parents would keep many children from gathering.“My kids aren’t going to be going to the mall,” he said.The historian John Barry, author of “The Great Influenza,” a history of the 1918 flu, questioned an idea underpinning the study’s conclusions. There is evidence, he said, that some cities with low sickness and death rates in 1918, including St. Louis and Cincinnati, were hit by a milder spring wave of the virus. That would have, in effect, inoculated their citizens against the more severe fall wave and might have been more important than their public health measures.The guidelines did not suggest using the military to enforce quarantines, as President Bush said he might do when he first mentioned avian flu in 2005.Dr. Levi said that using the National Guard to set up temporary clinics or move pharmaceutical supplies might make sense.“But they’re not there,” he said. “The people who know how to run field hospitals are in Iraq.”'"
"'07-02-01,'1','City officials would not give an estimate of the size of the protest.To opponents of Mr. Calderón’s government, the spike in the price of tortillas is further proof that the free-market policies he has pledged to continue benefit the wealthy at the expense of the poor. The high prices are new ammunition for those who have previously pressed to renegotiate the agricultural chapter of the North American Free Trade Agreement to provide more protection for Mexican farmers, and for Mexico to end its dependence on imports of American corn and recover what nationalists call food sovereignty.Mr. Calderón barely won a bitterly contested election in July against a leftist opponent who promised to roll back some of those policies. Aware that he would have to win over part of the population that has yet to see the benefits of free trade, Mr. Calderón quickly announced a series of social programs once he took office.He also cracked down on the drug trade, establishing an image as a decisive executive. He ordered the army into several cities to fight drug violence and summarily extradited 11 drug trafficking suspects to the United States.But the tortilla price spiral appeared to come as a surprise. Although Mr. Calderón moved quickly, announcing a pact on Jan. 18 to freeze prices, the problem has not been resolved.Even with the pact, the news reports focused on the fact that the price ceiling for the tortillas of about 35 cents a pound was about 40 percent higher than the price three months earlier and contrasted that with the 4 percent increase in the minimum wage, which is still less than $5 a day.But because fewer than 10 percent of tortilla producers signed on to the agreement, the government had little power over those who did not. In some areas, prices have risen to 45 cents a pound. There is little more that Mr. Calderón can do to contain prices without huge expenditures for subsidies. Most analysts agree that the main cause of the increase has been a spike in corn prices in the United States, as the demand for corn to produce ethanol has jumped.But the uneven structure of Mexico’s corn and tortilla industry here has also generated accusations — none of them proved — of hoarding and profiteering. Mexico’s corn flour industry is controlled by just two companies, Grupo Maseca, also known as Gruma, and Minsa. Under the pact, Gruma agreed to keep prices for corn flour at 21 cents a pound. The government has promised to crack down on profiteers.Ken Shwedel, an agricultural economist in Mexico City for the Dutch agribusiness bank Rabobank, said prices were likely to remain high in the United States, which supplies about 25 percent of Mexico’s corn.“This is the first time you’ve got a real agricultural shock to the economy,” he said. “The market economy isn’t as benevolent as a state-run economy. The market is characterized by fluctuations. You have to live with it and know how to deal with it.”The marchers clearly directed their blame at the government. “When they get involved in something as elemental as tortillas, well that’s just irresponsible,” said Francisco Ruiz, 48, a telephone worker.Carola Ortega, 64, a member of a peasant group, said: “We’re here because the government always takes advantage of the poor. First it was tortillas, but we’re not stupid; if tortillas go up, everything else does too.”Some analysts argue that the opposition has merely seized on a convenient issue and that the controversy will blow over.“For the unions, it is about much more than tortillas,” said Vidal Romero, a political scientist at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, a Mexico City university. “They want to make it clear to the president that they still have strength and not let the government do what it wants.”For the left, the tortilla issue is a new rallying cry after months of postelectoral protests. Mr. Romero said the left hoped to use the march to position itself as the main opposition force to Mr. Calderón’s presidency. “They want to draw oxygen from it,” he said.'"
"'07-02-01,'1','Two prominent Republican senators renewed their criticism yesterday of the way the Securities and Exchange Commission carried out its investigation into a major hedge fund, Pequot Capital Management.In separate speeches on the Senate floor, the senators, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, said the S.E.C. — which filed no charges against Pequot — had failed to aggressively follow up on investigative leads developed by the lawyer who led the inquiry, Gary J. Aguirre.Both senators said their statements reflected the findings of an interim report, which is expected to be released today, on their investigation of the S.E.C.’s conduct in the case.The hedge fund came under regulatory scrutiny in late 2004 when Mr. Aguirre began investigating several profitable trades made by Pequot in advance of mergers or other market-moving news. The Pequot trades were flagged by stock exchange surveillance teams and forwarded to the commission.The S.E.C. fired Mr. Aguirre in September 2005 after he complained that his investigation had been derailed by outside political influence.'"
"'07-02-01,'1','Retired players have reason to be concerned about their long-term health. A neuropathologist recently determined that Andre Waters, a former Eagles safety who committed suicide in November at age 44, sustained brain damage from playing football that led to his depression and death. Last month, a United States Court of Appeals upheld a 2005 trial court ruling that the Hall of Fame center Mike Webster sustained brain damage from playing professional football, mostly for the Steelers.According to a 2003 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, 14 percent of N.F.L. players had obstructive sleep apnea, a disease that impairs breathing and is known to affect large, muscular individuals like football linemen more often than people of average size. Reggie White, a Hall of Fame defensive lineman, died at 43 in 2004 after having cardiac arrhythmia, but he also had sleep apnea, which may have contributed to his death.With more football linemen weighing much more than 300 pounds, doctors said they expected sleep apnea to become more prevalent .“The primary treatment for sleep apnea is to lose weight, and they can’t,” said Dr. Allan Levy, an associate team physician with the Giants, who is assisting with this week’s screening. “There’s no such thing as a 225-pound offensive lineman. We try to make certain that they understand that they’ve got to come down in weight when they retire. All of my offensive lineman from the Giants’ two Super Bowl wins have all lost at least 50 pounds. They’re all in excellent health. You see some of the other guys, and they’re just huge. They’ve got all kinds of problems.“The problem with sleep apnea is in the neck. A 17½-inch neck is usually where the problem begins. When they sleep, the muscles relax in the body. Now the weight of their neck clasps down on their airway. They stop breathing. They momentarily wake up, then the cycle starts over again, and they never get into deep sleep. They develop heart disease and hypertension. Sleep apnea is a killer. One of the kids that played for us, we did a sleep study on, had 440 awakenings during the night.”The most common treatment for sleep apnea involves wearing a mask that supplies a stream of air through the nose during sleep. But some retired players have ailments that are far more debilitating. Tom Nowatzke, the president of the N.F.L. Alumni Detroit chapter, said more should be done by the league and the players union to help retired players with disabilities related to football.“I get $843 a month, but some guys are only getting $300, $400 a month because of when they played,” said Nowatzke, a 64-year-old former running back who scored a touchdown for the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl V.“Four hundred dollars a month won’t pay for a car payment these days, not to mention doctor bills and medicine, and stuff that’s not covered. I’m very fortunate to be as healthy as I am at my age. I’m going to see people this weekend who have trouble walking, and they’re eight or nine years younger than I am.”Nowatzke said he hoped that more players would stop to think how they may feel when they turn 60 and consider the health of players who have come before them.“Not many do,” Nowatzke said. “Guys who played in the ’30s, ’40s, ’50s probably died before they turned 70. Now guys are living to be 75 or 80. So it becomes a bigger problem.”'"
"'07-02-01,'1','CHICAGO, Jan. 31 (AP) — The Boeing Company said Wednesday that its fourth-quarter earnings more than doubled, largely as a result of robust commercial airplane and military systems business. The report set off a 4 percent gain in the share price.Boeing said its profit in the period rose to $989 million, or $1.29 a share, from $460 million, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 26 percent, to $17.5 billion from $13.9 billion.Both profit and sales topped Wall Street forecasts. Shares in Boeing, which is based in Chicago, rose $3.56, to $89.56.The chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., said that 2006 was a good year: “We achieved new records in revenue, cash flow and backlog and overcame meaningful challenges by focusing on improving productivity and meeting our commitments.”Boeing booked a record number of orders for new commercial planes, raising its year-end backlog to $250 billion, up 22 percent.The commercial airplanes unit posted operating earnings of $665 million in the quarter, up from $330 million. Its revenue increased 37 percent, to $7.6 billion from $5.5 billion.'"
"'07-02-01,'1','Gordon S. Macklin, who guided the growth of one of the world’s largest securities trading systems, the computerized service known as Nasdaq, died Tuesday in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 78.The cause was a stroke, his assistant, Anna Fukara, told Bloomberg News.More than three decades ago, Mr. Macklin helped usher in the era of electronic trading of securities when he oversaw the development of the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations system, or the Nasdaq.Instead of working on the floor of a traditional stock exchange, brokers nationwide were able to trade through Nasdaq, a computerized system that allowed them to display the prices they were seeking to get for a share in a particular company or the price they were willing to pay for it. Sales could then be executed at the push of a button.Initially, only over-the-counter stock, shares in typically smaller companies, including some with suspect financial track records, were traded on Nasdaq. But over time, the ranks of companies traded on the exchange grew to include powerhouses like Apple, Microsoft and Starbucks.Before he became president of the National Association of Securities Dealers in 1970, Mr. Macklin had previously worked for two decades at a brokerage firm in Cleveland.A year later, the N.A.S.D., a self-regulatory body that oversees the practices of registered securities dealers, started Nasdaq. In time, the newcomer became a formidable rival to both the New York and American Stock Exchanges.'"
"'07-02-01,'1','Joseph S. Farland, who as the American ambassador to Pakistan in 1971 helped Henry A. Kissinger surreptitiously slip into China for 36 hours to lay the groundwork for President Richard M. Nixon’s historic visit to China, died Sunday at his home in Winchester, Va. He was 92.The cause was complications of a stroke, his son Richard said.With a reputation for working outside diplomatic protocols, Mr. Farland — a former F.B.I. agent and, in the Eisenhower years, an adviser on military intelligence — was ambassador to the Dominican Republic from 1957 to 1960; to Panama from 1960 to 1963; to Pakistan from 1969 to 1972; and to Iran from 1972 to 1973.It was in the spring of 1971 that Mr. Farland, as ambassador to Pakistan, helped create the ruse under which Mr. Kissinger, then Nixon’s national security adviser, would arrive in Islamabad on July 8, apparently for talks with President Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan, the military dictator at the time. According to the plan, Mr. Kissinger feigned a severe stomachache and was taken to President Khan’s mountain rest house. From there, Mr. Kissinger was flown to southern China for a clandestine meeting, from July 9 to 11, with the Chinese premier, Chou En-lai. There, they arranged for Nixon’s weeklong trip to China in February 1972, which restructured long-strained diplomatic relations.In his 1979 book, “White House Years,” Mr. Kissinger wrote: “We were fortunate that our ambassador in Pakistan at that moment was a man outside the regular Foreign Service establishment. A traditionalist would never have responded without reinsuring himself by a ‘personal’ communication to his departmental chiefs in Washington. Farland, moreover, was as matter-of-factly able as he was conscientious. He handled the complicated arrangement for my trip with unfailing skill and discretion.”Joseph Simpson Farland was born on Aug. 11, 1914, in Clarksburg, W.Va., the only child of Richard and Grace Simpson Farland. His father was a banker. He graduated from West Virginia University in 1936 and a earned a law degree there in 1938. A year later he married Virginia Christopher, a daughter of a local coal mine owner; Mrs. Farland died in 1978.'"
"'07-02-01,'1','“There was a lot of evidence previously suggesting that the long-term standard should be lower, and this is adding one more study to that evidence,” said Douglas Dockery, a pollution specialist at the Harvard School of Public Health.Dr. Dockery wrote an accompanying editorial for the study, which is in the Thursday issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.The researchers, based at the University of Washington, worked from data collected for the Women’s Health Initiative, a research project that previously showed the heart dangers of hormone supplements.It has long been known that particulates can contribute to lung and heart disease, with women perhaps more susceptible than men to heart problems, perhaps because of their smaller blood vessels and other biological differences.But the degree of risk for older women was less clear. This study started with women who had gone through menopause and were 50 to 79 years old.Unlike earlier studies, it looked not just at deaths, but also at heart attacks, coronary disease, strokes and clogged arteries.Those problems were 24 percent more likely with every 10-unit increase in particles. Almost 3 percent of the women had some kind of cardiovascular problem.The risk varied along with the varying levels of these particles in different neighborhoods in the same city.In their calculations, the researchers tried to adjust for lower income and other health problems that have been blamed for the higher rates of disease in past studies.“I think the major contribution is answering the critics of the prior studies,” said the paper’s senior researcher, Dr. Joel Kaufman of the University of Washington.“The effect,” Dr. Kaufman said, “seems large and important and should be taken seriously.”States and other groups demanding a lower annual standard sued the E.P.A. last year, accusing it of disregarding the advice of its own scientists. Some agency scientists are also pushing for tighter rules on ozone, the chemical that creates smog and contributes to asthma and lung disease. The E.P.A. is scheduled to take another look at its standard for particulate matter and finish it by 2011.The grit is thought to reach deep into the lungs to spur inflammation that leads to heart attack and stroke. It would take about 30 particles to equal the thickness of a human hair.The particles, made of dust, soot and various chemicals, come from burning fuel in cars, factories and power plants. While individual particles are too small to see, they can be observed collectively as urban haze.'"
"'07-02-01,'1','The exchange’s nonexclusive alliance with Tokyo —loosely defined and less substantive than its merger with Euronext or its ownership stake in India’s national stock exchange — is an agreement to work together, the chief executives from the two exchanges said. Working groups are in place to examine possible linkages in areas like trading technology, cross-listings, new products including exchange-traded funds and areas of corporate governance and regulation, Mr. Thain said.Over the last few years, global exchanges have been radically transformed from staid not-for-profit membership organizations to for-profit, publicly traded technology hubs, struggling to capture soaring volumes and increasingly complex financial products.Given the limited number of exchanges in the world and their monopolylike characteristics, investors have leaped at the opportunity to own a piece of what are considered by many to be toll roads for traders. Hedge funds, private pools of capital that control half to a third of trading on these exchanges, have been some of the biggest investors.The exchanges themselves have been in a race to gobble one another up or strike alliances, seeking to corner the valuable liquidity that makes markets function. The Deutsche Börse lost out to NYSE in the bidding for Euronext, and NYSE’s rival, Nasdaq, has made a hostile offer for the London Stock Exchange, so far without success. Yesterday’s deal is expected to have more immediate importance for Tokyo than for NYSE. The Tokyo exchange is trying to restore its reputation after a series of embarrassing computer-related failures in late 2005 and early 2006 that paralyzed trading and resulted in huge losses for one brokerage firm.Those failures shook investors’ faith in the exchange, Asia’s largest and most sophisticated market and No. 2 globally after New York.The exchange has struggled to win back investor confidence, postponing its initial offering until 2009 and vowing to have its outdated computer trading system replaced by then.Analysts speculated that the Tokyo exchange’s biggest motivation in seeking an alliance with New York was to bolster its prestige and get outside help in improving its trading systems.“The T.S.E. is still trying to put its house back in order and regain investor confidence,” said Neil Katkov, a Tokyo-based analyst specializing in trading systems at Celent Communications “A tie-up with a major foreign exchange makes them look competitive again.”Analysts said the Tokyo exchange still faced a host of problems. The computer manufacturer chosen to build the new trading system, Fujitsu, also built the current problem-plagued system. And the new system, which is expected to cost some $300 million, will not be as fast or investor-friendly as the New York exchange’s current computers — which Nasdaq has frequently derided as antiquated and slow.For the NYSE Group, an alliance with the Tokyo exchange brings access to Asia’s largest market, with a capitalization of $4.6 trillion — about one-third of the New York Exchange’s.Tokyo’s stock market has re-emerged as an enormously popular place to invest. Foreign investors have been net buyers in recent years, drawn by rebounding stock and asset prices as Japan’s economy finally recovers from a long slump in the 1990s.In recent years, Japanese stock indexes have outperformed American indexes. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index has doubled since the start of 2003, compared with the Dow Jones industrial average’s rise of about 50 percent during the period. On Tuesday, the Nikkei 225 closed at 17,490.19, close to a six-year high.Analysts said the Tokyo market would probably benefit from higher profits as more companies overhaul themselves in the face of rising Chinese and other Asian competition. They said another boost would come as more of Japan’s wealth of private savings and pension funds moves into stocks to take advantage of the bull market.This and the foreign money pouring in have given Tokyo robust daily trading volumes similar to New York’s. On Monday, 1.49 billion shares were traded in Tokyo, compared with 1.54 billion on the New York exchange.'"

"'07-02-01,'1','Brian Kilcommons, a trainer based in Auburn, N.H., and a faculty member at the Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine in North Grafton, Mass., has found the same demand in rural New England. “Home pet services have just expanded considerably, and many good trainers are fully booked with house calls,” he said.The house-call boom is part of a general expansion of the “pet services” sector of the $38 billion pet industry. Spending in that category swelled to $2.7 billion in 2006, for services like training, grooming and boarding, up from $1.2 billion five years earlier, according to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association.Service does not come cheap; fees range from $100 to $500 an hour, according to several trainers.The fashion for house calls is being driven in part by Cesar Millan, a k a the Dog Whisperer, whose weekly show by that name on the National Geographic Channel has inspired millions of viewers to consider that they, too, could hire someone to bring their pets to heel in their own homes. The show, which follows Mr. Millan as he visits and tames out-of-control dogs, amounts to an advertisement for dog training house calls.Rising animal adoption rates, a result of shelters enacting “no-kill” policies and focusing instead on promoting adoption, have also contributed to the increase. (At Animal Care and Control of New York City, adoptions have more than doubled since 2001, to 19,314 in 2006.)As Mr. Berloni put it, “Rescued pets often come with baggage.”Baggage like Stanley’s, for example. In June, he was transported by police officers to the Humane Society of New York in Manhattan after a two-car accident left him with a broken hind leg, broken ribs, a head wound, bodily abrasions and patches of alopecia. He underwent leg surgery, and after being fitted with a leg cast he was transferred to the cat floor because of his fear of other dogs.Nonetheless, Arisa Itami, 33, a jazz singer from Japan, found him “cute and amazing,” and adopted him.“I think a larger dog would’ve been fine,” noted her husband, Ryan Dixon, a photographer.As part of its adoption program, the Humane Society offers free house calls, and the agency sent its director of behavior, Mr. Berloni, to assist Stanley and his new owners. During Mr. Berloni’s visit, the couple eagerly listed Stanley’s troubles: stealing food when Mr. Dixon eats on the couch; post-traumatic stress resulting from the car accident; and his unpredictable excretion habits, which sparked a lively discussion.“And he’s distracted, kind of out of focus,” Ms. Itami said. “He can’t walk straight. He’s always looking around.” (“I think that’s normal,” Mr. Dixon said. “No,” replied Ms. Itami.)Mr. Berloni nodded. A compact man with dark eyes and an air of rigid calm, he conducted the apartment analysis from Stanley’s point of view. “You eat on a low couch, down on his level, so he thinks you’re inviting him in,” he said to Mr. Dixon. The solution: set aside a corner of the room for a new dog bed, where Stanley can eat treats during mealtime.Mr. Berloni eyed a newspaper that the couple had set out for Stanley’s use in the center of the apartment, in hopes of preventing more damage to their furnishings. The paper was relocated to the bathroom, where Stanley would feel “less prone to predators,” Mr. Berloni said.Stanley looked bored. He gave Mr. Berloni a blasé glance, and groomed a patch of his alopecia.It’s hard to overstate how disruptive a misbehaved pet can be to a household. Problems like lack of housebreaking and chewing can fray nerves and sofas alike, and a pet’s hostility toward male guests can even destroy relationships. “Friends of mine call me a dog trainer slash marriage counselor,” Mr. Roos said. “People will say: When my boyfriend and I are having sex, the dog is ready to attack my boyfriend.”Aggressive dogs in particular can isolate owners. Mr. Kilcommons, the New Hampshire trainer, worked with a Virginia woman whose Rottweiler guarded doorways, barring visitors from entering the house, and then began taunting gardeners. “The dog would wait until the gardener bent over, and then stick his head between his legs and roar, then walk away,” he said. “People wouldn’t work for her.”For decades, frustrated pet owners had two options: Obedience classes or private office appointments, said Jean Donaldson, director of the San Francisco S.P.C.A. Academy for Dog Trainers.“The problem is that dogs were likely to go home and regress to the old rules,” Ms. Donaldson said. Home training, which is “efficient and customizable” to the point where some trainers will visit while a pet’s owner is at work, leaving behind a list of training exercises, she said, is more likely to encourage long-term change.“A huge part of managing your pet is managing the environment,” said Andrea Arden, who runs Andrea Arden Dog Training, a 12-year-old Manhattan firm that performs 60 house calls a week, twice as many as it did three years ago.Ms. Arden met a dachshund in a Park Avenue apartment recently who barked so much, “it was actually the building manager who called me,” she said. She and the owner created a space for the dog on one side of the apartment, away from bustling hallways, and turned on a television to drown out the noise the dog was responding to. (Ms. Arden also puppy-proofs rooms, fitting kitchen moldings with rubber bumpers and rendering garbage pails inaccessible.)Dogs are not the only animals receiving house calls. Dr. Peter Borchelt, an animal behaviorist in Brooklyn who began performing house calls in 1978, said that half his clients are cats, many with aggression and grooming problems. One cat hid under the kitchen cabinets whenever the owner’s new boyfriend would visit, he said, adding that the cat began to stress-groom wounds into its back. Dr. Borchelt instructed the boyfriend to pretend he was afraid of the cat, and the owner to create a safe, boyfriend-free space in the apartment.In many cases, what seem like complex and hopeless problems to pet owners can be resolved in one or two house calls from an experienced trainer, according to most of those interviewed.

"'07-02-01,'1','But who cares? All that really interests me is figuring out how to get the lining to lie flat on a doll-size pleated skirt. (I can make pleats!)The problem, however, is that one corner of my office has a table covered with a mess of fabric, spools, pins and patterns. I can’t find the scissors. How can I ever tackle a bigger project — curtains, a tablecloth, matching napkins — without the proper equipment?“Good for you,” said Karen Koza, a spokeswoman for the association. “You’ve got the bug. Now you need to figure out how to keep all your things together, organized.”“First, maybe I should figure out why I’m so obsessed,” I said. “Why do I get so much satisfaction from sewing bits of fabric together with really, really straight seams?”“You get a feeling of mastery from making something,” Ms. Koza said.“But I’m not a member of the crafty, do-it-yourself generation that sees sewing as an expression of personal creativity,” I said. “I was raised to think sewing, along with ironing and scrubbing floors, was a symbol of domestic repression.”“Don’t forget that sewing was something that once was considered an essential life skill,” Ms. Koza said. “You are independent when you can make something of your own.”When she put it that way, I almost felt courageous for neglecting my work, the laundry and the bills. I wasn’t spending all my time making tiny doll clothes — no, I was learning a life skill.“What should I make next?” I asked. “Am I ready to tackle something human-size?”“Take something you already have in the closet, say the dirndl skirt from last season, and make it into this season’s bubble skirt,” Ms. Koza suggested. “You can be creative and do what you want to it.”“I’m not that type,” I said. “I like to pattern. I like to cut out the little tissue-paper pieces.”“It’s about starting small,” Ms. Koza said. “And going from there.”Even starting small, I would need basic supplies. So I visited the Home Sewing Association’s Web site at Sewing.org, where I found a comprehensive list of necessities that included everything from an iron and ironing board to a strawberry pincushion. I already had a seam ripper, a measuring tape and pinking shears. But a bodkin to thread elastic through a casing? Who has a bodkin?I also glanced at some of the photos that visitors had posted in the “My Sewing Room” section, photos that showed sewing spaces that ranged from makeshift to swanky, with elaborate cutting tables (for a selection, see Sewingtableshop.com) and expensive computerized sewing machines from manufacturers like Bernina, whose top-of-the-line Arista 730e model has a suggested retail price of $7,999. (The model is described but not sold online at the company’s Web site at Berninausa.com.) It is the sewing machine equivalent of a sports car. I phoned Jeanne Delpit, a spokeswoman for Bernina, in the hope that she would tell me I absolutely needed a sewing machine that automatically regulated zigzag stitches at variable lengths, was capable of making 850 different stitches, had three thread cutters, could sew in 16 directions and was powered by the Microsoft Windows operating system.“We have a nice little entry-level machine in our Bernette line,” Ms. Delpit said. “The line sells for from $399 to $749.”I looked at the little robe sitting on the table next to my borrowed sewing machine and realized that she had a point. Maybe I should master the art of sewing an under collar to a lining before investing my retirement savings in a sewing machine.“You can always trade up,” Ms. Delpit said. “We encourage customers to work with one of our authorized dealers, and if you take it back in six months and say, ‘I want more,’ they’ll help.”I started small. I went shopping at sewing supply sites like Clotilde.com (where I bought a Magenta-Magic erasable pen, $5) and Junetailor.com (where I bought a thread rack that holds 60 spools, $18.99). I visited Reprodepot.com (where I gazed longingly at the fabrics) and Sewingpatterns.com (which carries a broad selection from dozens of manufacturers like Vogue, Simplicity and McCall’s).Joannfabrics.com had a selection of basics, including four kinds of bodkins, for $1.60 to $2.99, not to mention 16 kinds of pincushions, at prices of $1.29 to $8.99. The Joann site also had a store locator; I typed in my ZIP code and learned that the company had four bricks-and-mortar stores within 30 miles.Should I drive to one? I looked at a stack of unopened mail on my desk. Then I looked at the doll-size robe. It needed piping. How do you sew on piping? I wasn’t sure. But it was a life skill. The mail could wait.'"
"'07-02-01,'1','The beauty of suspension training, its advocates say, is that you can’t help engaging your core to steady yourself. On the other hand, critics warn that the instability of suspension straps can result in injury, especially if you have a history of joint or back injuries, or inadequate core strength.Personal trainers use TRX equipment at over 1,000 gyms nationwide, according to Fitness Anywhere, its maker. Roughly 10,000 $150 sets of straps have been shipped.Group classes for suspension devotees have begun to crop up nationwide. At Crunch, a class called BodyWeb With TRX is in full swing at two San Francisco outposts, and so is a pilot class featuring Inkaflexx equipment at Equinox in Darien, Conn. By mid-March, Equinox plans to offer TRX or Inkaflexx classes in Boston, Los Angeles and a new Manhattan club on Park Avenue. This summer, Life Time Fitness will add suspension training classes at a handful of its 60 locations in 16 states.“It’s like yoga on ropes because it takes a lot of balance,” said Mark Undercoffler, 32, a public relations executive in San Francisco, who has attended the Crunch BodyWeb class for three months. “The TRX works every part of your body in 50 minutes, especially your core. It’s the quickest way to get a cardio and muscle workout in less than an hour. I sweat as much in BodyWeb as I do in spin class.”The BodyWeb With TRX class — which involves lunges, chest presses and one-legged squats to high-energy dance music — is so fast paced that some say it amounts to a cardiovascular workout. At Equinox a mellower class called Inka focuses more on flexibility. To Andean flute music, participants are led through a series of stretches and a handful of strength-training moves.Suspension training is having a moment partly because some trainers and clients are bored with the ubiquitous balance equipment like stability balls. Interest in suspension straps is also high because a theory called functional training has been making slow but steady inroads in the fitness business. It advocates strengthening muscles synergistically, rather than in isolation.“With so much emphasis put on core and functional training, the timing is right” for suspension training, said Kathie Davis, the executive director of IDEA Health and Fitness Association, a trade group. “It has staying power because it has good education and programming behind it. Usually the trends that come and go are the ones that don’t have good educators putting together interesting programs to go with the equipment.”Randy Hetrick, the inventor of TRX straps, and his company, Fitness Anywhere, have developed over 300 exercises and taught 200 personal trainers and instructors in daylong seminars. After taking one, Susane Pata, a group fitness director at Crunch, designed the BodyWeb class.Not everyone agrees that suspension training is appropriate for the masses.Fabio Comana, a research scientist at the nonprofit American Council on Exercise, said that it might be valuable for well-conditioned athletes and gymgoers who regularly train their core, the muscles closest to their spine. But at best it is inappropriate for people who haven’t built up their core and at worst is potentially dangerous for them. “A segment of the population doesn’t have joint integrity and the ability to stabilize their entire body,” he said. So instead of using their core, they use the wrong muscles, aggravating their risk for injury.Mr. Comana, who has a master’s degree in exercise physiology, added, “I don’t mean to doubt it, because I do like it, and I’ve been using it for the last year.” But he counts himself among the experienced athletes who stand to benefit from the straps.Walter Thompson, a professor of kinesiology at Georgia State University in Atlanta, who reviewed instructional videos of TRX exercises, sees benefits but also risk. “My impression is that this would be effective for a small group of highly fit men and women,” Dr. Thompson said. “But I see potential for muscular, skeletal and joint injuries. Particularly hyperextension of wrists, elbows, shoulders, ankles and knees.”Fraser Quelch, the director of education at Fitness Anywhere, disagreed. To avoid injury, he suggested that deconditioned users perform moves with one leg behind the other, reducing instability.Advocates of suspension training also say that adjusting body position can make movements easier. For example, standing at 90 degrees and holding TRX straps keeps upper-body exercises manageable.Mr. Baldwin, who spent five years in the service teaching recruits conditioning and combat skills, said, “It’s easy to do a pushup with your hands against a wall, and it’s a lot harder to do one on the ground.” Suspension training, he added, “allows you to do exercises at every angle between the two.”Kurt Dasbach, the creator of Inkaflexx, argues that its trapezelike design — straps hanging from a wall joined by a bar — makes it inherently a bit more stable. “Inkaflexx is secured to the wall or ceiling by two anchors, so you’re not countering instability in every direction,” said Mr. Dasbach, a personal trainer at Equinox. “As a result, it makes a lot of the movements accessible for many people because it offers more stability than the TRX.”In a decade of working with Michael Carson, a personal trainer at Pro Gym in Brentwood, Calif., Jennifer Roth has tried dozens of new new things like stability balls and resistance cords. But Ms. Roth, 42, a carpet designer, said she likes the suspension strap best. “There’s always something new and more advanced you can bring to it, whether that is trying a new move or simply making it more difficult by changing your body angle,” said Ms. Roth, a college gymnast and swimmer. She has used TRX twice a week since July and credits it for leaner muscles and increased strength in her obliques.The two systems on the market differ in design, not least because they are products of starkly different hothouses. Mr. Hetrick was a Navy Seal squadron commander in the late 1990s, when he created the first prototype of TRX out of parachute webbing and a carabiner ring.“We were deploying throughout Bosnia and Southeast Asia in submarines, ships, warehouses and safe houses, all of these space-constrained environments where it’s hard to do well-rounded training,” he said.In 2005, four years after he left the service, Mr. Hetrick began marketing his product to the fitness business. Coincidentally, Mr. Dasbach created a similar apparatus inspired by his years as a professional soccer player in Chile, where a coach tied ropes to a wall to help players stretch.Marke Rubenstein, 53, an advertising executive in Stamford, Conn., was intimidated when she first saw the Inkaflexx straps. “I’m not very athletic and I’m not great in various difficult yoga poses, but I feel very comfortable with this,” she said after six visits to Mr. Dasbach’s class. “It’s challenging but not too difficult, and I can always modify the straps to make them work for me.”'"

"'07-02-02,'0','“This is not in the culture of Nissan, to miss something that has been forecast, particularly when it’s relative to profit,” he said. “We’re going to be very cautious when we give forecasts from now on.”Nissan’s global sales slid 3 percent between October and December, although revenue was up slightly. The company lost its second-place ranking in Japan to Honda, and while its share of the United States market was almost flat, it could not keep pace with surging Toyota.“We misread our main U.S. market,” Joji Tagawa, corporate vice president, told reporters in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg News. “We went for 15 months without any new Nissan-brand models and 18 months without any new Infiniti-brand models in the U.S., so our sales suffered.”Nissan only introduced one new model between April and September 2006, although last quarter it began selling six new or redesigned vehicles. In its next fiscal year, which will begin April 1, it is counting on 11 new models to improve earnings.For the fiscal year ending March 31, Nissan today cut its earnings target by 12 percent, to 460 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from a previous projection of 523 billion yen ($4.3 billion).Between October and December, the company said it earned 104.4 billion yen ($861 million), down from 135 billion yen ($1.1 billion) a year earlier. That is 32 percent less than what analysts had expected.“Nissan is suffering from a cocktail of intense competition, material costs, lower volume and mix,” Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley in Paris, said in a note to clients.Nissan had reported six consecutive years of record profits under Mr. Ghosn, who serves as chief executive of both Nissan and Renault. His seemingly golden touch made him a celebrity in Japan, and he has been widely regarded as one of the automotive industry’s most capable and dynamic executives.Last year, Mr. Ghosn spent several months overseeing discussions between his own Nissan-Renault alliance and General Motors about creating a three-continent partnership. The talks fell apart in October after Mr. Ghosn refused to entertain G.M.’s request that his companies pay billions of dollars as a premium to make up for what G.M. said would be vastly disproportionate benefits for each party.Some analysts believed the architect behind the proposal, billionaire G.M. shareholder Kirk Kerkorian, ultimately wanted to bring Mr. Ghosn to Detroit to preside over G.M.’s turnaround effort.While the talks were taking place, Ford’s chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., reportedly called Mr. Ghosn and suggested the two discuss partnership opportunities or perhaps a job at Ford if an alliance with G.M. did not happen. Since then, Ford has hired a new chief executive, and Mr. Ghosn said during a visit to Detroit that he was not interested in opening talks with another automaker, at least until he is more comfortable with Nissan’s performance.'"
"'07-02-02,'0','Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates called the term “civil war” a “bumper-sticker answer” that oversimplified the reality of overlapping conflicts. “I believe that there are essentially four wars going on in Iraq,” he said at a Pentagon briefing today, citing Shia-on-Shia strife, principally in the South; sectarian violence, largely in Baghdad; the Sunni insurgency, and attacks by Al Qaeda.The assessment contains the consensus judgments of the 16 agencies that make up the intelligence community and is sure to fuel the debate within Congress and between some lawmakers and the White House over what to do.Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, called the document “the latest in a long line of bleak assessments by foreign policy and military experts indicating the president’s plan is flawed and failing. This conclusion is shared by a bipartisan group of Congress and an overwhelming majority of Americans.”In general, the assessment is gloomy about the eroding security in the country and the prospects for Iraq’s government to reign in the violence between Sunni and Shia sects.The report also argues against a withdrawal of American forces from Iraq, concluding that a rapid military pullout “almost certainly would lead” to carnage worse in scale and scope.Some of the report’s judgments were first reported today in The Washington Post.There are a few grains of optimism. The Iraqi security forces have shown “real improvements,” the report says, even though they are unlikely to be able to assume greater responsibilities and battle Shiite militias successfully in the next 12 to 18 months.And the assessment says that some developments “could” help to reverse the downward spiral: broader Sunni acceptance of the political structure; concessions by Shiites and Kurds to “create space” for Sunni acceptance, and “a bottom-up approach” to help mend frayed tribal and religious relationships.But prospects for better relations between Shiites and Sunnis are clouded by the Shiites’ deep feelings of insecurity spawned by decades of subordination by the Sunnis under Saddam Hussein — and the Sunnis’ lack of respect for the central government and reluctance to accept their minority status now. Moreover, the Kurds, while “willing” to take part in building a new Iraq, are reluctant to surrender the autonomy they have achieved recently, the report says.The Kurds are a particular concern to Turkey, which does not want Iraq to disintegrate and is determined to eliminate the safe haven in northern Iraq for a Turkish Kurdish terrorist group, the assessment notes. But while Iraq’s neighbors, especially Iran and Syria, “influence and are influenced by” events in Iraq, they probably do not have enough influence to stabilize Iraq because that country’s “internal sectarian dynamics” are self-sustaining, the documents states.The report says Iraq could break apart “with grave humanitarian, political and security consequences” through a deadly mix of sectarian killings, assassinations of political and religious leaders and the complete Sunni repudiation of the government. Moreover, the documents says, many of Iraq’s professional and entrepreneurial people have already fled their country.Should the worst happen and the new country fall apart completely, the assessment sees three possible outcomes, all dire:Widespread fighting could produce “de facto partition” of the country into “three mutually antagonistic parts” and spawn “fierce violence” among Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds for years. A second possibility is that a new strongman could emerge, a Shiite this time, instead of the new democracy envisioned by the Bush administration. Finally, there could be anarchy, with resulting instability and bloodshed.At the Pentagon briefing, Defense Secretary Gates declined to comment in detail on the new intelligence estimate, which he said he had not read, and sought to play down the importance of the debate over whether Iraq is in the midst of a civil war.""When I think of a civil war I think of thousands of people out in the streets,” he said. Instead, in Iraq, he said he sees ""gangs of killers going after specific neighborhoods or specific targets,” or attacks on marketplaces meant to cause random suffering.As for recent efforts by the Iraqi government, he said officials appeared to be delivering, at least in part, on the first of a series of benchmarks for progress agreed upon between Baghdad and Washington.Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was also at the briefing, said that two of the four Iraqi army brigades promised as reinforcements in the capital as part of a new security plan had arrived, a third was en route and the fourth was scheduled to arrive by the end of February.""Contrary to what has happened in the past, the units that were designated” for deployment in Baghdad are being sent, he said.But the units that have arrived are at only about 60 percent strength, a figure that General Pace said was not acceptable. ""They do need to flesh them out,” he said. ""They need to get the people back who are with their families. It needs to be stronger than that.”Absenteeism is a chronic problem in the Iraqi security forces, in part because the lack of a working banking system means that soldiers are granted leave to deliver their pay to their families, and troops have sometimes refused assignments. In other cases, units do not want to leave the region in which they are based. Last summer, when the Iraqi government ordered troops to Baghdad to help with an earlier security effort, many of the them refused to go, American military officials have said.Democrats in Congress have complained that the Bush administration has refused to make the list of benchmarks public, even as the president has sought to assure the public that the American commitment is not ""open ended.”Mr. Gates today said that he saw no problem in releasing the benchmarks, and described the earliest of them in general terms: ""Are the brigades showing up, reasonably on time, in the numbers they need to be, are the politicians staying out of the decisions on which neighborhoods to go into, are the security forces allowed to go into all neighborhoods where there are lawbreakers?”Mr. Bush and American commanders in Baghdad have blamed the failure of earlier security efforts there to the shortage of Iraqi troops and to restrictions placed by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a Shiite, on the ability of American soldiers to pursue Shiite militia members.Senior intelligence officials for months had provided glimpses of the new intelligence estimate in public testimony before Congress, including an assessment that sectarian violence is the most significant threat to Iraqi security, surpassing even Al Qaeda’s role in Iraqi attacks.“Conflict in Iraq is a self-sustaining and growing cycle in which violent acts increasingly generate retaliation,” Lt. Gen. Michael Maples, who leads the Defense Intelligence Agency, recently told members of Congress.“Insecurity rationalizes and justifies militias, in particular Shia militias and increases fears in the Sunni Arab community,” he said.As the sectarian violence gathered steam over last summer, top Senators requested that Director of National Intelligence John D. Negroponte begin work on the new assessment, the first N.I.E. on Iraq since 2004.National intelligence estimates draw analysis from America’s disparate intelligence agencies, and are written by officials at the National Intelligence Council.The new report also draws conclusions about that ability of the Iraqi government to quell the violence and mend sectarian rifts in the country.Last week, National Intelligence Council chairman, Thomas Fingar, told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee that the new N.I.E. concludes it will be “very difficult” for the Iraqi prime minister to deal with the violence and accomplish a national reconciliation, but “not impossible.”""We judge that Maliki does not wish to fail in his role,"" Mr. Fingar said. ""He does not wish to preside over the disintegration of Iraq.""'"

"'07-02-02,'0','On his desk, which has been stripped of its Rolodex and the usual administrative accouterments, rests a sumptuously wrapped package: another going-away present. The doctor has been too busy to open it and refuses, when pressed, to unwrap it in front of an audience lest it contain “a gag gift.” To avoid temptation, he stows it in a corner and takes its place atop the bare desk.HE himself is very much in the pink. Make that ruddy. Dr. Daines, whose appointment happened in a hurry last month, still has the healthy vestiges of the powder-hound tan he acquired on a ski trip to Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Snow Basin in his native Utah.A skier since age 9, he owns up to black diamond proficiency and, at 55, keeps up with his three children, all in their 20s. His favorite tough run, at Alta, is one of those ski-at-your-own-risk propositions. “The High Rustler, and it’s not on the maps,” he says. “It’s steep.”Does Dr. Daines consider himself an on-the-slopes daredevil? Count him out; he’s never so much as stubbed a toe skiing.What about going out on a limb for health care reform — the reason Governor Spitzer, whose proposed budget includes a bold $1.2 billion in health care cuts, $1 billion of it from the state’s bloated Medicaid spending, turned to him? Count him in.“Our Medicaid is the most expensive in the country, not by a small degree but by a large degree,” he says. “In some ways, we’re oddballs on the medical scene. This state needs to put its Medicaid money in the places where Medicaid patients are treated.”The proposed overhaul of the Medicaid reimbursement system, as well as the closing of nine hospitals (five of them in New York City) and roughly 48 reconfigurations and mergers recommended by the 2006 Berger Commission report, will fall to Dr. Daines. He says he anticipates an “adversarial” reception from health care unions and legislators to whom they have close ties. Lawsuits from “victims” of the Berger Commission, which received support from the Legislature as well as from Governor Spitzer and former Gov. George E. Pataki, are already in the works.“There is no moratorium on change, and we will change,” Dr. Daines says. “We will either do so cooperatively and the right way, by consensus, or else things will explode and we will watch where the pieces land. I’m a planning person, and the Berger plan is a good plan. But I understand why good and loyal employees and good and loyal patients would raise a protest about having their hospitals closed. This is New York: people have lawyers, and everybody gets their day in court.”The son of an anesthesiologist and a homemaker, Dr. Daines grew up in Stanfordville, Utah, where his father served two terms as mayor. During college, Dr. Daines, an internist, spent two years in Bolivia as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints; to this day, he teaches Sunday school. He received his medical degree from Cornell in 1978 and ran the intensive care unit at St. Barnabas Hospital in the South Bronx, a center of activity in the AIDS and crack epidemics. He lives on the East Side of Manhattan with his wife, Linda, a managing director at Goldman Sachs. They also own a house in Dutchess County, closer to his new office in Albany, where, he says, “it feels a little like the first days of the New Deal; we’re fumbling our way toward some real solutions.”'"
"'07-02-02,'0','A lawsuit that prompted a 2003 Supreme Court decision over affirmative action admissions policies at the University of Michigan has been settled, concluding a nearly decade-long battle. The university will pay $10,000 each to the lead plaintiffs, Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher, to cover miscellaneous costs, both sides said. In exchange, the two agreed to drop all claims under a nearly 40,000-member class-action lawsuit against the university over its former affirmative action admissions policies. In June 2003, the Supreme Court upheld a general affirmative action policy at Michigan’s law school but struck down its undergraduate formula, which awarded admission points based on race. Ms. Gratz and Mr. Hamacher had sued over the undergraduate formula. In November, Michigan voters approved a ban on the use of race and gender preferences in university admissions and government hiring.'"
"'07-02-02,'0','Based on Autodata’s calculations, the industry ranking last month was G.M., Toyota of Japan, Chrysler and Ford. It was the second time in three months that Chrysler beat Ford; the previous time was in November. Ford is in the midst of a restructuring plan that is expected to permanently reduce its share of the American car market.Toyota passed the Chrysler Group last year to hold third place in the American market.January sales by G.M. fell 20.1 percent, while Ford sales fell 22.8 percent, according to Autodata. Both companies signaled this week that their sales would fall sharply in January, always one of the worst months for car and truck sales because of bad weather and a falloff in spending after the holidays.Sales at Chrysler, a division of DaimlerChrysler, fell 3.5 percent. G.M. and Ford each sold about 30,000 fewer vehicles to rental-car companies than they did a year ago. Chrysler said it cut its sales to rental companies by 10 percent in January, but did not release figures.In recent years, all three Detroit automakers have used rental agencies to keep their production at full tilt — a requirement because they must pay assembly workers whether or not their factories are running. But the practice can also flood the market for used cars, reduce resale values and make it harder to sell new models.In January 2005, so-called fleet sales to rental companies, government agencies and businesses accounted for nearly 40 percent of the sales by G.M., Ford and Chrysler. Last month, the figure was roughly 28 percent for Ford and 32 percent for G.M. Chrysler did not give a percentage, but industry executives calculated that it was higher than that of its rivals.Executives at the Detroit companies have said they will compensate for lower fleet sales by selling more vehicles to consumers. But it may take time to pick up the slack.As a result, those sales were disappointing in January, particularly at G.M., which has been trying to halt a decade-long decline in market share. Indeed, G.M. stressed Thursday that its sales to consumers rose in the final months of 2006. (Ward’s AutoInfoBank calculated that the Detroit companies held 53.3 percent of the American market in January, including their foreign brands.)“G.M. had pretty good momentum the last few months,” said Jesse Toprak, director of industry analysis at Edmunds.com, a Web site that gives consumers car-buying advice.Paul Ballew, G.M.’s chief sales analyst, acknowledged that sales to consumers in January were “modestly below where we expected to be.”Mr. Ballew said G.M. probably erred in reducing rebates and discounts by about $500 a car. G.M.’s discounts were worth an average of $2,365 in January, the lowest level for G.M. in nearly five years although still almost double what Toyota offered, according to Edmunds.“We probably dialed back our incentives a bit more than what we planned, and what our competitors are doing,” Mr. Ballew said.Ford increased its incentives in January by $676, to $3,502 a vehicle, while Chrysler had the highest discounts, worth an average of $3,853. On Thursday, Chrysler started a new coupon program that offers a discount on top of the cash-back incentives already being offered.Chrysler’s January discounts were a crucial reason its sales did not fall as much as those at G.M. and Ford, analysts said.Even with deep discounts, Chrysler dealers have had more trouble than usual clearing out leftover 2006 cars. Of the 488,000 vehicles in Chrysler’s inventory, about 18 percent are 2006 versions. The 2007 model year began in October.“It seems like this is a record level of prior-model vehicles to have in inventory at this time,” Ronald Tadross, an analyst with Bank of America Securities in New York, said on a conference call that Chrysler held for analysts and reporters.Chrysler’s incentives might also have kept Detroit’s automakers from falling to less than half of the market in January, a prospect some analysts see as inevitable.'"
"'07-02-02,'0','WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 — An F.B.I. agent told a jury Thursday that I. Lewis Libby Jr. “claimed” during formal interviews she conducted that he had not disclosed to two reporters the identity of Valerie Wilson, a Central Intelligence Agency operative.The testimony from Deborah S. Bond of the Federal Bureau of Investigation came at the beginning of prosecution efforts to close the circle in its case against Mr. Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. Mr. Libby is charged with lying to federal agents and to a grand jury investigating the leak of Ms. Wilson’s name.By the time Ms. Bond took the stand Thursday afternoon, the jury had already heard from the two reporters — Judith Miller, formerly of The New York Times, and Matthew Cooper, formerly of Time magazine. Ms. Miller testified that Mr. Libby had told her in detail about Ms. Wilson; Mr. Cooper said that Mr. Libby had been more terse, but that he had confirmed she worked at the C.I.A.In flat, unemotional tones, Ms. Bond recounted two interviews that she and other agents conducted with Mr. Libby in the Old Executive Office Building in October and November of 2003. In them, Mr. Libby gave answers that directly conflicted with the reporters’ accounts.At the time, the Justice Department was in the early stages of its investigation into how Ms. Wilson’s name was leaked to the press and whether the leak was part of an effort to retaliate against her husband, Joseph C. Wilson IV. Mr. Wilson had written an Op-Ed article published in The New York Times on July 6, 2003, asserting that the Bush administration had willfully distorted intelligence to justify invading Iraq.'"

But the public may assume that every casualty is a war wound, Dr. Kilpatrick said, so the site was changed to avoid misunderstandings.On Monday, the bottom line of the Defense Department’s Web page on casualties in Iraq listed a total of 47,657 “nonmortal casualties.”By Tuesday, the same page no longer showed a total for nonmortal casualties.

"'07-02-02,'0','JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 1 — In banner newspaper headlines and broadcast biographies, South Africans on Thursday mourned the death of Adelaide Tambo, a figure in the nation’s battle against apartheid and the wife of Oliver R. Tambo, an icon of the liberation struggle.Mrs. Tambo, 77, died unexpectedly late Wednesday at her home in Johannesburg. The cause of her death was not announced; she had received a clean bill of health from a doctor the previous day. Johannesburg’s Star newspaper, which devoted three-fourths of its front page to her death on Thursday, noted that South Africa’s president, Thabo Mbeki, was among those who went to Mrs. Tambo’s home as news of her death spread shortly after midnight.On Thursday, Mr. Mbeki said in a statement that Mrs. Tambo “contributed to the struggle immensely as an activist in her own right” apart from her husband, who was a global organizer and later president of the African National Congress, the locus of South Africa’s anti-apartheid movement in the 1960s and 1970s.Mrs. Tambo followed Mr. Tambo into exile in 1960 after South Africa’s white-ruled government cracked down on black dissidents after the notorious Sharpeville massacre, in which dozens of demonstrators were killed by the South African police. While Mr. Tambo roamed Africa and Europe rallying support for the anti-apartheid cause, his wife worked as a nurse and kept a home in London that sheltered other activists in exile, including Mr. Mbeki and Nelson R. Mandela.“She taught us to challenge everything,” Mr. Mbeki said in his statement on Thursday. “She would tell us, ‘Don’t let a single phrase slip by if it is wrong.’ ”Mrs. Tambo frequently said she enlisted in the anti-apartheid cause at age 10 after seeing her grandfather flogged into unconsciousness by white police officers in Vereeniging, a factory town not far from Johannesburg. By age 16, she was a courier for the African National Congress, and she became a local leader in the movement by age 18. During her years in exile, she seldom saw her husband. Mr. Tambo died of a stroke three years after the couple returned to South Africa in 1990, and a year before the nation became a democracy.'"
"'07-02-02,'0','WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 — A federal judge who dismissed a defamation lawsuit against The New York Times acted after concluding that the scientist who brought the case, a bioterrorism expert investigated over deadly anthrax mailings in 2001, was a public official and could not show that the newspaper had knowingly published false information.In an opinion released Thursday, the judge, Claude M. Hilton of the Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va., laid out the reasons for his order last month dismissing a long-running case brought by Steven J. Hatfill, a specialist in biological weapons. Dr. Hatfill’s lawsuit said a series of columns by Nicholas D. Kristof about the anthrax mailings had defamed him.Mark A. Grannis, a lawyer for Dr. Hatfill, said Judge Hilton’s opinion was unsurprising and was not the last word in the case.“The opinion is more or less what we expected, given the judge’s earlier statements,” Mr. Grannis said. “We will appeal, and we expect to prevail.”Mr. Kristof wrote about a government scientist whom he initially identified as Mr. Z, saying this scientist had become the overwhelming focus of the investigation into the anthrax attacks. Then, in August 2002, Mr. Kristof wrote that Dr. Hatfill, formerly with the Army bioweapons center at Fort Detrick, Md., had come forward to identify himself as Mr. Z and say the news media had treated him unfairly.'"
"'07-02-02,'0','The report strongly suggests that Mr. Aguirre was fired in retaliation for his criticism. At the same time, Senate investigators said they were “deeply troubled” by the failure of the S.E.C.’s inspector general, Walter J. Stachnik, to investigate Mr. Aguirre’s accusations properly.“The I.G. spoke only to Aguirre’s supervisors, accepted everything they said at face value and reviewed only documents identified by those supervisors,” the report concluded. “We believe the S.E.C. must take corrective and preventative action to ensure that future investigations, internal and external, do not follow the same path as the Pequot matter.”The S.E.C. should also consider reopening its Pequot investigation, the report states, though it takes no position on whether the fund or anyone connected to it engaged in any wrongdoing.The S.E.C. closed its inquiry without charging anyone in connection with the Pequot inquiry.John J. Nester, a spokesman for the S.E.C., said in a statement that because the matter was under review by other federal entities, which he did not name, the commission would have no comment.The report, which is based largely on Senate interviews with 19 crucial witnesses and thousands of pages of internal S.E.C. records, is a victory for Mr. Aguirre, who was fired in September 2005, just days after receiving a merit pay increase.At a Senate hearing in December, senior S.E.C. officials sought to justify his firing, arguing that he had done a poor job running the Pequot investigation and that he had been difficult to get along with. The officials asserted that Mr. Aguirre had once issued flawed subpoenas and that he had been unprofessional in the way he conducted an interview with Pequot’s founder, Arthur J. Samberg.There was scant documentary evidence to back up those charges, the report concluded. “We have noted the considerable lack of contemporaneous documents corroborating the concerns they raised,” it said.S.E.C. officials said the flawed subpoenas had seriously undermined their confidence in Mr. Aguirre. But, the report noted, those officials “produced no documents to the committees suggesting that they viewed it that way at the time.”The same held true for the examination of Mr. Samberg. In fact, the report states, one longtime S.E.C. investigator told the committee that he planned to use Mr. Aguirre’s examination “as a model for how to take testimony in his training of new S.E.C. attorneys.”The report called Mr. Aguirre “a smart, hardworking, aggressive attorney who was passionately dedicated to the Pequot investigation.”Mr. Aguirre testified that his troubles at the S.E.C. began when he asked for permission to examine John J. Mack, an influential Wall Street executive who was a close friend of Mr. Samberg. After initially supporting Mr. Aguirre’s decision, senior S.E.C. officials abruptly changed course, the report notes.“What is troubling is how this enthusiasm waned after public reports on June 23, 2005, that Morgan Stanley was considering hiring Mack as its new C.E.O.,” the report concludes.Mr. Aguirre was told that since he had no evidence linking Mr. Mack to suspected insider trading by Pequot, calling in Mr. Mack for an interview would not be justified.“The purpose of taking investigative testimony is not to confront a witness with accusations of wrongdoing, as Aguirre’s supervisors seem to believe,” the report states. “Rather it is to gather information that helps confirm or rule out working theories.”Mr. Mack and Mr. Samberg have repeatedly denied any improper conduct.Mr. Mack’s testimony was eventually taken in August 2006, more than a year after Mr. Aguirre proposed doing so.“We are concerned about the circumstances under which it was done,” investigators said. “Mack’s testimony was taken five days after the statute of limitations expired, and only a few months after we initiated our inquiry into this matter.”The report concludes that the S.E.C. finally interviewed Mr. Mack to deflect public criticism for not having done it earlier.'"

"'07-02-02,'0','More than 120 levees around the country could fail in a major flood and need to be better maintained, the Army Corps of Engineers said yesterday.The problems that led to what the corps called “unacceptable maintenance ratings” included erosion, tree growth on or too near levees, animal burrows and shifting soil.California has the largest number of problems, 37, and Washington State has 19. Louisiana has no levees on the list, said Maj. Gen. Don T.

"'07-02-02,'0','At a time of intensifying conflict between President Bush and Democrats in Congress over the Iraq war, the Democratic-led House acted this week to rescue another of Mr. Bush’s international priorities: the global fight against AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, diseases that kill millions of Africans each year.That Democrats stepped in to champion Mr. Bush’s signature global health undertakings suggests the deepening of political support for foreign aid programs, especially those that quickly demonstrate they can save hundreds of thousands of lives. It also bucks a historical pattern of declining support for foreign assistance when control of Congress and the White House is divided between Democrats and Republicans.“We’re in a different world now,” said Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York, who heads the appropriations subcommittee that oversees foreign aid. “This is the first time since Sept. 11 we’ve had a power split in Washington, and there’s a growing recognition among the public and policy makers that foreign assistance is critical to stability around the world.”The administration’s drive for a rapid strengthening of programs to prevent and treat AIDS and malaria had been caught in limbo. The departing Republican-led Congress had failed to pass spending bills to finance most federal agencies this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, including those that administer foreign aid.But the new Democratic leadership agreed this week to give the administration $4.5 billion this year to combat the big three global pandemics, $500 million more than the president himself had requested and over $1 billion more than if the undertakings had been required to continue at the previous year’s spending levels.'"
"'07-02-02,'0','Selling the securities would produce capital for the company, but that is viewed as an incidental result, not a reason to issue the securities. If the securities sold for a high value, few companies would choose to issue them — the reverse of what would be expected with a normal security.“Esoars seek to solve the problem of Black-Scholes overstating the options value,” said Evan Hill, a vice president of Zions who helped develop the security. “If Black-Scholes is not overstating the value, then Esoars does not solve anyone’s problem.”The Zion plan calls for investors to receive cash flows based on the profits received by option holders when they exercise their options, but after a delay averaging two months.The S.E.C. released a letter sent by its chief accountant, Conrad Hewitt, provisionally blessing the security as “sufficiently designed to be used as a market-based approach” to valuing employee stock options.In a statement Wednesday, Mr. Hewitt added that “an instrument’s design is just one of several factors that would have to be considered.”In his letter, he warned that the actual conduct of auctions could be critical, including whether there were enough bidders. If results of the auction diverged too much from what models forecast, that could be a reason not to use the results, he indicated.J. Richard Dietrich, the chairman of the accounting department at Ohio State University and a former academic fellow in the chief accountant’s office of the S.E.C., called the idea promising but warned of potential problems.Zion, he said, may have an incentive to produce low values through the auction process. “It would potentially get them a lot more customers,” he said.He said that one area that might need addressing was the timing of payments to investors.Under Zion’s proposal, if a company was issuing 10 million options to employees, it might sell securities representing 1 million options to investors. The offering would need to be large enough to attract investors, but not so large as to overwhelm the market and produce an unreasonably low price.To the extent employees forfeited options by leaving the company before they were allowed to cash in the options, the investors would receive a refund of the value of the security, plus interest.Then, when options were exercised by employees who remained, the investors would get the cash flow as if they had exercised the options, paid on a quarterly basis with an average delay of two months.Mr. Dietrich said that delay was one reason the auction could yield too low a price, and the S.E.C., in its letter, said issues relating to investor costs of holding would have to be considered.Mr. Hill of Zions said the security could be modified to include paying interest to offset the delay in the cash payments.A major problem with such auctions, and the reason that the S.E.C. may have to watch over them, is that they are fundamentally unlike other security sales in that both the seller and the buyer would be happy to see a low price — the buyer to get something cheap and the seller to be able to minimize the reported expense of issuing options to employees.Mr. Dietrich voiced questions about a statement by Zions that it might disqualify option bids intended to manipulate the market, asking if that might be a signal Zions was worried about keeping the price low.Mr. Hill said the possible manipulation he had sought to prevent with that proposal came from a worry that Wall Street competitors might try to drive up the price and thus reduce the attractiveness of Zion’s security to potential issuers.'"

"'07-02-02,'0','Many energy and environment experts see such a doubling as a foregone conclusion sometime after midcentury unless there is a prompt and sustained shift away from the 20th-century pattern of unfettered burning of coal and oil, the main sources of carbon dioxide, and an aggressive quest for expanded and improved nonpolluting energy options.Even an increased level of warming that falls in the middle of the group’s range of projections would likely cause significant stress to ecosystems and alter longstanding climate patterns that shape water supplies and agricultural production, according to many climate experts and biologists.While the new report projected a modest rise in seas by 2100 — between 7 and 23 inches — it also concluded that seas would continue to rise, and crowded coasts retreat, for at least 1,000 years to come. By comparison, seas rose about 6 to 9 inches in the 20th century.John P. Holdren, an energy and climate expert at Harvard University, said that the “report powerfully underscores the need for a massive effort to slow the pace of global climatic disruption before intolerable consequences become inevitable.” [Read a report by Mr. Holdren. (PDF format)]“Since 2001 there has been a torrent of new scientific evidence on the magnitude, human origins and growing impacts of the climatic changes that are underway,” said Mr. Holdren, who is the president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “In overwhelming proportions, this evidence has been in the direction of showing faster change, more danger and greater confidence about the dominant role of fossil fuel burning and tropical deforestation in causing the changes that are being observed.”The conclusions came after a three-year review of hundreds of studies of clues illuminating past climate shifts, observations of retreating ice, warming and rising seas, and other shifts around the planet, and a greatly expanded suite of supercomputer simulations used to test how earth will respond to a building blanket of gases that hold heat in the atmosphere.The section released today was a 20-page summary for policymakers, which was approved early this morning by teams of officials from more than 100 countries after three days and nights of wrangling over wording with the lead authors, all of whom are scientists.It described far-flung ramifications for both humans and nature.“It is very likely that hot extremes, heat waves and heavy precipitation events will continue to become more frequent,” said the summary.Generally, the scientists said, more precipitation will fall at higher latitudes, which are likely also to see lengthened growing seasons, while semi-arid, subtropical regions already chronically beset by drought could see a further 20-percent drop in rainfall under the midrange scenario for increases in the greenhouse gases.The summary added a new chemical consequence of the buildup of carbon dioxide to the list of mainly climatic and biological impacts foreseen in its previous reports: a drop in the pH of seawater as oceans absorb billions of tons of carbon dioxide, which forms carbonic acid when partly dissolved. Marine biologists have said that could imperil some kinds of corals and plankton.A vast improvement in the science of climatology — including “larges amounts of new and more comprehensive data” — has allowed the group to become far more confident and specific in its predictions, compared with its previous assessment in 2001, the authors said.The report essentially caps a half-century-long effort to discern whether humans, through the buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases released mainly by burning fuels and forests, could influence the earth’s climate system in potentially momentous ways.The group operates under the aegis of the United Nations and was chartered in 1988 — a year of record heat, burning forests, and the first big headlines about global warming — to provide regular reviews of climate science to governments to inform policy choices.Government officials are involved in shaping the summary of each report, but the scientist-authors, who are unpaid, have the final say over the thousands of pages in four underlying technical reports that will be completed and published later this year.Big questions remain about the speed and extent of some impending changes, both because of uncertainty about future population and pollution trends and the complex interrelationships of the greenhouse emissions, clouds, dusty kinds of pollution, the oceans and earth’s veneer of life, which both emits and soaks up carbon dioxide and other such gases.But a broad array of scientists, including authors of the report and independent experts, said the latest analysis was the most sobering view yet of a century of transition — after thousands of years of relatively stable climate conditions — to a new norm of continual change.Should greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere at even a moderate pace, average temperatures by the end of the century could match those last seen 125,000 years ago, in the previous warm spell between ice ages, the report said.At that time, the panel said, sea levels were 12 to 20 feet higher than they are now. Muych of that extra water is now trapped in the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, which are eroding in some places.The panel said there was no solid scientific understanding of how rapidly the vast stores of ice in polar regions will melt, so their estimates on new sea levels were based mainly on how much the warmed oceans will expand, and not on contributions from the melting of ice now on land.Other scientists have recently reported evidence that the glaciers and ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctic could flow seaward far more quickly than estimated in the past, and they have proposed that the risks to coastal areas could be much more imminent. But the I.P.C.C. is proscribed by its charter from entering into speculation, and so could not include such possible instabilities in its assessment.Michel Jarraud, the secretary general of the United Nations World Meteorological Organization, said the lack of clarity should offer no one comfort. “The speed with which melting ice sheets are raising sea levels is uncertain, but the report makes clear that sea levels will rise inexorably over the coming centuries,” he said. “It is a question of when and how much, and not if,” he said, adding: “While the conclusions are disturbing, decision makers are now armed with the latest facts and will be better able to respond to these realities.”Achim Steiner, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, which oversees the I.P.C.C. along with the meteorological group, said society now had plenty of information on which to act.“The implications of global warming over the coming decades for our industrial economy, water supplies, agriculture, biological diversity and even geopolitics are massive,” he said. “This new report should spur policymakers to get off the fence and put strong and effective policies in place to tackle greenhouse gas emissions.”The warming and other climate shifts will be highly variable around the world, with the Arctic particularly seeing much higher temperatures, said Susan Solomon, the co-leader of the team writing the summary and the section of the I.P.C.C. report on basic science. She is an atmospheric scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The kinds of vulnerabilities are very much dependent on where you are, Dr. Solomon said in a telephone interview. “If you’re living in parts of tropics and they’re getting drier and you’re a farmer there are some very acute issues associated with even small changes in rainfall — changes we’re already seeing are significant,” she said. “If you are an Inuit and you’re seeing your sea ice retreating already that’s affecting your lifestyle and culture.”The 20-page summary is a sketch of the findings that are most germane to the public and world leaders.The full I.P.C.C. report, thousands of pages of technical background, will be released in four sections through the year — the first on basic science, then sections on impacts and options for limiting emissions and limiting inevitable harms, and finally a synthesis of all of the findings near year’s end.In a news conference in Paris, Dr. Solomon declined to provide her own views on how society should respond to the momentous changes projected in the study.“I honestly believe that it would be a much better service for me to keep my personal opinions separate than what I can actually offer the world as a scientist,” she said. “My stepson, who is 29, has an utterly different view of risks than I do. People are going to have to make their own judgments.”Some authors of the report said that no one could honestly point to any remaining uncertainties as justification for further delay.“Policy makers paid us to do good science, and now we have high very scientific confidence in this work — this is real, this is real, this is real,” said Richard B. Alley, one of the lead authors and a professor at Penn State University. “So now act, the ball’s back in your court.”'"

Can you say, ‘Horrible three-way civil war?’ ”July 14, 2003: “I opposed the war in Iraq because I thought it would lead to the peace from hell, but I’d rather not see my prediction come true and I don’t think we have much time left to avert it. That the occupation is not going well is apparent to everyone but Donald Rumsfeld. ...

Not the first time I’ve had a bet out that I hoped I’d lose.”So Molly Ivins — who didn’t mingle with the great and famous, didn’t have sources high in the administration, and never claimed special expertise on national security or the Middle East — got almost everything right. Meanwhile, how did those who did have all those credentials do?With very few exceptions, they got everything wrong. They bought the obviously cooked case for war — or found their own reasons to endorse the invasion. They didn’t see the folly of the venture, which was almost as obvious in prospect as it is with the benefit of hindsight. And they took years to realize that everything we were being told about progress in Iraq was a lie.Was Molly smarter than all the experts? No, she was just braver. The administration’s exploitation of 9/11 created an environment in which it took a lot of courage to see and say the obvious.Molly had that courage; not enough others can say the same.And it’s not over. Many of those who failed the big test in 2002 and 2003 are now making excuses for the “surge.” Meanwhile, the same techniques of allegation and innuendo that were used to promote war with Iraq are being used to ratchet up tensions with Iran.Now, more than ever, we need people who will stand up against the follies and lies of the powerful.

"'07-02-03,'0','A key scene in “The Messengers” finds an anxious mom, Denise (Penelope Ann Miller), waking up in the farmhouse her family has just moved into, and discovering that the hideous dark stain she scrubbed out of her bedroom wallpaper just yesterday has reappeared at full strength.This image is not just a plot point; it’s a metaphor for the brand of horror filmmaking practiced by the movie’s directors, Danny and Oxide Pang (“The Eye”), a brother team based in Hong Kong and Thailand, making their United States debut. Even when they’re working with weak material — the case with this haunted house picture, set around a South Dakota farm where a Chicago family has settled — the Pangs devise scenes so scary that they stain the imagination and never scrub out.Poor Denise; her would-be farmer husband, Roy (Dylan McDermott); her troubled teenage daughter, Jess (Kristen Stewart); and her mute toddler son, Ben (Evan and Theodore Turner) clearly didn’t see “The Amityville Horror.” Otherwise, they wouldn’t spend more than one night in their new house, a desolate place with nighttime creaks aplenty, plus hair-raising apparitions (including a skittering thing that Ben thinks is his playmate) and an aggressive flock of crows.The children bear the brunt of the terror, and of course the parents don’t understand; little Ben can’t speak, and Jess is permanently grounded after a traumatic lapse in judgment that precipitated the family’s move. The nomadic handyman, Burwell (a ponytailed John Corbett), who joins in the planting of sunflowers and befriends Jess, is a cryptic rock, but faced with such an immense evil that he’s bound to break.Like too many horror pictures, “The Messengers” becomes more boringly prosaic as it goes along, and there’s an 11th-hour plot twist so dumb and poorly articulated that it destroys the movie. That’s a shame, because shot for shot, the Pangs might be the most terrifying filmmakers alive.Drawing equally on recent Japanese horror (that stain image was in “Dark Water”) and 1930s don’t-open-that-door tropes, “The Messengers” is every ghost movie ever made, done better than many. Off-center compositions leave vast, empty spaces where evil can lurk; a nervous camera catches blurry figures an instant before they disappear behind a door frame; fiendishly mixed sound effects make it seem as if foul forces are rattling about, not just in the attic or basement, but inside your head. “The Messengers” is an unsatisfying film, but anyone who claims not to be scared by it is lying.“The Messengers” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has supernatural shocks and brutal violence, mostly implied, but some explicit.Directed by Danny Pang and Oxide Pang; written by Mark Wheaton, based on a story by Todd Farmer; director of photography, David Geddes; edited by John Axelrad and Armen Minasian; music by Joseph LoDuca; production designer, Alicia Keywan; produced by Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert, William Sherak and Jason Shuman; released by Screen Gems, Ghost House Pictures and Columbia Pictures.

"'07-02-03,'0','That a single letter prodded the F.B.I. to action illustrates how slender are the time-brittled fibers that knit together the outcome in these fading crimes.In the case that produced the recent arrest, timing was crucial. If the bodies of the victims, Henry H. Dee and Charles E. Moore, had been found just three weeks earlier in the summer of 1964, their deaths might have been largely forgotten.The two friends, a sawmill worker and a college student, were 19 when they disappeared in May 1964, last seen hitchhiking on the highway near Meadville, Miss. They were beaten and drowned by Klansmen who mistakenly believed the two were involved in plotting an armed uprising. Two months later, on July 12, a fisherman spotted the torso of Mr. Moore in a Mississippi River backwater called the Old River. Mr. Dee was found the next day.At the time, an extensive search was under way for three civil rights workers, two of whom were white New Yorkers, who had disappeared on the opposite end of the state in what became known as the “Mississippi Burning” case. The initial classification of Mr. Moore’s body as that of a Caucasian male, and thus potentially one of the missing rights workers, caused a spurt of media coverage.That fleeting interest had two results, said David Ridgen, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation producer who has made a documentary about the case. It prompted the F.B.I. to investigate, and it ensured that there was enough in the historical record to arouse the curiosity, decades later, of scholars and reporters.Countless other race killings, however, were minimally recorded. In the late 1980s, when the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., was creating its memorial to 40 civil rights martyrs, most of whose cases remain unprosecuted, researchers found more than 80 victims who could not be included because not enough was known about the circumstances of their deaths.“It was so frustrating and sad,” said Sarah Bullard, the project’s chief researcher. “If the information wasn’t there I couldn’t include them, no matter what I suspected or felt.”Mr. Burrus of the F.B.I. said he was not familiar with the monument or the center’s research, but that the bureau had also consulted civil rights groups in compiling its list.Because local newspapers often ignored such killings, Ms. Bullard pored over microfilm of national newspapers and records compiled by the Tuskegee Institute, internal memorandums of the N.A.A.C.P. and other civil rights groups, and cartons of news clippings collected by a research group called the Southern Regional Council and stored in the basement of a Korean grocery in Atlanta.Ms. Bullard recalled references to an unidentified teenager who was found in the Big Black River in Mississippi wearing a Congress of Racial Equality T-shirt. After scouring all her sources, she learned only his name, Herbert Oarsby.“There were activists who were trying to pay attention,” Ms. Bullard said, “but at the same time there were African-American communities who knew that racist crimes amongst them were not going to be investigated or reported and made the choice not to seek justice because it would bring on further violence against them.”That may have been the case with Mr. Moore’s mother, Mazie, who made her elder son Thomas promise not to avenge or seek justice for his brother’s death. In 1964, when reporters found her at the country shack where she had lived all her life, she repeatedly praised the white residents of Franklin County, a Klan stronghold, and said there was nothing to be done.Alvin Sykes, a civil rights advocate who has urged the federal government to pass the Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Bill, which would provide $11.5 million per year to investigate these cases, said part of that money would be used to encourage people scared into silence at the time to come forward. “We have absolutely no idea how many of them are out there,” Mr. Sykes said.Mazie Moore died in 1977, and in 1998 Thomas Moore finally decided to seek justice, contacting the local district attorney, Ronnie Harper, who was unaware of the case. Mr. Harper requested information from the F.B.I., and was told that no file on the case existed.But in 2000 two journalists, Jerry Mitchell of The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson and Harry Phillips of ABC News, obtained copies of the F.B.I. investigation file that was said to be missing, which had led to the arrest of Charles M. Edwards and James F. Seale in November 1964, though the charges were dropped when the district attorney said there was not enough evidence to make a case.Mr. Phillips used the file to track down the F.B.I.’s principal informant, Ernest Gilbert, then 74, persuading him to do an on-camera interview about the case, and Mr. Mitchell reported that because the crime began in the Homochitto National Forest, where the two victims were tied to trees and beaten with switches, federal prosecutors might have jurisdiction in the case.But even those breakthroughs did not force prosecutors to act. Mr. Harper says he was told by the F.B.I. that Mr. Gilbert would not testify. The F.B.I. closed the case in 2003 because the jurisdiction issue could not be resolved, said Deborah Madden, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. office in Jackson. Mr. Gilbert died in 2004.Thomas Moore, living in Colorado Springs, grew tired of telling reporters his brother’s story with no result. But in 2005, Mr. Ridgen, the documentary producer, convinced him that the two should go back to Mississippi together.On that trip, they discovered that Mr. Seale was not dead, as several newspapers had reported, but was still living in Franklin County. Then came a coincidence: Thomas Moore had served in the same Army unit as Dunn Lampton, who became the United States attorney in Jackson in 2001. Mr. Moore and Mr. Ridgen persuaded Mr. Lampton to reopen the case, resulting in the recent arrest of Mr. Seale, who has pleaded not guilty.“Thomas Moore had a lot of information about what happened, and I made use of that,” Mr. Lampton said. “You don’t come into an office and go back and start digging through all the old files to find something to do. It’s only when someone brings that to your attention.”'"
"'07-02-03,'0','The administration has also intensified its criticism of Iran, accusing it of fueling the sectarian violence in Iraq and providing Shiite militias with material for bombs that the administration says have been used in attacks on American forces. The White House has thus far made little evidence public to support its case.The intelligence report did conclude that Iran is providing “lethal support” for Shiite groups that is intensifying the violence. But it portrayed the violence as essentially “self-sustaining,” and suggested that the involvement of outsiders, including Iran, was “not likely to be a major driver of violence or the prospects for stability.”National Intelligence Estimates provide a consensus of the 16 agencies that make up the intelligence community.In choosing to take the rare step of making public three and a half pages of “key judgments” from the classified report, administration officials seized on one conclusion — that American forces remain “an essential stabilizing element in Iraq” — to reinforce their view that more troops are needed to secure Baghdad and give Iraqi leaders breathing room to develop a political settlement, particularly between the warring Sunnis and Shiites.But top Democratic lawmakers said the estimate’s conclusions supported their view that the best way to combat violence in Baghdad would be through new political and diplomatic programs.The declassified portions included an assessment that an Iraqi military hampered by sectarian divisions would be “hard pressed” over the next 12 to 18 months to “execute significantly increased security responsibilities, and particularly to operate independently against Shia militias with any success.”The report also concluded that security in Iraq would continue to deteriorate at current rates unless “measurable progress” can be made in efforts to reverse the conditions that fuel violence.The full classified report was said by officials to be about 90 pages in length, and was provided to the White House and members of Congress. Top Democrats said the release of the intelligence estimate would strengthen their hand as the Senate prepares for a possible vote next week on a nonbinding resolution opposing President Bush’s new Iraq strategy.“The estimate reaffirms my belief that the best hope for progress toward stabilizing Iraq lies only with the Iraqi people and their political leaders,” Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, the West Virginia Democrat and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. “The steps identified by the intelligence community as having the best chance of reversing the chaos and bloodshed in Iraq are all political developments, not military.”But Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, said at the White House that the estimate “gives us some evidence” of why Mr. Bush had concluded that “an American withdrawal or stepping back now would be a prescription for fast failure and a chaos that would envelop not only Iraq, but the region.”Mr. Hadley said the estimate also bolstered the White House strategy of sending more than 20,000 new troops into Iraq.The previous National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, in the summer of 2004, detailed three possible outlooks for Iraq over the following 18 months, with the most pessimistic possibility that Iraq would descend into civil war.By contrast the new report, struggling to describe the nature of the ongoing violence, said that calling it a “civil war” was hardly sufficient.“The intelligence community judges that the term ‘civil war’ does not adequately capture the complexity of the conflict in Iraq, which includes extensive Shia-on-Shia violence, Al Qaeda and Sunni insurgent attacks on coalition forces, and widespread criminally motivated violence,” the assessment read.John E. McLaughlin, who oversaw the previous intelligence estimate when he was acting director of central intelligence, said that he believed that intelligence officials in 2004 had presciently assessed what was to come in Iraq, but that the escalation of sectarian violence over the past year had made the situation even more complex.“Civil war is checkers,” he said. “This is chess.”The report also warned that a further sectarian splintering of Iraq could incite other countries in the Middle East to arm and finance various sects in the country: Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt supporting the Sunnis, and Iran coming to the aid of Shiite forces.A National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq that was produced in 2002 in the prelude to the American invasion has become infamous as an example of an intelligence failure, because most of its central assertions about Iraq’s weapons capabilities and ties to terrorism have since been proven to have been mistaken.Since then, American intelligence officials have made efforts to overhaul the process to produce the reports, in part by giving new emphasis to dissenting views that were once buried in obscure footnotes.The latest analysis is understood to contain multiple dissents, one of which concerns the role of Syria in supporting Sunni insurgents in Iraq.Intelligence analysts have been divided over whether it is the policy of the government in Damascus to aid the flow of foreign fighters who enter Iraq from Syria, or whether that assistance is the work of lower-level Syrian officials acting on their own.American intelligence analysts have also disagreed about the extent to which Iranian government officials are aware of the flow of Qaeda operatives between Iran and Iraq.Beyond the current grim picture, the report described several “triggering events” that could cause the situation to worsen significantly. Among them, it listed the assassination of major religious or political leaders, a complete Sunni defection from the government, and sustained mass sectarian killings that could “shift Iraq’s trajectory from gradual decline to rapid deterioration with grave humanitarian, political and security consequences.”Were the already fragile government to collapse, the report outlined three possible outcomes: the emergence of a Shiite strongman to assert authority over minority sects, an “anarchic” fragmentation that puts power in the hands of hundreds of local potentates, or a period of sustained, bloody fighting leading to partition of Iraq along ethnic lines.“Collapse of this magnitude would generate fierce violence for at least several years,” the report concluded, “ranging well beyond the time frame of this estimate, before settling into a partially stable end-state.”'"
"'07-02-03,'0','To be sure, Nissan will still be profitable for all of 2006, and it still earned money from October through December, which is the third quarter in Japan’s fiscal year.But the lower results were enough to prompt a vow from Mr. Ghosn to put in place yet more cost-saving measures, with details to be made available in April.“We have today a performance crisis,” Mr. Ghosn told industry analysts in a video presentation from Paris, where Renault is based. “For the first time since 1999, risks outweighed opportunities.”The announcement was the latest setback for Mr. Ghosn, who gambled and lost last summer on a high-stakes alliance with General Motors. An alliance was pushed by the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, G.M.’s biggest shareholder at the time.It was one more distraction for Mr. Ghosn, who spends 10 days a month in Tokyo running Nissan and two weeks in Paris, where he has been carrying out a turnaround plan at Renault.For his part, Mr. Ghosn was sanguine on Friday. “This is not in the culture of Nissan, to miss something that has been forecast, particularly when it’s relative to profit,” he said. “We’re going to be very cautious when we give forecasts from now on.”Analysts noted that Nissan continued to fare better than many in the industry. Indeed, from 1999 to 2006, Nissan’s market capitalization more than quintupled, to $52.3 billion from $9.7 billion.Ford, on the other hand, said last month that it lost $12.7 billion in 2006, when it put in place and then expanded a restructuring plan it calls the Way Forward. G.M., for its part, is in the midst of its own restructuring, after a loss of $10.6 billion in 2005. G.M. said last month that it expected to be profitable for the fourth quarter, but it has delayed reporting its 2006 results.Given that, some analysts say Mr. Ghosn suffers from heightened expectations.Nissan blamed rising costs for commodities like steel and energy and slower sales for the worse-than-expected results, which could hurt the performance of Renault. Shares of Renault declined 4.2 percent in trading on Friday. The news came after Tokyo markets had closed, so there was no impact on Nissan stock.Nissan said its global sales slid 3 percent from October to December, although revenue was up slightly. The company lost its No. 2 ranking in Japan to Honda last year and a lack of new models kept sales flat in the United States, where 60 percent of Nissan’s profits are generated.In the last quarter, the company said it earned 104.4 billion yen ($861 million), down from 135 billion yen ($1.1 billion) a year earlier and 32 percent lower than analysts’ estimates. For the fiscal year ending March 31, Nissan cut its earnings target by 12 percent, to 460 billion yen ($3.8 billion) from a previous projection of 523 billion yen ($4.3 billion).“Ghosn is a target-driven manager. This is a case where the reality of the market has impeded the target,” said Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley in Paris. “To preserve the franchise long-term, some targets just aren’t worth making. Ghosn still has a strong reputation, but nobody’s perfect.”Mr. Ghosn’s reputation attracted the interest of Mr. Kerkorian, who proposed that G.M. consider a global alliance with Nissan-Renault. Some analysts viewed the move as a strategy to unseat G.M.’s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, and install Mr. Ghosn. Talks began in July but fell apart in October, after G.M. demanded billions of dollars in up-front payments from Nissan as a condition of a deal.As those talks were under way, Ford Motor’s chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., called Mr. Ghosn and suggested the two discuss partnership opportunities if an alliance with G.M. did not happen.Since then, Ford has hired a new chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, and Mr. Ghosn has said on several visits to Detroit that he is not interested in opening talks with another automaker, at least until he is more comfortable with Nissan’s performance.'"

"'07-02-03,'0','SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 2 — Lone Star Funds, the United States buyout firm whose multibillion-dollar sale of its investment in Korea Exchange Bank was blocked by South Korean prosecutors, will recoup almost a third of its original investment in a move that drew divided reaction.Korea Exchange Bank officials said Friday that it would pay a $445 million dividend, its first in a decade, despite a 48 percent plunge in its net profit last year.The bank said it is giving out $688 million to its shareholders, or 1,000 won a share. Lone Star, based in Dallas, controls 64.6 percent of the bank, one of the largest lenders in South Korea. It paid 1.4 trillion won ($1.5 billion) for the majority stake in 2003.The move raised hackles among South Korean activists, who have accused Lone Star and other foreign equity funds of acting like vultures.“Recouping part of its investment now is not an appropriate attitude we can expect from a fund on trial for that investment,” said Chung Jong-nam, secretary general of Spec Watch Korea, a civic group that has filed a lawsuit in an attempt to annul Lone Star’s 2003 transaction. “I don’t think it will do any good for Lone Star’s image here.”'"
"'07-02-03,'0','Decades of subordination to Sunni political, social, and economic domination have made the Shia deeply insecure about their hold on power. This insecurity leads the Shia to mistrust U.S. efforts to reconcile Iraqi sects and reinforces their unwillingness to engage with the Sunnis on a variety of issues, including adjusting the structure of Iraq’s federal system, reining in Shia militias, and easing de-Baathification.Many Sunni Arabs remain unwilling to accept their minority status, believe the central government is illegitimate and incompetent, and are convinced that Shia dominance will increase Iranian influence over Iraq, in ways that erode the state’s Arab character and increase Sunni repression.The absence of unifying leaders among the Arab Sunni or Shia with the capacity to speak for or exert control over their confessional groups limits prospects for reconciliation. The Kurds remain willing to participate in Iraqi state-building but reluctant to surrender any of the gains in autonomy they have achieved.The Kurds are moving systematically to increase their control of Kirkuk to guarantee annexation of all or most of the city and province into the Kurdistan Regional Government (K.R.G.) after the constitutionally mandated referendum scheduled to occur no later than 31 December 2007. Arab groups in Kirkuk continue to resist violently what they see as Kurdish encroachment.Despite real improvements, the Iraqi Security Forces (I.S.F.) — particularly the Iraqi police — will be hard pressed in the next 12-18 months to execute significantly increased security responsibilities, and particularly to operate independently against Shia militias with success. Sectarian divisions erode the dependability of many units, many are hampered by personnel and equipment shortfalls, and a number of Iraqi units have refused to serve outside of the areas where they were recruited.Extremists — most notably the Sunni jihadist group Al Qaeda in Iraq (A.Q.I.) and Shia oppositionist Jaysh al-Mahdi (J.A.M.) — continue to act as very effective accelerators for what has become a self-sustaining inter-sectarian struggle between Shia and Sunnis.Significant population displacement, both within Iraq and the movement of Iraqis into neighboring countries, indicates the hardening of ethno-sectarian divisions, diminishes Iraq’s professional and entrepreneurial classes, and strains the capacities of the countries to which they have relocated. The U.N. estimates over a million Iraqis are now in Syria and Jordan.The Intelligence Community judges that the term “civil war” does not adequately capture the complexity of the conflict in Iraq, which includes extensive Shia-on-Shia violence, Al Qaeda and Sunni insurgent attacks on coalition forces, and widespread criminally motivated violence. Nonetheless, the term “civil war” accurately describes key elements of the Iraqi conflict, including the hardening of ethno-sectarian identities, a sea change in the character of the violence, ethno-sectarian mobilization, and population displacements.Coalition capabilities, including force levels, resources, and operations, remain an essential stabilizing element in Iraq.If coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this estimate, we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq, intensify Sunni resistance to the Iraqi government, and have adverse consequences for national reconciliation.If such a rapid withdrawal were to take place, we judge that the I.S.F. would be unlikely to survive as a nonsectarian national institution; neighboring countries — invited by Iraqi factions or unilaterally — might intervene openly in the conflict; massive civilian casualties and forced population displacement would be probable; A.Q.I. would attempt to use parts of the country — particularly Al Anbar Province — to plan increased attacks in and outside of Iraq; and spiraling violence and political disarray in Iraq, along with Kurdish moves to control Kirkuk and strengthen autonomy, could prompt Turkey to launch a military incursion.A number of identifiable developments could help to reverse the negative trends driving Iraq’s current trajectory. They include:¶Broader Sunni acceptance of the current political structure and federalism to begin to reduce one of the major sources of Iraq’s instability.¶Significant concessions by Shia and Kurds to create space for Sunni acceptance of federalism.¶A bottom-up approach — deputizing, resourcing, and working more directly with neighborhood watch groups and establishing grievance committees — to help mend frayed relationships between tribal and religious groups, which have been mobilized into communal warfare over the past three years.A key enabler for all of these steps would be stronger Iraqi leadership, which could enhance the positive impact of all the above developments.Iraq’s neighbors influence, and are influenced by, events within Iraq, but the involvement of these outside actors is not likely to be a major driver of violence or the prospects for stability because of the self-sustaining character of Iraq’s internal sectarian dynamics.Nonetheless, Iranian lethal support for select groups of Iraqi Shia militants clearly intensifies the conflict in Iraq. Syria continues to provide safe haven for expatriate Iraqi Baathists and to take less than adequate measures to stop the flow of foreign jihadists into Iraq.For key Sunni regimes, intense communal warfare, Shia gains in Iraq, and Iran’s assertive role have heightened fears of regional instability and unrest and contributed to a growing polarization between Iran and Syria on the one hand and other Middle East governments on the other.But traditional regional rivalries, deepening ethnic and sectarian violence in Iraq over the past year, persistent anti-Americanism in the region, anti-Shia prejudice among Arab states, and fears of being perceived by their publics as abandoning their Sunni co-religionists in Iraq have constrained Arab states’ willingness to engage politically and economically with the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad and led them to consider unilateral support to Sunni groups.Turkey does not want Iraq to disintegrate and is determined to eliminate the safe haven in northern Iraq of the Kurdistan People’s Congress (K.G.K., formerly P.K.K.) — a Turkish Kurdish terrorist group.A number of identifiable internal security and political triggering events, including sustained mass sectarian killings, assassination of major religious and political leaders, and a complete Sunni defection from the government have the potential to convulse severely Iraq’s security environment. Should these events take place, they could spark an abrupt increase in communal and insurgent violence and shift Iraq’s trajectory from gradual decline to rapid deterioration with grave humanitarian, political, and security consequences. Three prospective security paths might then emerge:¶Chaos leading to partition. With a rapid deterioration in the capacity of Iraq’s central government to function, security services and other aspects of sovereignty would collapse. Resulting widespread fighting could produce de facto partition, dividing Iraq into three mutually antagonistic parts. Collapse of this magnitude would generate fierce violence for at least several years, ranging well beyond the time frame of this estimate, before settling into a partially stable end-state.¶Emergence of a Shia strongman. Instead of a disintegrating central government producing partition, a security implosion could lead Iraq’s potentially most powerful group, the Shia, to assert its latent strength.¶Anarchic fragmentation of power. The emergence of a checkered pattern of local control would present the greatest potential for instability, mixing extreme ethno-sectarian violence with debilitating intra-group clashes.'"
"'07-02-03,'0','SAN RAMON, Calif., Feb. 2 (AP) — The Chevron Corporation’s fourth-quarter profit fell by 9 percent as energy prices declined, but the company still ended up with its third consecutive year of record earnings.Chevron said Friday that it made $3.77 billion, or $1.74 a share, during the final three months of 2006. That compared with net income of $4.14 billion, or $1.86 a share, a year earlier.The profit decline was the first quarterly drop in more than a year but the profit was 1 cent higher than the $1.73 expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.Revenue for the period totaled $47.7 billion, down 11 percent from $53.8 billion in the previous year.Like its industry peers, Chevron has been hurt recently by a decline in crude oil prices, which have fallen more than $20 a barrel from their peak reached last summer.Lower natural gas prices, however, hurt Chevron even more. The company said its average price for natural gas sold in the United States fell 42 percent during the fourth quarter to $5.90 per thousand cubic feet. Natural gas prices in 2005 soared after damage in the Gulf of Mexico caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita created supply shortages.The unit that refines oil and sells gasoline earned $611 million outside the United States during the fourth quarter, a 44 percent increase from $423 million in 2005, helped by a weaker dollar.'"

We were 8-8 last year, and that’s encouraging.”Ted Thompson, the Packers’ general manager, said Favre called him to say he was “going to give it another shot.” He said Favre told him he thought it was better for the team if he did not delay his decision.“There were fewer uncertainties going into this off-season,” Thompson said. “Last year, there was a coaching change and other things that I think they had to work through.”He added, “In our conversations prior to the end of the season, I knew he was having a good time and he liked the team.”Favre seemed to echo those comments to The Sun Herald.“My offensive line looks good, the defense played good down the stretch,” Favre said. “I’m excited about playing for a talented, young football team.”Favre has started 257 consecutive games, including the playoffs, a record for quarterbacks.

"'07-02-03,'0','CHICAGO, Feb. 2 — Same-sex domestic partners are not entitled to health benefits from public universities or local and state governments under the State Constitution’s two-year-old marriage amendment, the Michigan Court of Appeals said in a ruling released Friday.In a reversal of a lower court ruling, a three-judge panel found that the amendment, which bans same-sex marriage, also prohibited government agencies from recognizing “similar unions” like domestic partnerships for any purposes.“By officially recognizing a same-sex union through the vehicle of a domestic partnership agreement, public employers give same-sex domestic couples similar status to that of married couples,” the judges wrote.Such action, they added, would “run directly afoul of the plain language of the amendment.”The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a supporting brief in the case, expressed “deep disappointment” with the decision and said it would appeal to the State Supreme Court.The issue of benefits became contentious when Michigan voters passed the marriage amendment in November 2004 because several public employers, including universities and local governments, had policies or agreements in place that extended health care to same-sex domestic partners of employees.'"
"'07-02-03,'0','The former Patriots linebacker Ted Johnson, who retired in 2005, told The New York Times for an article published Friday that he believed concussions he sustained in the N.F.L. led to his severe depression and addiction to amphetamines. His neurologist, Dr. Robert Cantu, said that Johnson, 34, displayed early signs of Alzheimer’s disease.Johnson is just the latest former player to wonder whether postcareer ailments are linked to the injuries and medical treatment he received in the N.F.L. In November, the former Eagles player Andre Waters committed suicide, and tests later revealed he had significant brain damage from football-related concussions.“We have had a concussion committee that has been studying this issue from a medical standpoint, including 12 doctors — five are from the outside and seven from the N.F.L. — that have been looking at this issue and trying to see what it is we can learn about concussions that would be helpful as we go forward,” N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said during the commissioner’s annual news conference Friday, two days before the Super Bowl.Upon the committee’s recommendation, which runs counter to most modern medical guidelines, many players who sustain a concussion in games are allowed to return to the game if they appear to have recovered.Johnson said he returned to the practice field four days after a concussion in August 2002. Despite the recommendation from the Patriots’ trainer that Johnson be protected at practice, Coach Bill Belichick sent Johnson into a high-impact drill, Johnson said.Johnson, feeling he was being tested and that his job was on the line (N.F.L. contracts are not guaranteed), did as he was told. He hit his head in the next drill, he said, and immediately felt woozy. He finished practice. Weeks later, having missed two preseason games and still feeling lingering effects, he approached Belichick.“I had to see if you could play,” Belichick said, according to Johnson. Johnson was so angry that he temporarily left the team.Belichick told The Boston Globe that he remembered the meeting. “If Ted felt so strongly that he didn’t feel he was ready to practice with us, he should have told me,” Belichick said.He added: “I’m sure in part of that conversation I apologized for things I said or did, as he did for his actions and his emotions following his decision to leave the team. If I made a mistake or hurt Ted in any way, I don’t feel good about that.”The Patriots’ owner, Robert Kraft, declined to answer questions about the possibility that Belichick, the winning coach in three of the past five Super Bowls, went against the advice of team medical personnel and sent a player with head trauma into high-impact drills.During his news conference, Goodell was asked if the league would consider taking action against a coach in such a situation. He did not answer directly.The former Giants linebacker Harry Carson, enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame last year, is one who believes the N.F.L. does not do enough.“I think the league is in denial, and I think the league will do everything that it can to discredit anyone who associates concussions that are sustained playing on the field with what happens after the game is over,” Carson said. “They have to discredit that, otherwise they might be open to all kinds of lawsuits down the road.”Many players, past and present, said much of the responsibility fell on the player. They often are reluctant to tell anyone when they feel the effects of a concussion, fearing that it will be construed as a sign of weakness.Vikings center Matt Birk and Saints tight end Ernie Conwell each said that they had demanded to go back into a game after taking a blow to the head, only to have trainers hide their helmets to keep them on the sideline.Much of the past focus on concussions has been related to quarterbacks. Troy Aikman, Steve Young and Chris Miller are among those who left the game early in part because of repeated concussions. But other position players take more routine beatings.“You think Belichick would test his quarterback?” Giants linebacker Antonio Pierce said. “Think he would test Tom Brady or his backup? No. They would be out for weeks. You test a defensive lineman or a linebacker. You’re taught to be so tough and so physical and so mentally tough and all that, that they use that against you whenever you get hurt.”'"

"'07-02-04,'0','Mr. Aronofsky, the director of “Pi” and “Requiem for a Dream,” released his latest film, “The Fountain,” in November after working on it for seven years. It quickly sank from sight. Mr. Russell, widely admired for his original mix of comedy and seriousness in “Flirting With Disaster” and “Three Kings,” has dropped from view since his disastrous “I Heart Huckabees” in 2004, and is not close to making a new film. The delightfully absurdist Mr. Jonze, of “Being John Malkovich” and “Adaptation” fame, has spent the last several years making music videos and finally settled on a feature film based on the Maurice Sendak book “Where the Wild Things Are,” planned for release in 2008.It’s not zero productivity, perhaps, but it is a far cry from the deluge of creative output from young directors in the 1970s, when Hal Ashby fired off seven movies in nine years, including “Shampoo” in 1975, “Bound for Glory” in 1976 and “Coming Home” in 1978. Robert Altman made six films in five years, including “MASH” and “Brewster McCloud” in 1970 and “McCabe & Mrs. Miller” in 1971. And Francis Ford Coppola had a similarly fertile run, with “The Godfather” in 1972, along with “The Conversation” and “The Godfather: Part II” in 1974.The current lack of productivity among promising filmmakers in their 30s and 40s has become a cause for quiet consternation among producers and agents, not to mention film lovers. It is felt in the paucity of movies creating excitement around the Oscars, and in the desperate trolling for new talent at the Sundance Film Festival.And it’s not just these filmmakers. Other major directors have spent years tiptoeing around different projects, often ambitious ones, only to back away and ultimately choose something more familiar. David Fincher, who after “Seven” and “Fight Club” in the ’90s was considered a top filmmaker, has become notorious for spending months considering projects, then walking away. His latest film, “Zodiac,” a police thriller, is finally due from Paramount; picking up the pace, he has been shooting an adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” about a man who ages in reverse.Others, like Baz Luhrmann, who reinvented the musical with “Moulin Rouge!” in 2001, or Mark Romanek, who created excitement with his indie “One Hour Photo” in 2002, have had projects fall through for various reasons. Mr. Luhrmann is currently filming “Australia,” starring Hugh Jackman, his first film since “Moulin Rouge!”; Mr. Romanek is still idle.In the space between all the conversations in Hollywood about star salaries, box-office winnings and Oscar possibilities lurks a larger question: Where are the missing movies?“I say it to these guys all the time, and some of them are my friends: ‘I feel like I want to see more movies from you,’ ” said Lorenzo di Bonaventura, a producer who was in charge of production in the ’90s at Warner Brothers, where he championed both “Three Kings” and “The Matrix.” “Why not more David Russell? Why not more Darren Aronofsky?” As filmgoers we’re being deprived. We as a business have to reach out to these filmmakers and beg them to make more.”Even Alexander Payne, the writer and director of “Sideways,” a critical darling two years ago, is not productive enough for Mr. di Bonaventura. “Why wouldn’t I want one movie a year from him?” he asked.Mr. di Bonaventura suggested that this diminished output had something to do with the extreme scrutiny the filmmakers’ every step receives. “The biggest problem in the business is you’re torn apart for failure now,” he said. “By the critics, by the audience, by the studios — everybody.”David Linde, co-chairman of Universal, agreed that the Hollywood fishbowl is not always healthy for originality and creativity. “There’s a lot of pressure in this town to be part of the mix in a specific way,” he said, like having the best weekend box-office numbers.Some mentioned money in discussing the drought: successful writer-directors can make huge fees rewriting other people’s scripts, as Roger Avary has since winning an Oscar as one of the writers of “Pulp Fiction” in 1994, or by directing commercial blockbuster-type movies, as Bryan Singer has done with “Superman Returns” and “X-Men,” after making a striking impression with “The Usual Suspects” in 1995.But it is possible that the self-indulgent American culture that shaped these filmmakers and made them so successful in the 1990s has left them ill equipped to take on the weightier questions facing society in the new millennium. Perhaps Quentin Tarantino, child of the video culture, feels at a loss when faced with the war in Iraq and global terrorism. And yet Mr. Russell made a movie about Iraq in 1999, well ahead of the current conflict, while the projects he now has in development are in the light comedy vein.“It’s part of the larger culture,” said Laura Ziskin, who was in charge of Fox 2000 when it made “Fight Club” and is now producing the third “Spider-Man” movie. “There’s not a lot of encouragement to go deep on anything. In the ’70s people had the feeling they could change things through art, through creativity.”Hollywood itself has a responsibility too, said Jeremy Barber, a leading agent for writer-directors like Noah Baumbach. “There’s no one pushing back,” he said. “It takes an oppositional force” to bring out the best in an artist, like a strong-minded studio executive or producer.“We have an indulgent system,” he added. “The industry celebrates them prematurely, and we don’t enter into a dialectical relationship with them.”Ms. Peirce declined a request for an interview, but a spokeswoman said that she took a long time to find material she liked well enough to make into a movie.Ms. Peirce has had many opportunities along the way. She landed a two-year deal at New Line in 2000, which expired without a project getting off the ground. She had been slated to direct “Memoirs of a Geisha” and, later, “A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,” based on the book by Dave Eggers. In 2001 she spoke in interviews of spending seven months researching an unsolved murder for what was to be her next project. That movie was never made.More than any other factor, though, Hollywood veterans cite the absence of the kind of creative ferment that coursed through the Hollywood of the 1970s, the challenge that one cinematic triumph posed to other artists.At least that’s what Cameron Crowe, the writer and director of “Jerry Maguire,” “Almost Famous” and the more recent critical disaster “Elizabethtown” suggested, as he was leaving a recent tribute to his hero, Billy Wilder.“There’s no community,” he said. “We need to encourage one another.” He cited the rivalry between the Beach Boys and the Beatles in the ’60s, when one group’s innovative album spurred the other to do it one better. “It’s like ‘Pet Sounds’ and ‘Sgt. Pepper’s,’ ” Mr. Crowe said. “It becomes a cycle that feeds on itself. One great work leads to another.”There is powerful evidence of that dynamic in three ambitious, critically hailed movies in 2006 that were, in no small way, the fruit of mutual challenge and frank criticism. The films — Alejandro González Iñárritu’s “Babel,” Guillermo del Toro’s “Pan’s Labyrinth” and Alfonso Cuarón’s “Children of Men” — were constantly reviewed and critiqued among the three directors, who are all Mexican.“These films are like triplets, they are sisters,” Mr. Cuarón said in a telephone interview from Mexico. (In the middle of the conversation his cellphone rang, with Mr. Iñárritu on the line. “I am trashing you as we speak,” Mr. Cuarón told him in Spanish.)“We are very good friends,” he continued. “We are big fans of one another, we respect each other so much. If Alejandro says, ‘That stinks,’ I know he is not trying to hurt me, he’s trying to help me.”All three films — which last month received a total of 16 Oscar nominations among them (including writing nominations for all three) — take on serious subjects in contemporary society. Mr. González Iñárritu’s film is a multicharacter tale about the breakdown in communication across diverse cultures. Mr. Cuarón’s, based on a novel by P. D. James, is a dystopic comment on society, foreseeing a terrifying future where women’s fertility has disappeared amid environmental disaster and a rising police state. And Mr. del Toro’s dark fable, set in Spain in the 1940s, grapples with the dangers of blind obedience in the face of evil.When Mr. González Iñárritu ran out of steam in the editing room, Mr. del Toro trimmed several minutes from his film; Mr. González Iñárritu returned the favor on “Pan’s Labyrinth.” After months of research in London, Mr. Cuarón showed an early draft of the screenplay for “Children of Men” to Mr. González Iñárritu.“He said: ‘Man, this is a piece of junk. You can’t shoot this thing. Where are your characters?’ ” Mr. Cuarón recalled. He spent a sleepless night, then went back to the drawing board.This mutual prodding has been going on for years, Mr. del Toro said. “We have a relationship that is not guarded, and that is invaluable in an industry where most people expect complacency,” he said over a drink at a Los Angeles theater where he was introducing “Pan’s Labyrinth” to a local audience.“All you can dream of is a system of truth, and support,” he went on. True to his creed — and in conspicuous contrast to his American counterparts — he is already at work on a new film, a sequel to “Hellboy.”'"
"'07-02-04,'0','In a year with extraordinarily large fields of presidential hopefuls in both parties, the verbal fights on Iraq were, to an unusual degree, Republican-on-Republican or Democrat-on-Democrat.Mr. Hagel, a Vietnam veteran like Mr. McCain and also a possible presidential candidate, called Mr. McCain’s approach — which lists 11 benchmarks for Iraqi government progress without setting any penalties for failure — “disingenuous.”The often combative Mr. Hagel was responding partly to an earlier suggestion from Mr. McCain that those who favor reining in American forces but who have not taken the next step of cutting off funding, are “intellectually dishonest.” Both men appeared on the ABC News program “This Week.”Meantime, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said the idea supported by Mr. Hagel and others for American talks with Iran and Syria was “naïve.”Last week, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware was equally blunt in criticizing a fellow Democratic presidential hopeful, former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. When it comes to Iraq, he said, “I don’t think John Edwards knows what the heck he is talking about.”Mr. Edwards, a former senator, has called for the immediate withdrawal of 40,000 American troops from Iraq. Mr. Biden, who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, opposes any increase in the number of troops in Iraq and supports Mr. Warner’s resolution.The cutting intra-party comments came a day after President Bush, in a rare appearance before a Democratic Party retreat in Virginia, made one of his strongest appeals for bipartisan cooperation on Iraq. But he also defended his call for an additional 21,500 troops for Iraq.Since the Congress has the power to curtail military spending, any resolution with sizable bipartisan support would be viewed as a warning shot. The Bush administration and its supporters have argued that a critical resolution could encourage enemies of the United States.Mr. McCain described the Warner resolution as “a vote of no confidence in both the mission and the troops who are going over there.”Mr. Hagel sharply rejected any suggestion that those backing the Warner resolution are effectively accepting defeat.“We cannot continue to feed our troops into the middle of a civil war,” he said. “This is not a cut-and-run resolution. This is not a withdrawal resolution.”Mr. Hagel wants American troops to be shifted out of cities and deployed along borders, and used more against terrorists.There was sharp disagreement today on the question of engaging Iran and Syria diplomatically to prepare the ground for an American . redeployment from Iraq.Mr. Hagel and others said that such engagement is critical. “There is going to be no peace in Iraq, there will be no peace in the Middle East unless all the regional partners are brought in to a framework of a political agreement,” he said.Other Republicans argued that Tehran and Damascus had made it clear they would not work with the United States to bring stability to Iraq. “The idea that the key to our success is through Syria and Iran is naïve,” Mr. Graham said on “Fox News Sunday.”'"
"'07-02-04,'0','More than half of those stopped, and sometimes frisked, by the police were black. The Red Hook projects have a large black population, a history of crime problems and, at least in a few young men, a wariness of the police.Mikel Jamison, 32, said that “he came up in these Brooklyn streets,” and that it is “hard being an African-American, hard to live and walk down the street without the police harassing us.”Mr. Jamison said some young men bring the unwanted attention of police on them, “with their pants down to their ankles and drugs in their pockets.” He then urged that he and this reporter keep their voices down because “some of the dealers, they’re out here right now.”But he said he blames police practices like the stop-and-frisks for tension between the community and the police. He said many officers might want to stop crime in the community, but many cannot discern between common criminals and the common people who live among them.After having a police officer jam a gun in his chest a few years ago, in an incident he said he would rather not discuss, Mr. Jamison said he converted to Islam and is now more conscious of the way the community is affected by such police actions.Anthony James, 28, who works for a large sanitation company and, as such, often keeps late hours, said the police frequently stop him as he leaves or comes home. He said that the stops had become such a problem that he has taken to carrying his work identification badge home to prove to the police that he has a job and is not selling drugs.“You see where you’re standing. This is the Red Zone,” he said, mapping with his hands a section of the projects from Columbia Street to Clinton Avenue. “This is the war zone. If they catch you in here alone they’re going to stop you. And they’ll play mind games with you. Ten minutes after searching you, they’ll come back by, just staring.”Mr. James, who said his “bad-boy days” are behind him, said officers doing the stops will say that the basis of the stops is that people are coming out of known “drug buildings.”“But we live here. I put my 7-year-old son to bed here. We have grandmas and old ladies up in here. This ain’t just a drug building, this is home,” he said. “It’s serious and dangerous out here, and they wonder why some people want to pull out their guns and start blasting.”Dorothy Shields, 74, has served as president of the tenants association at the Red Hook East housing development for 33 years, and said she believes the issue is less about people being picked on by the police, and more about a new generation of young people who do not have respect for authority, or their neighbors for that matter.Ms. Shields said she doubted some of the reports of overaggressive patrolling. “Some of them young men are not telling the truth about the police officers,” she said. “A lot of them feel they should be able to do anything they want do, wherever and whenever they want to.”Ms. Shields said she thinks frisks, at least in her neighborhood, are happening but not as much as some suggested.“Some people just don’t care for the police, no matter how right or wrong they are,” she said.At a press conference outside police headquarters yesterday, representatives of black and Hispanic officers’ groups called the data damning, and renewed calls for Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly to step down.“These numbers substantiate what we’ve been saying for years,” said Noel Leader, a co-founder of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care. “The New York Police Department under Raymond Kelly is actively committing some of the grossest forms of racial profiling in the history of the New York Police Department.”The Police Department said that officers stop people only if they are suspected of committing a crime, and that the practice is vital in getting guns off the streets. About 21,000 of the stops ended in arrests and about 29,000 in summonses.“I think it is one tool,” Deputy Police Commissioner Paul J. Browne said yesterday. “One law enforcement tool that is used to apply pressure. One of many.”Responding to complaints of profiling, the department noted that while 55.2 percent of those stopped were black, 68.5 percent of reported crimes involved suspects described as black.Mr. Browne said he could not speak about patrolling in Red Hook with any authority, but that in general the increase in reported stop-and-frisks was a result of the more scrupulous recording of such stops.“I think some of the individuals who have been critical of the department in the past will be critical of the department for this as well,” he said.At the community center in Red Hook where Rocky Harris had gone to play basketball, a 50-year-old man named Stanley, who is a big brother of sorts at the center, was shooting pool.When asked if he had been stopped and frisked by the police, Stanley, who said he did not want his last name published, said, “I’m an old man now, and they don’t bother me one bit. It’s the youth that they’re after. Not me.”'"
"'07-02-04,'0','Taken together, the moves provide the strongest indication yet that Mr. McCain intends to run a far tougher campaign than the one he ran in the 2000 primary. And they come as he transitions from being a onetime maverick to a candidate seeking to gather his party around him and create an air of inevitability about his prospects for winning nomination.As Mr. McCain assembles his team, he is also making it that much harder for his Republican challengers by scooping up a significant circle of the party’s top talent.In recent years, Mr. McCain has made a concerted effort to mend fences with Mr. Bush and reassure the Republican base that he is a reliable conservative. But his moves have focused new attention on the extent to which he may risk sacrificing the image he has long cultivated of being his own man, driven by principle rather than partisan politics.Mr. McCain’s advisers said he was not changing. But they were unapologetic about putting together a group dedicated to doing what it takes to reach the White House and employing lessons from his defeat at the hands of Mr. Bush in 2000.“This is about winning at the end of the day,” said John Weaver, Mr. McCain’s longtime senior strategist. “I don’t want to be in a knife fight ever again, but if I am, we’re going to win it.”Mr. McCain’s representatives said he would not provide an interview.Seven years ago, Mr. McCain charmed the news media and the public with his Straight Talk Express bus tour. He had a lean operation befitting an upstart candidacy, and he regularly spoke out against attack advertising, a quaint notion in retrospect.In the end, he ran his share of confrontational advertisements, once even leveling the ultimate Republican-to-Republican insult: that Mr. Bush was as dishonest as Bill Clinton. But he was perceived as having been knocked back on his heels by the rougher, tougher Bush campaign.Now Mr. McCain is building a larger organization, bringing together the heart of the bare-knuckled Bush crew once overseen by Karl Rove while keeping most of the advisers who ran his shoestring effort of 2000.“It’s like an all-star World Wrestling Federation cage match, except that instead of fighting one another, all of the brawlers are on the same team,” said Steve McMahon, a strategist for the Democratic National Committee. “There are very few people who play this game at the highest level, and on the Republican side these guys are among the best.”Mr. McCain has also hired Brian Jones, an adviser to Mr. Bush’s 2004 campaign; Fred Davis, a media consultant for Mr. Bush in 2004; and Steve Schmidt, who oversaw Mr. Bush’s 2004 war room, exploiting any tidbit that could help paint Mr. Kerry as a “flip-flopper.”The hires are another signal that the 2008 primary campaign could be a combative one all around.On the Democratic side, John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina, has wasted no time attacking Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s position on Iraq. And Mrs. Clinton’s team includes strategists who invented the concept of the modern campaign war room for her husband 15 years ago. But Senator Barack Obama of Illinois drew cheers at a party gathering on Friday when he warned his fellow candidates against attacking one another.Mitt Romney, a Republican and the former governor of Massachusetts, has hired Alex Castellanos, a onetime Bush strategist who also famously produced the 1990 commercial for Jesse Helms, the former North Carolina senator, in which a pair of white hands crumpled a rejection letter as a narrator said, “You needed that job and you were the best qualified, but it had to go to a minority because of a racial quota.”Given Mr. McCain’s history with some of the people on his team, the evolution of his staff may present an early challenge: How does he stay true to the “Straight Talk” spirit of his 2000 campaign, which helped him win the stature he has now, while also engaging in the political brinkmanship it can take to win?The Democratic National Committee is already criticizing Mr. McCain for his hires, issuing a statement this week calling them “a testament to how far he’s gone down the do-anything-to-win path.”Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster who is not yet allied with a candidate, said Mr. McCain was running the risk of looking “politically expedient” and of blunting his brand as “Senator Straight Talk.” He said the risk was highlighted by Mr. McCain’s recent suggestions that he may not use the campaign finance system he has long championed.In 2000, Mr. McCain received money from the system, which gives public financing to candidates who agree to strict spending limits. Mr. Weaver, the senior strategist, said Mr. McCain was keeping his options open because others, including Mrs. Clinton, were planning to work around the system.As Mr. McCain’s aides often point out, for all its appeal, the McCain 2000 campaign was a losing one. And they said it would be unfair to suggest that because Mr. McCain was augmenting his team he was somehow preparing to change who he was.“There are no negotiations regarding his principles,” Mr. Weaver said.In an interview on Friday, Mr. Jones, the campaign communications director, said Mr. McCain was not allowing his distaste over the Swift Boat commercials to interfere with his relationship with Stevens Reed Curcio & Potholm, with whom Mr. McCain has his own decade-long association. In addition, he said, Mr. McCain hired Mr. Nelson because of his breadth of experience in national campaigns. “The campaign,” Mr. Jones said, “is not going to let past contests on the battlefield limit how it’s going to go after talent.”Presidential politics are rich in fungible allegiances. James A. Baker III ran the primary campaigns of Gerald Ford and the elder George Bush against Ronald Reagan, only to become Mr. Reagan’s chief of staff. This year, David Axelrod is serving as a senior strategist for Mr. Obama; he was a senior strategist to Mr. Edwards in his 2004 campaign.“You could dissect any campaign this way: this guy did this ad this one time,” said Mr. Schriefer, the former Bush media strategist, who will run Mr. McCain’s advertising team. “There’s a tremendous history of foes becoming allies.”Mr. McKinnon, who led Mr. Bush’s advertising group in 2004, said he saw no inconsistency in working for Mr. McCain. Mr. Bush was right for 2000, he said, and Mr. McCain is right for 2008. “At the end of the day, the campaign will be won or lost on the character of the candidate and his or her core message,” Mr. McKinnon said. “Of course, I believe that will be John McCain.”Asked if the senator would avoid the attacks he criticized in 2000, Mr. Jones said that while Mr. McCain had yet to declare his candidacy, any campaign he ran would be “consistent with his beliefs and values.”'"
"'07-02-04,'0','The president contends that he can make the rule changes without any action by Congress. But Congress could try to block some or all of the changes.Democrats immediately denounced the proposals. “This is exactly the wrong approach,” said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who cited the proposals as evidence of what she called “the president’s misplaced priorities.”Many Republicans like the idea of an “income-related premium,” saying affluent beneficiaries can afford to pay a larger share of Medicare’s costs. Democrats are divided. Some see it as a progressive way to finance the program. But others say it is fundamentally at odds with the idea of social insurance, and they fear that it could prompt some wealthy people to leave Medicare.Administration officials said earlier this week that Mr. Bush would ask Congress to squeeze more than $70 billion from Medicare and Medicaid over five years. But the budget documents show that the actual figure is much larger: $101.5 billion of savings over five years.The president’s budget includes legislative proposals that would save $78.6 billion over the next five years — $65.6 billion in Medicare and $13 billion in Medicaid.In addition, the budget documents say that Mr. Bush will propose changes in federal regulations to save $22.9 billion more over the next five years: $10.2 billion in Medicare and $12.7 billion in Medicaid.Lobbyists for hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers plan a huge campaign to kill the president’s proposals, which they say will ultimately harm beneficiaries.Mr. Bush said his proposals would just slow the programs’ growth. “Our budget reduces Medicare’s average annual growth rate over five years to 5.6 percent, from 6.5 percent,” Mr. Bush said, while Medicaid would grow 7.1 percent a year, instead of 7.3 percent.In the past, Mr. Bush has proposed trimming Medicare payments to health care providers for a few years, but now he proposes to make the cutbacks permanent, so that hospitals and nursing homes would never receive a full update for inflation.For the Children’s Health Insurance Program, Mr. Bush requests $5.4 billion in 2008, a reduction of $223 million, or 4 percent, from this year’s level. Beyond the current levels of spending, the White House is seeking an “additional allotment” of $5 billion over the next five years, which is less than half of what would be needed to maintain coverage for children currently enrolled.Mr. Bush said he wanted to return the program to its “original objective” of covering children with family incomes less than twice the poverty level. Budget documents note that 16 states cover children above that level, and “one state, New Jersey, covers children up to 350 percent of the federal poverty level.” A family of four is considered poor if its annual income is less than $20,650.In a visit to the National Institutes of Health last month, Mr. Bush said, “The N.I.H. is one of America’s greatest assets, and it needs to be nourished,” adding, “It makes sense to spend taxpayers’ money on cancer research.”But the president’s budget for biomedical research is basically flat. He is requesting $28.9 billion for the health institutes in 2008, an increase of $232 million, or less than 1 percent. For the National Cancer Institute, Mr. Bush is requesting $4.8 billion, which is $9 million less than this year’s level.To fight childhood obesity, Mr. Bush asks Congress to set aside $17 million for a new program to promote “healthy behavior” among adolescents. But at the same time, he asks Congress to eliminate the preventive health services block grant, which provides $99 million a year to help states prevent obesity and other chronic conditions.Mr. Bush proposes an 18 percent cut in the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides $2.2 billion to help people pay heating bills this year. At a time of high fuel prices, many lawmakers are likely to resist the cut.'"
"'07-02-04,'0','With one hand, Lady Liberty lifts her lamp beside the golden door. With the other, she roots around in an immigrant’s wallet, plucking out bills. It’s not an appealing image, but that’s where we are, now that Citizenship and Immigration Services, the beleaguered federal bureaucracy that makes new Americans, has announced plans to increase fees sharply to cover its costs.The agency is distinctive in the federal government for being entirely dependent on fees it collects. It is also notable for backlogs and what its director, Emilio Gonzalez, acknowledges are “dingy buildings” and “rude employees.” Mr. Gonzalez promises that if the agency is granted an average increase of 66 percent in the price of visas and citizenship papers, it will process applications more quickly and take other steps to fulfill its responsibilities, the costs of which have risen sharply since 9/11.What this means for aspiring immigrants is simple: more cash upfront. The application fee for citizenship would rise to $595 from $330. The fee for permanent residency would increase to $905 from $325, and charges for bringing in a foreign spouse or employee would more than double. Refugees and victims of human trafficking or sex crimes would still have their fees waived, and other applicants could request hardship waivers.There are no easy formulas for pricing services like these, but advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration debate agree that the increases are exorbitant, and we agree. The proposed fees would become a means test for new Americans, slamming the door on many people who desperately want to be part of this country and have much to contribute.The blame clearly lies with Congress, which has required the agency to support itself entirely with fees. Congress should abandon this misguided rule and allocate the money to run the agency adequately and efficiently. All Americans benefit from the healthy, invigorating flow of naturalized citizens, and all Americans — not just the newest, least powerful ones — should help pay for it.'"
"'07-02-04,'0','RISING productivity can be a free pass for the economy, allowing strong growth and even fast-rising pay for workers without creating the more troublesome kind of inflation that affects the prices of goods and services.But rising employment costs have been a concern for several quarters. With Federal Reserve officials warning again last week about the risk of inflation, a report this Wednesday on fourth-quarter productivity could carry considerable weight, said Russ Koesterich, senior portfolio manager at Barclays Global Investors.Many people on Wall Street already question the long-held belief that the Fed will soon cut interest rates, Mr. Koesterich said. Weak productivity gains might cause them to abandon the belief altogether, especially if the report also showed continued strong growth in labor costs. Such growth could send stocks lower, he warned.“Wage costs are rising, and this may spoil the party,” Mr. Koesterich said. “There is an assumption that the Fed is going to be able to cut rates in 2007. If wages rise, it calls that into question, and they may have to hike a couple of times. What’s not baked into the cake now is the possibility of a rate hike.”A Bloomberg News poll of economists forecasts a 1.8 percent productivity gain at an annual rate, and a 2.3 percent increase in unit labor costs.Investors are willing to excuse rising employment costs if productivity is also robust because it means employees are earning their higher pay. That is not the case when productivity stalls.'"

Lodging is harder to come by.Though many travelers begin their trips to the city in Queens, thanks to the presence of New York’s two major airports, the borough has few hotel options outside the immediate areas of Kennedy and La Guardia.“The airports have a bunch of hotels, and there’s the one in Flushing on Main Street,” said Frank Gulluscio, district manager of Community Board 6, which covers Forest Hills. “But if somebody had to stay over from out of town, how far do you want to drive to get them into a hotel?”If the answer is not far, Queens residents may be in luck. Plans are in the works for two new hotels in the borough. But while one seems likely to find favor with its neighbors, the other is already provoking criticism.On Austin Street in Forest Hills, in the middle of a busy shopping strip, a developer named Yeheskel Elias is seeking approval for a 100-room luxury hotel. It would be the first hotel in the neighborhood since the Progressive-era hotels of Station Square in Forest Hills Gardens were converted to apartments long ago.“The idea for me is really not to build a generic Holiday Inn,” Mr. Elias said, noting that families of local residents as well as tennis fans attending the U.S. Open might stay there. “We want to do a five-star hotel.”The hotel, which would be neo-Tudor style to fit in with the neighborhood, would be built on property Mr. Elias already owns at Austin Street and 70th Road. The developer hopes to start construction within a year, and Mr. Gulluscio of the community board said the proposal would probably pass muster with Forest Hills residents.'"
"'07-02-04,'0','After reading “Agents of Angst” (Jan. 28), I was very disappointed to see that your article took one or two bad experiences from two people and misrepresented them as common occurrences in the real estate industry.While I’m not suggesting these unfortunate events didn’t occur, they are certainly not the norm in real estate practice as your article suggests. In 2006, there were only 206 complaints brought to the Department of State by real estate clients in the entire borough of Manhattan. And as noted, the Department has received fewer and fewer complaints statewide each year.In addition, the Real Estate Board of New York puts forth its own strict code of ethics, which clarifies licensees’ responsibilities to both their colleagues and to the public. If an alleged violation occurs, Rebny immediately handles it by voluntary mediation or binding arbitration.However few and far between, stories of unethical brokers are disappointing — disappointing to the public, disappointing to me and most importantly disappointing to my members, who have to work even harder to clean up the reputation of their industry. New York City real estate agents know the false stereotypes they must overcome, but if the department’s dwindling list of complaints is any indication, they’re doing a good job of it.

"'07-02-04,'0','At best, the property tax reforms making their way through the New Jersey Legislature are disappointing. Unless Gov. Jon Corzine uses the full power of his office to strengthen them, the state will continue to be plagued by the highest property taxes in the nation.Last week, the Assembly approved the politically popular part of the tax package — a 20 percent property tax credit for families earning $100,000 or less and smaller amounts for most people earning more — and the Senate is likely to pass it this week. But the politically unpopular parts of the package — those aimed at sustaining property tax stability over the long run — have either been watered down or lack sufficient support to pass.There were two items Mr. Corzine insisted on before he would sign a tax credit bill. One would cap annual property tax increases at 4 percent (thus imposing real restraints on local spending), the other would create a state comptroller with powers to investigate financial activity at all levels of local government. The Assembly passed both last week; the Senate has already passed the comptroller bill.But the cap measure would exempt a significant part of a town or school district’s expenses — including those for exceptional rises in health costs and additional students. The comptroller bill, meanwhile, would severely limit the office’s power to investigate and audit local government, including land deals, where a lot of corruption has occurred.In a pleasant surprise, the Assembly last week passed a bill to bar future state legislators from simultaneously holding other elective or appointed positions, such as mayor or member of the local school board. Unfortunately, the Senate may not act on it. Dual office holding poses a clear conflict of interest for the simple reason that legislators are not likely to support measures to cut state financing for the towns or school districts where they hold office.The list of compromised reforms goes on. At one point, senators and Assembly members seemed ready to pass measures cutting health and pension benefits for future teachers and other government employees, but Mr. Corzine took the legislators off the hook by saying he wanted to negotiate those potentially big cost savings with the employee unions.'"
"'07-02-04,'0','NEW JERSEY legislators, educators and parents have renewed their calls for overhauling the state’s school financing system after court-ordered audits found questionable spending and accounting practices in the poorest school districts.The audits cited numerous problems in Camden, Newark, Jersey City and Paterson, despite years of state oversight. The districts were the first of the 31 so-called Abbott districts to be audited under an order by the New Jersey Supreme Court. These school districts are among the state’s poorest and have received $35 billion in state aid since the state Supreme Court ruled 10 years ago that the poorest urban districts should be given the resources to spend as much on their students as the wealthiest suburban districts do.The audit findings, which were released Tuesday by state education officials, included school employees in Camden and Jersey City who remained on the payroll after they had died, a $1,000 florist’s bill for poinsettia plants at a board meeting in Jersey City and $3,080 for Newark school employees to attend a teaching job fair in Puerto Rico.In recent months, a growing number of critics have called for changes to the school financing system, saying it has wasted millions of dollars in the Abbott districts while shortchanging others. Assemblyman Bill Baroni, a Republican from Hamilton, said the audit findings would only fuel more criticism.“It is very hard to make the argument that the Abbott program is working when administrators are going on junkets,” he said. “That money should be going to students, classes and teachers.”'"
"'07-02-04,'0','“I want to be an activist professor,” he told me. This means that he spends more time writing, speaking and advising everyone from Tony Blair to the elders of mosques than on university teaching. Ramadan, who is 44, also lives the life of a devout Muslim, praying five times a day. The main thing, for him, is to find a way for Muslims to escape their minority status and play a central role as European citizens. “The fact that Western Muslims are free,” he said, “means that they can have enormous impact. But it would be wrong to claim that we are imposing our ways on the West. New ideas are now coming from the West. To be traditional is not so much a question of protecting ourselves as to be traditionalist in principle.”Traditionalist principles, for Ramadan, apply to politics as much as to religion. Muslims, he says, should not try to create a “parallel system” to Western democracy, let alone aspire to building a Muslim state. “There is no such thing,” he says, “as an Islamic order. We have to act to promote justice and inject our ethics into the existing system.” According to Ramadan, the global order of neoliberal capitalism allows the wealthy West to dominate the world. Resisting this order is part of his task as an activist professor, who derives his “universal principles” from his Muslim faith. This message not only provides educated European Muslims with a political cause but is also pushed with considerable success at such international leftist jamborees as the World Social Forum, where the world’s antiglobalists meet.I asked Ramadan what it was like to grow up as an Egyptian Muslim in Geneva. And not just any Egyptian Muslim: his maternal grandfather was Hassan al-Banna, founder in 1928 of the Muslim Brotherhood, which seeks to resist what it regards as Western domination and create an Islamic state. Al-Banna was murdered in 1949, by Egyptian government agents, following the assassination of the Egyptian prime minister by a Muslim Brother. “Difficult,” Ramadan replied, “very difficult, and full of tensions. There were very few Muslims in Geneva in the 1960s, apart from a few United Nations people and some North Africans. Some of my brothers were attracted by Western life, and one of them even rejected everything to do with religion. But our parents were very liberal about it, never forcing me to pray, always open to dialogue and discussion.”“Liberal” was a surprising description of Ramadan’s father, Said Ramadan, al-Banna’s favorite disciple and a tireless promoter of political Islam. He had to escape from President Nasser’s Egypt, after the Muslim Brotherhood was banned there in 1954 (a Muslim Brother was accused of trying to kill Nasser), and settled in Geneva. The youngest of six children, Tariq was named after Tariq Ibn Ziyad, the North African Muslim who conquered Spain in 711. Ramadan denies being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood — one of whose credos is “God is our goal, the Prophet our model, the Koran our law, holy war our way and martyrdom our desire” — but is proud of his illustrious background. To many Muslims al-Banna is still a very great man. When I met Ramadan later in the week at the gigantic East London Mosque, I heard him being introduced, with a tone of reverence, as al-Banna’s grandson. “With older people it lends authority to what I’m saying,” Ramadan told me, as we walked through the mosque, where the main languages were Bengali and Urdu, apart from quotations from the Koran, which were in Arabic.Even though Ramadan’s father represented the Muslim Brotherhood in Europe, promoting the cause of Islamic government, Ramadan went to a mainstream Swiss school, where he got a solid grounding in French literature and European philosophy. He graduated a year early and studied philosophy, literature and social sciences at University of Geneva. By age 24, he was already dean of a high school and later lectured in religious studies at a college in Geneva and the University of Fribourg. I was fascinated to learn that of all European philosophers, Ramadan chose to study Friedrich Nietzsche, who had anticipated the death of religious faith. He even wrote his doctoral thesis on Nietzsche. Had he ever experienced any doubts himself?“Doubts about God, no,” he replied. “But questions, yes. Nietzsche raised strong and accurate questions about religion, on how religious identities are built, and how believers use victim status to become killers themselves. I also read everything by Dostoyevsky, whom I liked from the very beginning. That was my universal frame of reference. It was not easy, growing up in a committed Muslim family while dealing with people outside who were drinking, and all that. But I was protected on ethical grounds, as a religious person, first of all by playing sports, every day, for two hours or more — football, tennis, running. And reading, reading, reading, five hours a day, sometimes eight hours. My father warned me that life was not in books. But it meant that even though I stayed away from drinking, I got respect from the people around me. I was known as ‘the professor,’ ‘le docteur.’ ”The notion of the bookish grandson of Hassan al-Banna reading Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky is arresting but not entirely surprising. Like them, he was wrestling with the idea of a disenchanted world that appeared to be falling into nihilism. In his teens and early 20s, Ramadan says, he “felt lonely in Europe, facing racial discrimination, and all that. So I idealized Egypt. My body was in Europe, but my heart was over there. I wanted to go back ‘home.’ ”In 1986 Ramadan married a Swiss woman, the sister of one of his football buddies who had converted to Islam. She took the name Iman, and they moved with their young children to Cairo in 1991, where Ramadan studied Muslim philosophy with scholars from Al-Azhar University. Their stay in Egypt deepened his understanding of Islam but also turned him into a convinced European. “I felt I had been misled,” he told me. “The philosophical connection between the Islamic world and the West is much closer than I thought. Doubt did not begin with Descartes. We have this construction today that the West and Islam are entirely separate worlds. This is wrong. Everything I am doing now, speaking of connections, intersections, universal values we have in common, this was already there in history.” At the same time, he realized that “home” was actually in Europe, that while Islam was his faith, his culture was European. Ramadan’s intellectual struggle to bridge different traditions was a personal one too.In his book, “Western Muslims and the Future of Islam,” published in 2004, Ramadan lists various approaches to Islam, from “political literalist Salafism” — militant, anti-Western, in favor of the Islamic state — to “liberal reformism,” which sees faith as an entirely private affair. I asked him at the mosque where he placed himself. “A Salafi reformist,” he said, which might seem a contradiction but is explained in his book as follows: “The aim is to protect the Muslim identity and religious practice, to recognize the Western constitutional structure, to become involved as a citizen at the social level and to live with true loyalty to the country to which one belongs.”Ramadan’s favorite Muslim philosophers are the late-19th-century reformists Muhammad Abduh and Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, who tried to revive Islam under Western colonial rule by rational interpretation of the holy texts. They were skeptical of religious tradition, accumulated over time, and looked for core principles in the Koran that spoke to reason. For them there was no contradiction between scientific reasoning and their Muslim faith. And female emancipation or democratic government could be reconciled with the original principles of Islam. Both had lived in Europe. Both were harsh critics of colonialism and Western materialism. In Ramadan’s words, “They saw the need to resist the West, through Islam, while taking what was useful from it.”Speaking about his grandfather, Ramadan observed: “People say that his ideas formed the basis of Al Qaeda. This is not true.” The spiritual father of revolutionary Islam, according to Ramadan and others, was another Egyptian Muslim Brother, Sayyid Qutb, who advocated a holy war against the idolatrous West. Ramadan pointed out that “Qutb actually joined the Muslim Brotherhood after my grandfather was killed. They didn’t even know each other. My position on Hassan al-Banna is that he was much closer to Muhammad Abduh. He was in favor of a British-style parliamentary system, which was not against Islam.”This may or may not be an accurate representation of Hassan al-Banna, but it tells us a lot about the way Ramadan presents himself. Reconciling what seems hard to reconcile is what makes him an interesting and sometimes baffling figure. It is why the University of Notre Dame appointed him as Henry R. Luce professor of religion, conflict and peace building. Prof. R. Scott Appleby, the man who did everything he could to bring Ramadan to South Bend, Ind., was hardly naïve about Ramadan’s European reputation. Over breakfast in New York recently, he told me: “He’s doing something extraordinarily difficult if not impossible, but it needs to be done. He is accused of being Janus-faced. Well, of course he presents different faces to different audiences. He is trying to bridge a divide and bring together people of diverse backgrounds and worldviews. He considers the opening he finds in his audience. Ramadan is in that sense a politician. He cultivates various publics in the Muslim world on a variety of issues; he wants to provide leadership and inspiration. The reason we wanted him is precisely because he’s got his ear to the ground of the Muslim world.”And this may also have been the reason that the U.S. State Department revoked his work visa in July 2004. Ramadan had already sent all his family possessions to South Bend. His children had been enrolled in local schools. According to the Department of Homeland Security, Ramadan was denied entry under a provision of the Patriot Act that bars foreigners from the U.S. who “endorse or espouse terrorist activity.” After the A.C.L.U and various academic groups contested the government’s refusal to process Ramadan’s application for another visa, a federal judge ruled that the State Department had to make a decision. The State Department refused to issue another visa on the grounds that Ramadan had donated roughly $900 to two European organizations that give aid to Palestinians. The organizations were, and still are, legitimate charities in Europe but since Ramadan made his donations have been blacklisted in the U.S. for supposedly giving money to Hamas. The A.C.L.U. lawyer, Jameel Jaffer, told me that Ramadan had fallen foul of the same principle that used to bar Communists from coming to the U.S.: his politics are not welcome.But what exactly are his politics? Ramadan explained to me what shaped his political understanding: “In my family, resistance was a key concept, resistance against dictatorship and colonialism. When I was 18, I started to travel to southern countries, in Latin America, India and Africa. The people I met were often leftists. The liberation theologists in Brazil were very important, resisting in the name of religious principles. I was at home with this discourse. I was also close to the Tibetans and spent one month with the Dalai Lama. It was the same philosophy, spiritual commitment and resistance, in their case against Chinese colonialism. Perhaps because of these personal experiences, I started to read the work of my own grandfather, who used the Scriptures, the story of Moses, against British colonialism. He was saying in the 1940s what the liberation theologists were saying in the 1960s.”Some of Ramadan’s critics, most notably the French journalist Caroline Fourest, who wrote a sharp attack on him titled “Frère Tariq” (Brother Tariq), draw a direct line from Hassan al-Banna, through Said Ramadan and Tariq Ramadan himself, to the militant Islamism threatening the West today. Such was the disquiet in France about Islamist violence that Ramadan was barred from that country in 1995. The ban was eventually lifted. Ramadan prefers to see the family legacy in terms of “Islamic socialism, which is neither socialist, nor capitalist, but a third way.” In this reading, his father’s friendship with Malcolm X is much more significant than any Saudi Arabian connection. This is why Ramadan was a popular speaker with African-American Muslims before his visa was revoked.“Western Muslims and the Future of Islam” throws some light on Ramadan’s idea of “Islamic socialism,” an ideology, combining religious principles with anticapitalist, anti-imperialist politics, that goes back to the time of the Russian Revolution. (Libya’s strongman, Muammar el-Qaddafi, is one who claims to rule according to these principles.) The murderous tyranny to be resisted, in Ramadan’s book, is “the northern model of development,” which means that “a billion and a half human beings live in comfort because almost four billion do not have the means to survive.” For Ramadan, global capitalism, promoted by such institutions as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, is the “abode of war” (alam al-harb), for “when faced with neoliberal economics, the message of Islam offers no way out but resistance.”To be a sworn enemy of capitalism does not mean you are a communist, a fascist, a religious fundamentalist or indeed an anti-Semite, but it is something these otherwise disparate groups frequently have in common. Advocating a revolt against Western materialism on the basis of superior spiritual values is an old project, which has had many fathers but has never been particularly friendly to liberal democracy. Ramadan’s brand of Islamic socialism, promoted with such media-friendly vitality, in conferences, interviews, books, talks, sermons and lectures, has won him a variety of new friends, especially in Britain and France.Gilles Kepel, a leading French scholar of Islam, describes in his book “The War for Muslim Minds” how Ramadan “reached out to make alliances with the far left, working a territory abandoned by his rivals” — rivals, that is, like André Glucksmann, once a Maoist, now a supporter of the war in Iraq. Kepel goes on to explain that Ramadan “exchanged his costume as the Muslim Youth’s spokesman — an outfit too tight to accommodate his ambitions and talent — for the garb of the universalist intellectual.” Just as Marxists claim a universal validity for their political ideology, Ramadan says he believes that religious principles, as revealed in the Koran, are universal. It was as a universalist that Ramadan promoted the right of Muslim women to wear the veil at French schools. “Rights are rights,” he said, “and to demand them is a right.”This has been read as a rallying cry to convert the West to Islam, the first step toward the establishment of Eurabia. Ramadan denies that this is his intention. “Whatever your faith,” he explained to me, “you are dealing with your fundamental principles. The message of Islam is justice. The neoliberal order leads to injustice. The point is to extract universal principles from one’s faith, but in politics it has to be a personal decision. The danger of my discourse in France is that I’m telling people to be citizens. Muslims are still treated as aliens. I’m telling them to vote.”Ramadan, as Kepel observes, is “balanced on a tightrope,” for his socialism is not always congenial to devout Muslims. Marx (along with “the Jew,” “the Crusader” and “the Secularist”) is a demonic figure for the Muslim Brothers. Ramadan is candid about his enemies: “My fiercest critics come from majority Muslim countries. Traditional Salafists condemn me for being against Islam.” Conversely, Ramadan’s defense of certain practices rooted in Islamic tradition creates much suspicion among those who might otherwise agree with his politics.Two media-driven controversies helped to make Ramadan both famous and notorious. The first was an exchange on French television in 2003 with Nicolas Sarkozy, the French interior minister (now running for president as the candidate of the conservative Union for a Popular Movement party), well known for his description of rioters in poor immigrant neighborhoods as “scum.” Sarkozy accused Ramadan of defending the stoning of adulterers, a punishment stipulated in the section of the Islamic penal code known as huddud. Ramadan replied that he favored “a moratorium” on such practices but refused to condemn the law outright. Many people, including Sarkozy, were outraged. When I talked with Ramadan in London, the mere mention of the word “stoning” set him off on a long explanation.“Personally,” he said, “I’m against capital punishment, not only in Muslim countries, but also in the U.S. But when you want to be heard in Muslim countries, when you are addressing religious issues, you can’t just say it has to stop. I think it has to stop. But you have to discuss it within the religious context. There are texts involved. I am not just talking to Muslims in Europe, but addressing the implementation of huddud everywhere, in Indonesia, Pakistan and the Middle East. And I’m speaking from the inside to Muslims. Speaking as an outsider would be counterproductive. But now I can say that Sarkozy helped me enormously, because the controversy helped me to spread my ideas.”The other, perhaps even more contentious issue, also raised by Sarkozy, was Ramadan’s supposed anti-Semitism. A month before the television debate, Ramadan posted an article on a Web site named Oumma.com, titled “Critique of the (New) Communalist Intellectuals.” This article had been turned down by both Le Monde and Libération. Ramadan’s main argument was that “French Jewish intellectuals” — like Bernard-Henri Lévy, Alain Finkielkraut, Bernard Kouchner, André Glucksmann and Pierre-André Taguieff (in fact not Jewish at all) — who used to be “considered universalist intellectuals” had become knee-jerk defenders of Israel and thus “had relativized the defense of universal principles of equality and justice.” Ramadan was trying to turn the tables on those who accuse Muslims of obsessing about their victimhood by accusing “Jewish intellectuals” of doing precisely that, thinking of just their own tribal concerns, while Ramadan’s pursuit of justice for Palestinians was supposedly part of a universalist project. These intellectuals were of course “the rivals” who, in Kepel’s phrase, had “abandoned” the left, just as many early neoconservatives had done in the U.S.Ramadan’s attack was unfair. The intellectuals he mentioned had all championed many causes other than Israel, including putting a stop to the mass murder of Muslims in Bosnia. And by compiling this blacklist of Jews and placing a philosopher whose name merely sounded Jewish among them, he opened himself to the charge of anti-Semitism. The response was shrill. André Glucksmann wrote: “What is surprising is not that Mr. Ramadan is anti-Semitic, but that he dares to proclaim it openly.” Bernard-Henri Lévy compared Ramadan’s article with “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” the vicious Russian forgery about Jewish world domination. It all was vastly overblown, but these labels have a way of sticking to their target. When I asked the British Labor politician Denis MacShane, one of the few British politicians with a deep knowledge of France, about Ramadan, he repeated all the allegations about Ramadan’s religious bigotry but said that the “fundamental dividing line is about Israel and the Jews.”Ramadan himself says that it was because of his views on Israel and on U.S. policy in Iraq that he was deprived of his visa to teach in the U.S. He told me: “I was asked to take part in a dialogue in Paris with representatives of American Jewish organizations, including Jack Rosen, head of the American Jewish Congress. It turned out to be less of a dialogue than an interview about my opinions on the Palestinian conflict. Rosen promised to talk to President Bush. But after this interview, I knew I would never get a visa.”This might sound like just the kind of conspiracy theory anti-Semites tend to indulge in. But unlike some Islamic activists, Ramadan has never expressed any hostility to Jews in general. There is no question that he is ferociously anti-Zionist. He sees this as part of his resistance to colonialism. A glance at his Web site shows precisely where he stands. “The dignity of the Palestinians is to resist, ours is to denounce. ... That means denouncing fears as much as the unjust and wretched policies which continue to kill an entire people in an occupied territory.”Ramadan is in fact one of the few Muslim intellectuals to speak out against anti-Semitism. In an article in Le Monde, he wrote: “We have heard the cries of ‘down with the Jews!’ shouted during protest demonstrations, and reports of synagogues being vandalized in various French cities. One also hears ambiguous statements about Jews, their secret power, their insidious role within the media, and their nefarious plans. ... Too rarely do we hear Muslim voices that set themselves apart from this kind of discourse and attitude.”Nonetheless, Ramadan’s criticism of Jewish intellectuals missed the point. The main reason his European critics, Jews or non-Jews, have turned against Islam, and political Islam in particular, is not Israel so much as a common fear that secularism is under threat. That fear is coupled with a deep disillusion, in the wake of failed Marxist dictatorships, with the kind of anticolonial leftism that Ramadan now promotes in the name of universal principles rooted in the heart of Islam. As Denis MacShane put it to me, “Ramadan repudiates core European principles that developed from Galileo to gay marriages.”What enrages former or current progressives is the apparent paradox that lies at the heart of Ramadan’s political rhetoric. On global capitalism he speaks like a 1968 left-wing student revolutionary, but on social affairs he can sound like the illiberal conservatives whom those students opposed. In American terms, he is a Noam Chomsky on foreign policy and a Jerry Falwell on social affairs. One of Ramadan’s fiercest critics in France, Caroline Fourest, fears that he has long-term plans to challenge European secularism through religious bigotry. She told me over the phone that she considered Ramadan “more dangerous than the obvious extremists, precisely because he sounds more reasonable.” The question of women is key to this.I wanted to know what exactly Ramadan meant by “Islamic femininity,” described in “Western Muslims and the Future of Islam” in terms of “natural complementarity” and “autonomy of the feminine being.” This sounded a trifle vague. He replied: “When you are struggling for your rights, you can achieve a legal status. This is necessary. We must have the struggle for equal rights of women. But the body must not be forgotten. Men and women are not the same. In Islamic tradition, women are seen in terms of being mothers, wives or daughters. Now woman exists as woman.”I was not sure this answer left me much the wiser. Later I put some of Caroline Fourest’s allegations to him — that he had advised Muslim girls to avoid shaking hands with men; that he warned against mixed swimming pools; that women should not be allowed to engage in sports if their bodies were exposed to men. He claims that these quotes were taken out of context. “What I mean,” he said, “is that men and women should have a choice. If they want to follow the rules of modesty, they should be able to choose to do so. Myself, I shake hands with women.” I asked him whether his own daughters practiced their faith. He laughed and said that he certainly hoped so, but they were free to choose. Both were sent to ordinary public schools in Switzerland and Britain.The question is how far secular society should be pushed to accommodate Islamic principles. “We are in favor of integration,” Ramadan says in a recorded speech, “but it is up to us to decide what that means. ... I will abide by the laws, but only insofar as the laws don’t force me to do anything against my religion.” A Muslim must be able to practice and teach and “act in the name of his faith.” If any given society should take this right away, he continues, “I will resist and fight that society.” There is some ambiguity here. What does it mean to act in the name of one’s faith? In 1993 he was against the performance of “Fanaticism, or Mahomet the Prophet,” a play by Voltaire, in Geneva, saying it “would be another brick in the edifice of hatred and rejection.” And yet he is careful not to call for violence or legal bans. As in the case of the Danish cartoons lampooning Islam, he prefers to use such words as “respect” or “tact.”Olivier Roy, perhaps France’s greatest authority on Islam, says that the matter of respect, what he calls “the discourse of dignity,” is Ramadan’s greatest appeal to his followers. I asked Roy in a telephone interview recently who Ramadan’s main followers were. “Not the first generation of immigrants,” he replied, “and certainly not the fundamentalists. The poor in the French suburbs don’t care about him, either. He appeals to people of the second generation, who have a college or university education but do not feel fully integrated. They are the would-be middle class, and for them the discourse of respectability, of dignity, is very important.”I thought of Roy’s words as I walked through Brick Lane, in London’s East End, on the way to the mosque where I was to meet Ramadan one day in December. Brick Lane used to be a poor Jewish area, where refugees from Russian pogroms eked out a living in the Sunday markets, cheap clothing stores and kosher dining halls. Now the Jews have moved up and on, and the area has become “Bangla Town,” home to Bangladeshis and Pakistanis. Brick Lane itself is lined with curry restaurants and stores selling “Muslim fashion” — head scarves, burqas, men’s baggy pants, even “Halal cosmetics.” I was struck by the word “fashion.” It denotes choice, a matter of modern identity more than a tradition left behind in the villages of Pakistan or Bangladesh. The same stores sold audiocassettes of the kind used to promote Ramadan’s speeches: cassettes with such English titles as “Islam for Children” or “How to Live as a Muslim.”This is the world in which Tariq Ramadan operates, an urban Western environment full of educated but frequently confused young Muslims eager to find attractive models they can identify with. I thought of the Somali-born Dutch activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, as charismatic in her way as Ramadan. Having had her fill of controversies in the Netherlands (she wrote the film “Submission,” which led to the murder of the filmmaker Theo van Gogh by a Muslim extremist), she now works at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. Her mission, too, is to spread universal values. She, too, speaks of reform. But she has renounced her belief in Islam. She says that Islam is backward and perverse. As a result, she has had more success with secular non-Muslims than with the kind of people who shop in Brick Lane.Ramadan offers a different way, which insists that a reasoned but traditionalist approach to Islam offers values that are as universal as those of the European Enlightenment. From what I understand of Ramadan’s enterprise, these values are neither secular, nor always liberal, but they are not part of a holy war against Western democracy either. His politics offer an alternative to violence, which, in the end, is reason enough to engage with him, critically, but without fear.'"
"'07-02-04,'0','Historical analogies have always been popular in foreign-policy debates, and the present day is no exception. For liberals, the best description of our current situation is “Vietnam II” (as Maureen Dowd dubbed it in a Times column): another ghastly quagmire from which we can do little but walk away. Nonsense, reply conservatives. It’s really “World War IV” (the words of Norman Podhoretz, who counts the cold war as III): another deadly struggle against totalitarianism for which we must mobilize every possible resource. As for the Harvard historian Niall Ferguson, writing in Vanity Fair, the best analogy is what could be called Rome II. We are another colossal empire, perched on the brink of decline and fall.Yet since history never repeats itself so neatly, the most useful historical analogies are not those that promise to predict the future but those that may reveal unexpected things about the present. Consider, for instance, a parallel rarely cited in current debates: the one between the post-cold-war period and the age of the French Revolution. Both began (by coincidence, in years numbered ’89 and ’90) with moments of extraordinary elation and hope. A powerful and much-loathed regime (the U.S.S.R., the French absolute monarchy) not only collapsed unexpectedly but did so with surprisingly little violence. So transformative did the change appear that many advanced thinkers predicted nothing less than an age of democracy in which warfare would have no place. In our own day, Francis Fukuyama famously spoke of “the end of history,” by which he meant an end to conflicts over the proper form of society. Two hundred years before, the fall of the French Old Regime led to surprisingly similar visions. In 1790, the new French Revolutionary state even renounced aggressive war, in what became known as its “declaration of peace to the world.” A French legislator promised giddily that from now on the human race would form “a single society, whose object is the peace and happiness of each and all of its members.”Yet in both cases, disillusion followed with cruel speed. In our own time, of course, there were the wars in the Balkans and the gulf, followed by the global upheaval triggered by 9/11. In the 18th century, less than two years after the declaration of peace, there began a series of wars that would drag in all of Europe’s major powers, take millions of lives and continue, with only small breaks, for more than 23 years, until France’s final defeat in 1815. They would make possible the career of a man whose name is synonymous with military hubris: Napoleon Bonaparte. In short, the Enlightenment vision of perpetual peace gave way rapidly to a conflict in which states directed every possible political, social and economic resource toward the utter defeat of the enemy — mankind’s first total war.Is this a coincidence? During the late 18th century, the Western world largely took war for granted. The major powers fought one another at regular intervals and devoted the lion’s share of their budgets to the purpose. For this very reason, however, they took care to practice a degree of restraint and to treat their adversaries with honor. The French reformer Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne was exaggerating when he said that “armies [now] slaughter each other politely ... what was once a wild rage is now just a moment’s madness.” Still, particularly in Western Europe, war took less of a human toll in the century before the French Revolution than at almost any time in history.In fact, advanced thinkers who believed in the new, Enlightenment creed of secular human progress came to hope that war might fade away entirely. European philosophers like Baron d’Holbach called it nothing but a “remnant of savage customs,” and no less a figure than George Washington agreed, in 1788, that it was time for agriculture and commerce “to supersede the waste of war and the rage of conquest.” It was precisely such sentiments that inspired France’s declaration of peace two years later.'"
"'07-02-04,'0','DESPITE the chill on a recent weekday morning, a few dozen people strolled the Derby Greenway Trail, the 1.7-mile-long, 10-foot-wide paved walkway that runs atop most of the levees along the Housatonic and Naugatuck Rivers.What were absent were dogs.In late November, in an 8-to-1 vote, the city’s Board of Aldermen decided to ban dogs for six months after receiving complaints, they said, about people not picking up after them. (Dogs can return on June 1, which also marks the start of a three-month review period.)If caught, owners have been asked to leave, but starting this month, they will be fined, said Kenneth Hughes, president of the Board of Aldermen.“People have to understand that the trail was made for people and not dogs,” Mr. Hughes said, explaining that unlike other state greenways, whose sides are lined with grass and trees, the post-and-rail fences in Derby give dogs no option but to relieve themselves on the path.The Derby trail was made mainly to allow people to get closer to the Naugatuck, the river that once powered the city’s copper tube, pin and piano factories. After the river spilled over its banks in 1955, destroying downtowns and killing dozens of people, Derby and other cities built tall levees that formed imposing barriers and made it hard to get close to the water.'"
"'07-02-04,'0','FORGET the makeup and flashy stagecraft deployed by the members of the Impossible Missions Force in their quest to bring justice to merciless dictators in South America and iron-fisted rulers behind the Iron Curtain. What’s really impressive is that no matter what country they infiltrate, they speak the native language flawlessly — that would be English of course, with a dusting of a Latin or Balkan accent. Impossible indeed.Such suspension of credibility is necessary to appreciate the first season of the classic and often outrageously clever CBS series “Mission: Impossible.” The 28 episodes, now available in a seven-DVD collection, look great, with color as crisp as when they were originally broadcast in 1966 and 1967.Credit Lalo Schifrin’s unforgettable, pulsating theme with turbocharging each episode. And it’s a kick to see what cold war anxieties the show’s writers exploited in a TV era fraught with espionage series (“The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,” “I Spy,” “Secret Agent,” “The Avengers”). The I.M.F. encounters villains armed with nuclear warheads, plague and vials of deadly bacteria capable of contaminating a city’s water supply — fears that sound depressingly plausible today. No wonder Tom Cruise saw the movie potential in the series.Unlike James Bond, who got his marching orders face to face from the curt but indulgent M, Dan Briggs, the I.M.F.’s chief, travels to the oddest places — a liquor store, a drive-in movie, an amusement arcade — to discover the mission (should he decide to accept it). Wherever the venue, there is always that tape warning Briggs that should he or any of the I.M.F. “be caught or killed, the secretary will disavow any knowledge” of their actions — the same tape that self-destructs in five seconds after it’s finished. Played with sly intelligence by Steven Hill (the estimable actor who later portrayed District Attorney Adam Schiff on “Law & Order”), Briggs, of course, accepts all assignments.Briggs’s ensemble includes Martin Landau as Rollin Hand, an actor and master of disguise (he bills himself as the man of a million faces, besting the immortal Lon Chaney by a mere 999,000); Barbara Bain (then married to Mr. Landau) as the sultry model Cinnamon Carter; Greg Morris as Barney Collier, whose electronic wizardry powers much of the I.M.F.’s chicanery; and Peter Lupus as Willy Armitage, the thinking person’s muscleman.In one of the season’s best episodes, the I.M.F. must steal the last car of the Svardia-Bern Express, surreptitiously move it into a warehouse, then convince the occupants that the train remains running on schedule — until there’s a “crash.” All of this is accomplished through movie magic: rear projection screens simulate the passing countryside, myriad reel-to-reel tape recorders mimic the sounds of a moving train, and rockers beneath the car provide the feeling of motion. In the end the charade exposes an idealistic prime minister’s protégé as a traitor to Svardia’s burgeoning democracy.In a later episode Eartha Kitt plays a contortionist who aids the I.M.F. by snaking her way through narrow air ducts in a foreign embassy, then limboing under various alarms to crack a vault holding stolen coded American intelligence secrets. If you’ve seen Mr. Cruise in the first “M:I” movie breaking into a supposedly impenetrable “black vault” at C.I.A. headquarters (through air ducts), Ms. Kitt’s acrobatics may seem familiar, albeit on a smaller scale. Whatever the budgets, suspense is played perfectly in both.'"
"'07-02-04,'0','These days, 5,000 workers operate machines that harvest more than 12 million tons of processing tomatoes. This represents a great leap in productivity — but it also suggests the disruptive effects of a sudden rise in the wages of workers at the bottom of the income scale.Most economists believe that imposing a minimum wage will generally increase joblessness at the bottom. More than 45 percent of respondents in a 2000 survey of members of the American Economic Association said they “mainly agreed” that minimum wages increased unemployment among young and unskilled workers, and an additional 28 percent responded that they “agreed with provisos,” which were not spelled out.Still, the consensus behind this bit of orthodoxy has weakened over time. Over the last few decades there have been several increases in federal and state minimum wages, with little impact on the level of employment. This has led economists in the last decade to reconsider the link between wages and jobs at the bottom. “The experience we have suggests that if there were a change in the range that is currently being talked about, it would be hard to detect any employment effects,” said Lawrence Katz of Harvard, one of a handful of economists whose work in the 1990s challenged the prevailing view that raising minimum wages reduced jobs.Alan Krueger, an economist at Princeton whose work also challenged earlier analyses of the impact of minimum wages on jobs, noted that while studies in the 1960s and ’70s seemed to relate gains in the minimum wage to falling teenage employment, the link weakened when using more recent data. That’s because the minimum wage has fallen substantially in real terms, and not many workers earn so little money. Those who do are much more difficult to replace than the tomato pickers were in the ’60s.Mr. Krueger pointed out that the conventional view assumed that it didn’t cost employers anything to replace a worker with somebody or something cheaper. In real life, by contrast, there is a cost to hiring; turnover is expensive. Unless the jump in the minimum wage were very large, employers would be unlikely to respond by letting workers go.The number of workers earning the minimum wage has shriveled in the United States. In 2005, fewer than 2 million people earned no more than the federal minimum wage, down from 4.4 million as recently as 1998. These workers were concentrated overwhelmingly in local service industries, which are relatively insulated from competition with imports, and in occupations that are relatively difficult to mechanize. For instance, virtually no minimum-wage workers were left in manufacturing. In 2005, according to government figures, only 39,000 manufacturing workers were earning no more than the minimum wage, down from 299,000 in 1998.By contrast, in 2005, about 1.2 million workers in the leisure and hospitality industry were earning no more than the minimum wage: restaurant cooks, hotel maids and others, accounting for almost 64 percent of all minimum-wage workers in the country.Unlike a manufacturer, a McDonald’s in the United States will not relocate to China when its labor costs rise. And until a machine is developed to adequately sauté the vegetables and toss the salad in America’s sit-down restaurants, it will be hard for employers to replace them, even if Congress agrees to increase their pay to $7.25 an hour from $5.15 over a couple of years.IN one study, Mr. Krueger and David Card of the University of California, Berkeley, found that in the eight months after New Jersey raised its minimum wage to $5.05 an hour from $4.25 in 1992, employment in fast-food restaurants grew slightly faster there than in Pennsylvania, where the minimum wage didn’t change.If there is a consequence to an increase in the federal minimum wage, it will more likely be seen in prices. Mr. Krueger and Mr. Card found that prices in restaurants in their study rose about 4 percent faster in New Jersey than they did in Pennsylvania.But that’s unlikely to induce customers to stop eating fast food. If labor accounts for about 30 percent of total costs in fast-food chains, even assuming that everybody at the restaurant works for the minimum wage, an increase of 40 percent, before inflation, is likely to add less than 10 percent to the price of your burger over two years.'"
"'07-02-04,'0','The Cleveland Orchestra is to return every season for a three-week residency. And the New World Symphony, the acclaimed orchestra academy run by the conductor Michael Tilson Thomas, will present major programs in the hall. But Mr. Thomas’s orchestra of top-notch young players is based in Miami Beach, and he plans to build a hall and teaching center, designed by Frank Gehry, near its current home, the Lincoln Theater. So for now most of the programs presented at Knight Concert Hall will be concerts by visiting orchestras, one-time events (like a recent performance of Mr. Golijov’s “Pasión Según San Marcos”) and performances by jazz ensembles, ethnic music groups and popular artists.Cultural insiders in Miami report that there is still bitterness among musicians over the demise of the Philharmonic. The overall annual budget for the Cleveland residency, which involves teaching workshops and outreach programs as well as concerts, is $3.5 million, most of it raised from contributors in Miami and Cleveland. An inability to raise a stopgap $2.5 million finally sank the Florida Philharmonic.Still, the Cleveland Orchestra concert was nearly sold out. As a gesture to Miami’s large Spanish-speaking population, the orchestra’s music director, Franz Welser-Möst, began the program with works by Argentine composers.Mr. Golijov’s “Last Round” takes the sound of a tango played on the accordionlike bandoneón and reconceives it for a bustling string orchestra heavily fortified with basses. Ginastera’s spunky 1953 “Variaciones Concertantes” incorporates evocations of Argentine folk music into a lean, rigorous and harmonically astringent 20-minute piece. But the highlight of the program was Mr. Welser-Möst’s clear-headed and vibrant account of Mahler’s Symphony No. 1, however curious it was to hear several flubbed solos from such a formidable orchestra.In what is becoming a trend, the stage of the concert hall extends into the auditorium. Rows of seats along the wall behind the stage can accommodate either a chorus or 200 extra patrons. A large organ loft, covered by a beautifully designed hibiscus curtain, awaits the purchase of an organ, whenever a donor comes along.After one hearing I hesitate to pronounce on the hall’s acoustics, designed by Russell Johnson of Artec. Mr. Johnson has received wide-ranging reactions to his work. Like Verizon Hall at the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia, another Johnson project, the Knight Concert Hall auditorium is flanked on either side by reverberation chambers with 82 huge concrete doors, covered with fabric and wood, which can be open or closed. This design element allows the hall to be “tuned,” as Mr. Johnson puts it, just like an instrument. Getting the tuning right, which can take many months, is bound to be a subjective call.Overall, the Cleveland Orchestra sounded full-bodied and clear, though the acoustics seemed to favor the lower-register instruments, especially the rich basses. The soft, sustained high violins in the opening of the Mahler lacked shimmer. The sound was pure but a bit thin. Yet the symphony’s brassy finale had plenty of clarion presence.I had no problem with the acoustics Mr. Johnson designed for the Ziff Ballet Opera House. This 2,400-seat auditorium is tall, with four tiers of balconies, but not deep. Even in the back of the top balcony the seats are just 139 feet from the stage. From my central seat on the main floor, the voices came through clearly, and the orchestra, conducted by Angelo Cavallaro, had warmth and presence.The old-fashioned production of “Manon Lescaut” from the Montreal Opera, directed by Bernard Uzan, realistically if somewhat drearily, evokes the late-18th-century French setting for this story of young Manon, who falls impulsively in love with the ardent and penniless Chevalier des Grieux but has a fatal weakness for jewels and finery. Puccini’s first big success, “Manon Lescaut” teems with impassioned emotions and soaring vocal lines.The lovely French soprano Sylvie Valayre brought temperament, intensity and stylistic insight to her portrayal of Manon. But in full-voiced outbursts, her sound turned raw and wobbly. The des Grieux was a hefty young tenor, Hugh Smith, who sang with impressive power and belted out the top notes. But his singing was blunt and muscular. The deftly staged crowd scenes allowed the company’s robust chorus to shine.Projected titles provided simultaneous English and Spanish translations, an essential policy in this bilingual city. In the lobbies during intermission, smartly dressed operagoers of all ages conversed in Spanish.Drawing in Spanish-speaking residents in South Florida has been a defining mission of the Carnival Center from its inception. The complex includes the Studio Theater, a black-box performance space that can accommodate 200 people, which has proved a popular place for ethnic music and dance events, and the Peacock Education Center, a large workshop and classroom.Still, it may take time to build audiences. An article published in The Miami Herald last Sunday reported that, three months and 100 performances into the center’s first season, ticket sales have been lackluster, some $900,000 below projections, forcing administrators “to find new ways of connecting with Miami audiences.” On average, the article said, 59 percent of available tickets have been sold, down from the 64 percent the center’s directors anticipated. Classical music events have sold the best. The Florida Grand Opera had a major hit with its production of Verdi’s “Aida” last fall, featuring the soprano Angela M. Brown, a star in the making, in the title role.Attendance may be affected by stories of parking hassles. Although the center is a block away from a major bus terminal, most people use cars to get there. There are parking lots in the vicinity, but the Carnival Center’s garage is a valet-only operation, and after the symphony concert, a long line of patrons waited outside on the balmy night for valets.The Cleveland Orchestra tour managers had a brainstorm: they provided free cookies, soft drinks and water, which the queued-up concertgoers happily accepted.'"
"'07-02-04,'0','If you watch “The O.C.,” you might think that Orange County, Calif., is a vapid cultural wasteland, an overtanned suburb of surfer dudes, spoiled members of Gen Y and desperate housewives. That's not necessarily inaccurate, unless you consider the small coastal city of Costa Mesa, about 37 miles south of Los Angeles.This midsize, somewhat nondescript city was once a sprawl of office parks and strip malls. But over the last decade, artists, writers and developers have turned Costa Mesa into a cultural beacon, with a gleaming concert hall, art galleries and theater stages that have become breeding grounds for Broadway.The heart of this artistic renaissance is the Orange County Performing Arts Center (600 Town Center Drive, 714-556-2787; www.ocpac.org), which rises like Oz against a sprawling landscape of bland high-rises. Last September, the center opened a $240 million building designed by Cesar Pelli that includes a sleek facade of undulating glass, a 2,000-seat concert hall and a 500-seat theater. The concert hall, named after Renée and Henry Segerstrom, has played host to the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Mariinsky Theater of St. Petersburg, Russia, which mounted Wagner's Ring Cycle last September, the first major “Ring” performed in Southern California in 30 years.“It's truly extraordinary that in a little more than 20 years, Costa Mesa and the people of Orange County have established a cultural scene that has taken other communities generations to achieve,” said Terrence W. Dwyer, president of the Performing Arts Center.For first-rate plays, head next door to the intimate Folino Theater Center, which opened in 2002 as the new home of the South Coast Repertory (655 Town Center Drive, 714-708-5555; www.scr.org), the county's busiest resident professional theater and arguably the most important in Southern California.Nationally recognized as an incubator of major talent, South Coast has mounted an impressive list of acclaimed plays, long before the East Coast establishment got wind of them. Among the plays it produced first were the Pulitzer Prize-winning “Wit” in 1995 and Donald Margulies's “Sight Unseen” and “Collected Stories.”'"

"'07-02-05,'1','WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 — Senator John McCain said Sunday that several aides brought on to his presidential campaign were “good people,” despite his own past criticisms of their work for others in the past.Appearing on “This Week” on ABC, Mr. McCain was asked about a front-page article in The New York Times on Sunday noting that Mr. McCain’s political team includes advisers who tried to skewer him in the 2000 primary against George W.

Obviously, I would do so, but I hope we would do so in an honorable fashion. We will run an honorable campaign.”'"
"'07-02-05,'1','Imagine the Census Bureau announcing that it would end the practice of asking people to identify themselves by race beginning in 2010. Black elected officials and their allies in the civil rights community would fight the proposal tooth and nail by arguing that racial statistics were necessary for enforcing civil rights laws — especially the Voting Rights Act — and that dropping race from the census would dilute black political strength. Enemies of affirmative action would jump for joy, believing that they had finally won.But these antagonists aren’t the only factions in the fight. A growing number of demographers and historians who are fully sympathetic to the civil rights struggle would probably be happy to see the word “race” disappear from the census as well. There seems to be an emerging consensus that the system of racial classification that has dominated national politics and the census for nearly two centuries is so fraught with imprecision — and so tainted by racist ideas that have been disproved by science — that it should eventually be dropped altogether.This view has been percolating among census historians for years. But it has gained traction since the 1990s, when there was a pitched battle over a proposal that would have added a “multiracial” category to the 2000 census. A compromise allowed people to check more than one box for race. But that change only fueled the debate by revealing a conflict between the fixed racial categories that have long dominated American life and a different sense of identity that’s clearly on the rise among younger Americans.Most Americans think of racial categories as objective, even benign, descriptions that are part of the social fabric. But the historian Margo Anderson writes that official statistics on “race” or “color” were inaugurated into the federal statistical system in the early 19th century. By then the government had embraced the view that people of African descent were from genetically inferior ancestral groups and could never escape subordinate status.Armed with this view, the Census Bureau became the fountainhead of 19th-century racist dogma. The bureau reported, for example, that free black people were disproportionately insane, thus supporting the view that slavery was the only suitable status for them. It actively promoted the eugenicist view that Americans of African descent were so inferior and ill equipped to survive that they would eventually become extinct.'"
"'07-02-05,'1','In Mr. Spitzer’s view, aid increases should be provided to cities, towns and villages “based on their level of fiscal distress.”Under his plan, 17 economically struggling upstate communities would receive the maximum 9 percent annual increase in aid. New York City and 81 “high-wealth towns and villages” would not receive any aid.Aides to the governor said the city’s loss would be more than made up for by the big increase in education spending and by closing certain tax loopholes, which are projected to save the city $374 million in the coming fiscal year and $379 million thereafter. Closing those loopholes, they say, essentially negates the effect of the loss of $327.9 million in annual aid.“The increased revenues that the city will receive from tax-loophole closings offset the money that it would be losing from the AIM program,” said Paul E. Francis, the governor’s budget director.The city is not as optimistic about the plan.For one thing, the $327.9 million in annual aid is a recurring, steady and longstanding revenue source, while the $374 million from closing tax loopholes is a projection by the governor’s office that may or may not prove accurate.In addition, the Legislature may not approve both the reduction in aid and closing of the loopholes.Secondly, because of how state aid is accounted for, the $327.9 million reduction might feel more like a $650 million hit. The AIM payments to New York City are typically disbursed in installments around October and December, for the fiscal year that ended the previous June 30.If Mr. Spitzer’s AIM proposal takes effect for the state fiscal year that starts on April 1, New York City would lose its aid not only for its next fiscal year, but also for the current one.A third potential point of contention is whether closing the loophole is a good idea.The governor says that corporations reduce their state tax liabilities using loopholes like shifting income out of the state using sophisticated tax-planning techniques and deducting dividends earned by real estate investment trusts.Some Republican critics have contended that Mr. Spitzer is really raising taxes under the guise of closing loopholes, a characterization the governor denies. Some business leaders assert that the cost of doing business in New York City remains very high and that any changes to the corporate tax structure should be made gingerly.Even so, Elizabeth Lynam, deputy research director at the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed policy organization, predicted that the city’s concerns about the governor’s budget would be expressed quietly. “I wouldn’t imagine there would be much acrimony, as far as the city-state relationship, in the next few weeks,” she said.Mr. Bloomberg returned yesterday from a trip to Israel, and his aides said they could not comment on the governor’s budget until after the mayor testifies today at a joint hearing of the Senate Finance Committee and the Assembly Ways and Means Committee.City Councilman David I. Weprin, the chairman of the Council’s Finance Committee, said he was concerned about the reduction in state aid, but confident that Governor Spitzer’s budget would benefit the city on the whole.“I feel pretty confident we’re going to do a lot better under Governor Spitzer than we ever did under Governor Pataki,” said Mr. Weprin, a Queens Democrat.“Even though this particular accounting move — if one wants to call it that — will on paper hurt New York City, I think it will be more than made up for in other ways,” Mr. Weprin said.He noted that Mr. Spitzer was proposing increasing state aid to the city’s schools by an amount substantially greater than the $1.9 billion minimum ordered by the state’s highest court in a landmark school financing case.In addition to increasing education aid while eliminating the unrestricted aid, Mr. Spitzer’s $120.6 billion budget plan includes smaller changes that would affect New York City.The plan calls for increasing what the state charges New York City for administering the city’s personal income tax; the change would cost the city $30 million a year.Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Bloomberg basically agree on several programs but not on all the details.The governor has proposed raising to $2 million from $50,000 the threshold at which New York City public building projects fall under the Wicks Law, which requires municipalities to use four separate contractors for such projects.The change would save the city $8 million in the next fiscal year, rising to $12.4 million in two years. The city would prefer to repeal the law, saying it would save $62 million a year.The governor also proposed changes involving lawsuits by public employees against their employers. One change would prevent employees who have won jury awards from also collecting full disability pensions.There is also the question of how the governor’s sweeping Medicaid proposal would affect New York City’s public hospitals system. So far, there is little consensus on the answer.Over all, Mr. Francis said that the budget plan would benefit the city by $668.5 million, almost all of that attributable to the increase in education aid. Combining two existing health-related programs — a cap on local contributions to Medicaid and a state takeover of the Family Health Plus insurance program — the figure approaches $1.4 billion, Mr. Francis said.“Governor Spitzer believes this is an overwhelmingly positive budget for residents of New York City,” he said.But as the city continues to analyze the reams of budget documents coming out of Albany, that view could be challenged.“It’s going to take some time for the city to work out just how well it will fare under the governor’s budget proposal,” predicted Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the city’s Independent Budget Office.'"
"'07-02-05,'1','The board of NBC Universal has scheduled a meeting in New York tomorrow morning, fueling speculation that the long-awaited appointment of Jeff Zucker as the company’s new chairman and chief executive, succeeding Bob Wright, will be formally announced the same day.One executive expected to participate in the meeting noted that three executives from the Vivendi Corporation, including its chief, Jean-Bernard Levy, are to travel from Paris to attend the meeting. Vivendi, which sold its main entertainment assets to NBC in 2003, remains a 20 percent owner of NBC Universal.Mr. Zucker’s ascension to the top position at NBC Universal has been forecast for many months. The appointment, if it takes place as expected, will be consistent with most succession plans at the General Electric Company, the parent of NBC Universal, in that it will elevate a longtime insider who had been groomed specifically for the job for many years.The coming retirement of Mr. Wright, who has led NBC for nearly 20 years and is now 63, and the appointment of Mr. Zucker, who is 41, were both presaged in an interview given to The New York Times in November by Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chairman of G.E.“Bob’s done his job extremely well for a long period of time,” Mr. Immelt said, “and he’s getting close to retirement.” In the same interview, Mr. Immelt openly declared his backing for Mr. Zucker, saying, “I am today and have been a Jeff Zucker fan.”'"
"'07-02-05,'1','Offline, however, the product introduction may have stumbled in trying to generate excitement with midnight store openings for Vista. Recently, the introduction of game consoles like Nintendo Wii and Sony PlayStation 3 drew crowds to stores for a day or more before the consoles went on sale. But within 40 minutes of selling Vista for the first time, CompUSA on Fifth Avenue in New York already saw its line wane to a trickle.Long lines for new products can have a positive effect on sales by generating news coverage that persuades consumers that they, too, should rush out to buy something. Consumers are more likely to buy based on product mentions in news content than on advertising, said Steven J. Farella, president and chief executive of TargetCast, an ad agency in New York.Many marketers have bolstered their public relations efforts in recent years and replaced some of their traditional advertising with events or stunts that the press is likely to cover, like Bill Gates’s appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.” This reflects a shift in mentality from a top-down approach to a groundswell strategy, Mr. Farella said.This time around, Microsoft also faced consumers who spend their free time with a vastly different array of media and entertainment devices.“It’s harder to get people’s attention now because of media fragmentation and audience distraction, and it’s easier for people to ignore you,” said Chuck Porter, the chairman of Crispin Porter + Bogusky. “Mass media to a degree doesn’t exist anymore.”Mr. Porter said many advertisers now focus on finding prime customers rather than blitzing all consumers.In the online aspects of its campaign, Microsoft took a narrow approach. The company focused on three groups of Internet users with different interactive campaigns.For young consumers who like to spend time on social networking sites, Vista introduced a Web site featuring the comedian Demetri Martin. Young people online did take a liking to Mr. Martin — his MySpace.com page lists more than 80,000 friends. Microsoft also sponsored a tour for Mr. Martin and a special on Comedy Central.For more technically minded consumers, Microsoft created a puzzle game called Vanishing Point with online and offline events and clues; 90,000 people played the game, Mr. Williams of Microsoft said.For a broader audience, Microsoft created a site for people to post photos and videos of amazing moments — or as Microsoft called it, “Wow” moments. About 20,000 people did so.Retail analysts said they were not worried about Vista sales in the long run, despite the lack of apparent excitement. For one, they said, Vista is available in large quantities whereas the sought-out game consoles were produced in limited supply.Also, Vista was available at 39,000 store locations last Tuesday, while Windows 95 was introduced at far fewer stores, which made crowds at any given location bigger, said Christopher Swenson, director of software and industry analysis for the NPD Group.Mr. Swenson also said that thousands of people ordered Vista through Amazon.“People can get it overnighted to them and delivered to their office,” Mr. Swenson said. “Why would anybody go out in the freezing cold to a retailer?”'"
"'07-02-05,'1','Should you get the whitening toothpaste, the anticavity toothpaste or the one that does both? The detergent that removes stains, the one that makes colors brighter or the all-in-one?Those decisions are the subject of studies described in a forthcoming paper in The Journal of Consumer Research, titled “Jack-of-All-Trades or Master of One?” The studies show that, when consumers consider all-in-one products side by side with specialized ones, the specialized products seem better at their particular functions than they did when considered alone. The all-in-ones, on the other hand, seem worse at each job.There is at least one way for marketers to short-circuit this effect: make the all-in-ones more expensive. In one experiment, the proportion of subjects choosing the all-in-one product shot up by more than a third when it was priced at a premium. “If you combine different products, you must give people a reason why they should not discount the performance of each individual function,” said Alexander Chernev, the paper’s author and an associate professor of marketing at Northwestern University. “The moment they think it’s more expensive, they find a way to account for this discrepancy.”'"
"'07-02-05,'1','The Swedes, who jumped into the newspaper game back in 1645, are taking another great leap forward: what is said to be the oldest newspaper in the world has gone digital and is now available online, and online only.The World Association of Newspapers says that the country’s Post och Inrikes Tidningar, or PoIT, is the world’s oldest newspaper still in publication. Its new editor, Roland Haegglund, is its only employee.“The change in format is of course a major departure, for some possibly a little sad, but it is also a natural step,” Mr. Haegglund told Agence France-Presse, which first reported the story.The paper was founded by Queen Christina and her chancellor. Sweden was engaged in the Thirty Years’ War at the time and had devoted much of its treasury to the war, causing widespread misery at home; Hans Holm, the last editor of PoIT’s print version, told the agency that the newspaper was a way of explaining to citizens where their taxes were going.The paper was and remains the official organ of the Swedish government. It thrived during the 17th and 18th centuries, covering foreign and domestic news. But as competition grew, PoIT stopped covering news and instead carried announcements by financial, legal and corporate institutions. The final print version, published Dec. 29, had only 1,500 subscribers.Christina, who became queen at age 5 although she did not receive her coronation until she was 18, helped found the newspaper when she was 19, amid much court intrigue and a chaotic romantic life. If only the paper were online then, she could have blogged about it. KATHARINE Q. SEELYE'"
"'07-02-05,'1','By contrast, the implanted chips have gained almost no traction in the marketplace since the Food and Drug Administration approved their sale in 2004.Applied Digital plans to issue at least 4.3 million shares of VeriChip for $6.50 to $8.50 a share, leaving it with 47.4 percent to 53.6 percent of the stock, depending on whether the three underwriters exercise their rights to buy additional shares, according to its registration statement. VeriChip would net $27 million if the shares sold at $7.50, the filing said.Its technology requires the injection of a rice-grain size capsule into a user’s upper right arm. The chip inside contains a coded identifying number that is linked to whatever the user authorizes — whether his or her name, address, emergency contacts and important medical records. The chip can be energized and then scanned by a hand-held reader that has to be positioned within inches of the arm to work reliably.For the most part, the company has been giving hospitals and doctors the gear needed to read the chips and link the encoded numbers in them to patient information. In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, VeriChip said that total revenue from the device and the services tied to it was less than $100,000.VeriChip said that more than 1,200 doctors had registered to take part in VeriMed, as the company calls the medical application of its implant, as of the end of 2006, and that close to 400 medical facilities had been equipped with scanners and supporting gear. It said that only 222 patients have had the device implanted.The company acknowledges that it relies mostly on patients to provide the information linked to their identification numbers and that health care workers may not be fully confident about its reliability until doctors or members of their staffs supervise the data entry, one of many essential steps that may not occur. No insurers reimburse doctors for participating.Scott R. Silverman, the chairman of Applied Digital and, since December, chairman and chief executive of VeriChip, has no shortage of vision of how the chips may eventually be embraced. He has referred to them as the “natural successor to the dog tag” for the armed forces and recently proposed that all immigrants and guest workers have the implants. But VeriChip also says that it intends to build the market with voluntary programs like VeriMed, a gesture to privacy concerns that has done little to mollify critics.Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said: “This technology sends the Orwell meter into the red zone. There’s almost no scenario under which the benefit can’t be obtained from an anklet or a bracelet. The only reason to implant it is so that it can’t be removed voluntarily, which makes it a human rights issue.”Applied Digital may be running out of time to overcome the critics and doubters. It has been keeping the VeriChip business alive with a steady stream of loans and a favorable supply contract with the Digital Angel Corporation, a publicly traded subsidiary that sells similar implantable devices for identifying and tracking pets and livestock. How long Applied Digital’s creditors and long-suffering shareholders would support this largess is unclear.In its filing, VeriChip said that $7 million would go toward repaying money lent by Applied Digital and that $8 million to $10 million would be invested in developing VeriChip over the next two years.'"

"'07-02-06,'1','Carter had an opportunity for redemption with a 3-point attempt as time was winding down in overtime, but it rimmed out and the Nets did not take another shot.The Nets are making things difficult on themselves, Carter said, with “our defensive lapses, our inability to score sometimes.”He added: “At the same time, we got to make our free throws. Everything’s going wrong, but at the same time we just have to stick together.”Even when the Nets did something right Monday, they were holding themselves back at the same time.During a third-quarter stretch in which the Nets outscored the Sixers by 6-2 and held them without a field goal for four minutes to increase their lead to 11, they missed six of eight free throws. Those misses allowed the Sixers (16-33) to hang around, and they closed the quarter on a 12-2 run to trail by only a point entering the fourth quarter. (A day earlier against the Hawks, the Nets missed 14 of 34 free throws.)“They’re empty possessions,” Nets Coach Lawrence Frank said of the missed free throws. “It’s just like a turnover. We’re going through a repeated exercise, so hopefully at some point we’ll crack the code.”The Nets put themselves in a precarious position in the fourth quarter, when their defense disappeared and they allowed the Sixers to use a 14-4 run to turn a 4-point deficit into a 6-point lead. But the Nets fought back and forced overtime when Eddie House hit a 3-pointer with 7.8 seconds remaining to tie the score at 88-88.In overtime, the Nets made only 3 of 8 field-goal attempts, while the Sixers shot 55.6 percent.Even though it seemed as if the Sixers had an easy time cracking the Nets’ defense, Moore said it was not necessarily so. He pointed to a pair of shots by the Sixers’ Joe Smith — an off-balance leaner late in the fourth quarter and a 19-footer in overtime with a hand in his face. “If you got their center shooting the ball way out there, that’s good defense,” Moore said. “That’s what you got to take.”As much as the Nets may try to find positives — several times their captain, Jason Kidd, reiterated the point, “We’re going out there and we’re competing” — their situation could soon become dire.The Nets are three and a half games behind Toronto for first place in the Atlantic Division, which the Nets have won in four of the past five seasons. The Nets are in ninth place in the Eastern Conference, a game and a half behind Miami; the top eight teams make the playoffs.After winning 9 of 11 games from late December through late January, the Nets have lost seven of nine.The Nets are also falling on the wrong end of close games. Five of their past seven defeats have come down to a single possession.“You would think that the percentages would change and be in our favor,” said Kidd, who had 14 points, 8 assists and 7 rebounds. “Right now we’re in a rough patch. We’re not getting that stop or making that shot.”With the same core group as last season, the Nets may have entered this season with the attitude that they could strut to another division title. They may finally be starting to realize that it will not be that easy.“Sooner or later, it’s got to be turned around,” forward Cliff Robinson said before the game. “It’s got to be consistent basketball. It can’t be good games for a stretch and then bad games for a stretch.”'"

"'07-02-06,'1','Representatives for the Wall Street banks declined to comment on the investigation.“Mutual fund traders have long complained that their big trades may be being front-run by market participants with inside information about their trades, and they believe the price on those trades suffers as a result,” said Lori Richards, the director of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations at the S.E.C. “We are looking into these allegations in a systemic way. It is fact-finding and too early for any conclusions.”The S.E.C. confirmed the existence of the investigation but declined to comment further.Concerns about insider trading have escalated as mergers and buyouts have boomed and the use of complex derivatives has soared. Studies of various markets — including those for stocks and credit default swaps — have pointed to an unusual amount of trading ahead of announcements for deals.The growing power of hedge funds — and their opaqueness and the wide range of trading strategies they employ — is feeding those concerns. Hedge funds control an estimated 30 percent to 50 percent of trading on most major markets. They are also Wall Street’s best customers. Hedge funds trade, borrow and finance more, on average, than other clients And as more hedge funds enter a crowded field, the premium on information has never been higher.With data on millions of trades from most major Wall Street banks, the S.E.C. will try to examine whether outside traders like hedge funds or internal traders like those inside the firm who are trading with the bank’s money may be getting tips from the bank handling the mutual fund’s trade and using the information to place a trade elsewhere.“If an investment bank is tipping a hedge fund on a trade we are doing on Dell, those people all need to go to jail,” said Andrew M. Brooks, vice president and head of equity trading at T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund company. “We are absolutely concerned and worried and paranoid about information leakage, information that would allow someone to know about our trades and run ahead.”If the commission finds any evidence of possible insider trading, it would then commence a formal investigation. The S.E.C. could ultimately bring civil charges against individuals or firms.Regulators and law enforcement officials have pursued other cases related to the sharing of information about trades. In what became known as the squawk box case, brokers from institutions, including Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Lehman Brothers, were accused of allowing traders to listen in on the public outcry system — the squawk box on the trading floors — to glean tips about customer orders coming in.The S.E.C. sued the A. B. Watley Group and 16 people in the case. Next month, the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn will bring to trial a case against seven people. Two have pleaded guilty to insider trading. While the accusations in the squawk box case involve an obvious dissemination of insider information, detecting whether traders were illegally tipped in huge, fast-moving markets is much harder.When Linda Chatman Thomsen, head of enforcement at the S.E.C., testified before Congress in September about insider trading, she outlined some of the problems inherent in such cases.“Piecing together an insider trading case can be a complex and painstaking process,” she said. “It is rare to find a ‘smoking gun’; virtually all insider trading cases hinge on circumstantial evidence. It is quite common for insider traders to come up with alternative rationales for their trading — rationales that the staff must refute with inferences drawn from the timing of the trades, the movement of the funds and other facts and circumstances.”There are many gray areas. If Mr. Brooks of T. Rowe Price wants to sell stock in the XYZ Company and he hires a bank to do that, the bank has to call clients to gauge interest in the stock. That is not tipping, but legitimate work for the bank to do.And detecting any trades will be difficult. If a trader received a tip about a stock whose price was set to rise, that trader could enter into trades that are harder for regulators to detect — like derivatives transactions that are not traded on any exchange and whose value may be linked to a change in a stock price rather than the stock itself or an option on the stock.Here’s how a questionable trade might take place: If Fidelity asked brokerage firm X to sell a large part of its stake in I.B.M., and traders at that brokerage firm told its favorite clients to expect a drop in I.B.M.’s price as a result, that favorite client could go to another brokerage firm — or group of banks or trading venues — and sell I.B.M. shares short, betting on a decline and making money when Fidelity’s order went through. The trader could pay back the source of the tip by directing more business to his bank.“The information is going to the bank as an agent, and the bank is only supposed to use the information for the mutual fund’s benefit,” said Larry E. Ribstein, a professor of law at the University of Illinois. “If it uses it for someone else’s benefit, you might have a concern.”The hedge fund business has long argued that it is unfairly tarnished with suggestions of insider trading. Amid increased scrutiny by regulators into hedge funds’ use of information in the loan market, the Managed Funds Association said in a statement last year, “We reaffirm our collective commitment to promote fair and competitive markets in which inappropriate use of material nonpublic information is not tolerated.”“Hedge funds pay a lot in commissions,” said Mr. Brooks of T. Rowe Price. “They are smart and work hard, but they can’t be that smart and work that hard to get some of the advantages they have gotten.”“There are too many conflicts of interest between those who serve hedge funds and hedge funds themselves.”'"
"'07-02-06,'1','Geri D. Palast, the campaign’s executive director, said the governor’s proposed budget was consistent with the group’s goals in its landmark school financing lawsuit. “We want to make you an honorary member of C.F.E.,” she told the governor.Mr. Spitzer encouraged education advocacy groups to support his calls for distributing more money to high-need urban districts like New York City’s. “You are the troops who will determine the success of what we’re trying to do,” he told Ms. Palast.The alliance showed how much the political calculus of Albany has changed. Education advocates shared a stage with the governor, instead of picketing him, as they did sometimes to his predecessor, George E. Pataki. And with the governor and the Democratic-led Assembly very close in their approaches to school financing, the advocates could train their attention on the Republican-led State Senate, which is wary of the governor’s proposal.Although critical of the governor’s overall budget, the mayor endorsed the governor’s plans to revamp school aid formulas, tie increases in school financing to performance measures and raise the statewide cap on charter schools to 250 from 100.While Mr. Bloomberg said “we are grateful” for the proposed increase in education spending, he maintained that even with the total amount of school aid growing, “After all the ‘Sturm und Drang’ and court decisions, the city’s share of state aid to education changes virtually not one bit.”From 2002 to 2011, he said, the city will have increased its spending on public schools by $5.8 billion a year, compared with a projected annual increase of $4.5 billion in state aid for the city schools.Mr. Bloomberg saved his strongest criticism for Mr. Spitzer’s plan to eliminate the city’s share of a state program called Aid and Incentives to Municipalities, which provides the city with $327.9 million in unrestricted aid each year.The city fuels the state economy, he said, contributes 48.6 percent of state tax revenues and pays $11 billion more each year to the state than it receives in aid. “The state budget should not undercut New York City’s, which, to some extent, this budget does,” he said.The city has received the aid since 1946 and sees it as particularly valuable because it is steady from year to year — unlike property tax receipts, the city’s main source of revenue.Because the aid to municipalities is disbursed toward the end of each calendar year, for the city fiscal year that ended the previous June 30, the reduction would amount to a one-time hit of about $660 million, the mayor said — $327.9 million for the current fiscal year and $327.9 million for the next.Furthermore, the mayor predicted that the loss of aid would be irreversible: “Something that’s gone is gone: Just take a look at the commuter tax.” (That tax was repealed in 1999, costing New York City hundreds of millions of dollars a year.)The mayor also criticized a proposal by Mr. Spitzer to increase the annual charge the city pays the state to administer the city’s personal income tax, to $70 million from $40 million. He called on the Legislature to allow the city’s Finance Department to administer the tax instead.“I’m confident they can do far better for us than hitting us with a 75 percent year-over-year increase for doing less work,” he said. He said the task had become simpler because more taxpayers were using electronic filing and fewer people had to pay after the state repealed the city’s commuter tax in 1999.The mayor asked the state to restore aid, cut nearly a decade ago, for 15 city public housing developments that were built in the 1950s with state dollars. The city’s Housing Authority has to divert $60 million a year now in federal aid for operating costs at those developments. “If the state wants to be more compassionate, as it says it does, here’s a good place to start,” the mayor said.The mayor asked the Legislature to renew the $400-a-year property tax rebate that began in 2004; ratify a plan to cut $250 million in business, corporate and sales taxes; provide a $1,000-a-year tax credit to low-income families with children under age 3; and raise the city’s share of the cigarette tax to $2 per pack from $1.50.The mayor also called for repealing the Wicks Law, which requires that four separate contractors be hired for public building projects; giving city child welfare officials access to income data on foster parents; tightening rules governing lawsuits against the city by its employees; halting the practice of improving city workers’ pensions without the city’s approval; and giving the city’s Transitional Finance Authority $2.5 billion in additional capacity to issue bonds.'"

"'07-02-06,'1','The current price of corn is $3.23 a bushel, which is more than half again what it was a year ago, and beginning to bring to mind the record $5.545 a bushel set in July 1996.There are many reasons for this price spurt. The ethanol boom has created a sharp new demand for corn. The Department of Agriculture revised its estimate of the 2006 corn harvest downward by some 200 million bushels because of weather and other factors. There is also a smaller corn reserve on hand than usual — the smallest in a decade — which parallels shortages around the world.Add to this the growing weight of commodities funds investing in agricultural markets, and you have daydreams — or nightmares — of that $5 mark.Yet all this has taken place against the backdrop of three record harvests in a row, a sure sign of how strong the ethanol appetite for corn production is turning out to be. It’s tempting to assume that the effect of sharply higher prices is confined primarily to the agricultural sector. But where corn is concerned, we are all part of the agricultural sector. The historical cheapness of corn has driven it into nearly every aspect of our economy, in the form, most familiarly, of corn syrup. The low price of corn over the past half-century lies at the very foundation of America’s historically (and unrealistically) low food prices.Gratifying our two major appetites — cheap food and cheap gas — used to seem easy because both corn and oil were abundant. Cheap oil helped keep corn prices low because it cost farmers less to run their tractors and combines.But we are entering a new dynamic now. While there has been talk recently about refining ethanol from sources other than corn, that could take a while. So at the moment what we are trying to do is gratify those appetites from the same resource: agricultural land. No matter how high prices go, what will need to change isn’t the amount of corn acreage available or even the size of the enormous harvests we are already getting. What will need to change is the size of our appetites.'"
"'07-02-06,'1','About 2,200 of the devices have been implanted in patients suffering from depression, according to Cyberonics. Many insurers have paid for a few implants. But no major insurer routinely covers the procedure, which costs at least $25,000 at most hospitals.The VNS was approved in 1997 as a therapy to control epilepsy. The company’s former chief executive, Robert P. Cummins, bet heavily on expanding the sale of the device for depression. Cyberonics and psychiatrists working with the company used the term treatment-resistant depression to describe the severely ill patients they hoped to help. About 4 million of the 20 million Americans who are estimated to suffer from depression annually fail to find lasting relief from drugs and electroconvulsive therapy.While many patients say VNS has saved their lives, it failed its clinical trial. Patients with implants that were not turned on did not clearly fare worse than those receiving stimulation.But Mr. Cummins, whose mother and grandfather were depression sufferers and who committed suicide, persisted with a number of follow-up studies and eventually persuaded the Food and Drug Administration to approve the new use in 2005.The F.D.A.’s approval came despite opposition by many of the agency’s experts, which led to an investigation by the Senate Finance Committee. Its strong critique was among the documents cited by Medicare in reaching its decision not to cover the treatment.The vast majority of private insurers have also criticized the quality of the data supporting the device’s use and have refused to cover it. Having geared up to support a market that has been slow to develop because of such resistance, Cyberonics has been losing money.Last year, the company also became involved in federal investigations into how it handled options granted to Mr. Cummins and other executives. Pressure from dissident shareholders led to Mr. Cummins’s resignation late in November and the replacement of three board members last month.A national decision not to cover the implant would end the current practice of some local Medicare administrators to pay for it.Mr. Cummins gambled that he could gain broader coverage by proposing to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that it first cover a subset of the treatment-resistant group: the sickest of the sick.The agency’s reviewers said that the “concept of treatment-resistant depression is vaguely defined, subject to varying determination, and until a scientifically valid definition exists is of little help in treatment selection for individual patients.”The agency noted that 1,831 of the 1,843 public comments it had received were in favor of expanding coverage, including 618 from people who identified themselves as depression sufferers and 122 who had received the implant. More than 250 psychiatrists, the American Psychiatric Association and nearly 100 surgeons and neurologists also supported Cyberonics in the comments.Many patients told the agency that they had failed 20 or 30 depression treatments. Many of the comments spoke of difficulty getting private insurers to cover the implant and expressed hope that a positive coverage decision would influence the private insurers. Cyberonics had actively encouraged submissions, the agency noted.'"
"'07-02-06,'1','The Nasdaq Stock Market has won regulatory approval to increase fees and offer more services to the 3,200 companies listed on it.The higher fees were effective Jan. 1, Nasdaq said yesterday in a statement. The decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission also allows Nasdaq, an all-electronic exchange, to provide news-release distribution and Internet broadcasts at no additional charge.Nasdaq’s chief executive, Robert Greifeld, has tried to lure companies from the New York Stock Exchange through a series of acquisitions that helped Nasdaq expand beyond the business of matching buyers and sellers of shares.Some member companies opposed the higher fees, and the S.E.C. approved the proposal over objections from rival news-distribution companies, including Business Wire, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway. More than 30 Nasdaq-listed companies had asked regulators to reject the plan.Listing fees account for more than 10 percent of revenue at Nasdaq.The largest increases will apply to companies with more than 150 million shares outstanding. Their annual fees will rise to $95,000 from $75,000, Nasdaq said when it proposed the plan. The annual listing fee for similar-size companies at the Big Board is at least $139,500.The smallest increase, roughly 1.2 percent, will apply to companies with 50 million to 75 million shares, which will now pay $45,000. The comparable fee at the New York Stock Exchange is $46,500, according to data on its Web site.'"
"'07-02-06,'1','PARIS, Feb. 5 — Microsoft rebuffed a public appeal by Mikhail Gorbachev on Monday for its chairman, Bill Gates, to intervene on behalf of a Russian school principal charged with software piracy.The case of the teacher, Aleksandr Ponosov, has drawn wide public attention in Russia, in part because the principal says he innocently purchased computers with the unauthorized Windows software already installed.Praising Russia’s enforcement of intellectual property rights, Microsoft sought to distance itself from the prosecution in a statement issued by its public relations agency in London.“Mr. Ponosov’s case is a criminal case and as such was initiated and investigated by the public prosecutor’s office in Russia,” said Microsoft, whose European operations are based in Paris. “We are sure that the Russian courts will make a fair decision.”“We do respect the Russian government’s position on the importance of protecting intellectual property rights.”'"
"'07-02-06,'1','Richard Paris, the captain, was not tested for alcohol consumption after the accident. He has said that he had a drink the night before the accident but was not impaired when he was handling the boat.Jean Siler, one of the survivors, welcomed the charges.“I’m just glad that somebody is going to be held responsible,” she said. Ms. Siler, of Trenton, Mich., is a plaintiff in a civil lawsuit against Shoreline; her left arm was broken in the accident, along with two bones in her back and one of her ribs.“It’s a misdemeanor,” she said of the charge. “What’s to be accomplished by making it worse? None of those dead people are coming back. You can push for all kinds of penalties, it changes absolutely nothing.”Mr. Paris declined to comment, as did a lawyer representing both Mr. Paris and Shoreline Cruises. Both the captain and the boat operator will be arraigned on Feb. 14.The 38-foot Ethan Allen capsized on Oct. 2, 2005, leading to the deaths of 20 of the 47 tourists on board, most of them elderly residents of Ohio and Michigan.The boat was put into service in 1966 and authorized to carry 48 passengers and two crew members, but a report last year from the National Transportation Safety Board found that modifications made to the boat in 1989 — specifically a new wooden canopy with plexiglass windows that replaced a canvas canopy — had altered its center of gravity.The report said the boat should not have been carrying more than 14 passengers. At the time of the accident, the boat was carrying 48 people, including Mr. Paris, then 74, who was the only crew member.The report suggested that tougher state standards might have prevented the accident. The boat was tested under the 1960s-era standards, which assumed an average passenger weight of 140 pounds. Immediately after the Ethan Allen capsized, Gov. George E. Pataki changed state regulations to assume an average passenger weight of 174 pounds.The safety board also said that most of the passengers were on one side of the boat during the accident, which occurred after the boat encountered waves from one or more other vessels on the lake.One year ago, the county sheriff declined to press charges after an investigation by his office and referred the matter to Ms. Hogan’s office.“Am I frustrated?” Ms. Hogan said, “I think there are a lot of preventative actions that could have been done on the part of the State of New York, and those actions really hampered the safety of these passengers.”Lincoln Cathers, a retired naval engineer who testified before the grand jury, said that if the boat had been retested, “this would not have happened,” and added that “the boat was grossly overloaded.”'"
"'07-02-06,'1','Geoff Freeman, the executive director of the partnership, said that just 2 percent of survey respondents ranked Canada as the worst. “I find that especially telling,” he said. “You have two countries right next to each other, very culturally similar, both threatened by terrorism, and one appears to be finding a way to strike a balance between security and entry that is far more appealing to world travelers.”“We talk about security,” he said, “but if people can’t come here for meetings or to look at U.S. products they want to buy, and so choose to do business with another country instead, that’s a threat to America’s economic security.”United States government officials, however, insist that the process has improved greatly in recent years. Changes added after Sept. 11, 2001 “came so quickly that we weren’t as efficient as we wanted to be,” said Maura Harty, assistant secretary for consular affairs in the State Department. “But we now have an expedited service for business travel visas in place in every U.S. consulate and embassy in the world.”Ms. Harty said that only 29 percent of the respondents in the Discover America Partnership survey had applied for a visa in the last 18 months. “I urge people who haven’t applied for a visa in a few years to come back,” she said. “Try us, you’ll like us.”But Gary Shapiro, president and chief executive of the Consumer Electronics Association, disagreed. He said the Consumer Electronics Show, which his organization put on last month in Las Vegas, had 24,000 attendees from overseas (out of a total of 140,000), “but we probably would have gotten 40,000 if the visa process were not so challenging.” For example, he said, 40 people came from China, “but they told me an additional 10, including the most senior-ranking person, were denied visas.”Mr. Shapiro — who said he lobbied the government on this issue “all the time” — added that his foreign attendees described the visa application process as “demeaning.”“Imagine if, before you traveled somewhere, you had to fly to another city to get permission to get a document, wait in line for hours, bring a financial statement of your net worth and everything you own, pay $100, wait a month, and then get a yes or no, with no explanation why,” he said. “Our visa policies are discouraging international business in the United States and giving other countries a competitive advantage over us.”There is some evidence that such restrictions are discouraging business travel. In November, Euromonitor International, a London-based market research firm, found that the number of business arrivals in the United States fell 10 percent from 2004 to 2005, while the number of such arrivals in Europe grew 8 percent over the same period.But last month, the Association of Corporate Travel Executives, in Alexandria, Va., conducted an informal survey of its non-American members who travel to the United States frequently on business. The survey found that while many complained of American travel policies, especially the difficulty in obtaining visas, they would continue to come to the United States.“Our members were emphatic that whatever inconvenience they’ve experienced lately, they’re still coming to the U.S.,” said Jack Riepe, an association spokesman.'"
"'07-02-06,'1','The Chevron Corporation announced yesterday that it would separate the positions of chief executive and board chairman and make it easier for shareholders to remove directors.The chairman will now be elected annually by the board, the company, based in San Ramon, Calif., said in a public filing. Previously, the oil producer’s chief executive automatically occupied the role of chairman.David J. O’Reilly, 60, has held both positions since January 2000. During his tenure, Chevron stock delivered annual average returns of 11 percent, assuming reinvestment of dividends. The decision to split the top jobs was approved by the 13-member board at a Jan. 31 meeting, the filing said.Chevron’s board also changed voting rules so that directors in uncontested elections require more “yes” than “no” votes, excluding abstentions, to retain their seats. Under the old plurality system, investors’ choices were limited to voting “yes” or withholding their votes.Chevron said last week that fourth-quarter profit fell 9 percent, to $3.77 billion, after energy prices and production declined. The drop ended a streak of profit gains that began in July 2005.Mr. O’Reilly missed his own 2006 production forecast and told investors output would decline this year because of contract changes in Venezuela and construction delays in central Asia.The vice chairman, Peter J. Robertson, 60, was promoted to the new position of office of the chairman in December 2004, a move that investors like Timothy M. Ghriskey of Solaris Investment Management said made Mr. Robertson the heir apparent to Mr. O’Reilly.'"
"'07-02-06,'1','A national poison control database suggests that some diet supplements may pose risks to consumers, raising questions about a 1994 federal law stating that “safety problems with the supplements are relatively rare.” But an essay in Science Times on Jan. 16 about those risks overstated the number of adverse reactions to supplements reported in the database.The essay said the database, issued by the American Association of Poison Control Centers, reported 125,595 incidents of poisonings in 2005 related to vitamins, minerals, essential oils, herbs and other supplements, and a total of 1.6 million such incidents from 1983 to 2005. In fact, the figures refer to reports of exposures to those substances.The poison control association defines “exposures” as calls to poison centers from the public or health professionals reporting “actual or potential exposure to a substance (e.g., an ingestion, inhalation or topical exposure).” In an e-mail message, Dr. Susan Smolinske, a spokeswoman for the association, said that “some exposures to diet supplements result in unknown or benign outcomes, rather than adverse outcomes.” She cited an August 2005 report in the journal Clinical Toxicology suggesting that about 10 percent of exposures result in “moderate to major” medical outcomes.The database has no category for poisoning incidents, so that number is not known. While it does have a column headed “adverse reactions,” that category refers only to reports of reactions “occurring with normal, prescribed, labeled or recommended use of the product,” leaving out overdoses and cases where the dose was unknown.The number given for “adverse reactions” is lower than the number of people treated in health care facilities after exposure to a substance. It is also generally lower than the number of medical outcomes ranging from minor to fatal that were associated with the substance.'"
"'07-02-06,'1','Flamenco was hybrid from the start: Gitano, Sephardic Jewish, Moorish, Andalusian Christian. But from its origins until the 1970s, it became an elegantly closed-in form of music; from there it could only reconstitute itself into a new hybrid.The singer Estrella Morente represents both where flamenco comes from and where it’s going. The daughter of the remarkable cantaor Enrique Morente — himself an innovator, when he wants to be — she has grown up inside its tradition; at Town Hall on Saturday night, she performed in an ensemble that included one uncle (José Carbonell) on guitar, and another (Antonio Carbonell) accompanying her with palmas, or handclapping.She is justifiably a success in Spain — her recent record, “Mujeres” (EMI), makes her case, with plenty of tradition but also some innovations in arrangement and production. But she had never performed in the United States before Saturday, when the World Music Institute and the annual Flamenco Festival brought her to New York. Flamenco singing is a difficult art. But diversifying it as much as she wants to might be even harder.Ms. Morente doesn’t sing like her father, who loads up his phrases with anguished cracks and scoured, guttural yells. Her voice is round and unblemished, closer to Celine Dion’s. But she can still work flamenco singing’s trademarks, its microtonal rips and aggravated melisma; she paces herself, using them only at key moments, at a single peak moment or in the final passages of a song.Saturday’s show had no intermission, but fell into two obvious parts. Ms. Morente charged onstage in a black suit with a jacket and a traditional black falda skirt; imperiously, she ratcheted herself into a chair. From there until midconcert, her deliberate physical movements became inseparable from her singing.In “Tangos de Graná,” she tensed and sobbed the words at the apex, then turned to José Carbonell and listened closely, resting her right hand on her left knee; she finished with the traditional winding wrist movements of flamenco dance, splaying her outstretched fingers over her head like antlers.'"
"'07-02-06,'1','“We love the Beatles, and it has been painful being at odds with them over these trademarks,” said Steven P. Jobs, chief executive of Apple Inc., who is widely known as a huge fan of the Beatles’ music. The companies declined to provide further details of the settlement.The new agreement replaces one signed by the companies in 1991, when Apple Corps, which represents Paul McCartney; Ringo Starr; the estate of George Harrison; and Yoko Ono, the widow of John Lennon, moved to ensure that the computer company did not use the apple logo in the music business. The Apple Corps logo is a Granny Smith apple. The logo for Apple Inc. is an apple with a bite taken out of it.But things changed in 2003 when Apple Computer, as it was known until it dropped “Computer” from its name last month, began signing deals with record labels to distribute music online through iTunes.Apple Computer had approached the British company in hopes of distributing the Beatles’ music on iTunes, but Apple Corps instead accused the technology company of breaching the 1991 contract, arguing that Apple was essentially entering the music business with its service.Last May, a judge in London ruled in favor of Apple Computer, agreeing that the company’s use of the logo was fair and reasonable. Apple Corps’s appeal of that ruling was scheduled for this month.“It is great to put this dispute behind us and move on,” Neil Aspinall, manager of Apple Corps, said in a statement. “The years ahead are going to be very exciting times for us.”The Beatles are considered the last major holdout from online downloading services like iTunes. Today, Beatles fans can play Beatles music on an iPod only by transferring the songs from a CD.But the latest settlement does nothing to resolve that issue, and Mr. Jobs said nothing about it yesterday. Speculation about a deal to sell Beatles songs on iTunes reached fever pitch on fan Web sites and blogs after Mr. Jobs appeared to give the band a highly public nod last month. In introducing the Apple iPhone, he demonstrated the device’s music-playing capabilities by displaying Beatles album covers and playing the song “Lovely Rita” for the audience.Elizabeth Freund, a spokeswoman for Apple Corps, said the settlement had no bearing on any move to make Beatles music available on iTunes, saying that was a separate matter for the Beatles to discuss with EMI, which holds the rights to the Beatles’ recordings.A spokeswoman at EMI, where digital sales of Beatles songs could be a lucrative source of income, declined to comment on whether or when that might happen.The iTunes service is by far the largest legal music downloading site, having sold more than two billion music downloads accounting for more than 70 percent of the market, according to the NPD Group, a market research company.With the Beatles dispute behind it, Apple Inc. faces still another trademark battle: a lawsuit filed by Cisco Systems, the networking company, over the use of the iPhone brand. Cisco has said the two companies have been unable to reach an agreement over the name after several years of discussion.Mark Chandler, Cisco’s general counsel, said at the time the suit was filed in January that Cisco would have been willing to share the trademark if Apple had agreed to its terms. These included an agreement by Apple to differentiate its coming iPhone product — a combination iPod and cellphone — from Cisco’s iPhone, a business phone that uses the Internet to transmit calls.Apple Inc. recommended yesterday that users hold off upgrading their computers to Microsoft’s new operating system, Windows Vista, because of compatibility problems with Apple’s iTunes music software.Users should wait to upgrade to Vista until a new version of iTunes becomes available in the next few weeks, said Derick Mains, a spokesman for Apple.'"
"'07-02-06,'1','State Street Corporation said yesterday that it would buy Investors Financial Services Corporation in a $4.5 billion stock deal that highlights the accelerating pace of consolidation in the securities processing business.The deal has been approved by the boards of the two rivals, both based in Boston. Two months ago, the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial of Pittsburgh agreed to a $16.5 billion merger that would create the largest custodian in the financial services industry.Banks like State Street operate in a little-noticed corner of the financial world. They specialize in back-office financial tasks, using sophisticated technology to keep track of the securities positions of large investors like pension funds, hedge funds and charitable endowments.State Street said it would track more than $14 trillion in assets once the transaction was closed. The newly formed Bank of New York Mellon Corporation will monitor more than $16.6 trillion.State Street is offering 0.906 shares of its stock for each share of Investors Financial Services common stock, based on last Friday’s closing share price. That places the value of the deal at just less than $4.5 billion. It is also a 38 percent premium over the closing price of Investors Financial stock on Friday.'"
"'07-02-06,'1','Marc Graboff, who is now president of NBC Universal Television West Coast, will be given added supervisory duties over NBC’s entertainment division in California. Beth Comstock, who is president of NBC’s digital and marketing division, and Jeff Gaspin, who heads up the company’s cable operations, will also take on new responsibilities.Another important NBC West Coast executive, Kevin Reilly, is in talks to extend his contract as president of NBC’s entertainment division.The most urgent questions facing Mr. Zucker relate to the digital revolution now roiling the media marketplace.Bill Simon, senior client partner for the global entertainment division of Korn/Ferry International, an executive search firm, said the arrival of digital outlets for television programs had made what was formerly a simple equation for NBC much harder.“It comes down to this,” Mr. Simon said. “He has to figure out how to grab an audience, how to hold an audience and how to monetize an audience.”All three jobs will be harder with the advent of Internet sites like YouTube that offer television programming, including shows from NBC, with little financial gain for the networks.Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst at Prudential Securities who follows General Electric, NBC’s parent company, said that Mr. Zucker’s task is threefold: he has to continue to create successful programming while also cutting costs in the TV business and elsewhere.At the same time, Mr. Zucker is charged with trying to figure out what the next disruptive digital media outlet like YouTube will be, and how the company can capitalize on it.Given the complexity of the task, Mr. Heymann said it made sense for Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chairman of G.E., to select as Mr. Wright’s successor someone who was brought up in the G.E. management ranks. Mr. Zucker has some blemishes on his track record — NBC’s slide in prime time among them — but he has shown recent success.Compared with hiring an executive from the outside, Mr. Heymann described Mr. Zucker’s hiring as having “the potential to be the lowest-risk alternative with the most potential for upside and success.”In the near term, Mr. Heymann said, G.E.’s challenge is to return NBC Universal’s earnings to the peak levels they achieved in 2003.The media company recently reported an increase in earnings for the quarter ended Dec. 31 to $841 million, from $801 million the previous year. It was the first year-over-year profit increase for NBC Universal in five quarters.The challenges facing Mr. Zucker have little to do with the current state of NBC, which, some detractors notwithstanding, is mainly solid across almost all of its divisions.Under Mr. Wright, the company has expanded with great success in recent years, adding the Universal movie studio and highly profitable cable channels like USA and Bravo. Until the last couple of years, NBC under Mr. Wright was among the most profitable divisions of G.E.NBC has been the network leader in news and late-night programs, but trails the other networks in prime time.One of the downturns for the company occurred on Mr. Zucker’s watch when he ran the network’s entertainment division in California. NBC fell from first place to last in prime time in 2004, just after Mr. Zucker finished his run as president of NBC Entertainment.Some of collapse of the network’s prime-time fortunes had to do with NBC’s long-term failure to develop new programs. Mr. Zucker was credited with maintaining NBC’s success much longer than might have been expected, given the dearth of hits, because of his ability to manage NBC’s remaining assets, like the comedy “Friends.”Twice he managed to keep that show on the air (in high-cost negotiations) when it was expected to finish production.But competitors in Hollywood — and some critics in the press — have pointed to those struggles and asked why Mr. Zucker was not held more responsible for them. Mr. Zucker mainly put his head down, focused on NBC’s more successful cable channels and tried to change the momentum at the network.Now, thanks to new hits like “The Office” and “Heroes,” NBC’s prime-time lineup has begun to show some improvement.Longer term, NBC will have to show that it can continue to create hit entertainment content, its chief source of profit. Recent signs have been favorable in that area, according to some of NBC’s most prominent producers, and Mr. Zucker’s relationship with the Hollywood community, once thought to be strained, has been shored up.Dick Wolf, who has been NBC Universal’s most important producer for a generation because of his “Law & Order” dramas, said in a telephone interview, “I think Jeff will get a very strong endorsement from the community.”He said misperceptions of NBC had been rife in recent years. “You would think from reading some accounts that this was a company literally going down the tubes,” Mr. Wolf said. “For a company going out of business, it seems to me NBC is generating a lot of cash.”He said he favored the selection of Mr. Zucker not just because of their friendship but also because “he’s just a really smart guy, and people know I like really smart guys.”That view was echoed by Ben Silverman, who has become one of NBC’s biggest suppliers of programs, with shows like “The Office” and “The Biggest Loser.” Yesterday NBC announced it had signed a new deal with Mr. Silverman that will give the company first access to all the programs his company develops.Mr. Silverman noted that Mr. Zucker took pains to make sure the deal was announced as his personal decision, to underscore his Hollywood credentials.“The guy makes decisions,” Mr. Silverman said. “Sometimes that ruffles feathers in an industry that likes to be coddled, but as a producer I like that kind of transparency.”'"
"'07-02-06,'1','Alcoholics are not the only people with a drinking problem, a new study says.Most people at risk for any number of alcohol-related problems may not even qualify for a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, the researchers suggest in the February issue of Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.“Even though alcohol dependence is an important issue, in fact other forms of excessive drinking, especially binge drinking, are more prevalent,” said one of the authors, Jim Roeber, a New Mexico Department of Health epidemiologist.The researchers, led by Sandra Woerle of the National Institute of Justice, surveyed more than 4,700 residents of New Mexico. Respondents were asked about how often they drank, how much they drank and whether they had ever driven while impaired.While only 1.8 percent of those surveyed appeared to have an alcohol dependence problem, the study found, more than 16 percent took part in at least one kind of excessive drinking. Most of those were binge drinkers.By some estimates, heavy drinking leads to 75,000 deaths a year in the United States. It plays a role in a variety of health problems, as well as accidents and violence.The results of the study raise questions about the best way to reduce the public health problems associated with alcohol abuse.People with alcohol dependencies are usually treated individually. But if most of the threat comes from people who are not dependent, the study said, it may be more effective to focus on deterrents like increasing alcohol taxes, raising the drinking age and training waiters and bartenders.'"
"'07-02-06,'1','But problems with wet cameras should not have prevented CBS from providing a couple of looks at weather radar (can a Doppler system co-exist with a Telestrator?) or forecasts of when the rain might end. If Katie Couric could narrate a story during the Super Bowl pregame program, Dave Price, the weather anchor of CBS’s “The Early Show,” could have been in Miami.And CBS’s sideline reporters, Solomon Wilcots and Steve Tasker, should also have shown the cleats the players wore on the wet, well-drained field.I also wondered about the absence of mud on the field. How could so much rain produce no mud? And wouldn’t mud have made it a warmer, more interesting throwback of an event? CBS’s Sam Ryan reported shortly after 2 p.m. Eastern time during the four-hour pregame program about the sand-based field, which required moisture and was not covered the night before.But viewers who tuned in anytime after that would have been unaware of the drainage system, which can pump away 100,000 gallons of water an hour and make the field as playable as it was. Ed Mangan, the N.F.L.’s field director, said the Bermuda grass grew in sand and was laid over 12 inches of sand.“Sand needs to be damp,” he said by telephone. “Take dry sand and wet sand in your hand, and you can tell which one is more stable.” On Saturday, the field was irrigated with more water than all that fell during the game.“It has to rain real hard to create standing water on the field,” Mangan said.Hence, a mudless game in a driving rain. Harvey Greene, a spokesman for the Dolphins, said that the only mud woes at the stadium had occurred when the Marlins’ dirt infield became wet.The rain obviously altered the game, although CBS analysts, from the pregame on, played down the notion that the rain would be a problem. Simms and Nantz referred to dreadful, slippery conditions, but the strongest statements came from Simms in watered-down ways like “the rain is absolutely having a little effect on the throws as you watch them go through the air” and “there must be a little moisture hurting Grossman’s spirals.”Simms should have offered his passing-in-the-rain expertise. If he didn’t volunteer it, Nantz should have asked. With Bears quarterback Rex Grossman mishandling snaps and stumbling into easy sacks, a Simms master class in passing in foul weather would have been welcome.NEAR-RECORD VIEWERSHIP The game attracted an average of 93.15 million viewers, the most since the peak of 94.1 million for Dallas’s victory against Pittsburgh in 1996. The electrifying halftime performance by Prince generated a 41.8 rating, a drop of 3 percent from the 43.2 in the previous half hour during the second quarter. The peak halftime performer was Michael Jackson, whose 1993 show generated the second-highest-rated half hour of NBC’s Super Bowl broadcast, which is considered sensational.The Super Bowl first broke the 90-million-viewer barrier in 1986, but the most significant year was 1978, when Dallas’s victory against Denver attracted 78.9 million viewers, up 16.9 million from the year before, which represented a 27 percent leap, the largest in the game’s history.'"

"'07-02-07,'1','It’s strangely fitting that Woody Allen’s “Annie Hall,” a thoroughly postmodern romantic comedy, would inspire an entire movie about a young man obsessed with “Annie Hall.” Titled “Burning Annie,” the film is a soup-to-nuts homage that makes references not just to the original’s story, characters and tone, but also to specific jokes and shots, including a straight-into-the-camera narration.This no-budget indie, by the filmmaking team of Zack Ordynans, Randy Mack and Van Flesher, stars the “Donnie Darko” actor Gary Lundy as Max (the nickname of Mr. Allen’s “Annie Hall” character), a college student and fledgling D.J. Max’s lifelong obsession with Mr. Allen’s movie dominates his life, defines his personality and sense of humor, and stunts his ability to deal with women (particularly an Annie-like character played by Sara Downing of the television series “Roswell”).It all sounds precious, but somehow it doesn’t play that way. “Burning Annie” is a thoroughly professional comedy, well paced, attractively photographed and smartly acted.Unfortunately, it also has no life of its own, apart from its fascination with Mr. Allen’s film, an odd turn of events considering what a profound influence “Annie Hall” has had on the last three decades of independent cinema. Sometimes the best way to honor an inspiration is to do something completely different.Directed by Van Flesher; written by Zack Ordynans; director of photography, Stephan Schultze; edited by Randy Mack, Jeff Orgill and Chryss Terry; music by Dean Harada; production designers, Kenn Coplan and Jennifer Copp; produced by Mr. Mack; released by Armak Productions.

"'07-02-07,'1','The choice of top commanders, drawn from the army and the police, has largely been settled, the officials said, but was slowed by sectarian disagreements, with Shiites objecting to Sunnis and Sunnis objecting to Shiites.Integrating the Iraqi police force with the army, essential to the plan, remains a problem, officers say. Some Sunni neighborhoods remain off limits to the police, because they are thought to be deeply infiltrated by Shiite militias and are widely distrusted by Sunni residents.The stepped up pace of the violence against Shiites since the plan was announced, which American and Iraqi officials say is part of a strategy by Sunni insurgents to undermine the government, has further convinced many Shiites that the Iraqi security forces are hapless.Mr. Maliki told his commanders that they needed to be aggressive and to deploy their troops in force soon to combat that impression, and he promised that unspecified elements of the crackdown would start within days.“We should not be late, because any more delay would raise suspicions about the military and police forces,” he said.Mr. Maliki has sought to put an Iraqi face on the new plan, but people whose lives have been torn apart by the bloodshed here have also blamed the Americans for failing to provide security. American officials have defended the pace of the operation, emphasizing that it involves a rolling buildup of forces that will take time.On Tuesday, few signs indicated that anything had changed on the streets of Baghdad, aside from some new checkpoints scattered around the city. An aggressive clearing operation began Tuesday night in a Sunni neighborhood in eastern Baghdad. Iraqi officials said it was part of the new crackdown, but similar operations have been under way for weeks.American military officials said one large event to signal the start of the crackdown was unlikely.The violence continued Tuesday, though perhaps more slowly than in the past few days. An employee in the prime minister’s office who was working on antiterrorism issues was killed, a police official said.Three car bombs killed at least six people and wounded 17 more, gunmen killed two police officers, and 11 people were kidnapped from a house in the Sadr City section of Baghdad overnight.Mr. Maliki’s aides said that while they were frustrated by the delay, trying to rush the security plan into action before the forces were ready would only compound the problems.“It could be like an abortion for this operation,” said Sadiq al-Rikabi, a political adviser to the prime minister. “Finishing it before it starts.”American officers said the new plan, under which an additional 17,000 American forces are to be deployed in Baghdad, would not necessarily have an official start. They said it would be more accurate to describe the effort as a broader strategy shift that would put American troops in Baghdad neighborhoods in more aggressive ways, living and working with Iraqi troops.The Americans are arriving in staggered intervals over months, and troops on the ground are beginning to carry out the new strategy, the officers said. In western Baghdad, American forces are living with Iraqi soldiers at new Joint Security Stations in two neighborhoods. More stations are under construction.From the beginning, American officers have cautioned that the new plan would take time, because any chance of success rests on building trust with a population whose faith has been severely tested by nearly a year of vicious sectarian violence. But they know that time is not on their side.“There have to be some early successes to establish momentum,” said one battlefield commander, who like the others spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not designated to talk with reporters.Despite the setbacks, the shape of the Iraqi side of the plan is coming into focus.Last month, Mr. Maliki appointed Lt. Gen. Aboud Qanbar as the overall Iraqi commander for forces in Baghdad. General Qanbar, who had worked in the prime minister’s office for six months on security issues, was not Mr. Maliki’s first choice; that one was rejected by the Americans as too sectarian. But Mr. Maliki, in turn, rejected the candidate proposed by the Americans, leading to a bitter row that ultimately ended with the Americans accepting General Qanbar, who was largely unknown to them.But one of General Qanbar’s chief selling points to Iraqi officials was precisely his relative obscurity since the American invasion in 2003. “There are many officers who could do the job better, but appointing them would have caused an uproar among the Sunnis,” an Iraqi officer said.Under the new plan, two other commanders will report directly to General Qanbar, one responsible for eastern Baghdad and the other responsible for western Baghdad. The Iraqis and the Americans have agreed on those appointments.The plan also calls for Baghdad to be divided into nine security districts, each with a commander. Those choices were completed recently, Iraqi officials said.'"

With each purchase or rental, they will have the option to send a digital copy of the movie or show to their TiVos, in addition to downloading it to their PC.There is no additional charge for the service, which is called Amazon Unbox on TiVo. The service will not work for satellite or cable TV subscribers whose set-top boxes run TiVo software.Executives at Amazon and TiVo said bypassing the PC would open the digital download market to a more mainstream audience.“Certainly there is a phenomenon of people watching short video clips on sites like YouTube,” said TiVo’s chief executive, Thomas S. Rogers. “But our research clearly shows that when it comes to full-length movies and television shows, for the real experience, it needs to be on the TV set.”Bill Carr, vice president for digital media at Amazon, said that the service would also provide a better experience than the video-on-demand stores offered by cable companies, mostly because its selection is greater and the Internet allows for easier browsing.“As we know, a lot of people spend their time shopping and browsing for content they love on their PC, and the cable services don’t allow you to do that,” Mr. Carr said.Amazon Unbox, which was introduced last September, received poor early reviews for its clunky software and slow downloads. Amazon says the average movie should take about an hour to download on a fast broadband connection, but users have reported longer waits.Videos rented from the site must be watched within 30 days, and once a video starts playing it must be watched within 24 hours.Most of the media companies that sell or rent TV shows and movies through Amazon Unbox, including CBS, Fox, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Warner Brothers, will make them available to TiVo users. Others, including Sony, are not yet signed up but Mr. Rogers said he expected them to come aboard shortly.'"

"'07-02-07,'1','WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 — Hollywood has often been a whipping boy here, but with a new Congress in session, the heads of the major movie studios converged on the capital Tuesday to pitch their industry in the unaccustomed role of good guy: boon to the trade balance, engine of economic growth, polisher of the nation’s image and employer of a big, uncelebrated, middle-class work force.Cheered by the Democratic takeover, the industry’s leadership hopes to press its agenda of fighting piracy, obtaining new tax advantages and reining in movie and television production from going abroad.So the Motion Picture Association of America put on a daylong show for lawmakers, lobbyists and Capitol Hill aides, armed with some A-list talent — the actor Will Smith gave a morning speech, and Clint Eastwood received an award at dinner — and a new study showing that film and TV production accounts for $30 billion in wages, $10 billion in taxes, more than 400,000 jobs and a trade surplus of $9.5 billion.“When people read about us, they read about celebrity and glitz,” said Dan Glickman, the trade association’s chairman, who said he learned much about other industries from such programs while he was a congressman. “That’s an asset we have, but that’s not enough.”Judging from a few panel discussions, the M.P.A.A. had calculated that it would be hard to drum up sympathy for an industry symbolized by its highly paid stars and largely made up of giant conglomerates. So, atop the talking points, apparently, was the idea that the movie business is really made up of middle-class guild and union members who often live hand to mouth.“It’s not just me and Tom,” said Mr. Smith, referring to Tom Cruise, one of his peers who can command $20 million a picture. He said his latest film, “I Am Legend,” was employing 1,000 local crew members and actors on location in New York.'"
"'07-02-07,'1','The chief executive of Apple Inc., Steven P. Jobs, is calling on the four largest music companies to license their music for distribution without digital anti-piracy protection, shifting away from a nearly four-year-old philosophy that helped steer the iPod music player to worldwide success.Mr. Jobs’s appeal, expressed Tuesday in a letter posted on Apple’s Web site, arrives as the company, whose iPod dominates MP3 player sales, faces a slew of lawsuits in Europe over so-called digital rights management. France, Sweden and Germany are among the countries that have accused Apple of hurting customers by locking rival players out of its iTunes service.It is a striking move for Mr. Jobs and for Apple, whose resurgence as a dominant technology company was built on the success of the iPod and iTunes. Introduced in 2003 as the iTunes Music Store, the service charges users 99 cents to download songs from the major labels. Its promise of copyright protection, called FairPlay, helped persuade the four major labels — the EMI Group, Universal, Sony BMG and the Warner Music Group — to allow online sales.Consumers took to the system in droves, letting Apple capture nearly 75 percent of the portable music player market.For the first quarter, Apple reported $1 billion in profit, stemming largely from sales of 21 million iPods. Customers have downloaded more than two billion songs from the iTunes store.'"
"'07-02-07,'1','The most urgent questions facing Mr. Zucker relate to the digital revolution now roiling the media marketplace.Bill Simon, senior client partner for the global entertainment division of Korn/Ferry International, an executive search firm, said the arrival of digital outlets for television programs had made what was formerly a simple equation for NBC much harder.“It comes down to this,” Mr. Simon said. “He has to figure out how to grab an audience, how to hold an audience and how to monetize an audience.”All three jobs will be harder with the advent of Internet sites like YouTube that offer television programming, including shows from NBC, with little financial gain for the networks.Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst at Prudential Securities who follows General Electric, NBC’s parent company, said that Mr. Zucker’s task is threefold: he has to continue to create successful programming while also cutting costs in the TV business and elsewhere.At the same time, Mr. Zucker is charged with trying to figure out what the next disruptive digital media outlet like YouTube will be, and how the company can capitalize on it.Given the complexity of the task, Mr. Heymann said it made sense for Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chairman of G.E., to select as Mr. Wright’s successor someone who was brought up in the G.E. management ranks. (Mr. Wright will stay on as a General Electric vice chairman and assist with the transition.) Mr. Zucker has some blemishes on his track record -- NBC’s slide in prime time among them -- but he has shown recent success.Compared with hiring an executive from the outside, Mr. Heymann described Mr. Zucker’s hiring as having “the potential to be the lowest-risk alternative with the most potential for upside and success.”In the near term, Mr. Heymann said, G.E.’s challenge is to return NBC Universal’s earnings to the peak levels they achieved in 2003.The media company recently reported an increase in earnings for the quarter ended Dec. 31 to $841 million, from $801 million the previous year. It was the first year-over-year profit increase for NBC Universal in five quarters.The challenges facing Mr. Zucker have little to do with the current state of NBC, which, some detractors notwithstanding, is mainly solid across almost all of its divisions.Under Mr. Wright, the company has expanded with great success in recent years, adding the Universal movie studio and highly profitable cable channels like USA and Bravo. Until the last couple of years, NBC under Mr. Wright was among the most profitable divisions of G.E.NBC has been the network leader in news and late-night programs, but trails the other networks in prime time.One of the downturns for the company occurred on Mr. Zucker’s watch when he ran the network’s entertainment division in California. NBC fell from first place to last in prime time in 2004, just after Mr. Zucker finished his run as president of NBC Entertainment.Some of collapse of the network’s prime-time fortunes had to do with NBC’s long-term failure to develop new programs. Mr. Zucker was credited with maintaining NBC’s success much longer than might have been expected, given the dearth of hits, because of his ability to manage NBC’s remaining assets, like the comedy “Friends.”Twice he managed to keep that show on the air (in high-cost negotiations) when it was expected to finish production.But competitors in Hollywood -- and some critics in the press -- have pointed to those struggles and asked why Mr. Zucker was not held more responsible for them. Mr. Zucker mainly put his head down, focused on NBC’s more successful cable channels and tried to change the momentum at the network.Now, thanks to new hits like “The Office” and “Heroes,” NBC’s prime-time lineup has begun to show some improvement.Longer term, NBC will have to show that it can continue to create hit entertainment content, its chief source of profit. Recent signs have been favorable in that area, according to some of NBC’s most prominent producers, and Mr. Zucker’s relationship with the Hollywood community, once thought to be strained, has been shored up.Dick Wolf, who has been NBC Universal’s most important producer for a generation because of his “Law & Order” dramas, said in a telephone interview, “I think Jeff will get a very strong endorsement from the community.”He said misperceptions of NBC had been rife in recent years. “You would think from reading some accounts that this was a company literally going down the tubes,” Mr. Wolf said. “For a company going out of business, it seems to me NBC is generating a lot of cash.”He said he favored the selection of Mr. Zucker not just because of their friendship but also because “he’s just a really smart guy, and people know I like really smart guys.”That view was echoed by Ben Silverman, who has become one of NBC’s biggest suppliers of programs, with shows like “The Office” and “The Biggest Loser.” Yesterday NBC announced it had signed a new deal with Mr. Silverman that will give the company first access to all the programs his company develops.Mr. Silverman noted that Mr. Zucker took pains to make sure the deal was announced as his personal decision, to underscore his Hollywood credentials.“The guy makes decisions,” Mr. Silverman said. “Sometimes that ruffles feathers in an industry that likes to be coddled, but as a producer I like that kind of transparency.”'"

"'07-02-08,'0','The proposed machine, physicists say, is needed to complement to the Large Hadron Collider now under construction at the European Center for Nuclear Research, CERN, outside Geneva. That machine will be the world’s most powerful when it goes into operation this fall, eventually colliding beams of protons with 7 trillion electron volts of energy apiece. Physicists hope that using it they will detect a long-sought particle known as the Higgs boson, which is thought to endow all the other constituents of nature with mass. They hope, too, to discover new laws and forms of matter and even perhaps new dimensions of spacetime.But protons are bags of smaller particles called quarks and gluons, and their collisions tend to be messy and wasteful. Because electrons and positrons have no innards, their collisions are cleaner, so they can be used to create and study with precision whatever new particles are found at Cern.The hitch is that until the hadron collider proves its worth by actually finding something new, the governments of the world are unlikely to sign on to contribute a share of the billions.Particle accelerators derive their punch from Einstein’s equation of mass and energy. The more energy they can pack into their little fireballs, the farther back in time they can go, closer and closer to the Big Bang and perhaps ultimate truth about nature, allowing particles and laws that once ruled the cosmos, but have since vanished more completely than the dinosaurs, to briefly strut their stuff again. But as physicists have pushed inward and backward, their machines have gotten bigger and more expensive. Competitions between universities and laboratories turned into races between countries and then continents.The Large Hadron Collider cost about 4.7 billion Swiss Francs, or 3 billion Euros, according to CERN. But that does not include the cost of digging the collider’s 18-mile-circumference tunnel, which had been used for a previous machine, the detectors, which cost upwards of $1 billion, nor most of the above-ground CERN complex, which has been a world center of particle physics for decades.A competitive proton collider that would have been even bigger, the Superconducting SuperCollider, was canceled by Congress in 1993. At the time its estimated cost had ballooned to $10.3 billion in 2007 dollars, according to Robin Staffin, associate director for high energy physics at the Department of Energy.The International Linear Collider collaboration, led by a steering group chaired by Shin-ichi Kurokawa, of Japan’s High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, or KEK, consists of 1,000 scientists and engineers from 100 countries.Physicists acknowledge it could be years before the world commits to building the ILC, although jockeying for the costly privilege of hosting the giant machine has already begun. For their purposes, the committee priced three different sites: near CERN in Switzerland, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., and in the mountains of Japan and found that the cost of so-called site-specific costs, like digging tunnels and shafts and supplying water and electricity, were nearly the same in each case, about $1.8 billion.The host country would be expected to shoulder these costs, the design collaboration said, while the remaining $4.9 billion, which covers high-tech things like magnets and control rooms, would be split among all the participants. Extras like auditoriums, cafeterias and living space for scientists were not included in the cost estimate, since at some places like Fermilab they already exist. The cost estimate released today also does not include the linear collider’s detectors.One unusual twist to the design, said Dr. Barish, is that the tunnels, rather than being laser straight through the ground, would curve with the Earth. “It isn’t obvious and it took us a while to demonstrate that we could actually design a machine that bends” he said, but that feature would allow the digging to stay within the same geologic layers and prevent liquid cryogenics from wanting to flow “downhill” from one part of the tunnel to another.'"

He said he hoped to raise about $6,000 at last night’s event, which was the second so far.As he took questions, however, he said, “these events raise not as much money but awareness” of the problems surrounding the drug-testing of athletes.Landis plans to hold more fund-raisers around the country. In the meantime, his lawyers are preparing for two hearings, one involving the United States Anti-Doping Agency, the other involving France’s anti-doping agency. One of Landis’s lawyers will ask the French agency today if the case against Landis could be postponed until the conclusion of the hearing in the United States, Henson said.Still, the agency could proceed with the hearing in front of a nine-member panel, even without Landis being present. If he is found guilty, the penalty could be a one- or two-year ban.In the United States, Landis and his lawyers — and USADA and its lawyers — will present their cases in front of a three-person arbitration panel on May 14. Either party could appeal the result to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and that decision would be final.If Landis loses his appeal, he would become the first Tour champion to be stripped of his title because of doping.Landis had hip surgery four and a half months ago and said he felt fine, but he also said he did not think he would be able to get himself into shape to compete in this summer’s Tour de France.'"
"'07-02-08,'0','A couple arrested on narcotics and weapons charges were accused of trying to hire a hit man to kill the superintendent of their apartment building, the police said yesterday. They said that the husband, who was in jail, wrongly suspected the superintendent of giving detectives information that led to a search of their home. The couple, Francisco Diaz, 38, and Maria Diaz, 34, of 657 West 161st Street, were charged with conspiracy to commit murder, said Inspector Kenneth M. Cully, the commanding officer of the Manhattan North narcotics unit. He said that the alleged plot came to light in late December, about a month after detectives arrested the couple and said they seized a loaded .45-caliber handgun, 100 grams of cocaine and $1,300 from their home. Inspector Cully said that after the police got wind of what he called the plot, an undercover officer posing as a potential assassin visited Mr. Diaz in jail, and also spoke to Ms. Diaz about it. Despite Mr. Diaz’s suspicions, the superintendent “was not the source of the information that led us to do the search warrant,” Inspector Cully said.'"

Several prominent evangelical leaders said that, after meeting him, they had grown sufficiently comfortable with the notion of Mr. Romney as president to overcome any concerns they might have about his religion.On a pragmatic level, some said that Mr. Romney — despite questions among conservatives about his shifting views on abortion and gay rights — struck them as the Republican candidate best able to win and carry their social conservative agenda to the White House.“There’s this growing acceptance of this idea that Mitt Romney may well be and is our best candidate,” said Jay Sekulow, the chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative legal advocacy group, and a prominent host on Christian radio.Mark DeMoss, an evangelical public relations consultant who represents many conservative Christian groups, said it was “more important to me that a candidate shares my values than my faith,” adding, “And if I look at it this way, Mr. Romney would be my top choice.”Mormons consider themselves to be Christians, but some beliefs central to Mormons are regarded by other churches as heretical. For example, Mormons have three books of Scripture other than the Bible, including the Book of Mormon, which Mormons believe was translated from golden plates discovered in 1827 by Joseph Smith Jr., the church’s founder and first prophet.Mormons believe that Smith rescued Christianity from apostasy and restored the church to what was envisioned in the New Testament — but these doctrines are beyond the pale for most Christian churches.Beyond that, there are perceptions among some people regarding the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the church is formally known, that account for at least some of the public unease: that Mormons still practice polygamy (the church renounced polygamy in 1890), that it is more of a cult than a religion and that its members take political direction from the church’s leaders.Several Republicans said such perceptions could be a problem for Mr. Romney, especially in the South, which has had a disproportionate influence in selecting Republican presidential nominees.Gloria A. Haskins, a state representative from South Carolina who is supporting Senator John McCain for the Republican nomination, said discussions with her constituents in Greenville, an evangelical stronghold, convinced her that a Mormon like Mr. Romney could not win a Republican primary in her state. South Carolina has one of the earliest, and most critical, primaries next year.“From what I hear in my district, it is very doubtful,” Ms. Haskins said. “This is South Carolina. We’re very mainstream, evangelical, Christian, conservative. It will come up. In this of all states, it will come up.”But Katon Dawson, the state Republican chairman, said he thought Mr. Romney had made significant progress in dealing with those concerns. “I have heard him on his personal faith and on his character and conviction and the love for his country,” Mr. Dawson said. “I have all confidence that he will be able to answer those questions, whether they be in negative ads against him or in forums or in debates.”Mr. Romney’s candidacy has stirred discussion about faith and the White House unlike any since Kennedy, including a remarkable debate that unfolded recently in The New Republic. Damon Linker, a critic of the influence of Christian conservatism on politics, described Mormonism as a “theologically unstable, and thus politically perilous, religion.”The article brought a stinging rebuttal in the same publication from Richard Lyman Bushman, a Mormon who is a history professor at Columbia University, and who said Mr. Linker’s arguments had “no grounding in reality.”Mr. Romney is not the first Mormon to seek a presidential nomination, but by every indication he has the best chance yet of being in the general election next year. His father, George Romney, was a candidate in 1968, but his campaign collapsed before he ever had to deal seriously with questions about religion.Senator Hatch said his own candidacy in 2000, which was something of a long shot, was to “knock down prejudice against my faith.”“There’s a lot of prejudice out there,” Mr. Hatch said. “We’ve come a long way, but there are still many people around the country who consider the Mormon faith a cult.”But if Mr. Romney has made progress with evangelicals, he appears to face a larger challenge in dispelling apprehensions among the public at large. A national poll by The Los Angeles Times and Bloomberg News last June found 37 percent said they would not vote for a Mormon for president.Mr. Romney offered assurances that seemed to reflect what Kennedy told the nation in discussing his Catholicism some 50 years ago. Mr. Romney said the requirements of his faith would never overcome his political obligations. He pointed out that in Massachusetts, he had signed laws allowing stores to sell alcohol on Sundays, even though he was prohibited by his faith from drinking, and to expand the state lottery, though Mormons are forbidden to gamble. He also noted that Mormons are not exclusively Republicans, pointing to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader.“There’s no church-directed view,” Mr. Romney said. “How can you have Harry Reid on one side and Orrin Hatch on the other without recognizing that the church doesn’t direct political views? I very clearly subscribe to Abraham Lincoln’s view of America’s political religion. And that is when you take the oath of office, your responsibility is to the nation, and that is first and foremost.”He said he was not concerned about the resistance in the polls. “If you did a poll and said: ‘Could a divorced actor be elected as president? Would you vote for a divorced actor as president?’ my guess is 70 percent would say no. But then they saw Ronald Reagan. They heard him. They heard his vision. They heard his experience. They said: ‘I like Ronald Reagan. I’m voting for him.’ ”'"
"'07-02-08,'0','WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (AP) — Productivity grew at a healthy 3 percent annual rate in the final quarter, although for all of 2006, this crucial measure of economic vitality expanded at the slowest pace in nine years.Productivity, the amount of output for an hour of work, rose by 2.1 percent for all of 2006, down slightly from a 2.3 percent increase in 2005.It was the slowest pace since a 1.6 percent gain in 1997, according to figures released Wednesday by the Labor Department. But the 3 percent annual growth rate in the last three months of 2006 was nearly double what economists were expecting.Labor costs for each unit of output rose 3.2 percent for all of 2006, up from a 2 percent increase in 2005 and the fastest rise in worker wages and benefits since a 4.2 percent increase in 2000.For the fourth quarter, wage pressures eased a bit, rising by just 1.7 percent, a better outcome than analysts had been expecting after a 3.2 percent rate of increase in the third quarter.'"

"'07-02-08,'0','Because of the impromptu protest, New York Racing Association officials were forced to cancel the remaining four races on the Saturday card. NYRA also scrapped Sunday’s entire program because of concerns about the subfreezing weather and the possibility that the jockeys would again refuse to ride.The jockeys’ concerns about Jamaica Hospital first surfaced last Thursday, when jockey José Santos was sent there after sustaining serious injuries in a spill that also led to the death of a horse. Rita Santos, the jockey’s wife, said that doctors at Jamaica had overlooked some of her husband’s injuries and failed to provide the sort of hands-on care she believed he needed.“I never had an opportunity to ask the questions I thought needed to be asked because no doctors ever showed up,” she said.About seven hours after he was admitted, Santos, against the advice of the doctors treating him at Jamaica, checked himself out and went to North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. North Shore is a prestigious hospital and is where jockeys are normally sent after accidents at Belmont Park, which straddles the Queens-Nassau border. Belmont takes over from Aqueduct for racing in late spring, summer and early fall.“I understand that a lot of the jockeys have a relationship with North Shore and they are comfortable there and that’s where this patient wanted to go,” said Ole Pederson, Jamaica’s vice president for emergency medicine. “But to achieve that goal, some negative comments were made about us, and I think that was counterproductive.“No one ever expressed any concerns or issues to us while he was here,” Pederson added in reference to Santos. “We are very comfortable with the care that was provided in this case.”Dr. Joseph Bosco, a former doctor at Jamaica Hospital who was asked by the hospital to review Santos’s complaints, said Santos was examined by doctors at Jamaica, including one specializing in spinal problems.On Tuesday, a group of jockeys and NYRA officials met to discuss the hospital dispute. It was explained to the jockeys that the emergency medical technicians working at Aqueduct must abide by regulations that stipulate that any person with possible life-threatening injuries be taken to the nearest hospital that is a Level I trauma center.Jamaica Hospital is about 10 minutes from Aqueduct; North Shore is 25 minutes away. The solution reached at Tuesday’s meeting stipulates that Aqueduct jockeys with less-severe injuries can be taken to North Shore; more serious cases will be sent to Jamaica. Satisfied with the agreement, the jockeys returned to work yesterday, the first day of regularly scheduled races since Sunday.The hospital dispute underscores the dangers inherent in horse racing, the only sport in which an ambulance follows the competitors around the playing field. According to the Jockeys’ Guild, an average of 1.5 jockeys are killed each year while racing. Of course, far more horses die, an issue dramatized by the death last month of Barbaro.Lopez, 46, has had his share of injuries in his racing career. He has had four spills within the last three years and, early in his career, broke four vertebrae. But yesterday, his biggest problem was that he was cold.“It’s awful out there,” he said when asked about the conditions. “You get winded because you’re pushing these horses and you’re trying to win and that ice-cold air gets to you. It’s miserable. You’re uncomfortable most of the time.”Lopez said that during a good week, he could clear as much as $15,000 from his share of the purses. That is what keeps him coming back to New York and makes him put up with the cold, one of the sport’s dreariest racetracks and, ultimately, the perils that make hospital care an ongoing issue for every jockey.'"
"'07-02-08,'0','“I’m not exaggerating,” said Stephen P. Allbee, a project director in the agency’s water division who helped make the projections. “It’s a really, really big public issue, and it’s going to be with us for a long time.”Local geology or underground hazards are blamed for many sinkholes: weak limestone in Florida, old mineshafts in Pennsylvania. But increasingly, the authorities say, as America’s cities grow older and basic repairs are put off, when the ground gives way the problem is bad pipes.In its 2005 “Report Card for America’s Infrastructure,” the American Society of Civil Engineers gave water and wastewater infrastructure across the country a D-minus and suggested it would take an investment of $390 billion to bring wastewater infrastructure alone up to par.Estimates vary on what the costs could be, but nervous water utilities and environmental groups have been campaigning to educate the public and local elected officials to get more money for repairs. But they face an uphill battle, persuading people to pay higher water and sewer rates, and politicians to approve those rates instead of building new schools, parks, libraries and roads.“You can’t easily go to a ribbon-cutting or have your picture taken in front of a new sewer line,” said Dean Marriott, director of the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services, which oversees sewer maintenance in the city. “Everyone simply counts on them working. Most people don’t know how they work or even where the system is.”Still, Mr. Allbee, the E.P.A. official, said age and neglect could prove as fatal to a system as a catastrophic natural event or a terrorist attack.“You can lose that system all at once because of terrorism,” Mr. Allbee said, “but you can lose it over time by just not taking care of it.”The American Water Works Association, whose members include more than 4,700 utilities, has begun an advertising campaign “to raise this conversation about buried water infrastructure above ground,” said Greg Kail, a spokesman for the association.One advertisement, placed in spots from bus shelters in Miami to newspapers in Anchorage, features a picture of a faucet with the words, “Do you know how often you turn me on?” Another ad in the works will focus directly on problems with water mains, and include the phrase, “Don’t let me break down in front of you.”“The concept is to personify the infrastructure,” Mr. Kail said. “We’re not trying to scare people. We’re trying to make them aware that this is a real concern that deserves our attention to keep it from being a crisis in the future.”The bulk of the water and sewer lines beneath American streets were installed in three phases: at the end of the 19th century, in the 1920s, and just after World War II, echoing periods of population growth in cities and expansion into suburbs.A burst of environmentalism in the 1970s, including passage of the Clean Water Act, led to improvements in water and sewage treatment facilities and increased federal scrutiny of the water supply. But the condition of underground water and sewage pipes, many of which were built to last only 50 to 75 years, has not always received the same attention. At the same time, demand has increased.“The pipes age, and the population increases,” said James W. Rush, editor of Underground Infrastructure Management, a trade magazine for public utility administrators. “Those are the two factors that are always at work.”Portland has had a boom in downtown development, adding demand to its water and sewer systems.The city is in the 16th year of a 20-year, $1.4 billion, federally mandated project to reduce sewage overflows into the Willamette River from about 100 days a year to 4 days or less. Signs in the city promote two enormous sewer and storm water lines being dug as part of the project, one on the west bank of the Willamette that is 14 feet in diameter and another on the east side that is 22 feet in diameter.“I’ve walked them,” said Mr. Marriott, the Portland official. “You could roll a marble from one length to the next — beautiful, beautiful work. What goes in them is stuff that used to go in the river.”Overflows are a problem in many cities, and fixing them is not cheap; Portland has some of the highest water and sewer rates in the country. Mr. Marriott said the average residential sewer bill in Portland has risen to about $45 a month from about $14 in the early 1990s, when the city began the mandated improvements.Once the project is completed, he said, rates will probably stay high so that the city can fix other problems, like the sewer pipe decay that officials believe most likely helped cause the sinkhole in December, the one that swallowed the sewer truck.Mack McEachern was there on that chilly morning. First the water in his apartment on Southeast Oak Street stopped running. Then the boiler in the basement began to fade. Water-utility workers came to check an exterior main. The city inspected a clogged sewer line. Something was wrong with the system, but what?Mr. McEachern recalled how he stood outside and watched the big sewer truck start to pull away, supposedly without having pinpointed the problem.Then, he said, “The ground shook.”'"
"'07-02-08,'0','“He’s trying to move the responsibility away from Apple and turn this into a trans-Atlantic trade issue,” said Torgeir Waterhouse, senior adviser to the Norwegian Consumer Council.Like consumer organizations in several other European countries, the Norwegian group is not happy that songs bought from the Apple iTunes Store can be played only on Apple’s iPods. A consumer ombudsman in Norway agreed last month with a complaint filed on the matter and gave Apple until March 1 to respond and until Oct. 1 to do something about the situation.While Norway is a tiny market, the ombudsman’s decision was followed by similar complaints from groups in other Nordic countries, France, Germany and the Netherlands.Analysts say the moves could encourage regulators to take bolder steps to try to break the iTunes/iPod link. Legislators in France tried last year to pass a law opening the system to competition, but the proposal was watered down.“Apple can see that the legislative tide is turning in Europe,” said Mark Mulligan, an analyst at Jupiter Research, in a posting on the company’s Web site. “To U.S. readers it might seem strange to be so concerned about consumer group actions in little markets like Norway, which have just four million inhabitants. But this is all about precedents and other markets following suit.”By calling on the record companies to drop their insistence on copy protection, analysts said, Mr. Jobs may have been trying to insulate Apple, in case European momentum for legislative or regulatory approaches increases. Having watched Microsoft, tussle with the European Commission for years, Mr. Jobs may want to avoid a similar fate.BEUC, a European consumer group, has been asking the commission to enact a charter of digital rights. Analysts say lobbying is still at an early stage, but policy makers are likely to examine the issue under the current six-month German presidency of the European Union.For some time, the recording industry has been urging manufacturers and retailers of digital music devices — not just Apple but also Sony and Microsoft — to open up systems that tie customers of an online music store to using a music player from the same brand.French law generally prohibits marketers from making the purchase of one product dependent on the purchase of another, a practice known as tying, said Cedric Manara, a law professor at Edhec Business School in Nice.In December, a French court ruled against Sony for failing to alert consumers that its devices could use only music recorded under a proprietary format. Apple faces a similar court challenge in France.“Now, if courts come back and say, ‘You have to open up this system,’ they can say, ‘Look, we’ve done all we can, and our music partners won’t let us,’ ” said Paul Jackson, an analyst at Forrester Research.While the recording industry wants digital music services and devices to be technologically interoperable, Mr. Jobs said that would not work if the industry insisted on maintaining copy protection.To achieve interoperability with digital rights management, he said, Apple would have to license its technology, creating security risks.John Kennedy, chief executive of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, a trade group based in London, said he did not accept Mr. Jobs’s argument. “He seems to have gotten frustrated with the various attacks over interoperability,” Mr. Kennedy said. “He seems to be trying to take out that frustration on the music industry.”“The good news is that he seems to want to talk about interoperability, which in the past was a closed door,” Mr. Kennedy said.'"
"'07-02-08,'0','The issue flared this week when Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates testified at a Senate hearing that he shared the concerns of officers who complained about a request from Ms. Rice’s office that military personnel temporarily fill more than one-third of 350 new jobs in Iraq that the State Department is supposed to be responsible for. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that senior military officials were upset at the request and told President Bush and Mr. Gates that the new Iraq strategy could fail unless more civilian agencies stepped forward quickly to carry out plans for reconstruction and political development.David Satterfield, the State Department’s senior adviser for Iraq, told reporters during a teleconference that the State Department’s request was only for temporary help and for non-State Department positions that would probably be filled by contractors anyway.“The skill sets needed for the additional staff are not skill sets in which any foreign service in the world, including our own,” are proficient, Mr. Satterfield said. While State Department employees would provide leadership, he said, most of the staffing required would involve specialists like agricultural technicians.But many military officials remained angry at the request, saying that the military did not necessarily have people with those skill sets, either, and that it would have to go to the already strained National Guard to plug holes that would take advantage of their civilian, and not their military, strengths.Adm. Edmund P. Giambastiani, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military was used to working with State Department officials in Iraq, including Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad. But, in a telephone interview, Admiral Giambastiani went on to describe a kind of cultural clash.“The problem, not surprising, is we’re used to deploying over there,” Admiral Giambastiani said. “We send out orders, we execute orders, we deploy our military, and guess what happens? They turn up and do their job.”He said that while it was acceptable for the State Department to ask for the National Guard, with its experts in civilian military affairs, to fill the positions temporarily, “you have to understand why people on the Defense side would come up with this frustration.” He added, “We’ve got to get the mission done, but in the long term, we’d rather use our military personnel to fill the military functions.”Answering lawmakers’ questions on Monday, Ms. Rice said the department had managed to fill 87 percent of the positions it needed in Iraq.But that percentage does not readily show the people who are volunteering, a number of State Department officials and employees said.“A number of lower-level people are willing to go, seeing this as a combination money-maker, adventure and career-builder,” said one State Department employee who said he had been asked twice to go to Iraq in the past year and had said no both times, vehemently. “It’s the midlevel people who don’t want to go.”Department officials have offered incentives, including combat and danger pay, and have conveyed to employees that a stint in Iraq could lead to a more rapid career rise. They have also refused to fill openings in some plusher postings in Europe until Iraqi positions are filled, State Department employees said.The complaints from the Pentagon are part of long-simmering tensions between the Pentagon and the State Department over who is responsible for what in Iraq, The differences go back to the months before the invasion, when State employees complained that they were being cut out of the postwar planning by a Pentagon bent on doing everything itself.“There’s some outrage that the collective capacity of American reconstruction capability was ignored prior to the war,” said one State Department employee who is learning Arabic before deploying to the Middle East. “And now we are expected to clean up the mess.”'"

Whatever the reason, the company’s new iPod dock is called George.The dock, which is compatible with most recent iPods, has most of the standard features, including a pair of speakers, an AM/FM radio and a musical alarm clock. The dock reads the iPod’s contents and can show the current song and full track list on its display screen. George also has inputs for devices like the iPod Shuffle and CD players.In a twist, the front panel is removable and becomes an iPod remote, allowing songs and podcasts to be browsed from up to 25 feet away.There are a few interesting improvements to the radio as well. It is bandless, which means that you can browse through a continuous “dial” that has both the AM and FM bands. You can also store station presets grouped by genres, like talk, sports and rock radio.Chestnut Hill is selling George for $549 at www.chillsound.com. It will be available in retail stores later this year. A portable iPod boom box called Martha can’t be far behind. JOHN BIGGS'"
"'07-02-08,'0','NEWARK, Feb. 7 — An audit of the way Newark City Hall sends out its water bills, inspects its restaurants and pays private tow-truck operators has documented an antiquated and disorganized bureaucracy that has been squandering millions of dollars, encouraging municipal malfeasance and potentially putting the health of its residents at risk.The $1.2 million audit, commissioned by Mayor Cory A. Booker soon after he took office in July, found that the city had failed to collect $80 million in tax revenue and that it loses about 30 percent of its drinking water each day through undiscovered leaks.Auditors also stumbled upon the medical records of residents piled up in milk crates in public hallways, according to the report, details of which were reported in The Star-Ledger of Newark on Wednesday.“As a resident of Newark, the things we discovered are downright infuriating,” said Michelle Thomas, the director of the office of Innovation and Performance Management, which helped coordinated the three firms that conducted the research. “For the most part, it’s folks just not being allowed to do the right thing.”Although it does not mention Mr. Booker’s predecessor by name, the report serves as a richly detailed critique of former Mayor Sharpe James, who ran City Hall for two decades and whose use of municipal credit cards is under investigation by state and federal authorities.'"
"'07-02-08,'0','The subsidiary has been in financial trouble for several years. Now, the parent company says it no longer wants to prop up the American unit. With a final cash infusion of $287.5 million, Royal Sun Alliance hopes to turn the subsidiary over to a group of American executives and be done with it.“We are a business, not a charity,” said George Culmer, the chief financial officer for the British insurer, at a hearing called by the Department of Insurance in Delaware, where the company has its American headquarters.The hearing officer, Lawrence A. Hamermesh, a professor at Widener University Law School, concluded that Royal & SunAlliance USA, which would change its name to Arrowpoint Capital Corporation, has enough money to pay its claims to Mr. Silverstein, General Motors and other American corporations. He has recommended that the deal be approved.But Mr. Silverstein’s group and other American corporate customers argue that Mr. Hamermesh is overly optimistic about the financially troubled company’s ability to pay up. “If the parent company pulls out, we don’t think we’ll get paid anything like what we’re owed,” said Marc Wolinsky, a lawyer for Mr. Silverstein.The Silverstein Group and other policyholders have been given until tomorrow to file objections.Last fall, state and city officials, the Port Authority and Mr. Silverstein agreed on a framework for rebuilding the 16-acre trade center site by 2012. The Port Authority, which owns the land, took financial responsibility for building the Freedom Tower, whose projected cost stands at $3 billion.The Port Authority is also building a $2.2 billion transit hub and working with government officials and private business leaders to erect a memorial and museum.Mr. Silverstein, in turn, is building three other towers along the eastern edge of the site, with a combination of insurance proceeds, tax-free Liberty Bonds and private borrowing, with the intent to lease space to the Port Authority and other agencies.The developer and others have long complained that the insurers have been slow to pay. The problem with Royal & SunAlliance USA has been slowly evolving. The company encountered financial difficulty several years ago because of claims from the trade center attack and because of a wave of new claims on policies it sold years ago to General Motors and other corporations as protection against lawsuits over illnesses caused by asbestos.In 2003, the company stopped selling insurance, dismissed most of its 6,317 employees and went into what insurers call “runoff,” a condition in which an insurer does nothing but pay claims.A runoff is almost never good for customers. That is because with no new income from sales and with the prospect of new claims arising, managers have to ration the available money. They generate income by investing that money and they also try to persuade policyholders to settle claims for less than they expected — in other words, take a financial haircut. If there’s money left over after all claims have been resolved, it goes to the insurance company and its owners.The World Trade Center was already in danger of receiving less than the $255 million that a federal court had ruled Royal Sun’s subsidiary owed as part of the $4.6 billion that the courts ordered all of the trade center’s insurers to pay. Mr. Wolinsky, the lawyer for Mr. Silverstein, said the risk jumped sharply in September when the British parent first moved to abandon the subsidiary.If the British insurer continued doing business in the United States, Mr. Wolinsky acknowledged, it would have the same incentive to pay as little on claims as possible. But paying nothing, or next to nothing, would damage its standing with rating agencies and customers, Mr. Wolinsky said. In self-defense, he said, the British firm would be forced to put more money into the American unit.“There have been several runoffs in the United States in which a parent has kept the subsidiary going because of the reputational interest,” Mr. Wolinsky said.Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, said that there would be serious financial problems with the rebuilding effort if Royal failed to pay the full amount. So far, he said, the insurer had paid only $5.6 million of the original $255 million claim.“It would create a major hole and there’s no obvious replacement,” he said. “Our rebuilding plan depended on insurers living up to their obligations, which have been affirmed by the Court of Appeals.”'"
"'07-02-08,'0','Low tire pressure increases fuel consumption, speeds up tire wear and can change a car’s handling from precise to mushy. And with today’s low-profile tires, you cannot detect low pressure by the bulge of the sidewalls. On many new cars tire-pressure monitor systems can provide a warning, but many drivers who lack such a system ignore the need for regular pressure checks.It’s hard to ignore a flashing red light. Air Alert valve caps, from Aviation Upgrade Technologies, blink when the pressure drops significantly in the tires they are mounted on. The L.E.D.’s are bright enough to be seen in daylight, and really catch your eye by night. The set of four is $25, and it is available in auto supply stores and online at www.aviationupgrade.com.Air Alerts fit on the tires like normal valve caps, and calibrate themselves to each tire’s pressure (from 10 to 139 pounds per square inch).If a tire’s pressure drops by four pounds per square inch, its valve cap will start flashing — and keep flashing for three weeks or more, in case the tires lose pressure when you are not around.'"
"'07-02-08,'0','In her latest choreographic experiment Karole Armitage takes on the hypnotic music of Gyorgy Ligeti, a composer of spellbinding imagination whose compositions are hardly unknown in the dance world. For “Ligeti Essays,” performed by 10 members of Armitage Gone! Dance on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater, Ms. Armitage places her own stamp on the music and, along with it, something other choreographers don’t have: David Salle.Mr. Salle, Ms. Armitage’s longtime visual designer, creates a magical and deceptively simple setting for “Ligeti Essays.” A lone silvery tree with bare twisted branches graces the stage, which is bordered by neon tubes of light by Clifton Taylor. At first the wings and rear of the stage are black, but midway through the dance the back wall gradually transforms into a twinkling sapphire sky. It’s breathtaking, providing a pristine setting for Ms. Armitage’s partially frozen world. As the lighting gently shifts from light to dark, the stage takes on the look of a remote, icy pond in the middle of a dream.The extensive music covers a great deal of territory, from three song cycles written to the poetry of Sandor Weores to “The Hamburg Concerto” and “Musica Ricercata” for solo piano. Ms. Armitage as usual plays with melodies by constructing abstract designs with bodies; the dancers look handsome in Peter Speliopoulos’s belted black-velvet leotards for the women and black pants with slim-fitting tops for the men. But too often the sections, which suffer from brevity, fall into predictability.Frances Chiaverini, with her long legs and arms, possesses an entrancing, gangly allure, and William Isaac and Mei-Hua Wang are arresting in their duets. Still, much of the choreography is overwhelmed by static poses and, especially in the first half, little texture in the way of pacing. The surprise emergence, at the end, of a pregnant Megumi Eda, who passes the dancers and touches each on the shoulder, seems to be an attempt to deepen the conversation with a touch of humanity, yet the shift seems like a postscript.Ms. Eda also appears in “Pig,” featuring Jeff Koons’s pink inflatable animal that Ms. Armitage used in her 1989 ballet “Contempt.” Wearing a long pale-pink tulle dress by Christian Lacroix, Ms. Eda dances a playful pas de deux with the massive creature. It’s a frothy concoction, nothing more.The program concludes with a reduced version of Ms. Armitage’s “Time Is the Echo of an Ax Within a Wood” (2004) , which unfolds in another majestic set by Mr. Salle. This time he frames the stage with a curtain of silver beads, providing a shimmering universe for a darker, more brooding kind of dream. Here, as Ms. Armitage shows her fine aptitude for sensual, flowing lines and fierce partnering, Mr. Salle creates a frame to give flesh meaning. It’s still a marvel.'"
"'07-02-08,'0','To say Airbus has a lot riding on the A380 does not begin to describe the risk. This carefully orchestrated flight was clearly an effort to put public attention back on the plane rather than the A380 program, which has become a $6 billion millstone around the neck of Airbus.“The real moment for me will come when we deliver the first plane to Singapore Airlines in October,” said Mr. Leahy, the co-chief operating officer of Airbus, who has spent the last year mollifying angry customers because of repeated delays in deliveries of the $300 million plane.The A380 got a desperately needed lift in December, when Singapore Airlines and Qantas of Australia agreed to buy 17 additional planes — the first firm orders in more than a year. But production woes have cost it at least one customer: FedEx canceled an order for 10 jets.Perhaps most troubling, Lufthansa of Germany placed a $5.5 billion order for 20 Boeing 747-8’s, a stretched version of the 37-year-old jumbo jet that the A380 was once expected to put into mothballs.This day, though, was for savoring the gee-whiz aspects of the A380 rather than its murky commercial prospects.The novelty began at the gate, which offered upper- and lower-deck access to the plane. Emirates, the largest customer for the A380, plans to put premium and economy-class seats on separate decks — recalling a Gilded Age ocean liner — and to board people directly from V.I.P. lounges.The main staircase between the decks is grand enough that one could picture the actress Kate Winslet descending it in an evening gown on her way to dinner, as she did in that movie about a very big ship.Enough about size; how are the seats? Pretty much like those on any other wide-body jet, it has to be said.Airbus was quick to claim an edge, though. The A380’s economy-class seat is 18 inches wide, which Airbus said was an inch wider than the seat on a typical 747, even with the same number of seats abreast. Airbus can eke out more space because its main deck is 20 inches wider than that of a 747.Seating design, however, is largely left up to the airlines, which means that this plane offered only a theoretical example of the flying experience on an A380. That may explain why there were two cocktail bars on board, enabling passengers to graze on canapés and wash them down with Champagne.“It’s more like working in a lounge than on an airplane,” said Daniela Indrizzi, a flight attendant for Lufthansa, who was on loan to Airbus Wednesday to refill glasses and hand out more nibbles.When Airbus first announced the A380 seven years ago, it conjured up images of on-board duty-free shops, casinos and showers. Mr. Leahy said one undisclosed carrier had ordered a shower for its first-class cabin. But the more fanciful ideas have fallen by the wayside.When packed with seats, the A380 can hold 840 people. Airbus used this plane for evacuation drills last year, and it said all 840 were able to pile out in 78 seconds, with only a couple of broken bones. It is not clear what would happen if they all needed to use the restroom at the same time.Fortunately, there were 15 lavatories on this A380, including one in the first-class cabin that has a window above the commode. However spectacular the view, its cramped confines didn’t invite loitering.There were other quirks. The overhead bins were not especially roomy, even in business class. The laminated safety cards look much the same as they did during the heyday of the 747. The in-flight entertainment system, which caused all those production problems, was switched off.And there was something missing: on a flight buffeted by turbulence, no airsick bags in the seat pockets.The pilot, Peter Chandler, seemed to welcome the blustery weather as a chance to show off his machine. Terry Lutz, an Airbus test pilot on hand, attested that the A380 is “extraordinary when you bank it.”Airbus promotes the A380 as having the quietest cabin in the sky, and indeed, the four Rolls-Royce engines purred. Lying on the horizontal seats in first class, it was easy to imagine slumbering all the way to Hong Kong. For families with sleepless toddlers, the long aisles are perfect for walks.Critics say that whatever the A380’s technical marvels, it will probably be only a niche plane in an industry increasingly dominated by medium-size, extremely fuel-efficient aircraft like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.Richard L. Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., said the slogan for today’s flight could have been, “Come see the future, as it once was.” He predicted that Airbus would sell only 300 of the planes; Mr. Leahy said sales would be 800 to 900.Airbus is still trying to recover from wiring problems that shut its production line last year. Losses — because of penalties for late deliveries and a costly overhaul — are expected to slice more than $6 billion from the profits of its parent, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, over four years.This has worsened the political tensions that swirl around Airbus. French and German officials are fretting about layoffs at Airbus plants. Workers in Germany have threatened to delay deliveries of planes, after reports that up to 8,000 people there could lose their jobs.Pressed on all the bad news, Mario Heinen, the chief of the A380 program, told reporters that they should feel privileged to get a ride on the plane. “Let’s just enjoy this beautiful aircraft,” he said.'"

"'07-02-09,'0','Writing about experience necessarily sanitizes it, theorizes Sangjoon Han, a Korean-American soldier who fought in Iraq and is one of many articulate talking heads in Richard E. Robbins’s documentary “Operation Homecoming.” Built around the firsthand recollections of soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, the film is a spinoff from an anthology of essays, e-mail messages, poems and letters compiled by the National Endowment for the Arts and published by Random House.Mr. Han’s “Aftermath,” a fictional composite of several events, is one of the strongest and most sophisticated contributions. Written from the dual perspectives of a fleeing Iraqi farmer and an American soldier who shoots him after repeatedly shouting at him to stop, it reaches a tragically absurd conclusion in which the American treats the farmer “whose vital organs were piled on top of him” with an IV.As you absorb the most graphic images of combat and how it changes people in these works written by soldiers but read by nine actors, “sanitize” is not a word that comes to mind. The best pieces portray combat as such a heightened sensory experience that it demands to be written about, and they suggest that war can turn ordinary men who wouldn’t think of keeping diaries into latter-day Hemingways.The visual images illustrating these recollections are pertinent wartime montages (one story is accompanied by animation), but they can’t compete with the power of the words. Listening is like reading variations of “Snowden’s Secret,” the climactic chapter of “Catch-22,” in which Yossarian, tending a dying man, realizes that “man is matter.” Several pieces describe the animal terror of death during combat in visceral language that involves every organ of the body.Here is a sample, from e-mail that John McCary, an Army sergeant, sent to his friends and family after attending a funeral for soldiers from his unit in 2004:“What do you say to your men after you’ve scraped up the scalps of an entire Iraqi family off the road right next to the shattered bodies of your soldiers held together only by their shoelaces, body armor or helmets: we’re fighting the good fight? I don’t think so. We’re just fighting. And now we’re dying.”'"
"'07-02-09,'0','The long-awaited report by Thomas F. Gimble, the Pentagon’s acting inspector general, concluded that, while the Feith team did not violate any laws or knowingly mislead Congress, it developed dubious intelligence that was inconsistent with the findings of the wider intelligence community.Mr. Gimble told the committee today that, while the Pentagon’s in-house intelligence-gathering was not illegal or unauthorized, “the actions, in our opinion, were inappropriate, given that all the products did not clearly show the variance with the consensus of the intel community, and in some cases were shown as intel products.”When Mr. Inhofe pressed Mr. Gimble on whether he agreed with Mr. Levin’s characterization of his report, Mr. Gimble said he viewed the document as “a flat, fact-based report of the events that occurred. I don’t have an opinion as to whether it’s devastating or not devastating.”On Thursday, as details of Mr. Gimble’s report were beginning to come out, Mr. Feith issued a statement saying his office’s activities had been authorized by former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and former Deputy Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, and that his office properly shared its findings.The report could add fuel to the growing debate in Congress over the administration’s conduct of the war, and whether and how lawmakers should declare their opposition to it.Mr. Levin said he wanted his committee to hear from Stephen Hadley, the national security adviser, and I. Lewis Libby Jr., the former chief of staff for Vice President Dick Cheney. Both Mr. Hadley and Mr. Libby received a Pentagon briefing in September of 2002 on supposed Al Qaeda-Iraq links that Mr. Gimble’s report said did not fully reflect intelligence agency views.Some of the administration’s most severe critics have long accused the White House of implying a link between the Al Qaeda terrorists who carried out the Sept. 11 attacks and the regime of Saddam Hussein -- a notion largely discredited by the independent commission that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks.Senator James Webb, Democrat of Virginia, embraced Senator Levin’s remarks and said the intelligence operation in Mr. Feith’s office had helped to create “a misunderstanding that persists to this day and affects the debates that are going on now.”But Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, disagreed. “I’m trying to figure out why we’re here,” he said, adding that the shortcomings of prewar intelligence had been known for some time.Mr. Chambliss noted that intelligence “is not exact science” after Mr. Gimble conceded that some Czech intelligence officials suspected a link between Al Qaeda and Baghdad, at least early on. “There are differences of opinion,” Mr. Chambliss said.However, Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, drew from Mr. Gimble a statement that Mr. Feith had not been entirely consistent in his intelligence briefings, in ways Mr. Gimble said he could not go into for security reasons.“He changed the briefing for his audience?” Mr. Reed asked“There were adjustments made depending on the audience,” Mr. Gimble replied.“Well, why would he do that?” the senator asked. “Why would he make changes based on the audience?”“I don’t think I’m in a position to make a comment on why he would do what he did,” Mr. Gimble said.'"
"'07-02-09,'0','The EMI Group, the British music giant, has been considering a plan to offer a broad swath of its recordings for sale online without anti-copying software, executives involved in discussions with the company said.EMI, which releases music by artists including Coldplay and the Beatles, has discussed various proposals to sell unprotected files through an array of digital retailers, including Apple, Microsoft, Real Networks and Yahoo, said the executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity.It is far from clear that the company, which has tested the concept recently by selling a song from Norah Jones in unprotected form, will reach a deal.But if it does, it would be the first of the four major music companies to distribute its catalog without software designed to limit copying. Because various online retailers use different forms of security software, known as digital-rights management, their services are not always compatible with all music-playing devices on the market.The debate over the industry’s handling of the issue heated up this week when Steven P. Jobs, chief executive of Apple, which leads the market with its iPod and iTunes service, suggested that the music companies offer their music without anti-copying software.Mr. Jobs’s stance drew catcalls from executives at several major labels — though some have experimented by selling a handful of songs in unprotected form, as EMI did with a single from Ms. Jones’s new album.'"

"'07-02-09,'0','In a statement issued Thursday, Mr. Feith, who left the Pentagon in 2005, made similar points. Mr. Rumsfeld did not respond to telephone messages seeking comment.According to Congressional officials, Mr. Feith’s statement and the policy office’s rebuttal, the report concluded that none of the Pentagon’s activities were illegal and that they did not violate Defense Department directives.But the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, said in a statement that because the inspector general considered the work of Mr. Feith’s group to be “intelligence activities,” the committee would investigate whether the Pentagon violated the National Security Act of 1947 by failing to notify Congress about the group’s work.Senator Levin, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the report a “very strong condemnation” of the Pentagon’s activities.“I think they sought this kind of intelligence. They made it clear they wanted any kind of possible connections, no matter how skimpy, and they got it,” he said.Mr. Feith and other officials in his Pentagon office have been accused by critics of the administration of distorting intelligence data to justify the invasion of Iraq. When Democrats were in the minority in Congress, Mr. Levin conducted an inquiry and issued a report excoriating Mr. Feith and others at the Pentagon for their conduct.The conclusions the Pentagon team reached in the year or so before the invasion of Iraq have been generally known for some time and were largely discredited by the Sept. 11 commission, which found “no evidence” that contacts between the Iraqi government and Al Qaeda “ever developed into a collaborative operational relationship.”According to Mr. Levin, the inspector general’s report did not make any specific recommendations, and he said that interagency coordination “will significantly reduce the opportunity for the inappropriate conduct of intelligence activities outside of intelligence channels.”The Senate Intelligence Committee, meanwhile, is completing work on its own investigation into the use of intelligence by policy makers in the months before the Iraq war. Under Republican leadership, it had delayed an examination of Mr. Feith’s activities pending the outcome of the inspector general’s report.The Pentagon’s rebuttal vehemently rejected the report’s contention that there was “inappropriate” use of intelligence by Pentagon civilians and said the effort to identify links between Saddam Hussein’s government and Al Qaeda was done at the direction of Mr. Wolfowitz, who was deputy defense secretary at the time.Describing the work as a “fresh, critical look” at intelligence agency conclusions about Al Qaeda and Iraq, the Pentagon rebuttal said, “It is somewhat difficult to understand how activities that admittedly were lawful and authorized (in this case by either the secretary of defense or the deputy secretary of defense) could nevertheless be characterized as ‘inappropriate.’ ”The Feith operation dates to shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when the Pentagon established a small team of civilians to sift through existing intelligence with the aim of finding possible links between terror networks and governments. Bush administration officials contended that intelligence agencies were ignoring reports of collaboration between Iraq and Al Qaeda.By the summer of 2002, the group, whose membership evolved over time, was aimed at identifying links between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein’s government in Iraq.The inspector general’s report criticizes a July 25, 2002, memo, written by an intelligence analyst detailed to Mr. Feith’s office, titled, “Iraq and al-Qaida: Making the Case.”The memo said that, while “some analysts have argued” that Osama bin Laden would not cooperate with secular Arab entities like Iraq, “reporting indicates otherwise.”The inspector general concluded that the memo constituted an “alternative intelligence assessment” from that given by the Central Intelligence Agency and other intelligence agencies and that it led to a briefing on links between Al Qaeda and Iraq that was given to senior Bush administration officials in August 2002, according to excerpts of the draft inspector general report quoted by Mr. Edelman.It is not clear whether the inspector general revised his report after receiving the rebuttal.The draft inspector general report said Mr. Feith’s office should have followed intelligence agency guidelines for registering differing views, “in those rare instances where consensus could not be reached.”In his statement Thursday, Mr. Feith said he was pleased that the inspector general had cleared him of violating laws or Defense Department policies, but he called it “wrong” and “bizarre” for the report to criticize civilian officials for scrutinizing intelligence agency conclusions and passing along their findings to senior officials.Mr. Feith also said that the inspector general’s findings reflected “confusion about the way policy and intelligence officials relate to one another in the real world.”'"
"'07-02-09,'0','Mr. Klein, who spoke at the meeting after Mr. Cerf, said simply that “he is divested.”In a telephone interview hours later, Mr. Cerf said that he had let the stock go only on Wednesday. Mr. Cerf and Michael Best, the Education Department’s top lawyer said in the interview that before being named deputy chancellor, Mr. Cerf had sought a waiver from the city’s Conflicts of Interest Board allowing him to keep the shares, but changed his mind this week.“I concluded that this had the potential to be a distraction,” Mr. Cerf said. “It felt like there was going to be kind of a buzz about this.”Mr. Best and Mr. Cerf said that he had recused himself from any dealings with Edison. While Edison is best known for running schools, its business dealings with the New York City Education Department include a contract under which one of its subsidiaries, Newton Learning, provides tutoring for students in failing schools as mandated by the federal No Child Left Behind law. Under that contract, the company was paid more than $9.6 million in the 2005-6 school year.Mr. Best said he also believed that it held a contract to provide tutoring during the summer to struggling third graders, but that he did not think the department had spent any money yet under that contract.Mr. Klein’s latest effort to reorganize the school system will give private companies and nonprofit groups the opportunity to bid for a role in offering support services for the schools. Mr. Klein has said that by law he cannot exclude commercial companies like Edison from bidding for the work. He told the parents group yesterday that school officials had no intention of giving commercial companies like Edison a wider role.“Nobody was looking to bring in for-profit organizations,” Mr. Klein said. “Our position on this has been clear. We would have, if we could have, limited this to not for-profits. We’re not looking to bring for-profits into the city.”Mr. Klein said that Mr. Cerf would not be responsible for choosing which groups get the contracts and said: “I’m not sure there is a conflict had he not been divested. That’s an issue for the lawyers to work through.”In a statement, a spokeswoman for Edison, Laura Eshbaugh, said that the company had not seen the request for proposals and that she doubted “that we would be interested in applying based on our current understanding.”She said Mr. Cerf resigned from Edison’s board of directors in October 2006. At the time, he had already been acting for months as a consultant to Mr. Klein.Under city Conflicts of Interest laws, public servants must seek a waiver in order to hold stock valued at $40,000 or more in companies that do business with their own agency. They also need a waiver if they hold that amount of stock in a privately held company that does business with any city agency, officials said.Mr. Best stressed that since Mr. Cerf’s earliest days as a consultant, he had been completely forthright about his Edison holdings and had agreed to recuse himself from any dealings related to the company. He said he expected that the Conflicts of Interest Board would have granted Mr. Cerf’s waiver.“I can’t stress to you enough how typical this is of people coming into city service,” Mr. Best said. “Nobody was trying to keep this a secret.”Mr. Best said that the Department of Education sought to prevent conflicts of interest with its consultants through clauses in their contracts.In the telephone interview, Mr. Cerf said that he did not know the nature of the stake he owned in Edison and that he had not thought much about it.“Edison was a public company, then it was taken private,” he said. “As part of that underlying transaction, there was some kind of equity interest created. I don’t know the particulars of it, other than it is options-like in substance.”According to the filings with the S.E.C., when Edison became a private company in 2003, Mr. Cerf was awarded 22.22 percent of so-called Class B contingency shares, a total of 20,000 shares in the company once they vested after five years. He was the only Edison official other than the company’s founder, H. Christopher Whittle, to be named in the filings as a beneficiary of the deal.Because the company is private, its does not have to disclose its financial statements or the value of its stock, which depends on its profits. But the S.E.C. filings laid out several hypothetical scenarios, showing the potential value of the different equity stakes after five years, that listed Mr. Cerf’s shares as potentially worth from $1.1 million to $6.7 million.Mr. Cerf said the shares’ value “is utterly dependent on the success of the company. Maybe some person made some hypothesis of what the company would be worth.”He acknowledged that he knew he was unable to sell or transfer the sales when he decided he no longer wanted to own them. Instead, he said, he sent a letter to the company’s owners relinquishing his ownership rights.The agenda at yesterday’s parent meeting listed Mr. Cerf as a speaker on the topic “Privatization: History of Edison Schools.” While the agenda had been public for more than a week, Mr. Cerf apparently did not know of it until Wednesday.That day, said the parent leader, Mr. Johnson, the chancellor’s senior counselor for community affairs, Brian Ellner, urged him to remove the item from the agenda, saying it was too “provocative.”“They just went ballistic,” Mr. Johnson said. “I said it’s already printed; it’s been out there for 10 days.”Told last night that Mr. Cerf had given up his shares on Wednesday, Mr. Johnson said in an interview that the deputy chancellor’s responses at the meeting were “extremely disingenuous and extremely disrespectful” to the parent organization.'"
"'07-02-09,'0','In a separate interview, Mr. Ailes elaborated. “Many times I’ve seen things on CNBC where they are not as friendly to corporations and profits as they should be.”He added: “We don’t get up every morning thinking business is bad.”The quick strikes by Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Ailes at their largest competitor suggest that the News Corporation will use the same take-no-prisoners tactics in the business area that Fox News Channel used in going after its biggest rival, CNN.Asked whether that meant that Fox would go easy on its reporting of the type of corporate scandals like Enron and WorldCom that cost individual investors millions of dollars when those companies collapsed, Mr. Ailes replied: “We will be as ruthless in our coverage of business scandals as we have always been.” He said that while thousands of companies have publicly traded securities, “only 9 or 10 are in trouble” at a given time.Kevin Goldman, a spokesman for CNBC, which is part of General Electric’s NBC Universal division, said the network welcomed the new competition and dismissed the comments from Fox executives about its coverage of business news.""I’m not surprised the potential competition has begun its typical onslaught of lies and propaganda,"" he said.Fox is stepping into an arena where other broadcasters have struggled. At least two financial news networks, FNN and CNNfn, have faltered in the last 20 years. But while the overall number of viewers for business television is small, it is a lucrative business because those watching tend to be attractive to advertisers.CNBC has bounced back after a long advertising drought to post a 65 percent increase in daytime ratings during the last quarter. The company has also said that last year was CNBC’s best in terms of revenue, even counting the late 1990s stock market boom.But the channel has taken a public relations hit recently after Citigroup fired a senior executive in part because of his professional and personal relationship with Maria Bartiromo, CNBC’s most popular anchor.Mr. Ailes said that Fox hoped to begin broadcasts early in the fourth quarter, but that the timing would depend on the hiring of reporters and editors as well as the construction of studios. Mr. Ailes said the channel already had 30 million subscribers under contract through distribution agreements with cable operators. CNBC is currently offered to 90 million cable subscribers, according to a spokesman for the network. Bloomberg TV can reach 43 million viewers through its 24-hour business channel.Fox has already struck deals with two major cable operators: Comcast and Time Warner. Comcast, the nation’s largest cable operator, will offer the Fox Business Channel to roughly half of its 24 million cable subscribers who have digital cable.Time Warner is offering it to about 7.6 million households, including 7.3 million cable homes that have digital cable, and to 300,000 subscribers in the New York market who do not have digital cable but will see the channel on their analog service. Fox also has an agreement with Charter Communications, which is based in St. Louis.Cablevision Systems, the Long Island operator, has yet to strike a deal with Fox, although DirecTV, the satellite television service controlled by the News Corporation, has agreed to carry it.Fox did not disclose what cable operators are paying for the service, although several cable executives, who did not want to be identified because the negotiations were private, said the figure was 10 cents to 15 cents a subscriber.In addition to Mr. Ailes and Mr. Cavuto, Fox said yesterday that Kevin Magee, an executive vice president for Fox News and a former producer at CNBC and ABC, would be responsible for daily operations and Alexis Glick, formerly of NBC’s “Today” show, would serve as director of business news and appear on camera in some segments.'"
"'07-02-09,'0','The first hedge fund and private equity company to go public in the United States will make its market debut today at $18.50 a share — at the high end of its expected price range.At that price, the company, Fortress Investment Group, which manages about $30 billion in assets, would have a market value of $7.4 billion. Class A shares of Fortress will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FIG.The Fortress offer is an unusual landmark in the rapid ascent of hedge funds. Managers of hedge funds — private investment pools that use an array of investment strategies — have been known for secrecy, in part to maintain a competitive advantage. Securities regulations that restrict their investors to the very wealthy and institutions like endowments and pension funds have furthered the mystique of the funds.Now Fortress is trading some of that privacy and cachet for capital.The company raised $634 million from the sale of 34.3 million shares yesterday.Demand for the offering was strong, analysts said. People who attended a presentation by Fortress on the offering on Wednesday said that it was standing room only. Last week, Fortress said in a filing that it expected to sell the shares in a range of $16.50 to $18.50 each.'"
"'07-02-09,'0','A male voice intones, “Introducing the most sophisticated piece of technology ... you will ever pee on.”Getting pregnant “is a beautiful thing,” said Julie Godon, director for marketing at the United States women’s health division at Inverness Medical Innovations.“It’s human and real,” she added, and urinating on the test monitor “is what you really do.”Charles Rosen, president at Amalgamated, describes Inverness as the agency’s most progressive client.“We could see right away this company would be willing to shatter taboos in women’s communications,” Mr. Rosen said.Using humor to dispel what lingering embarrassment there may be among consumers was the most important element in the creation of the campaign, Mr. Rosen said. That would help differentiate the ads from campaigns for other products for women that spoke about product benefits in a soft, safe voice, he added.Early results for the Clearblue Easy campaign indicate that the ad is working. Ms. Godon said that sales at one of Inverness’s largest retailers had increased 78 percent in a four-week period compared with the same period a year ago.Over the decades, ads for women’s personal care products typically merely implied the use of products like tampons and menstrual pads. A ’70s-era ad for Rely tampons, once sold by Procter & Gamble, for example, showed a young woman in a white bathing suit (white was a subtle signal about the efficacy of the product) kneeling in front of her male companion in a motorboat. “When the motor conked out, we paddled home,” the headline read. “Boy, was I glad I was wearing Rely.”Today, the Always line of menstrual pads sold by Procter runs ads carrying the nearly gleeful theme “Have a happy period.”The Always campaign also tries to speak to intelligent women who would understand the tongue-in-cheekiness of outdoor advertising. Posters on the train in Chicago advise the menstruating commuter, “It’s not too late to call in sick,” or “It’s O.K. to skip the gym.”If not exactly breakthrough, the ads approach a subject once considered “the curse” as one that has its lighter side.The new frankness has also arrived in the men’s personal care category, as seen in the success of the Philips Norelco Bodygroom shaver, introduced in 2005. The shaver, from Philips Electronics North America, is aimed at men, particularly those younger than 40, who wish to rid themselves of body hair.Robert Baird, chief executive at the domestic appliance and personal care division of the Philips consumer appliance group, said he was shocked the first time he saw the ads for Bodygroom.“I literally fell back in my chair,” said Mr. Baird, 45, a veteran of packaged-goods marketing. “I’m pretty liberal, but I was very worried about reaction out there in the world.”A commercial opens with a male in his mid-20s, dressed in a white bathrobe, who describes the process of shaving unwanted body hair using pictures of vegetables and fruit. Certain words and slang terms for body parts are bleeped out.The spot appears only online, and there are links to other video clips, which can be forwarded to friends.The concept first appeared in a print ad in Britain.Philips’s American agency, Tribal DDB Worldwide, part of the DDB Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group, decided that since the subject of body hair was not “topic No. 1” among men, it would need to “give them something else to talk about,” said Steve Nesle, executive creative director at Tribal DDB in New York.“We had to make it so compelling to the target audience that they couldn’t help but share it with friends,” he added.It worked. The fanciful Web site drew its first million visitors in a month.Philips spent “way less than $1 million” on the Bodygroom campaign, Mr. Baird said, and sales tripled over the original forecast. Philips Norelco rose to first in the trimming category from third, he added, and the product was listed as the item “most wished for” in the personal care category on Amazon.com during the holiday shopping season.'"
"'07-02-09,'0','A day after HSBC issued its first-ever profit warning, the bank’s chief executive started a management shake-up at the American consumer finance unit where losses from home loans to high-risk borrowers increased more than expected last year.Shares of HSBC, an international lender based in London, fell $2.44, to $89.78, in New York.HSBC, which derives about a third of its profit from North America, said that higher-than-expected default rates by borrowers with poor credit records meant that the bank would need to set aside an additional $1.8 billion to cover losses on loans that soured in 2006. That is about 20 percent more than previously forecast by industry analysts.Michael Geoghegan, the chief executive of HSBC, sought to soothe analysts’ concerns yesterday, saying that the loan-loss difficulties were isolated to its American consumer finance arm, the HSBC Finance Corporation.To that end, Mr. Geoghegan appointed Brendan McDonagh, formerly chief operating officer of HSBC Bank U.S.A., as chief operating officer of HSBC Finance. An HSBC spokesman in London, Richard Lindsay, said that the position was a new one and that Mr. McDonagh’s job would be to shore up the group’s mortgage portfolio.HSBC also named Christopher Spooner, the HSBC group head of tax in London, as the chief financial officer of HSBC Finance. He will succeed Simon C. Penney who recently retired.'"
"'07-02-09,'0','The former head of Idaho hedge-fund company, Wood River Capital Management, pleaded not guilty yesterday to securities fraud and other charges after investors lost at least $88 million when two of its funds collapsed in 2005.John H. Whittier, Wood River’s majority shareholder and principal executive, entered his plea through his lawyer at a hearing in federal court in Manhattan before Federal District Judge Jed S, Rakoff.Last week, Mr. Whittier was charged with securities fraud and three counts of failing to disclose a beneficial interest in publicly traded securities above certain thresholds.The Securities and Exchange Commission initially brought civil charges against Mr. Whittier and Wood River in October 2005.Prosecutors said that from February 2004 to September 2005, Mr. Whittier acquired more than 70 percent of the common stock of the Endwave Corporation for two of the company’s hedge funds and four managed accounts, but did not disclose those holdings in public filings.But, Endwave’s stock fell sharply in summer 2005, which triggered margin calls by some of the hedge funds’ brokers, prosecutors said.In September 2005, Whittier notified investors that he could not pay redemption requests because of liquidity problems and the funds were no longer doing business by October of that year, the government said.'"
"'07-02-09,'0','LOS ANGELES, Feb. 8 (Reuters) — Hand-drawn animation, out of fashion in the computer age, experienced a rescue worthy of a fairy tale on Thursday, when Walt Disney animators announced they would bring the art form back to the big screen.“We will be bringing back hand-drawn films,” said Edwin Catmull, the president of Pixar and Disney Feature Animation.Animators refer to hand-drawn animation as “two dimensional,” as opposed to computer-generated animation, referred to as 3D. Pixar, which created “Toy Story” and other computer animation hits, was acquired by the Walt Disney Company last year.Speculation has swirled since then over whether Mr. Catmull and John Lasseter, the chief creative officer, who took control of the ailing Disney animation facility, would reestablish the art form that made Disney the world’s pre-eminenent animator.All of Disney’s feature animation films in production at the time of the Pixar deal were computer-animated.'"
"'07-02-09,'0','Hedge funds can raise private money in the form of a 3(c)1 fund, which requires that there not be more than 100 investors and that they be moderately rich. (In December, the S.E.C. set a new standard for the funds of a net worth of $2.5 million.) Or they can raise 3(c)7 funds with no limits on the number of investors but with a higher wealth standard of “qualified” investors — investments worth $5 million. Being private and raising money via 3(c)1 or 3(c)7 funds means not having to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940.So if only the rich can invest, why does talking about the fund put investors who are not rich at risk?The S.E.C. seems to agree that that’s an issue. In 2003, when it published “Implications in the Growth of Hedge Funds,” it entertained the idea of lifting the prohibition on advertising and general solicitation on funds that market to the very wealthy. “There seems to be little compelling policy justification for prohibiting general solicitation or general advertising in private placement offerings of Section 3(c)7 funds that are sold only to qualified purchasers,” the report said.Nothing much has happened on that front since. In the meantime, the commission passed a rule that required hedge funds to register, and then that rule was overturned by the courts. The Massachusetts state securities regulator, William F. Galvin, sued Phillip Goldstein, the hedge fund manager who successfully challenged the S.E.C., over the registration rule, claiming that Mr. Goldstein violated the solicitation rules and let investors onto his Web site.The lawsuit “is bizarre,” Mr. Goldstein said. “If someone asks for info and you give it to them, isn’t that First Amendment activity? I’m not selling anything. I’m just providing information.” Yet there is reason to have hope that something could happen. According to Robert E. Plaze, associate director of investment management at the S.E.C., the commission’s views on the issue “have not changed” from 2003, and finding a way to get rid of the prohibition is on the to-do list for 2007.In April 2006, Steven Jay Seidemann, D. E. Shaw’s general counsel, wrote a letter to the commission, arguing that the rule should be removed for funds that are marketed only to qualified buyers. The S.E.C., he noted, had summed it up best: “In all the private offerings since the beginning of regulatory time, no offeree has ever lost any money unless he or she became a purchaser,” part of a proposing release read.Among the public policy objectives in removing the prohibition, Mr. Seidemann included the fact that D. E. Shaw employees cannot correct the news media when its returns are misstated because such a correction could be deemed “solicitation” and continuing to silence the funds, he wrote, will “contribute to the perceived lack of transparency in the hedge fund industry.” Amen.Let’s be honest, though. A lot of managers don’t want anyone — including me — knowing what they are doing, and if this rule is changed, they will be out of excuses. That’s a good thing.I encourage the S.E.C. to take them up on their battle cry. The S.E.C. chairman, Christopher Cox, can rest assured that there is broad consensus on the issue.And hedge funds that are in favor of this can rest assured that I will look forward to a fireside chat as soon as the rule goes through.'"
"'07-02-09,'0','BIRD flu has not yet turned into a pandemic, but it is already killing the meager hopes of some of the world’s poorest people for a marginally better life.When poultry become infected with the deadly strain of avian influenza (H5N1), it is essential that all birds nearby be culled to prevent further spread. We all stand to benefit from this important pandemic prevention strategy, recommended by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Unfortunately, however, the world’s poor are unfairly shouldering the burden of the intervention.Last month officials in Jakarta, Indonesia, announced a ban on household farming of poultry there. The domestic bird population of Jakarta is estimated at 1.3 million. Thousands of families were given until Feb. 1 to consume, sell or kill their birds. Now inspectors are going door to door to destroy any remaining birds.The Indonesian government pledged to pay about $1.50 for each bird infected with the H5N1 virus, a sum that may approximate the bird’s fair market value. But most birds that have been killed under this policy are healthy, so their owners, most reports suggest, will receive nothing.Moreover, it is not clear how Jakarta’s poor will replace the income they once received from chickens and other birds. When officials impose widespread culling, industrial-scale poultry producers — like the company that owns the large British turkey farm where bird flu was found this month — usually have the resources to absorb the losses. But when the birds of small-scale poultry farmers are culled, entrepreneurs who were just beginning to move up the development ladder can be plunged right back into poverty. The most dependent and vulnerable members of the community become even more dependent and vulnerable. “Backyard birds” are the only source of income for many women and children.Families whose birds are found to be infected with the virus may suffer even more. People in Cambodia, China and India whose poultry have been blamed for avian influenza outbreaks have often been subject to extreme stigma and isolation, and there have even been reports of suicides by desperate farmers.'"
"'07-02-09,'0','Rupert Murdoch and Fox News are adding Wall Street to their news portfolio.After many months of speculation about whether he would or wouldn’t, Mr. Murdoch said today that his News Corporation would begin airing a cable business news channel as early as October.To be called the Fox Business Channel, the new network will be developed and run by Roger Ailes, chief executive of Fox News. His two top deputies will be Kevin Magee, a Fox News executive vice president who will oversee the day-to-day operations; and Neil Cavuto, the unapologetically partisan Republican who anchors Fox’s weekday business show. Mr. Cavuto will oversee content for the new channel.News Corporation said it already has a subscriber base of 30 million because it has reached distribution agreements with multiple cable operators in large markets like New York. Time Warner, Comcast and DirecTV have all agreed to carry the new network, News Corporation said in a statement.For several years, Fox News executives, and Mr. Murdoch himself, have made it no secret that they were studying the possibility of creating a rival to CNBC. As recently as this week, Mr. Murdoch tipped his hand and said during a conference call to discuss his company’s financial results that an announcement on the channel was imminent.Though financial television news is a potentially lucrative business because of its typically affluent audience, there is risk to such a project. CNN had a financial news channel, CNNfn, but the network folded in 2004 after failing to attract enough viewers.Fox Business Channel will also have a formidable competitor in CNBC, whose ratings are on the rise and whose supremacy in television business news has been long established. Mr. Ailes of Fox, in fact, helped establish CNBC’s dominance before leaving the network in 1996.'"
"'07-02-09,'0','There are also shops that sell fake flowers of silk and plastic — “permanent botanicals,” as they’re known in the trade — and places that specialize in hard goods: vases, floral foam, spray paint and aerosol cans of artificial fragrance. How about a case of artificial butterflies or creepy-looking phony hummingbirds? They’re here too, along with plastic ladybugs, grasshoppers and praying mantises.But the days of all this plenty, both real and phony, may be numbered, Ms. Stewart said, explaining that West 28th Street is rapidly becoming more valuable as real estate than as a marketplace, and that the flower business has undergone a sea change. Three-quarters of all the flowers sold in the United States are now imported, she said, mostly from South America, and flowers are now available not just from florists but over the Internet and in delis and supermarkets, which puts increasing financial pressure on the wholesaler. What would make economic sense, she went on, would be for the flower market to move somewhere like the Hunts Point section of the Bronx, the new home of the Fulton Fish Market, but some flower sellers don’t want to budge.In the meantime Ms. Stewart was delighted to find that, thanks to some lilies and narcissus by the door, the G. Page Wholesale Flowers store still smelled like a flower shop — not a given in these days when scent is being bred out of flowers in favor of color, shape and longer shelf life. “And look at these,” she said, grabbing a bunch of French tulips from the Netherlands. “This is a really high-end flower,” she explained. “It’s not just the size, but the petal count, the delicacy of the color. It’s a luxury item, like fine wine. One of the things growers are always complaining about in America is that people here have no way of comparing flowers except by price. We don’t have a sense of quality.”Elsewhere in the shop she admired some pricey calla lilies, a flower that grows like a weed in her garden back home in Eureka, Calif., and some delphiniums, which she had tried and failed to grow for years. “That was my ‘Aha’ moment,” she said, explaining how she had come to be interested in the flower industry. “I saw some delphiniums at a farmers market in Eureka, and I said, ‘I can’t grow these to save my life.’ The seller said: ‘Oh, you don’t do these in a garden. You do them in a greenhouse.”Down the street, at Fischer & Page, she paused over some peonies from Israel; some roses of the lime-green Limbo variety, from Ecuador; some American ranunculuses. “I predict that this is going to be the next hot flower,” she said of the ranunculus. “It looks a little bit like a rose, it comes in all these great colors, and it can be grown using the same greenhouse infrastructure they use for gerbera daisies, which means that the grower doesn’t have a lot of downtime.” She added: “There’s a lot that’s unnatural about the flower business. It’s not the garden. There’s nothing garden about it.”Sun Valley Floral Farms, she added, one of the largest growers of cut flowers in the United States and a place that merits a chapter or so in her book, is just down the road from her, in Arcata, and the first time she went there was for an open house in 2001. “I had a naïve idea of what a flower farm would be,” she said, “but a factory is what I saw.”Still farther down West 28th Street, at Associated Cut Flowers, the floor was littered with leaves and greenery, and some of the shelves were already empty. It was past 9 a.m., and the flower district was winding down. There were even some parking spaces, as the last few vans loaded up and headed uptown, to hotels maybe, or to the kind of corporate offices that have a monthly flower budget.“That’s the one thing I don’t like about the flower business,” Ms. Stewart said. “Everyone gets up so damn early. It’s even worse in Amsterdam. I think maybe my next book should be about bartenders.”'"
"'07-02-09,'0','Mr. Tafara and Mr. Peterson call the concept “substituted compliance,” the idea being that the markets are complying with rules that are more or less as good as American ones.The S.E.C. could still bring fraud charges if it thought that was necessary, but angry customers might have to pursue any complaints in the home country’s legal system, rather than in the United States.The commission has not endorsed the proposal, but a former S.E.C. chairman, David S. Ruder, now a securities law professor at Northwestern University, said he thought the commission was interested in the idea, which he supports. “They are trying to incent the other regulators of the world to allow a kind of regulatory cooperation that will eventually lead to harmony,” he said in an interview.Such easy access to American investors would seem to remove incentives for foreign companies to list in United States markets. In a commentary accompanying the article, Edward F. Greene, a Citigroup lawyer, suggested that the idea should be extended to allow companies from those foreign markets to list on American exchanges, and to allow American investors to buy foreign mutual funds and use investment advisers from outside the United States.In a way, the idea mirrors one of the most successful efforts of William J. McDonough when he was chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Sarbanes-Oxley law that created the board gave it power to inspect any auditing firm — in the United States or overseas — that audited companies listed in American markets.As European countries pondered protests, Mr. McDonough gave speeches in which he said he assumed that other countries would set up similar accounting boards, and that the American board could then rely on their inspections. It worked, and such boards were created in many countries.Similarly, the carrot of easy access to the American market could stimulate countries to improve their regulatory systems — and to offer reciprocity to American exchanges and brokers.But there has to be some doubt about the ability of the S.E.C. to assess overseas regulatory regimes fairly and to keep track of changes. Europe will want all members of the European Union to be treated identically, although the quality of regulation varies.And political considerations could easily intrude. “One can imagine the complexities that will arise when the first Turkish broker-dealer seeks an exemptive ruling while renegotiation of military basing rights are pending elsewhere in the government, ” wrote Howell E. Jackson, a Harvard law professor, in an article in the same journal.There already is opposition from some concerned with protecting investors. “Technology has advanced faster than political systems, and countries have not yet developed the necessary safeguards to protect investors who cannot protect themselves should the barriers to market access be removed,” wrote George W. Madison and Stewart P. Greene, two lawyers for TIAA-CREF, a money management firm.But the technology has progressed, and the S.E.C. and other regulators are going to have to design an international regulatory regime to deal with the new realities. How well they succeed may determine whether future investors have adequate protection, or whether an international regulatory race to the bottom ends up making it easy for crooks in jurisdictions with little effective regulation to prey on people the world over.'"

"'07-02-10,'0','The original proposal would have given refineries more leeway to average the benzene content across their entire gasoline supply. That would have left some regions, particularly parts of the Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountain States, with benzene levels well above the levels permissible elsewhere, because their gasoline has historically contained more benzene. Objections by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, played a role in the agency’s decision instead to limit the trading program, Mr. Wehrum said.In addition to the new benzene limits for gasoline, the new rule also orders cuts for benzene levels in tailpipe emissions and pungent benzene vapors escaping from gasoline cans.The new standard will cut 19,643 tons of benzene from gasoline when the controls on refiners take effect in four years. In addition, several other rules currently in force will have the side effect of cutting benzene from all of these sources, reducing benzene from its 1999 level of 250,000 tons, the most recent figure available.The agency estimated that the new rule, called the Mobile Source Air Toxics rule, would result in 33,000 tons of reductions by 2015. Those reductions, combined with the additional reductions that were side benefits of other rules, would cut the benzene levels down to 108,000 tons.“Cars and trucks put out a whole toxic soup of pollutants,” Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, one of the two groups that sued the agency, said in an interview. “The administration is going after one of them. Benzene poses a whole host of health risks. It’s a good thing that they strengthened the standard.”But Charles Drevna, the executive vice president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, said the agency had “thrown a curve” by insisting on a ceiling on the amount of benzene in any refinery’s gasoline, which limits the refinery’s ability to use allowances.“Certain areas are going to have a much more difficult time,” Mr. Drevna said, including those refineries in the Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountains.California’s current standard for benzene is already below the new national standard, so that state’s 13 refineries are not affected. Highly industrialized areas like the Northeast and the Chicago area are already required to produce what is known as reformulated gasoline, and so their benzene levels have been reduced somewhat in recent years, though not as much as they will be under the new rule.Mr. Drevna said that a spate of new rules, including a rule making steep cuts in the sulfur content of diesel fuel and a separate rule reducing the sulfur content of gasoline, have put a burden on refiners.Mr. Wehrum, of the federal agency, said the trading program was designed “to allow the flexibility for industry to find the most cost-effective place to spend.”For Mr. Drevna, it was not flexible enough.For Marti Sinclair of the Sierra Club, which was also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, it was too much.“We are happy that E.P.A. has addressed this important public health issue at last,” Ms. Sinclair said in a statement, adding, “It is disappointing that E.P.A. would undermine its own program by adopting this dangerous trading scheme.”'"
"'07-02-10,'0','“We have made quite clear to them that it’s not directed at them,” Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said here. “And I think we’ll work our way through it.”A senior Defense Department official traveling with Mr. Gates said an American missile defense program in Europe would be devised to counter Iran’s improving missile arsenal. “They are extending the range of their missiles,” the official said. “It’s a matter of time.”In his comments, Mr. Gates cited reports of a recent visit to India by Mr. Ivanov that quoted the Russian minister as making statements that acknowledged the American “plans here in Europe for missile defense do not threaten Russia nor its strategic deterrent.”Opportunities for United States-Russia military cooperation, and competition, are expected to be discussed further this weekend at an international security conference in Munich, which will feature an address by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Saturday and by Mr. Gates on Sunday.NATO is discussing in broad terms whether and how to move forward with a regional missile defense system, and Russia’s objections are not focused on that alliance program. Russia is not a NATO member, but participates in a NATO-Russia Council that meets during alliance sessions.Russian officials do express alarm, however, at the American ballistic missile defense system, and Moscow’s arguments have grown louder since the United States entered bilateral talks with Poland and the Czech Republic, two of the newer NATO allies, about basing parts of a missile defense system on their soil. Kremlin leaders have long said that an effective missile defense system could set off a new nuclear arms race.American officials say that while no final agreements have been reached, serious technical talks are under way about basing antimissile radar in the Czech Republic and interceptor missiles in Poland.Mr. Ivanov did not describe Moscow’s options to thwart any antimissile system, but Russia’s military laboratories could be expected to add dummy warheads and other blocking materials, known as chaff, to blind or confuse a missile defense system, and do it at relatively modest expense.“We have the capability to surpass any antimissile system,” he said. “It doesn’t mean that we threaten others.”Mr. Gates acknowledged that the United States and Russia “do have differences, there is no doubt about that.”During their conversations at the NATO session, Mr. Gates said, he asked Mr. Ivanov about Russia’s energy export policy; the topic is critical for European nations that fear Russia may turn its oil and gas deliveries on and off to further a political agenda.“I raised energy security and so did a number of other defense ministers,” Mr. Gates said. “And I would say that it was both in the context of protecting supplies from terrorists and others. But also there were references made to manipulation. And I think it was not confrontational, but I think the message was pretty clear.”Mr. Gates, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency who specialized in Soviet issues, had never before met his current Russian counterpart, Mr. Ivanov, whose previous assignments included senior positions with Moscow’s spy service operating in Africa.“We commented on two old intelligence guys getting together,” Mr. Gates said afterward.'"

Those alternative private investments are limited to the very wealthy and to large institutional investors like pension funds and university endowments.Class A shares of Fortress closed at $31, after touching a high of $37, up 67.6 percent from an offering price of $18.50.The reception for Fortress, which also manages private equity funds, was the second-best for an initial public offering of a financial company since 2001.Its performance was topped only by the November initial public offer of Nymex, the parent of the New York Mercantile Exchange, which rose 125.4 percent on its first day, according to Thomson Financial.'"
"'07-02-10,'0','The inspector general’s report found that while the Feith team did not violate any laws or knowingly mislead Congress, it made dubious interpretations of intelligence reports and shared them with senior officials without making clear that its findings had already been discounted or discredited by the main intelligence agencies.“The actions, in our opinion, were inappropriate, given that all the products did not clearly show the variance with the consensus of the intel community, and in some cases were shown as intel products,” Mr. Gimble told the Armed Services Committee in a hearing on Friday.That set off a two-hour partisan clash. Democrats argued that the report showed intelligence had been manipulated to justify an invasion of Iraq, and Republicans insisted that Mr. Feith’s office did nothing wrong by reaching conclusions that differed from those of the main intelligence agencies and presenting them to higher-ups, who had asked for the re-examination in the first place.Senator Levin, who has long been a leading critic of Mr. Feith’s role, called the report “a devastating condemnation of inappropriate activities” by Mr. Feith. But Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, responded, “I don’t think in any way that his report can be interpreted as a devastating condemnation.”Mr. Gimble said formal intelligence findings did not corroborate some of the Pentagon’s assertions: that Mr. Hussein’s government and Al Qaeda had a “mature symbiotic relationship,” that it involved a “shared interest and pursuit of” unconventional weapons and that there were “some indications” of coordination between Iraq and Al Qaeda on the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.The briefers from Mr. Feith’s office should have noted their departures from the formal consensus findings of intelligence agencies, Mr. Gimble said.Representative Ike Skelton, a Democrat from Missouri and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Mr. Feith’s office exercised “extremely poor judgment for which our nation, and our service members in particular, are paying a terrible price.”Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, noted that Mr. Feith’s superiors at the Pentagon had asked him to re-examine intelligence on links between Iraq and Al Qaeda. Therefore, Mr. Sessions said, there was no need for the briefers to point out that their conclusions differed from those of the C.I.A., because the briefing was intended as a “critique” of the agencies’ conclusions.A similar argument has been made in a formal rebuttal to the inspector general that was prepared by Mr. Feith’s successor at the Pentagon.'"
"'07-02-10,'0','“It is a real difficult challenge for us culturally across the country to be in a place where we can talk about ourselves,” Ms. Johnson said. “But it is something that we need to do.”In recent years, the Oneidas have spent more than $1 million to form their media conglomerate. The goal is to influence perceptions about American Indians as well as political decisions about tribal issues, said Ray Halbritter, chief executive and representative of the Oneida Nation.“The experience of Native American people in this country is one of being colonized. Now we’re in a position where we have the desire to be independent, but we’re still at the mercy of the larger society,” he said. “The perceptions of us are critical.”The tribe has been looking for ways to improve its relationships with local landowners since it began filing lawsuits over land rights in federal court in 1970. Early suits contended that 250,000 acres sold to New York in the early 19th century was an illegal transaction. Years of court battles followed, creating longstanding friction.The tribe has lost several suits but has bought back 17,370 acres from landowners, including a cornfield in Verona where it built the Turning Stone Resort and Casino. Today, the tribe reports annual revenue of more than $400 million, the bulk of which comes from gambling, according to a report filed with the Bureau of Indian Affairs.The Oneidas have applied to place that land into federal trust, which would make it exempt from state and local laws. Local officials want to collect more than $350 million in property taxes from the tribe, an amount the tribe is contesting.For decades, the Oneidas have poured their profits back into businesses, including 17 gas stations and a championship golf course, and programs that assist their members with housing and education. But in recent years, Mr. Halbritter has also turned the tribe’s attention — and money — toward multimedia productions.“We want to create products,” he said. “We want to become more relevant and human to people, not just stereotypical memories.”Today, the two-story house in Vernon that is home to Four Directions Productions has hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment, including high-definition video cameras.Mr. Rood, the studio director, is the only Oneida among its 10 employees.“When I saw the ad for an HD studio in this area, I was floored,” said Tracy Morse, 49, of Rochester, who is the studio’s director of photography. “I jumped at the opportunity.”On a recent Wednesday, Mr. Morse viewed on two large computer screens unedited scenes from a music video for a remix by Jana, a folk singer who is a member of the Lumbee and Tuscarora tribes of North Carolina.“It was originally a ballad, and now they’re going to use this video in clubs in Las Vegas, New York and L.A.,” Mr. Morse said.In December, the second album from the tribe’s recording studio, Standing Stone Records, produced for Jana, received a Grammy nomination for Best Native American Music Album.The short animated film the tribe is producing tells of a raccoon who feigns death along a riverbank in hopes of luring a colony of crayfish ashore. One crayfish falls for the trick and brags to others that he killed the raccoon. When the rest of the colony comes ashore to see his “kill,” the raccoon springs alive and eats all of them.Ms. Johnson, of the National Congress of American Indians, said the Oneidas’ work may open doors for tribes across the country.“We have not been involved in the media in a large extent, so the industry has been controlling the message,” Ms. Johnson said. “It’s better that a tribe tells the stories rather than Walt Disney.”'"
"'07-02-10,'0','And during a conference call with analysts last week, Jonathan Rosenberg, senior vice president for product management at Google, said the radio test was “pretty robust in terms of scope.”“I believe we had over 700 radio stations in more than 200 metros in the network,” Mr. Rosenberg said, according to a transcript of the call published by Thomson Financial.But radio analysts said that they were not impressed by the numbers themselves, stressing that Google’s access to air time may be limited, by and large, to what the industry calls “remnant inventory” — ad time sold at the last minute and at low prices.Many analysts say that Google has been trying to sign a large inventory deal with CBS Radio, whose network of 147 radio stations is among the largest in the country, but that negotiations have taken longer than expected and no deal has been announced yet.A spokeswoman for CBS Radio declined to comment. Ryan Steelberg did not respond to an e-mail message and phone calls seeking comment, and Chad Steelberg could not be reached for comment.Google’s success in radio is important, in part, because the company’s lofty valuation is partly based on investors’ expectations that it will be able to expand beyond its core Internet advertising business to media like radio, newspapers and even television.Success is important for the Steelbergs, too. Google paid $102 million in cash for dMarc, and agreed to pay as much as $1.14 billion over three years, depending on how well the company meets certain performance targets.Google’s relationship with one radio network suggests that speculation about its inventory problems is accurate and that the company faces challenging negotiations with others besides CBS.During a conference call with analysts last month, Rick Cummings, president of Emmis Radio, described the airtime it had made available to Google as “remnant inventory.” Emmis owns 23 stations in major markets and was one of the first radio networks to work with dMarc.“The Google folks have expressed an interest in doing more business with us and in some prime inventory,” said Mr. Cummings, according to a transcript of the call. “We’ve said we’re happy to discuss it so long as the money is there and the price is right. That remains to be seen. That’s really up to them.”Analysts say they expect Google will eventually find a way to make deeper inroads into radio.“I would assume that someone in the industry will eventually sell Google some inventory,” said Jonathan Jacoby, a broadcasting analyst with Banc of America Securities.

"'07-02-10,'0','WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 (AP) — A federal appeals court on Friday blocked the Pentagon from transferring an American citizen to an Iraqi court to face charges that he supported terrorists and insurgents.A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia unanimously ruled that the man, Shawqi Omar, a citizen of both Jordan and the United States who once served in the Minnesota National Guard, had a right to argue for his release before a United States court.By a 2-to-1 vote, the panel also upheld an injunction issued last year by Judge Ricardo M. Urbina of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia that barred the American military from turning Mr. Omar over for trial in an Iraqi court.Mr. Omar was captured in Iraq in 2004 by American forces during a raid on associates of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of the insurgent group called Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, who was killed in an American airstrike last year. Mr. Omar is imprisoned at Camp Bucca, in southern Iraq. He has been held in several camps for more than two years without formal charges and, his family says, without access to counsel.The United States military says that Mr. Omar was harboring insurgents and had bomb-making materials at the time of his arrest.Lawyers for Mr. Omar’s family say he is innocent and likely to be tortured if handed over to the Iraqi government.'"
"'07-02-10,'0','MOSCOW, Feb. 8 — Chevron intends to bid for assets of Yukos, the bankrupt oil producer, Russian officials said Friday. If Chevron succeeds, such an acquisition could help close the final chapter on the downfall of Russia’s largest oil company.Chevron, based in San Ramon, Calif., declined to comment on the assertion by two Russian officials — including the chief executive of Gazprom, Russia’s natural gas monopoly — that American companies were interested in participating in an auction of Yukos assets. The second official, a bankruptcy receiver, identified Chevron as one of those companies.The company’s participation would be contentious; it would add a sense of legitimacy to an auction critics say amounts to little more than a grab for assets stolen over the last three years from Yukos shareholders, including holders of the Yukos American depository receipts traded on the New York Stock Exchange.Russian officials say tax fraud and embezzlement brought down Yukos and that the bankruptcy auction is legal under Russian law.The bid by Chevron, if it happens, illustrates some of the ethical choices and political complexities that American oil companies are forced to navigate these days as they search for scarce reserves of oil in foreign countries.'"
"'07-02-10,'0','“It is inherently preposterous to make this system work,” said Jon Twitchell, a transportation consultant in San Francisco who fought construction of the original monorail on behalf of a consortium of opponents, including nonparticipating casino-resorts and homeowners along the route. “Transit has not paid for itself in this country since 1945. It is always publicly subsidized. Eventually, the public will end up paying to prop this up.”That has not happened so far, but the latest numbers are bleak. December was the monorail’s worst month, with 18,197 riders per day, far below the 53,000 predicted by studies used to sell the bonds to investors and to persuade public officials to give up public right of way. Despite a management shakeup in mid-2005 that purged the company of its founding executives, the system’s average ridership plunged 31 percent in 2006, to 19,219 per day.The company’s new chief executive, Curtis L. Myles III, said that drop was somewhat anticipated after fares were raised in December 2005 to $5 a ride from $3. That move increased revenues by 4 percent, to $31.4 million for the year, still far short of the $44.9 million needed to break even. The total cost of the system per year is about $61 million; the monorail receives about $16 million in advertising revenues from companies like Sprint, which is about to start providing wireless Internet access on the trains and has a 15,000-square-foot store at the convention center stop.Mr. Myles acknowledged in an interview that the company’s cash reserves, estimated by Fitch at about $89 million, would run dry by 2010 if revenues did not improve. To break even, he said, the monorail would need to increase ridership by about 50 percent.Critics fear that if the monorail goes bankrupt, the public will be forced to pay to run a system that exists to shuttle casino patrons, not local residents. Mr. Twitchell and others warned of such an outcome from the start, but Mr. Myles insisted the bondholders would merely sell off the assets to cover the debt and that there was a fund set aside to demolish the tracks.All this is grim talk for a monorail that opened in July 2004 with a lavish party that included huge buffets at all stops and the governor’s taking the inaugural ride flanked by navel-baring showgirls, a Prince impersonator and the comic Rita Rudner.The technical problems started almost immediately. The following month, passengers were frightened when a technician opened the doors on the wrong side of the elevated tracks; a month later, pieces fell off the trains twice. No one was injured, but the system was shut down for 14 weeks. It has operated largely trouble-free since that reopening.Still, Mr. Myles said, the monorail took a public relations hit.“Whenever you open a new business, especially something in Las Vegas that’s tourism related, you expect a bump in ridership to come from the fact that it’s new,” he said, “but they had to shut it down for three months.”Expected ticket-selling partnerships with some resorts on the route did not materialize, Mr. Myles said, nor did a plan to make it possible for hotel guests to charge monorail fares to their rooms.“If the monorail executives have ideas that they want to bring to the hotel community, then they ought to,” said Alan M. Feldman, spokesman for the MGM Grand casino-hotel where the system originates. “At the same time, the hotel’s job in terms of marketing isn’t to sell monorail tickets.”Others say the monorail’s design is problematic because it bypasses several resorts, including Bellagio, Mirage, Caesars Palace, Venetian and Wynn Las Vegas, the last two because neither would spend the millions required to build a station and connecting halls.“We’ve been here three days, and we just found out about the train,” said Michael New, 26, of Sydney, Australia, riding it with his girlfriend, Julie Tanswell, 25. “We knew it was here, but we could never find it, and everyone we talked to told us to take the bus.”Mr. Myles said the coming marketing efforts would raise ridership in the short term to keep the company from defaulting on the debt before the airport extension was built.But even those who agree that the airport link may help foresee problems.“The only way the monorail could ever be a success is if it went to the airport,” said Steve Sebelius, a Las Vegas blogger and editor of the weekly newspaper CityLife who has attacked the monorail since its inception, “but who’s going to buy these bonds when they’re totally private, subject to default and the performance of the train is so poor?”The monorail could face more financial headaches this spring as the Nevada Tax Commission reviews its sales tax exemption to the system on the grounds that it was performing a public service. One commissioner, George Kelesis, said the system offered no discounts for students or people who are disabled.“Why should they be exempted from the taxes?” Mr. Kelesis said. “The purpose of the monorail is to benefit eight casinos.”But Mr. Myles said that Nevadans who showed state identification could ride the train for $1 and that even at its current ridership levels, the system was relieving traffic congestion.“This company is providing 20,000 transit trips a day in the resort corridor,” Mr. Myles said. “If it wasn’t here, those trips would be taking place on the streets.”'"
"'07-02-10,'0','The United States was in a familiar spot yesterday, scrambling in a Davis Cup match played on clay.James Blake lost to Tomas Berdych, 6-1, 2-6, 7-5, 7-5, leaving the United States tied at 1-1 with the Czech Republic. Andy Roddick defeated the Davis Cup rookie Ivo Minar, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, to give the United States the early lead in the first-round World Group series in Ostrava, Czech Republic.Bob and Mike Bryan will face Lukas Dlouhy and Pavel Vizner in doubles today, with reverse singles tomorrow.The United States has not won a Davis Cup World Group match on clay in a decade.The 12th-ranked Berdych took advantage of a disputed line call to finish off the sixth-ranked Blake. In the fifth game of the fourth set, Blake was convinced he had a break when Berdych appeared to double fault. Blake said he was penalized by the umpire for continuing to play the point. Berdych saved that break point and came back to win the game.“We agree the ball was out,” Blake said. “He said I didn’t stop fast enough. In his judgment I reacted to the ball,” keeping the rally alive. “Maybe next time I will sit down on the court.”Blake regrouped and was serving to tie the set at 6, but a double fault coupled with Berdych’s winners sealed the victory.In other group play, visiting Russia, the defending champion, leads Chile, 2-0, after Fernando Gonzalez lost on clay for the first time since his Davis Cup debut nine years ago, upset by Igor Andreev, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2.Also taking 2-0 leads were Sweden (at Belarus), France (home against Romania), Argentina (at Austria) and Belgium (home against Australia).'"
"'07-02-10,'0','Much about the New York shows always feels superfluous — a lot wouldn’t cut the mustard in Milan or Paris — and maybe that’s because of the showbiz element. Watching the parade of Russian peasant finery at Vera Wang on Thursday, you half expected Barbra Streisand in a skullcap to burst out with “The Way He Makes Me Feel.”And then there is Zac Posen. It isn’t just that Mr. Posen had the television stars Rachel Bilson and Nicole Ritchie at his show on Thursday night, as well as a woman who brought along her pet in a portable Louis Vuitton kennel. He also makes the kind of pertly feminine clothes that seem on the verge of tapping their way onto a Broadway stage.Any time a fashion designer goes off in the direction of the Russian Revolution, he or she might as well issue a disclaimer that says don’t take me seriously. The romance of that period has been well covered — another babushka, another bushy eyebrow, what’s the difference — and the real terror is too ghastly to trivialize with a nicely cut gabardine jodhpur.Ms. Wang’s stylized Russian story was fairly lugubrious. In a way, her problem is that she has too much information, and at the same time, she is not an original-thinking designer. Everything interests her: workers’ tunics, Russian constructivism, military insignia.Yet she lacks the imagination and courage to create something wholly original in ready-to-wear. She is continually defeated by her own eye, which is a magazine editor’s eye. This is wonderful for creating visual effects, like pairing models in their sweet-looking Cossack wear. But it prevents her from taking risks. It is as though she has convinced herself, as a former editor, that her own work can never be as good as the great designers.Ralph Lauren and many other untrained designers could tell her differently. They could tell her that it’s enough to see one’s world directly and simply, as Mr. Lauren has done with his now-iconic evocations of the American West. Ms. Wang, though, spends too much time looking at other designers’ work, and with envy, one feels.'"
"'07-02-10,'0','And while cash cards have proved popular during Christmas, a gift card, even one festooned with red hearts, does not quite seem appropriate for this romantic occasion.The question of how much of a premium is reasonable in gift-giving recently nagged at a blogger who writes about local food at the DallasFood.org site. In a 10-part series that can only be called investigative blogging, he tried to justify Noka’s price. He analyzed the marketing of the chocolate with lawyerlike logic and came to the conclusion there was little special about it. He noted that the company, just as other chocolatiers do, buys bulk chocolate, called couverture, from chocolate makers, who process the cacao. But while truffle makers like Michael Recchiuti or Michel Cluizel charge a mere $80 or $85 a pound for their treats, the markup for Noka could be as much as 50 times the wholesale cost of the couverture, the blogger estimated.Through taste-testing and some deduction, he guessed that the source of the Noka chocolate is Bonnat, a French chocolate maker. A consumer can also find a Bonnat chocolate bar in stores for about $7.50, or $34 a pound. (Noka is hardly the most expensive chocolate. A Forbes.com survey gave that honor to a shop in Norwalk, Conn., Chocopologie by Knipschildt Chocolatier, for its slightly more pricey $2,600-a-pound bonbons that have unusual ingredients like pink peppercorns or crystallized violets.)Heavily trafficked sites like BoingBoing.net, Chowhound.com and Slashdot org publicized the exposé on the little-known DallasFood blog. The report has had 750,000 page views since the story went up in December and has been passed from chocophile to chocophile. A clerk at Fog City News, a San Francisco magazine and chocolate store, laughed when asked if she carried Noka chocolates. “Haven’t you read the posting about that on DallasFood.org?” she asked.Katrina Merrem and her husband, Noah Houghton, who started Noka three years ago in their Dallas-area apartment, took umbrage at the attack. They will not reveal the source of their chocolate, though most chocolatiers brag about that. Mr. Houghton said, “The couverture is made specially for us.”The couple, both former accountants, do not add flavorings to their chocolates, which are identified by the country of origin and which, they say, each come from a single estate. “Our focus is on the pure natural flavor of the cacao,” Mr. Houghton said. In other words, it is pretty much the chocolate they get from the wholesaler, just molded into little pieces.He said the product’s value was also in the “total gifting experience” with brushed stainless steel boxes available at Neiman Marcus stores and a distinctive logo that belies the company’s origins in a one-bedroom apartment in Plano, Tex.Like the premium ice cream Häagen-Dazs (created in the Bronx), which sounded foreign and expensive, the Noka logo has exotic typography: capital N, small o (with a macron over it), capital K, capital A in a meshing of the owners’ first names. “On the gift end, no one was really doing justice to the gifting experience,” Mr. Houghton said.To succeed in the luxury good market, he said, “the value people are getting must be there.”DallasFood.org saw it differently. “If you or your gift recipient are rich, stupid and vain, Noka is probably the way to go,” it said.But not so fast. There might be some rationale here for springing for at least something more than the Whitman sampler at Walgreens. Most economists would say that giving gifts, other than cash, makes no economic sense. The recipient would be better off spending the money on something he or she values.Joel Waldfogel, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, gained considerable attention from his 1993 paper in The American Economic Review titled “The Deadweight Loss of Christmas.” He argued that people valued a gift as much as a third less than if they had been given the same amount of cash to spend on themselves.He shed some light on why people give extravagant gifts. “It’s like food stamps,” Mr. Waldfogel said, because the government antipoverty program is intended to get people to buy food, which they might choose not to do if given cash.A luxury gift is similar, he said. “Suppose it is something they wouldn’t buy for themselves,” Mr. Waldfogel said. “You are forcing them to consume something luxurious. You are saying: ‘I don’t care what you want. This is what I want you to have.’ ”There could, however, be some value in giving an expensive gift. Bradley J. Ruffle, an economics professor at Ben-Gurion University in Israel, said gifts were a way to establish a relationship. The economic term is “signaling,” jargon for showing a person that you care at a very high cost to yourself. “Giving a diamond ring when you are getting engaged is a similarly extravagant and wasteful gift,” he said. But it signals serious intent.In some American Indian tribes, a ceremony to initiate relations with another tribe included the burning of the tribe’s most valuable possession, Mr. Ruffle said. “Why? It’s a signal that you’d go to the extreme cost to maintain the relationship.”In short, what an expensive gift really shows is that the giver and recipient do not know each other all that well. The gift is an attempt to convey the information: “Hey, I’m O.K.” It is a time-saving way to establish a relationship without going through the drawn-out process of a series of thoughtful gestures.There may be other benefits, said Mr. Ruffle, who studies economic puzzlers like gift giving and religious belief. A gift carries with it emotional costs and benefits. The recipient has an expectation of what the giver will deliver. If the gift fails to exceed expectations, then the recipient is at an emotional loss, as the giver could be. And there could be other consequences like a certain chill in the air. But if the gift is well received, the giver can take pride in that and win an emotional benefit.Gifts can also save the recipient time, another benefit. If the recipient cannot get to a place selling a desired product or has not done the necessary research to know what product to buy, a gift saves that person time. Mr. Ruffle, for instance, buys unique dolls for his niece back in Canada during travels around the world and would consider buying a high-tech device for his technophobe mother that would make her life easier.“It is still wasteful,” Mr. Ruffle said. But it might make you feel less guilty about splurging for the roses, a bottle of port or a dinner out.FOLLOW-UP: Tax season is a good time to buy a shredder because the office supply retailers discount them to lure customers into their stores.You do not need a model that chops paper into the tiniest of confetti. A machine that simply shreds and crosscuts will do the trick. It is better to look for a machine that shreds multiple sheets of paper and is not too top-heavy.'"
"'07-02-10,'0','I was cruising through Borders, looking for a copy of “Nostromo.”Suddenly I was swimming in pink. I turned frantically from display table to display table, but I couldn’t find a novel without a pink cover. I was accosted by a sisterhood of cartoon women, sexy string beans in minis and stilettos, fashionably dashing about book covers with the requisite urban props — lattes, books, purses, shopping bags, guns and, most critically, a diamond ring.No, I realized with growing alarm, chick lit was no longer a niche. It had staged a coup of the literature shelves. Hot babes had shimmied into the grizzled old boys’ club, the land of Conrad, Faulkner and Maugham. The store was possessed with the devil spawn of “The Devil Wears Prada.” The blood-red high heel ending in a devil’s pitchfork on the cover of the Lauren Weisberger best seller might as well be driving a stake through the heart of the classics.“Penis lit versus Venus lit,” said my friend Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, who was with me. “An unacceptable choice.”“Looking for Mr. Goodbunny” by Kathleen O’Reilly sits atop George Orwell’s “1984.” “Mine Are Spectacular!” by Janice Kaplan and Lynn Schnurnberger hovers over “Ulysses.” Sophie Kinsella’s “Shopaholic” series cuddles up to Rudyard Kipling.Even Will Shakespeare is buffeted by rampaging 30-year-old heroines, each one frantically trying to get their guy or figure out if he’s the right guy, or if he meant what he said, or if he should be with them instead of their BFF or cousin, or if he’ll come back, or if she’ll end up stuck home alone eating Häagen-Dazs and watching “CSI” and “Sex and the City” reruns.'"

"'07-02-11,'0','“We competed, but we hurt ourselves,” said Jamal Crawford, who had 6 turnovers and lost Fisher on the final play. Crawford also missed a final chance to tie the score, as time expired before he could get off a runner at the end of overtime.Coach Isiah Thomas — whose job depends on showing the evident progress demanded by team ownership — was fuming. Thomas, his jaw tight, delivered an abrupt and vague postgame statement.“This is going to be really quick, fellas; I have absolutely no comment on tonight’s game,” Thomas said. He then walked away from the pack of reporters and toward the team bus.It was the first time all season that Thomas declined to take questions after a game. He appeared to be trying to contain his anger and avoid a possible fine. Thomas was clearly incensed late in overtime when David Lee failed to draw a foul on a dunk. Lee was called for a technical foul on the play for complaining about the noncall. A livid Thomas jumped up and down on the sideline and was fortunate not to be called for a technical foul himself.Lee dunked with 1:51 left in overtime to cut the Jazz’s lead to 99-97. Lee claimed he was fouled by Mehmet Okur on the play and gestured toward the referee Leon Wood. Lee made his complaint a little too emotionally, however, and Wood called him for the technical foul.Fisher hit the technical free throw, and Paul Milsap followed with a layup to give the Jazz a 102-97 lead. The Knicks tied the score again at 102-102 on Quentin Richardson’s 3-pointer with 22.3 seconds left. But the impact of the Lee technical, and the lack of the foul, had already been felt.“I’m not a guy that plays with a big ego or anything like that,” Lee said. “Everybody makes mistakes, and in my opinion, they made a mistake on that play.”Lee said he quickly apologized to Wood. “It was me that was at fault. My emotions got out of control,” he said.James L. Dolan, the Madison Square Garden chairman, who demanded “evident progress” of Thomas, was in the stands for the game, adding an extra air of importance, and perhaps pressure, to the game.Okur led the Jazz with 29 points. Crawford had 29 points and 10 rebounds. Curry had 27 points and 8 rebounds but had 8 turnovers.It was that kind of night for the Knicks, who opened a three-game trip that leads into the All-Star Game break.After blowing a 10-point lead in the final minutes of the fourth quarter, the Knicks had a 93-90 lead with about two minutes to play. Crawford tried to force a pass inside for a turnover and Okur scored on a driving 8-footer to tie the score at 93-93 with 12.7 seconds left.Crawford missed an off-balance 3-pointer at the regulation buzzer, then ripped off his headband in anger, apparently contending he was fouled by Fisher. Crawford, usually the Knicks’ best clutch player, also missed a runner down the stretch before Okur tied the score.Steve Francis, playing for the first time since Dec. 29, had 13 points in 21 minutes as a reserve. The Knicks had another new look Saturday — every player wearing an orange headband.The 23-victory mark had merited much discussion but was not given much weight by the team.“Me personally, I place no significance in that number,” Thomas said before the game. “I won’t belittle the progress that has been made in terms of the team and how we’re playing and where we’re going, considering where we started from,” he added. “But to say that will be the end of it, that would be unacceptable to me.”Scott Layden, the former Knicks general manager, said he was enjoying life as an assistant for Utah’s Jerry Sloan. If he thinks much about the Knicks, and what has happened since the team fired him three years ago, he will not say. And while Isiah Thomas frequently derides the roster he inherited, Layden will not touch the issue. “When I left New York, I told Jim Dolan — I gave him my word — I will not talk to the media, either on or off the record, about my time with the Knicks. I’ve stayed true to my word,” Layden said. ... The return of Steve Francis pushed Nate Robinson — once a rotation fixture — further down the depth chart at guard. He seems unlikely to get much playing time behind Stephon Marbury, Jamal Crawford and Francis. JErome James started his third straight game at power forward but picked up two early fouls and played only four minutes. David Lee started the second half in his place.'"
"'07-02-11,'0','ESSEN, Germany, Feb. 10 — Finance ministers from the world’s leading economies put the $1.4 trillion hedge fund industry firmly on the international policy agenda on Saturday, saying they would scrutinize the sector closely with an eye toward encouraging more self-regulation.Representatives from the Group of 7 nations, who met in the industrial center of the host country, Germany, issued a statement saying that the practices of hedge funds, which have drawn growing concern from financial policy makers over the last few years, have “become more complex and challenging” in light of the industry’s prominence and volatility.“Given the strong growth of the hedge fund industry and the instruments they trade, we need to be vigilant,” the ministers said in their statement. “We therefore agreed to further pursue the issue.”Hedge funds, which manage vast pools of capital and operate largely outside regulatory scrutiny, have grown to become some of the largest and most important players in markets around the world, particularly on Wall Street and in London. On Friday, the Fortress Investment Group, the first hedge fund in the United States to go public, saw its shares rise 67.6 percent on the first day of trading.At the meeting on Saturday, even the United States Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr. — whose former firm, Goldman Sachs, profits immensely from its relationship with hedge funds — said hedge funds needed more attention from policy makers.'"

"'07-02-11,'0','LJUBLJANA, Slovenia, Feb. 9 — Acting against the wishes of the United Nations Security Council, the Bosnian government said Friday that it would review the status of almost 800 federal and local police officers that the United Nations barred from working in 2002.In a challenge to the United Nations, Bosnian officials said a commission was examining whether police officers were unfairly barred from employment, either on the grounds that they might have committed crimes during the 1992-1995 civil war, or on the grounds that they were not properly qualified.The officers were dismissed in 2002 as the United Nations mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina was ending. The United Nations had a mandate to overhaul the country’s police forces after the war, but only five months to check the backgrounds of the officers. The government argues that the review performed by the United Nations was flawed and rushed, and that many officers could not appeal the dismissals.The officers have gained widespread support among Bosnia’s three main ethnic groups. But the issue also has taken on a broader significance because a number of international authorities have backed the government and said mistakes were made by the United Nations during the vetting process. The government’s previous demands of the United Nations to re-examine the vetting process have been supported by the office of the High Representative, Christian Schwarz-Schilling of Germany, who is Bosnia’s most-senior international official, as well as Europe’s main human-rights authority, the Council of Europe.The criticisms go to the heart of the United Nations mission here and the broad freedoms it had in exerting its powers.'"
"'07-02-11,'0','“We have had gay bishops and gay clergy for millennia,” she said. “The willingness to be open about that is more recent.”She said that what she wanted to convey to her fellow primates was that despite the highly-publicized departure of some congregations (a spokesman said 45 of 7,400 have left and affiliated with provinces overseas), the Episcopal Church has the support of most members, who are engaged in worship and mission work, and not fixated on this controversy.“A number of the primates have perhaps inaccurate ideas about the context of this church. They hear from the voices quite loudly that this church is going to hell in a handbasket,” she said. “The folks who are unhappy represent a small percentage of the whole, but they are quite loud.”In the global picture, however, those unhappy with the Americans are a significant bloc, and some are ready to cut off the American branch of the Anglican Communion. Conservatives were emboldened recently when an influential bishop, N. T. Wright of Durham, England, said in an interview, “Even if it means a bit of pruning, the plant will be healthier for it.”Bishop Jefferts Schori said the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Rowan Williams, had accommodated the conservatives because he also presides over the Church of England, where the conservatives are a more substantial presence than in the United States, and are increasingly assertive.Bishop Jefferts Schori, who is 52, exudes a cool presence, sitting erect in a crimson shirt and white clerical collar. She uses few words to make her points. In her previous career, she was an oceanographer, specializing in squid and octopuses.Ordained a priest only 13 years ago, she is the former bishop of Nevada, where she permitted blessings for gay couples and voted to confirm the Rev. Canon V. Gene Robinson, who is openly gay, as bishop of New Hampshire in 2003. She was elected presiding bishop last June, a nine-year assignment.She said opposition came primarily from a “handful of primates,” led by Archbishop Peter Akinola of Nigeria, with support from those in Uganda and Rwanda. She said they had made it appear as if the bulk of the Anglican Communion was arrayed against the Americans, when that was not the case.“It’s abundantly clear that there’s a diversity of opinion in the provinces of the Communion” she said. Asked why they are not more vocal, she said, “I think that has to be tenderly nurtured. You don’t want to put people in a precarious situation” by encouraging them to speak out against their own primates.One African bishop recently did so. After the House of Bishops in Tanzania voted in December to cut ties to the Episcopal Church and stop accepting its donations, Bishop Mdimi Mhogolo, who leads the Diocese of Central Tanganyika, wrote a letter saying, “The issue of homosexuality is not fundamental to the Christian faith.”At the meeting in Tanzania, Bishop Jefferts Schori is to sit down with the primates of 13 provinces that do not ordain women as priests, not to mention as bishops. But she said her sex was not the reason some primates were preparing to shun her. The problem is that some bishops say the Episcopal Church has failed to repent or to declare a moratorium on gay blessings, steps required by a committee of officials commissioned by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 2004.She is likely to be face to face with Archbishop Akinola, who has created a rival network of conservative churches in the United States.Bishop Jefferts Schori said that if she is rebuked at the meeting, it will not be anything new; she experienced that before as an oceanographer: “The first time I was chief scientist on a cruise, the captain wouldn’t speak to me because I was a woman.”Asked how she would respond if primates walked out on her, she said, “Life is too short to get too flustered.”'"
"'07-02-11,'0','The stock market declined last week on rising oil prices, a disappointing forecast for memory-chip sales and concern that the Federal Reserve might be as likely to raise interest rates as to lower them.The memory-chip forecast came on Friday, when Micron Technologies said prices of the chips it makes for MP3 players and digital cameras were likely to fall more than 30 percent this quarter amid an industry glut. That report depressed the shares of a range of technology companies.On the same day, two Federal Reserve officials said the central bank would raise interest rates if the economy surged and inflation didn’t settle into an acceptable range.And the price of oil briefly rose above $60 a barrel in trading in New York on Friday, closing at $59.89, up from $59.02 the previous week.For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 72.66 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 12,580.83. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 10.33 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 1,438.06. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 16.06 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 2,459.82.

"'07-02-11,'0','Let’s go back to the test analogy for just a second: the prof has left a page out of the test booklet, but you’ll still lose points if you don’t answer every question that was supposed to be on the test.Now you might suspect that Washington’s need to raise money without raising taxes has something to do with the omission of these tax breaks. More than 11 million people claimed the deduction on state and local sales taxes last year — when it was fairly easy to find. Terry L. Lemons, a spokesman for the I.R.S., says there is a reasonable explanation for the omission on this year’s forms: These exemptions were scheduled to expire at the end of the year unless Congress renewed them. With no assurance that the deductions would be extended and with a printer’s deadline at hand, the I.R.S. drew up the forms without the deductions. By the time Congress got around to renewing them, in December, it was too late to alter or reprint the 17 million forms, he said.This news of the missing deductions is being broadcast in clear and forceful press releases. Not from the I.R.S., of course — its announcements about the waylaid deductions tend toward more measured prose, like this one, “I.R.S. Plans Feb. 3 Start Date for Processing Extender Claims.”Others offered more lively descriptions of the problem. “Income Tax Form 1040 Missing Lines for Key Deductions” blared the headline on one of them. It began, “If you thought completing income taxes was confusing before, wait until you fill out your tax returns for 2006.” That snappy item came from the National Association of Tax Professionals, which seemed barely able to suppress its glee at the thought that the I.R.S. was driving more customers to its doors.Mr. Lemons of the I.R.S. said the problem was not as great as it might seem, since fewer people than ever are trying to do their taxes at the kitchen table. Increasingly, he said, people go to tax preparers or file electronically with software that includes the information that is not on the paper forms.Those who do sharpen their pencils, roll up their sleeves and do their taxes on paper can claim the deductions, the I.R.S. says, by following a few simple instructions. All you have to do to claim the deduction for state and local sales taxes on Schedule A of the 1040 is to go to Line 5, “State and local income taxes,” enter “ST” on the dotted line to the left to indicate you are claiming the general sales tax deduction instead of the deduction for state and local income tax, after figuring your deduction with the worksheet and tables in Publication 600.A child could do it.Oh. You also have to sacrifice a newt on a flaming altar that you build in the backyard to specifications laid out in Publication 932, Paragraphs 3 to 6.IN any case, Mr. Lemons said, the problem with getting the word out about the forms was unavoidable. “There are just certain things outside of our control,” he said. “Basically, we’re just trying to do the best we can under the circumstances.”This makes sense. They sent most of the information, after all. How about this? I’ll send the I.R.S. most of the money I owe this year. I’m sure they’ll understand.'"

"'07-02-21,'0','“When I started, my influence was the Hollywood glamour portrait,” Mr. Winokur said. “I thought if I did these very Pop head shots, the color background makes the person stand out. The photographs reveal every detail while telling you nothing about the person except what they present to the camera. You can make up your own story about the person, because that is the only information you have.”He found the backdrops in his first portraits too subtle, so he began experimenting with colored gels and colored paper backdrops, eventually achieving a brighter and more saturated effect.“These days, I mix gels to get more and more colors,” he said. “I guess my love of bright, supersaturated colors has something to do with 1960s Pop Art, and with the keyed-up palette of acrylic paints. In the late 1980s, I began using Cibachrome paper, which made it possible to take these intense colors one step further, introducing a metallic, plastic look.”The simplicity of Mr. Winokur’s visual alphabet derives from the way children are taught to read. “I have young children, so I suppose I’m thinking more about the alphabet these days,” he said. “But I like that alphabets provide a foundation for all reading and writing, and that, similarly, objects — or images — provide a basis for learning and memory.”We look at an object and think of the word it represents: the word “apple” pops into your head when you see Mr. Winokur’s portrait of an apple. That his bright red apple is on an eye-popping green background is a nod to the intensity with which children experience color.“Young children see and recognize objects before they learn their names, or how to say them,” he noted. “My picture alphabet is both a simple alphabet for kids and, I hope, a group portrait of iconic 20th- and 21st-century objects.”His candylike colors add a playful dimension to the sobriety of the objects, which are deceptively simple. He chose them for the ease with which a child might be able to identify them, but they also serve as a catalog of daily staples. Each one is intentionally elementary, “except for the letter Q, which was really hard,” he said. That letter is represented by a playing card, the queen of spades.Mr. Winokur’s work fits into a photographic tradition extending back to the medium’s early days, when the length of an exposure could be an hour, and inanimate objects were the perfect subject.“When I photograph objects, I present them out of context, isolated, divorced from reality,” he said. “I think the intense color of my work makes the artificial presentation even more so. The supersaturated colors make us see the objects in a different light: no longer ‘just’ objects but images to be considered, contemplated, dealt with.”'"
"'07-02-21,'0','Recent merger attempts by EMI and Warner, whose stars include Madonna and Enya, were shelved because of fears that European Union regulators would block a combination. A European court in June annulled an earlier approval of a merger of the Sony Corporation’s Sony Music with BMG, a division of Bertelsmann that was created in 2004. The European Commission is expected to rule in March on a new proposal by SonyBMG, which would be the world’s second-largest music company after Universal Music.Warner Music said today that it had made an approach to EMI on Jan. 24 after the Independent Music Publishers and Labels Association agreed to support a merger of the two companies before the European Commission. Warner said in a statement that it believes the agreement with association improves its chances of getting regulatory approval of a combination.Any merger plan by EMI and Warner would have a bigger chance of succeeding if SonyBMG passes regulatory scrutiny, analysts said.“The industry is having a very bad time now, and regulators may take a more lenient approach,” said Alex DeGroote, an analyst at Panmure Gordon in London.Sales at both EMI and Warner have slumped over the last year. EMI, based in London, said last Wednesday that it was experiencing an “unprecedented level of market decline.”The company’s music catalog also includes bands like The Rolling Stones and Arctic Monkeys, but its new releases have not done as well. Sales at its recorded music division are projected to fall 15 percent and earnings are expected to miss analysts’ estimates, the company said last week, partly because of disappointing sales by new artists such as Robbie Williams. EMI reported in November that it had a loss of £30.6 million and said its sales had declined 6.1 percent in the six-month period ending in September 2006, compared with the same period in 2005.Warner Music has also struggled. The company said earlier this month that its net income dropped 74 percent in the three months ending in December from the same period a year earlier on an 11 percent decline in sales. The company said that it had released fewer albums and said that sales were soft in the United States and in Europe. A combination of the two companies may result in costs savings of about £150 million.“There may be some overlapping shareholders pushing for a deal,” said Mr. DeGroote. “Also, there may be some changes now that the two executives who opposed a deal have left.”In January, EMI ousted Alain Levy, chief executive of the recorded music division, and David Munns, the unit’s vice chairman. Eric L. Nicoli, the parent’s chief, assumed their responsibilities.EMI said it will consider any proposal that focuses on improving its business risks and that creates new value through a combination. A spokeswoman for EMI declined to comment further.EMI and Warner Music also tried to merge companies in 2000, but regulators opposed the plan. EMI launched a second attempt to buy Warner Music in 2003, but failed when a group led by Edgar Bronfman Jr. won the bidding for Time Warner Inc.’s music unit.'"

"'07-02-22,'0','""It is not directed in any way against Russia,” Mr. Hadley told news agencies. “It is directed to certain countries that are developing both ballistic missiles and have shown a desire to pursue nuclear weapons.”At a packed briefing for foreign reporters in Washington, Lt. Gen. Henry A. Obering III, director of the United States Missile Defense Agency, used slides and videos to try to explain that the small number of interceptors meant to be installed in Poland — 10, in an area the size of a football field — could hardly threaten Russia.The associated radar facility planned for the Czech Republic would be able to track at most a few Russian missiles, he said, and the interceptors in Poland could not begin to counter thousands of Russian warheads.The debate escalated after the Russian missile commander, General Nikolai Y. Solovtsov, threatened Monday to aim Russian weapons at the two East European countries if they allowed the United States to install the antimissile defenses there. American negotiations with the two over details of the planned installations are continuing.The Russian reaction has been stinging. Some analysts believe Russia is concerned about the continued eastward expansion of NATO and the establishment of the first permanent American military base to go into a former Warsaw Pact country.Croatia, Macedonia, Albania and Georgia are hoping for eventual NATO membership. Ukraine is considered a much more distant possibility, partly because its membership would be seen as far more threatening by Moscow.Mr. Hadley, whose trip to Russia had been planned weeks ago, said he saw no grounds for a Russian withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, as Moscow threatened last week in response to the American antimissile plan.But American officials have balanced their conciliatory efforts with a growing pushback to a sharply cooler Russian tone ushered in this month in Munich by President Vladimir V. Putin.Mr. Burns described Mr. Putin’s speech — in which the Russian leader said that the United States was fostering an arms race and had “overstepped its national borders in every way” — as “extraordinary.”Daniel Fried, assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, told journalists at the Foreign Press Center in Washington that he thought Mr. Putin’s message, at least in part, was that “Russia is back as a power in the world.”He said Washington would welcome this so long as it meant “Russia being back as a force for good in the world” and a partner in dealing with Iran, North Korea, Kosovo and terrorism.General Obering, at the same briefing, said that the United States had no plans to expand its East European missile defenses to other countries, and for that matter, no money has been appropriated to do so. The United States is building larger antimissile facilities in Alaska and California to guard against any possible North Korean attack.After the briefing, Mr. Fried was asked whether the United States could accept Russian inspectors at the planned antimissile sites.“We’ve been completely transparent with the Russians” by offering them a series of briefings on the antimissile plan,” including a detailed briefing by General Obering in November, Mr. Fried said. “This is not directed against the Russians.”But, he added, bristling a bit, “You don’t start out by threatening nuclear holocaust against your neighbors.”'"
"'07-02-22,'0','BAGHDAD, Feb. 22 — American troops on a raid near Falluja discovered three car bombs under construction in a bomb-making factory that appeared intended to be used with chemicals, the chief American military spokesman in Baghdad said Thursday.Five of the buildings raided by American forces were packed with munitions and chemicals, he said.The discovery follows three gas attacks in the past month in which insurgents used truck bombs to deploy chlorine, a greenish gas that burns the skin and can be fatal after just a few deep breaths. The latest such bombing on Wednesday in southern Baghdad killed at least two people and wounded 32 others, many exhibiting symptoms of chlorine exposure.The spokesman, Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, described the materials found in the raid as 65 propane tanks and ordinary chemicals, but he did not say any chlorine gas was found. He said the troops found “five complete buildings full of these various types of things to include car bombs that were being assembled and put together with propane tanks.The insurgents’ recent use of chlorine gas in bombings appeared to be a new attempt to heighten fears among Iraqi citizens, he said on CNN.“What we are seeing is a change in tactics, but the strategy has not changed,” General Caldwell said, adding that the recent bombings were a “crude attempt to raise the terror level by taking and mixing ordinary chemicals with explosive devices and instilling that fear within the Iraqi people.”Just west of Falluja in Ramadi, the Anbar provincial capital, American forces fought a fierce battle with insurgents early Thursday morning that officials at the Ramadi hospital said left at least 27 Iraqis dead. Dr. Abdullah Salah said four women and four children were among the dead. Eyewitnesses said at least three homes were attacked by American aircraft.The Associated Press reported that photographs that were made available to it showed “the bodies of two small boys wrapped in one blanket, one with a bloody face, the other ashen and with mud on his mouth, his hands crossed on his chest.” Other pictures showed four or five bodies covered by blankets, and men sifting through rubble that appeared to be the wreckage of one destroyed home.'"

"'07-02-22,'0','Before the Fed can act on interest rates in either direction, analysts said, it needs to have a clear indication that inflation is settling into a pattern, either higher or lower. But since the summer, consumer prices have been fickle, falling, flattening and then rising again.“You can make a reasonable case that maybe inflation goes a little lower, or you can make a reasonable case that maybe it goes a little higher,” the chief economist of MFR, Joshua Shapiro, said. “I think they’re sitting there waiting to see if it breaks. If it breaks decisively one way or the other, then they’ll act.”Minutes from the January meeting of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, released yesterday after the customary three-week delay, indicated that the Fed was not on the verge of any significant shift in tone. “All members agreed that the predominant concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as desired,” the minutes said.They also showed that Fed officials discussed whether their tough tone on inflation was still appropriate and unanimously concluded that it was. All 11 Fed bankers who voted at the meeting agreed that “a change was not warranted at this time.”The Fed still has a lot to be concerned about, as the data released yesterday showed.One factor officials pointed to during the January meeting as a potential obstacle to lower inflation was rising wages.Yesterday, the Labor Department reported that the average earnings for workers in nonmanagement positions continued to advance at a brisk pace. After inflation, average earnings on both a weekly and hourly basis rose 2.1 percent in January. As recently as July, inflation was swallowing wage gains, leaving workers with negative real earnings.The core inflation rate increased 2.7 percent from a year earlier, well above the 1 percent to 2 percent the Fed typically prefers. That reversed a four-month trend when the year-over-year core inflation rate fell or remained flat. After climbing as high as 2.9 percent in September, year-over-year core inflation fell to 2.6 percent in November and December.“Inflation is still sticky, and higher than the Fed wants it to be,” said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist with Bank of America. “And as long as it stays above 2 percent, the Fed is going to continue to express concern about it.”Overall inflation in January was 2.1 percent compared with a year earlier, down from 2.5 percent in December.The Fed meets next on March 21. Most analysts expect it to keep the benchmark short-term interest rate at 5.25 percent, where it has been since August. But, as prices of contracts that allow traders to bet on future interest rates show, traders expect a rate cut before 2008.Sharp rises in the costs of medical care (the most in more than 15 years) and tobacco (the most in almost 5 years) helped elevate core inflation in January, leading some economists to argue that temporary factors were causing an exaggeration of the figures.“At first sight, the jump in January core consumer price inflation seems to signal renewed inflationary vigor,” Kenneth Beauchemin of Global Insight wrote in a research note. But Mr. Beauchemin noted that the price increase for medical care in January was the fastest since 1991.Food prices also rose the fastest in almost two years.On the bright side, there were hints that the outlook for inflation in the long term was improving. Energy prices dropped 1.5 percent in January, after a 4.2 percent increase in December. Housing prices, including rent, rose at a slower pace.When he addressed Congress two weeks ago, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said two major factors in the forecast for lower inflation this year were lower housing and energy costs. And many economists said yesterday that January’s figures alone were not a reason to expect inflation to start rising at a troubling pace. “That’s not going to cause them to run out and panic,” Mr. Shapiro said.But, as Mr. Bernanke has said, there is a degree of uncertainty to the Fed’s forecast.Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook, argued that the January consumer price data should alarm the Fed because it is probably a sign of things to come. A combination of rebounding economic growth, low unemployment and slowing worker productivity will push inflation higher, he said.“Clearly this is not what the Fed wants to see,” he wrote in a research note. “Bernanke has recently testified that core prices had been retreating, but January’s numbers suggest we may have seen the lows for inflation in this cycle.”'"
"'07-02-22,'0','Representatives for Apple and Cisco said other terms of the deal would remain confidential. It is not known if Apple made a cash payment to Cisco, but intellectual property lawyers say some sort of payment is typical in these cases. It is also unclear whether Cisco had sold Apple the name iPhone outright and had then secured permission to use it itself.But the deal appears to give a partial victory to both sides. Apple can begin selling its phone with the name that its strong-willed chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, seemed to prefer.Cisco can also continue to use the name, and with the promise of interoperability, it might have some of the hype and magic surrounding Apple’s products rub off on its own less prominent offerings.Hostilities broke out between the two companies last month, when Mr. Jobs announced the music phone at the annual Macworld convention in San Francisco.Cisco, the networking company based in San Jose, Calif., was using the name to sell phones that can plug into a PC or connect with a wireless hot spot and make free calls over the Internet.The two companies negotiated intensely over the trademark in early January. Executives had planned to make announcements concurrently at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and at Macworld, proclaiming the links between their iPhone products.After talks broke down and Mr. Jobs announced his iPhone anyway, Cisco filed a lawsuit, saying that Apple’s use of the iPhone name constituted a “willful and malicious” violation of Cisco’s intellectual property. In response, Apple called the lawsuit “silly” and noted publicly that several companies besides Cisco were using the iPhone name.Cisco’s lawsuit described covert Apple attempts to obtain the rights to the iPhone name. In September 2006, a corporation calling itself Ocean Telecom Services filed an application for the trademark based on earlier filings in Trinidad and Tobago. In its complaint, Cisco asserted that Apple was behind the efforts.But while they flung legal accusations at each other, both companies faced significant pressure to settle. Apple’s iPhone will be released in June and will be available to customers of the AT&T wireless network, which was formerly known as Cingular Wireless. If Apple had failed to settle with Cisco and subsequently lost the battle in court, it could have been liable for financial penalties for each unit that it sold.But Cisco also faced a strong incentive to reach a deal.“Cisco had to provide access to the trademark to Apple if it wanted to achieve the highest value for the name. There was no potential second buyer who would have equaled Apple’s desire for the iPhone mark,” said Alan Fisch, an intellectual-property lawyer at Kaye Scholer in Washington.He added that Cisco also faced the reality that consumers associated the name more with Apple.“The iPhone name has been informally synonymous with an anticipated Apple phone for years prior to the product’s formal announcement,” he said.'"
"'07-02-22,'0','And so it was, as a small pack of riders, including the overall leader, Levi Leipheimer of the Discovery Channel team, caught the breakaway and then left it behind on the climb, where sections of the road run upward at a leg-sapping 20 percent grade.Although Leipheimer came in second at the finish line, he retained the overall lead by three seconds over Jens Voigt, a German rider for CSC. Voigt jumped to second place over all from 14th, thanks to 13 bonus seconds he earned by finishing first in the stage in 3 hours 43 minutes 44 seconds and in a sprint midway through the day’s ride.Leipheimer now looks like even more of a lock to win the overall title, barring a crash or a failure in Friday’s 14.5-mile time trial in Solvang. He will also have to get through what is expected to be a rainy 133-mile ride down the Pacific Coast Highway Thursday, a 105-mile run from Santa Barbara to Santa Clarita Saturday and Sunday’s 78-mile trip through a circuit of downtown Long Beach.While the Sierra Road climb left Leipheimer in front, it jolted the rest of the field. Rory Sutherland, an Australian rider for the American team Health Net, moved up to third from fourth, but he also fell from five seconds behind Leipheimer to 15 seconds down. Christopher Horner, an American riding for the Belgian team Predictor-Lotto, jumped to fourth place from 26th, 16 seconds behind.Meanwhile, Jason Donald, the first-year professional for Slipstream who was only one second behind Leipheimer for the first three days, finished Wednesday more than three minutes back, falling to 38th place, 3:10 behind the leader.As the climb up Sierra Road steepened, riders began falling out of the back of the pack, unable to keep up. First came the young cyclists from the USA National Development team, then the sprint specialists, who have a hard time in the mountain passes, and then some of the better riders who were not quite in tiptop shape so early in the racing season. A large group of riders finished nearly 10 minutes behind Leipheimer.On the descent, riders tucked into an aerodynamic position and hurtled toward hairpin turns at up to 70 m.p.h. If that seems dangerous, it does not feel half as gut-wrenching as doing the same thing in the back seat of the Toyota-United team car, driven by Jansen.Inside the car with Jansen were Kirk Willett, co-director of the team and a former professional cyclist; Shane Fedon, the team’s chief mechanic; Sean P. Tucker, the owner of the second-year team and a former professional rider; and a reporter.Leipheimer crested the Sierra Road climb with four others — Voigt, Horner, Jason McCartney, also of the Discovery team, and Rabobank’s Robert Gesink. About a minute behind followed a group of about dozen riders, including Toyota-United’s Baldwin, who kept a strong enough pace on the climb to be within striking distance.That group was joined on the descent by 21 other riders, including Toyota-United’s Justin England. As the road flattened for the run into San Jose, those riders worked hard to close the gap on Leipheimer, and the radio kept reading out smaller time gaps as they sped toward the finish line — first 30 seconds, then 20, then 10.They ran out of road, however, finishing four seconds behind Voigt, Leipheimer and Horner.Nevertheless, Jansen could barely contain his glee after the team’s strong finish.“It’s great to have two guys up there,” he said. “It’s a lot to ask to have everybody be in such good shape this early in the season. But Baldwin looks really promising. He could move up to the top 10” in the overall standings.'"
"'07-02-22,'0','But along with the options are months of anxiety-ridden admissions procedures, an ordeal that in some ways rivals the quest for Ivy League colleges and in other ways is the educational equivalent of the annual bridal sale at Filene’s.There are information fairs, tours and open houses — some mandatory, some not. There are tests, interviews, lotteries, auditions and a litany of deadlines. And more change is in the works.The chancellor has said he wants to make more middle school choices available, and to overhaul middle school admissions procedures to make them less haphazard and more equitable, similar to the way the Education Department centralized the admissions process for gifted and talented programs this year.But even as the chancellor’s office works to make the process easier, parents described a system that can reduce adults to tantrums and leave 10-year-olds knotted in stress.“The college application process was not hard,” said Sandra Echols, a Harlem resident and graduate student with three children applying to new schools for next fall — her older son to college, her daughter to middle school and her younger son, Kenyan, 4, to kindergarten outside his home district. “Applying to kindergarten is much more difficult,” she said. “There is much more uncertainty.”Even Clara Hemphill, the lead author of the most definitive guidebooks to the city schools, has found herself struggling through high school admissions this year with her son, Max Snyder, an eighth grader.“You’d think I’d be able to do it without any trouble,” Ms. Hemphill said, describing how at one point she realized that she had signed up for a school’s required tour but not for its required exam. “I would be unable to figure out what each school required for the application.”This month, Max learned that he had been accepted into one of the city’s elite specialized high schools and his top-choice general high school. But the result did not leave Ms. Hemphill glowing about the process.“The public school choice process is a curse and a blessing,” she said. “I can only imagine what happens to 13-year-olds who have parents who can’t devote this kind of time and who aren’t capable of gathering information.”The surge in public school options in the city mirrors a nationwide increase in “choice schools.” The thinking is that failing schools will find it hard to survive if parents can opt out of them.New York City first adopted school choice on a wide scale in the 1970s in response to the decline of many geographically zoned high schools. Before then, students mostly attended school near home, traveling only to attend the elite specialized schools or some vocational programs. Under Mr. Klein, choice has increased exponentially.“Giving people choices is always empowering and almost always will lead to better outcomes for kids,” Mr. Klein said in an interview, adding that he was glad to have had a choice when he was a student between William Cullen Bryant High, his local school, and Bronx Science.And he said students’ choices could indicate when an undesirable school should close. “You want people to vote with their feet and then take appropriate action,” he said.Mr. Klein said that without giving parents a wide array of choices, they could not choose the best school for each child. And he said that replacing large, failing high schools with new, small schools had created appealing alternatives in neighborhoods that long had none: he noted that more than 90 percent of students attending the new, small high schools were black or Hispanic.Deputy Mayor Dennis M. Walcott said the administration had moved aggressively to provide information on admissions but acknowledged that the process could be confusing. “I’d rather have the parents, if they are going to complain, that they complain about the multitude of options,” he said, “versus not having any options or being restricted in their choices.”But some educators say greater school choice primarily benefits students with savvy, motivated parents who are able to spend time figuring out the best schools to list on applications, and puts at a further disadvantage the children with little support at home.“I think it may in the long run offer more opportunity for better education for kids who aren’t getting it,” said Norm Fruchter of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University. “But any choice program or effort gets initially monopolized by people who have the advantages of access and information and the ability to move on what their kids need.”This concern prompted Acorn, the community advocacy group, to create a program providing advice on high school admissions in low-income neighborhoods.And while some parents say they are thrilled to have such a rich menu of options, others complain that it is the schools — not families — who do the choosing.Take general high school admissions. Schools create ranked lists of the children they want, based on criteria like doing well on an audition or having good grades or expressing a special interest by attending an open house. Separately, children list on admissions forms up to 12 schools that they might want to attend. A computer system then makes matches.At the middle school level, by contrast, admission to many schools depends heavily on scores on English and math exams in fourth grade, creating enormous pressure at test time — a year before other admissions rituals like open houses or interviews.“It’s like an SAT for 9-year-olds,” said Julie Drake, a midwife who has two sons in public schools. “It’s crazy.”Charter schools, and some magnet schools, conduct admissions by lottery. But however admissions are conducted, other rules complicate the process. Some schools give geographic priority to students in a certain district, region or borough, while other schools are open to everyone.Most children in New York City still attend neighborhood elementary schools. In some parts of the city, there are still neighborhood middle schools and high schools to fall back on. But in others there are not.The school shopping season is now at its height, with high school results starting to come in, middle school entrance exams and interviews wrapping up, elementary and charter school lotteries taking place and testing for gifted programs nearly complete.While officials cannot say exactly how many students attend school outside their neighborhoods, thousands of seats in scores of elementary and middle schools are now available to children by application rather than through geographic proximity.And high school is now entirely a choice system, with about 100,000 eighth and ninth graders applying each year not just for specialized schools like Stuyvesant but also for the constellation of more than 200 small schools opened in recent years. Students must apply even if they want to attend a traditional neighborhood high school, though admission is guaranteed to any child living within the local zones where such schools still exist.In East Flatbush, Brooklyn, Patricia Joseph, a mother who is a member of the District 17 parents’ council, is fretting about finding a public high school for her 13-year-old son, Kadeem. Although she has been through the process twice before, with her older children, she said she still felt lost. “It’s not any easier,” she said. “There is still so much to do and not enough time.”Junior high school guidance counselors, she said, often do not have sufficient information or do not make it available. And she said that for low-income families like hers, children were at a disadvantage because they could not afford private study courses or tutors ahead of the specialized school entrance test.“Most of the parents cannot afford to pay Kaplan or Princeton Review $1,000,” she said.And while some parents said that the local elementary and middle schools in their neighborhoods were good enough that there was no need to get involved in the admissions race, others said they only wished that were the case.Still others said the effort was worthwhile.“The application process is overwhelming,” said Marcia Lalla, who lives in the Bronx but whose daughter attends one of the new, small high schools in Manhattan. “However, if you and your child do the research, you will be pleased with your choices.”'"
"'07-02-22,'0','And on Wednesday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, who has a prickly relationship at best with Ms. Rice, was quoted in Rossiiskaya Gazeta, the Russian state newspaper, wholly contradicting the American position.“We must acknowledge that these objects are fully suitable to intercept missiles fired from Russian territory,” he said.His colleague, the departing Russian defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, has said that Russia could easily overwhelm the American defenses with a far cheaper system of countermeasures to blind or confuse an antimissile system.During a stopover in Brussels on Wednesday on his way to Moscow, President Bush’s national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, said a missile defense system against Iran “is a reasonable thing to do, it’s something Europe ought to be interested in, it’s something that Russia ought to be interested in.” Iran might even decide not to try to build long-range missiles once the system was in place, he suggested.Ambassador Victoria Nuland, the United States representative to NATO, said Russia had no cause to express surprise, as representatives from Moscow and the European allies were briefed regularly on the project over the past year.In November, the NATO-Russia Council received what Ms. Nuland called “a full technical briefing” from Lt. Gen. Henry A. Obering III, director of the Missile Defense Agency, and Eric S. Edelman, the under secretary of defense for policy.But the administration is concerned about growing criticism of the program. Officials scheduled a briefing by General Obering on Thursday for foreign reporters based in Washington. Joining him will be Daniel Fried, the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs.The antimissile interceptors, General Obering said last month, “are geared toward and are directed toward rogue nation capabilities, obviously not sophisticated ballistic missile fleets such as the Russians have.” He said they “cannot physically catch the Russian ICBMs even if we were trying to target those missiles” because of the short distances and flight times from Russian silos in relation to Poland.The debate began this month with a caustic speech by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who told an audience in Munich that the United States was provoking a new nuclear arms race. He also criticized the expansion of NATO.Senior Bush administration officials attending the security conference in Munich and those back in Washington conferred on the proper response, and they decided to push back — but only gently.Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates rewrote his own speech, delivered a day after Mr. Putin’s, to say that the Russian president’s comments brought a certain nostalgia for a simpler time, but that “one cold war was quite enough.”Angela E. Stent, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University, said the Bush administration had “already been reassessing our policy toward Russia, as we have understood at least since January of 2006 or even before that there is a newly self-confident Russia, a Russia that is awash in petrodollars and a Russia that really feels it can say no and pursue its own interests.”Ms. Stent said the Bush administration was well aware that the Russian agenda on Syria, Hamas, Venezuela and a number of issues parted with Washington’s. But she said it was worth seeking cooperation, in particular on counterterrorism.Before he left for Moscow, Mr. Hadley said there were “a number of areas where Russia and the United States and Europe can cooperate productively, where we have common interests, where we can cooperate and are cooperating.” These include terrorism and nuclear proliferation.But the administration is pressing Moscow on other issues of concern, including its use of its energy resources as a political tool, its crackdown on civil liberties and press freedoms and its pressure on Russia’s southern neighbors, in particular Georgia.'"
"'07-02-22,'0','The company’s decision to list only in Russia, reflecting government policy to support local exchanges, probably limited demand and drove down the price, Mr. Westin said.Before the offer, about 36 percent of Sberbank’s shares were publicly traded; the rest were owned by the Russian Central Bank.The bank, aided by JPMorgan and Credit Suisse, collected nonbinding bids in January and February. It was not clear how many investors would actually purchase shares at the price the board set on Wednesday, leading to uncertainty over how much the offering would bring in.The precise amount raised will not be determined for six weeks, the Russian finance minister, Aleksei L. Kudrin, said, according to Interfax. A Sberbank spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday.Mr. Kudrin said the bank had gathered 230 billion rubles, or $8.8 billion, in bids that were near the asking price.The share float capped a quick rise for Sberbank, a low-key company that is trusted by many Russians because it did not default on depositors during the 1998 financial crisis. The bank operates 20,000 branches, by far the most in Russia.Growth is expected from consumer lending and mortgages, which are starting to catch on in Russia.Russia’s mortgage rate, for example, is 0.2 percent of gross domestic product, Mr. Westin said, citing a study by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. By contrast, the mortgage rate in Estonia is 17 percent of G.D.P. In Hungary, it is 10 percent, and in Croatia, 11 percent.The Eastern European banks developed their markets faster because they privatized earlier and took on foreign partners with expertise in developing retail services.Russian banks, through much of the past decade, were entwined in financial industrial groups owned by oligarchs. Such banks, known here as pocket banks, focused on serving the companies in their group rather than consumers.Sberbank, the state bank, was an exception, and is now well positioned to profit from the growth in mortgage and consumer lending. The bank has vastly outperformed even the fast-moving Russian stock market. In the last year, its stock price has doubled.'"
"'07-02-22,'0','Google will continue to provide the extended bundle of software free to businesses and educational institutions. But it will also offer businesses additional e-mail storage and customer support for an annual fee of $50 a user.By comparison, businesses pay on average about $225 a person annually for Office and Exchange, the Microsoft server software typically used for corporate e-mail systems, in addition to the costs of in-house management, customer support and hardware, according to the market research firm Gartner.Google said initial customers of Google Apps would include a unit of Procter & Gamble and SalesForce.com, a pioneer in the business of delivering software as an Internet service.“We are in the process of phasing out Microsoft Office and Exchange from our company,” said Marc Benioff, the chief executive of SalesForce.com and a frequent Microsoft critic.Google Apps comes at a time of increased competition between Microsoft and Google in a number of areas, including Internet search and advertising and mobile services. And it comes just as corporations are considering whether to upgrade to recently released versions of Microsoft Windows and Office.While most analysts say that businesses will increasingly use software delivered over the Internet and supported by advertising — a formula that Google has mastered — they are split over the threat that Google’s offering represents to Microsoft in the near term.“I think Microsoft should be very concerned about this,” said Rebecca Wettemann, vice president of Nucleus Research.Ms. Wettemann noted that a business may spend about $80,000 on a systems administrator to manage e-mail and desktop office software. For the same amount of money, Google Apps allows a business to support 1,600 users, she noted. Simply in terms of staffing, “this may be a better proposition even if Microsoft were free,” Ms. Wettemann said.Mark R. Anderson, an analyst at Strategic News Service, a technology consulting firm, said Microsoft should worry about Google’s inroads into one of its core businesses but would not see an immediate impact.“These things take years to happen,” Mr. Anderson said. “Google will have to prove itself in terms of security and in terms of quality.”For its part, Google has at times emphasized the competition with Microsoft and at times played it down.Mr. Girouard said Google’s products were not replacements for Excel or Word, which he admits are more powerful. But he added that for smaller businesses and for certain groups of employees within larger companies, Google Apps could be a substitute for Microsoft’s products.Microsoft has taken steps to embrace the trend toward Internet services with products like Office Live, a package of functions to help small businesses set up Web sites.“We have a bunch of hosted services that we offer to our customers,” said Chris Capossela, vice president for Office at Microsoft. “Our belief is that the future of computing is a combination of software and services.”Mr. Capossela said he welcomed the competition. But he said he expected that many customers would continue to want to have their data stored in-house because of security, legal and compliance reasons.For now, Google’s share of the business software market is a tiny fraction of Microsoft’s.Google said more than 100,000 small businesses had been using Google Apps for Your Domain, as the earlier package of e-mail and messaging programs was known. Docs and Spreadsheets had 432,000 users in December, according to Nielsen/NetRatings. Microsoft says Office has 450 million to 500 million users.'"
"'07-02-22,'0','ATLANTA, Feb. 21 (AP) — The Coca-Cola Company said Wednesday that it would put caffeine content information on the labels of all of its drink products distributed in the United States that include the ingredient.The company said the plan was voluntary and part of an industry initiative.On Monday in New York, Simcha Felder, a Democratic city councilman from Brooklyn, said he intended to introduce a nonbinding Council resolution calling for the Food and Drug Administration to require that caffeine content be included in product labels on food and beverages.The F.D.A. requires that caffeine be included in ingredient lists when added to soft drinks and caffeinated water, but has not required that caffeine content be labeled, even though it has long advised pregnant women to avoid or limit their intake of caffeine.Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, said it had already included caffeine labeling on its energy drink Full Throttle and its green tea Enviga products and would introduce the new labels on its other brands, starting with cans of Coca-Cola Classic, in May.PepsiCo announced plans on Wednesday to introduce a version of Diet Pepsi that includes more caffeine, as well as ginseng, Reuters reported.The drink, to be called Diet Pepsi Max, will have about a third more caffeine than the company’s popular Diet Mountain Dew and is aimed at consumers aged 25 to 34, a Pepsi spokesman said.'"

Only last week, Wall Street rallied after the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S.

The pattern could cause wet spring conditions in the eastern Corn Belt, particularly in the Ohio River Valley, according to the forecast.This could delay planting in the area at a time when ideal planting and growing conditions are needed to produce record corn crops, said Vic Lespinasse, analyst with A.

"'07-02-22,'0','The vote took place the same day Britain announced a substantial reduction of its troops in southern Iraq, and a week after a European Parliamentary committee issued a strong report criticizing secret American flights in Europe of terrorism suspects.But the government’s collapse also reflected its own inherent weaknesses, possibly signaling that Italy’s chronic political instability may be coming out of remission. In a nation that has had some 60 governments since World War II, Mr. Prodi has presided uneasily over a coalition of nine diverse parties, ranging from moderate Catholics to Communists.“It’s very bad,” said Roberto D’Alimonte, a professor at the University of Florence and expert in electoral law. “We still have to come to terms with a working political system. We do not have a working political system.”There are many scenarios for what comes next — and one possibility, if not immediately likely, is a return to power of Silvio Berlusconi, whom Mr. Prodi defeated in elections last year.As ministers met late into the night to discuss how to proceed, Mr. Berlusconi’s supporters rallied outside the seat of government, waving banners and demanding that the government step aside.“The country has been exposed, by a majority that isn’t and by an incompetent government that has rejected parliamentary dialogue — a grave international humiliation,” Mr. Berlusconi told reporters.For Mr. Berlusconi to return, new elections would have to be held, which at the moment seems several steps in the future.After accepting Mr. Prodi’s resignation, President Giorgio Napolitano will begin to consult with political parties on Thursday and will ask one of them to try to form a government.Many political experts believed that Mr. Prodi would be given a chance to shuffle his cabinet in a way that would satisfy the parties already in the government. Then he would call for a confidence vote in Parliament.But many experts noted that such a government would remain weak, with the deep splits over Afghanistan and the American base unresolved.“Something has broken,” said Franco Pavoncello, the president of John Cabot University here and a political scientist. “This vote and the reaction of the government has created damage to Prodi’s ability to last.”In theory, the prime minister’s term lasts five years, but Mr. Berlusconi is the only prime minister to have endured that long.While the government’s weakness made it liable to fall at any moment, its collapse on Wednesday came as something of a surprise. For months the government has been bickering internally — and weathering attacks by Mr. Berlusconi and other opposition leaders — over issues ranging from the budget to a proposed law giving rights to unmarried couples.But foreign policy remained a particular weak spot. Essentially, Mr. Prodi and his ministers have sought to walk a difficult line, echoing much of the skepticism in Europe about President Bush and the war in Iraq while maintaining Italy’s traditionally strong ties with America.The government’s far-left members, however, have strongly resisted the presence of nearly 2,000 Italian troops in Afghanistan. And last weekend, tens of thousands of people rallied against the expansion of the American-staffed NATO base in Vicenza, which Mr. Prodi’s government reluctantly supported.The splits grew deeper, and on Tuesday in Spain, Italy’s foreign minister, Massismo D’Alema, himself a former prime minister, called for the Senate to endorse Italy’s foreign policy. If it did not, he said, the government should “go home,” or step down.In a long and impassioned speech before the vote on Wednesday, Mr. D’Alema defended his government’s position on Afghanistan and the Vicenza base, in terms that he hoped would win the left’s support.“We have not supported the neoconservative politics of the American administration and we have not sent soldiers to Iraq,” he told his colleagues. “There is a profound difference between the military operations in Afghanistan, approved by the United Nations, and those in Iraq.”He added that the support of expanding the base was essential to good relations with America. “To change course would be a hostile act against the United States,” he said.In the end, the government needed 160 votes but received only 158 with the two abstentions. Opposition senators roared at the result, shouting immediately: “Resign! Resign!”Many experts said they believed that Mr. D’Alema, one of the most powerful and experienced members of the government, would resign. And as Italy’s leaders search for a broader solution in the next few days, there are several alternatives to a mere shuffling of the current cabinet.The most dramatic, and perhaps least likely, is that Mr. Napolitano could call immediate elections. But he has said he will not do so until the current electoral law, instated by Mr. Berlusconi last year, is changed. Many experts blame the law for virtually guaranteeing a thin majority in the Senate no matter who wins, and thus destabilizing the political system.Another option is the appointment of a temporary government made up of largely centrist technocrats. The aim would be to steer Italy toward new elections, most likely engineering a change to electoral laws first.A final possibility involves peeling off the more centrist Union of Christian Democrats, a party long allied, if uneasily, with Mr. Berlusconi. Even as the government tottered on Wednesday, one party leader, Marco Follini, seemed to raise the possibility. “The moment has arrived to put into the pipeline a different center-left,” he told reporters.But Professor D’Alimonte noted that the party did not have enough seats to allow Mr. Prodi to cast off the rebellious far-left of his own party. Simply adding on Mr. Follini’s party remained a possibility, although Professor D’Alimonte noted that it also seemed a recipe for even deeper disputes since it shares little politically with the Communists who brought down the government.'"
"'07-02-22,'0','Greg Joswiak, vice president of iPod product marketing for Apple, said the growing number of products designed to plug into an iPod helps prove that the iPod has become “a cultural phenomenon.”“If you look at it from the consumers’ standpoint, they have a consumer electronic product that becomes more valuable over time,” he said. “We’re adding these accessories, adding capabilities.”Any speaker accessory that attaches to the iPod by way of the proprietary 30-pin connector in the player’s base must be licensed by Apple, he noted. Those that do, including the FUNKit, can usually also permit full control of the iPod through the speaker systems and charge iPods’ batteries.Those that do not, and are not counted as official iPod accessories, are “less interesting,” Mr. Joswiak said. That judgment has not dissuaded toymakers like Lee Schneider, president of the Commonwealth Toy & Novelty Company, a major maker of plush animals and dolls.“We look at not only the toy business, but what’s happening in the world, and the trends in the marketplace, from a fashion standpoint, from a technological standpoint,” said Mr. Schneider, surrounded by shelves of battery-powered flora and fauna in his company’s Manhattan showroom. “We then take and see how we can interpret these trends into fun trends that children and young adults would love to have.”Last year, he said, “iPods were becoming the rave of the world.” Mr. Schneider said that he and his executives had asked themselves a single question: “What can we do to make something that could be utilized with iPod?”First, he said, the company came up with a name that would tie its prospective line of products to iPod. The result was iPals, which Commonwealth quickly registered and trademarked. Next, the company moved to define the personality of an iPal.The first iPal, released last year, was a shaggy, plush creature resembling a teardrop-shaped extraterrestrial with stereo speakers for eyes positioned on long, flexible stalks. The shaggy iPal plugs into any audio player with a standard headphone jack, avoiding the need for an Apple license.Mr. Schneider said the original iPal, which cost about $25, was intended for “tween girls who want to have something cool and fun in their room.”Then came the Movin’ and Groovin’ line of potted plants, also $25, “probably the best introduction in the history of my company,” Mr. Schneider said. The plants, some wearing sunglasses and others a pink purse over a leafy limb, gyrate to music played through a speaker hidden in the plant’s pot.There is also a line of dancing snakes (soon to be joined by dancing dragons), both $25, as well as plush speaker systems for children called Smonsters and Plumplers, about $15, and Mini iPals that will cost $10. In the works is a dancing plant as tall as a third grader (“a room décor piece”) for $80.“I look at this almost like the Lava Lite of the 2000s,” Mr. Schneider said of his creations.Sharper Image, the retail chain, is featuring a line of fanciful iPod speaker systems. One is a scale model of a lemon-yellow, convertible Volkswagen Beetle. Its speakers are hidden in its wheels, and iPods are intended to “ride” in its back seat. At $100, the Beetle is also a digital alarm clock and FM-AM radio with a wireless remote control and working headlights.Sharper Image is also offering a $40 teddy bear that flashes tiny lights embedded in its paws and feet when digital music is played through its speaker. A pocket on its belly is strategically positioned to nestle an iPod.Sharper Image also sells an iPod docking station that creates a rainbow of colored L.E.D. lights that pulsate to the rhythm of music played through it. The stereo systems come in two versions, one for $100 and a similar one with a subwoofer for $150.Mr. Hirsch, the toy industry marketing expert, said iPods have become such a part of everyday life that — as with a wristwatch — its underlying technology was taken for granted. “It’s almost like magic,” he said.Among the first to tap into that magic, many in the industry say, was Hasbro’s I-DOG Interactive Music Companion, introduced in fall 2005. At $30, it is a palm-size robotic pooch with an embedded speaker that moves to music played through it when attached to a digital music player. Hasbro also makes a menagerie of I-animals, including pups, cats and fish. This month it added a $20 penguin, called I-CY, that flaps its flippers as its belly glows to music.Not to be outdone, Mattel, continually updating Barbie, is introducing interactive Chat Divas Barbie dolls for $30. The doll can talk on its cellphone in one hand and sing karaoke with a microphone in the other. The battery-powered karaoke machine doubles as a speaker for a music player, and Barbie moves her head and lips to the music.MGA Entertainment has taken a different direction. The company has created the i-Bratz i-Petz Piggy, a touch-sensitive plastic piglet ($25) that dances to music played through it. It lights up, turns its head and even flaps its if-pigs-could-fly wings.And while it may not qualify as a toy, Atech Flash Technology has come up with an accessory that may still provide a smile. It is the Stereo Dock for iPod with Bath Tissue Holder, a toilet-paper dispenser with an iPod dock and speakers. Selling for $100 ($130 with built-in rechargeable battery), it can also be detached from the wall and used as a portable speaker system.George Yang, the marketing director of Atech, which has offices in Taiwan and Fremont, Calif., said the Apple-licensed product had been well-received at trade shows. “All get a good laugh out of it,” he said. As for Apple, he added, “it’s good P.R. for them.”'"
"'07-02-22,'0','Insurance costs are also higher in the Northeast. Insurance for workers’ compensation and liability, necessary no matter how minor the job, can cost contractors as much as 30 percent more in the Northeast than it does in the Midwest, he said.“The price of materials doesn’t drive the cost of the project so much as the price of qualified labor,” he said. “My highest-paid employee makes $90,000 per year.”Competition is also a factor. In markets where many wealthy people want to renovate, a $30,000 or $50,000 kitchen is competing for labor with someone else’s $100,000 bathroom, said Lee J. Stahl, president of the Renovated Home, a Manhattan-based remodeling company. Even a moderately priced contractor is “shooting at the highest star” and may shirk the work on your home as deeper pockets beckon, even in the middle of a job.That translates into very different costs per square foot, depending on where you live. Renovation experts say it is extremely difficult to accurately compare costs regionally because of such variations. To get the most up-to-date assessment of local costs, it is best to ask local contractors and salespeople at building supply stores about rates.One extensive source of detailed data, including the estimated resale value of each renovation, is the Web site for Remodeling magazine, remodeling.hw.net; data may be found by clicking on “special features,” and in that pull-down menu, “cost versus value.” The site reports that in 2006, an upscale bath renovation cost an average of $43,050 in the Pacific states; $35,212 in the South Atlantic region and $36,868 in the Mountain states, while the national average was $38,165.Contractors and homeowners alike agree on one point: get everything in writing, but don’t haggle. Do not, contractors warn, nickel and dime the people you hire to tear your home apart. And don’t automatically take the low bid, because that could be a signal that the contractor is very inexperienced and perhaps not up to the job.“They’re going to ask to be paid professionally,” said Mr. Stahl, whose crew of 28 designers and 20 workmen is booked five months in advance, typically on projects worth $100,000 or more. “If they’re behaving like a professional, they expect to be paid like a professional.”Dean Bennett, president of a 12-year-old design and construction firm in Castle Rock, Colo., a Denver suburb, said customers need to realize that complexities are revealed as jobs go along and that costs increase. “Most people don’t understand the tasks, time and intricacies involved in building a wall, let alone larger projects,” he said. “Estimate prices and multiply by 1.5 times for a truer figure.”Mr. Bennett warned of exceptionally low or high pricing. “Contractors should always be upfront with what they charge,” hourly or by project, he said. Watch for markups on materials; know what the markup is and monitor it. If you have hired someone who charges a 20 percent markup on each item, for example, ask to review invoices so you can see for yourself what the contractor paid, and what you are paying.“I show every client every invoice, and every week they get a running total,” he said. “It’s a more upfront way to do business.”“You want an understanding of what’s happening and where your money is going,” he said. “A lot of contractors will bill their time plus materials. I prefer that, because no one’s trying to get away with anything by buying cheaper materials and marking them up in order to make their profit.”To keep a contractor working and motivated, Mr. Bennett suggested weekly invoicing and payment.Mr. Woolf, whose Chappaqua business has a full-time staff of 12, agrees that clients need to be aware of costs but should not underestimate them. “The biggest mistake a prospective client makes going into a project is not having a realistic budget,” he said. “Clients often have a preconceived notion of what something ‘should’ cost. They are wrong. It’s always more.”“You’re not buying a commodity item,” he added. “Different builders have different overheads, profit margins, and place a different value on their work. A plumber charging $2,000 to $3,000 has a shop, a license and insurance,” Mr. Woolf said. “He owns trucks, and he has payroll. Plus, don’t forget the cost of materials.”Homeowners should learn what’s involved in a renovation, Lee Stahl said. “If your budget has no flexibility, become the most educated person on the planet,” he said. “Take a community college class. Understand the work, the nuts and bolts of it.”He and others highly recommend the videos and books produced by the television shows “This Old House” and “Hometime.” Carl Heldmann, a longtime contractor, is the author of “Be Your Own House Contractor,” which has sold 300,000 copies and offers sample contracts and a glossary in English and Spanish.Even the tightest budget can accommodate $500 worth of education, Mr. Stahl said. If you can’t afford a mistake, learn how to avoid one.Some homeowners — if they have the expertise — undertake as much of the work as possible themselves to save money.Ken Golub, a Chicago public school teacher who has spent $50,000 remodeling his 100-year-old house near Wrigley Field, estimates that he has saved another $50,000 by doing much of the painting, plastering and wood stripping himself. Tasks like those are more easily undertaken than plumbing or electrical work, which contractors say should be left to professionals.Last summer, Mr. Golub excavated and installed his own patio, a job quoted at $8,000. He did it for $4,000 by renting heavy equipment like a jackhammer and soil compactor from Home Depot. “It was backbreaking work,” he said.The worst renovations are crippled by indecision.

"'07-02-22,'0','But in 1978, when Urban Archaeology opened on Spring Street, the preservation movement was still gaining steam, along with a new eclecticism in decorating, as Stephen Drucker, the editor in chief of House Beautiful magazine explained. “It was the moment when having a claw foot bathtub in your bedroom was a shocking and fabulous thing to do,” Mr. Drucker said. “People restoring brownstones in Brooklyn — remember, the ’70s were the beginning of the brownstone movement, the back-to-the-city movement — didn’t have a Restoration Hardware to turn to.”The dark age of salvage, from about 1930 to the late 1960s, just after the outcry over the destruction of Penn Station, was ending.“It used to be called gargoyle snatching,” said Jeff Byles, the author of “Rubble: Unearthing the History of Demolition,” published last year in paperback. “Until the ’30s, the wreckers could resell everything, from the sinks to the copper pipes.” But then labor costs made this practice uneconomical. It wasn’t until the 1970s that a market was reborn, and contractors stopped pouring the contents of the buildings they smashed into landfills and began selling them instead to men like Mr. Shapiro.By the 1980s the contractors themselves grew balky, Mr. Shapiro said. “They’d see a stone head they’d sold me for $50 selling for $200 in my store,” he said. “They’d tell me, ‘I’d rather smash it up than sell it to you.’ Of course, I’d gone in and taken the things out and cleaned them up and made them nice. So I bought a bunch of hammers and tied them up in red ribbons to give to these guys. One week I handed out 30 hammers.”The early ’80s were a hiccup, he said, in the steady growth of the salvage business. By the mid-1980s, he might pay $100,000 to a contractor for the salvage rights to, say, a Wall Street bank building with 20-foot-high carved mantelpieces, paneled rooms and a limestone facade.Salvage became incredibly lucrative for everyone, Mr. Shapiro said, “because incredible things were coming down — Stanford White buildings, triple mansions on Park Avenue.” He continued: “In 1980 I’d sell a great double sink from the turn of the century for $15,000. By 1990 I’d pay $15,000 to get one.”And his clients, like Paul Simon and the designer Betsey Johnson, were buying multiples of every bathtub or sink in his store. “The Yale club, the St. Regis, no one outbid me,” he said. “I’d buy all the sinks, and I’d sell them all.”When he ran out of copper-clad bathtubs or two-inch-thick marble sinks, he began making them himself. His clients still clamored for things with “patina,” but they wanted them made their way, higher or wider or thicker, he said. “They didn’t just want one or three of something,” he said. “They’d want eight, for all eight bathrooms.”He moved the business to Franklin Street almost 10 years ago, and it largely became a manufacturing company. There are two workroom floors, a design floor and two showroom floors filled with bathroom vignettes of green glass tiles, replicas of Helena Rubinstein’s minimalist medicine cabinet in stainless steel and marble (Urban Archaeology’s best-selling item) and slate and marble floors to tempt TriBeCa’s new royalty, the hedge fund managers.Mr. Shapiro’s business is now all about the obsession with bathrooms that has overtaken many new American projects. And much of the salvage in New York (and beyond) has been taken over by Kevin Browne, an admirer and sometime collaborator of Mr. Shapiro’s and president of Olde Good Things, the business end of a group called the Church of Bible Understanding.Olde Good Things has showrooms on 24th Street and in the West Village, as well as in Los Angeles and Chicago, and a 100,000-square-foot warehouse in Scranton, Pa. The company sells early-20th-century doors, bathtubs, sinks, hardware, windows, shutters, mantels, columns and masonry.So does Demolition Depot, a vast, attic-y warehouse, annex and yard on East 125th Street owned by Evan Blum, a 30-year salvage veteran and former competitor and enemy of Mr. Shapiro’s, according to both men, who clearly loathe each other (the salvage business can be nasty).Mr. Browne’s artifact business, once a carpet-cleaning company called Christian Brothers (it was satirized in a Seinfeld episode), started as a junk table at the 26th Street Flea Market in the mid-1990s. Back then, “I’d go into Gil’s store and go, ‘Aah,’ ” said Mr. Browne, wincing in mock horror at the memory. “Because he was selling one corbel for $200 and we were lucky if we made $200 in one day at the flea market.”Today Mr. Browne has scrapbooks of all the buildings he has helped to take down, including the Con Edison plant on F.D.R. Drive, the Philadelphia Civic Center and much of old Times Square.Lately he has branched out. Having salvaged scores of banyan trees from Florida, post-Wilma, he is having tables made from their massive stump slices and selling them along with mirrors made from copper-clad office building window frames and consoles made from old iron fences. But Mr. Browne has no plans to get out of the salvage business. He is not worried about salvage stock. “There’s too much out there,” he said.Neither is Mr. Shapiro, though his business no longer depends on it.“Thirty years from now the stuff from the ’40s is going to be coming down and people will want the things in them,” he said. “Buildings we’re not going to run out of. We should worry about oil.”'"

"'07-02-23,'0','“The Number 23” is an accidental comedy starring a deadly serious Jim Carrey that owes something to David Fincher, a little something else to Robert Anton Wilson and next to nothing, at least intentionally, to the gods of laughter, be they Gelus (Greek) or Jerry Lewis (American). In its downbeat tone and paranoid timbre, the film recalls several of the director Joel Schumacher’s previous thrillers, notably “8MM,” his exploitative walk on the sexually deviant side. Like all his films this new one looks professionally polished; like “8MM” it’s humorless save when it’s laughable.A master crafter of overwrought pulp fiction, Mr. Schumacher started in Hollywood as a costume designer before writing several black-oriented movies, including Michael Schultz’s memorable ensemble comedy “Car Wash.” He went on to direct slick amusements like “The Lost Boys” and “Flatliners,” all as disreputable as they are diverting, along with the even better “Falling Down” (Michael Douglas goes ballistic as a beleaguered Los Angeles Everyman) and “Phone Booth” (Colin Farrell gets hung up in the last phone booth in New York). He also brought the “Batman” franchise to a temporary halt with “Batman & Robin” (the one in which George Clooney wears a rubber suit with assertively stiff nipples), but that film paved the way for Christopher Nolan’s “Batman Begins,” so who’s complaining?No matter how preposterous, Mr. Schumacher’s films almost always have a certain pop je ne sais quoi; they’re hooky like a chart-topping song, like that not-quite-dumb-enough television show you just can’t stop watching. “The Number 23,” which was written by the newcomer Fernley Phillips, starts off promisingly with Mr. Carrey, eyeballing a dog from behind the wheel of a truck. The character, the curiously named Walter Sparrow, works as a dogcatcher in Anywhere U.S.A., a job that might be a tip of the hat to Mr. Carrey’s breakout role in “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective” and definitely comes off as a bit down- market for a leading man in a Hollywood flick. That alpha-dog entrance suggests Walter is a wee eccentric.The story doesn’t make a doggy lick of sense, which isn’t a knock. Walter’s wife, Agatha (Virginia Madsen), buys him a used book, “The Number 23,” written by someone waggishly called Topsy Kretts. If that name doesn’t tip you off that something is afoot (say the two words fast if you’re still missing the joke), then Walter’s sudden preoccupation with the book should do the trick. Before you can say “obsessive-compulsive disorder” or look up apophenia (the experience of seeing connections where none exist), Walter finds himself seeing the number 23 in every combination everywhere he turns: indoors and out, on street signs and in his personal history, name and anniversaries. It all adds up, even if it doesn’t.What does it mean? Not much, though the film spends a lot of our time and its energy trying to persuade us otherwise. Mr. Schumacher has some fun with special effects, taking us inside the gloomy neo-noir world of the book itself, where Mr. Carrey plays another character with an animal-related moniker, Fingerling. The word Fingerling means small fish, but he comes across as small potatoes. A detective by trade, he plays the sax, fools around with a femme fatale named Fabrizia (Ms. Madsen, slinking around in dark hair and black slip), and hooks up with a woman he anoints the Suicide Blonde (Lynn Collins). Naturally he employs a wrung-out voice-over, suggesting that he or the screenwriter has lapped up one too many detective stories.'"

"'07-02-23,'0','Three of the administration’s most senior economic policy makers — Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., his top deputy, Robert K. Steel, and White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten — are alumni of Goldman Sachs, which in the last decade has evolved into one of the most important players in the private equity market.As hedge funds have grown both in the United States and globally, and as periodic collapses have shaken the markets and caused investors to lose money, pressures have increased to impose greater regulation on them. But supporters say that the hedge fund industry had grown more sophisticated in recent years, is well equipped to manage risks, and that none of the failures have harmed the nation’s financial system.The explosive growth in recent years of private equity investment and hedge funds has made their managers symbols of new wealth, a huge source of philanthropy to the nation’s museums, hospitals and orchestras, and a major new force in political campaigns.Millions of Americans do not qualify to make investments in hedge funds, which are pools of largely unregulated assets, but they are exposed to the risks associated with hedge funds through their pensions and personal retirement accounts.The decision to avoid demanding more openness from private funds represents a starkly different approach to that undertaken by Washington for publicly traded companies, which in the last five years have faced a battery of new governance, auditing and disclosure rules following the scandals at Enron and other large companies.The working group rejected any proposal that would give the government the ability to inspect the books and records of hedge funds or force the funds to make regular reports about their activities. Both banks and brokerage firms must adhere to stringent rules that give regulators great leeway in supervising them.While the working group never considered anything as strict, many hedge funds oppose even minimal oversight because they say it could slow their ability to make lightning-fast investment decisions or reveal trading strategies to rivals.A previous effort by the Securities and Exchange Commission to protect investors by requiring hedge funds to register with the government failed last summer. In June, a federal appeals court ruled that the agency did not have the authority to regulate them.In leading a deeply divided commission to adopt those rules in the first place, its then chairman, William H. Donaldson, said that hedge funds had been central figures in a variety of market trading abuses and that registration was a modest and essential way for regulators to begin to understand them. Although he had the support of two of the four other commissioners for his efforts on hedge funds, Mr. Donaldson came under heavy criticism from Republican lawmakers and top administration officials for suggesting that regulators shine a light on what he called “a dark corner” of the market.Under its new chairman, Christopher Cox, the commission decided not to appeal the court decision that struck down the rules. Instead the agency is preparing to write a new regulation that would require investors in such funds to have greater personal wealth. That proposed regulation is not affected by today’s announcement.On Thursday, the president’s working group, led by Mr. Paulson, proposed a series of nonbinding principles that put the onus primarily on companies, investors and the buyers and sellers of their complex securities to impose a “market discipline” that should be adequate to protect investors and the marketplace. Officials said those principles would make the hedge fund companies more transparent and their investors and creditors more vigilant to shady operators and excessive risk-takers.At a briefing Thursday, a senior Treasury Department official involved in drafting the principles suggested that any new regulations would discourage innovation and risk-taking. The official said he would only speak on condition that he not be identified because the new guidelines were the product of a group of agencies.Officials acknowledged that many of the principles that were advanced by the administration and the regulators would seem obvious to smart investors and properly managed hedge funds.“Private pools of capital can be an appropriate investment vehicle for more sophisticated investors,” read one of the main principles that the officials and agencies agreed upon. “Because these pools can involve complex, illiquid or opaque investments and investment strategies that are not fully disclosed, the risk associated with direct investment in these pools are most appropriately borne by investors with the sophistication to identify, analyze and bear these risks.”The report said that the concerns of less sophisticated investors in pension and retirement vehicles could best be addressed “through sound practices on the part of the fiduciaries that manage such vehicles.”The announcement was hailed by several trade groups for the hedge funds and other companies involved in trading complex financial instruments.“The President’s Working Group has taken a thoughtful and judicious approach to many of the investor protection and systemic risk issues which surround hedge funds,” said Micah S. Green, co-chief executive of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which represents hundreds of Wall Street firms.“Too often, regulators reach immediately for new laws or rules which can have the unintended consequence of stifling innovation or smothering markets,” Mr. Green said. “By instead providing principles and guidelines, the President’s Working Group has recognized the importance of flexibility and efficiency in a healthy marketplace.”But other experts said the guidelines would have limited effect.“They are regulating around the peripheries,” said Jay G. Baris, a securities lawyer with Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel in New York. “They are turning up the heat on disclosures, on fiduciaries to determine suitability, and on risk management. But they are going to stop short of substantive regulation of hedge funds or of unregistered hedge fund advisers.”The reaction in Congress, which is in recess this week, was largely muted.Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrats who heads the House Financial Services Committee, called the announcement “a first step in addressing questions presented by the significant growth of hedge funds.”“Steps are being taken to increase investor protection,” Mr. Frank added, “and I believe the appropriate committee in the House and the Senate should be working with the Presidential Working Group and others for the further study and monitoring of both issues.”A similar statement was issued by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee.There is no expectation that Congress will adopt legislation on the subject any time soon.'"

"'07-02-23,'0','To some people, Mr. Corzine was mapping out a sobering long-term assessment of the state’s ills, leaving little doubt that he is determined to lease or sell valuable assets like the New Jersey Turnpike and the state lottery.But others noted that 2007 is an election year in which all 120 legislators must appease voters, suggesting that Mr. Corzine was postponing some of the knottiest long-term decisions to provide political cover to his fellow Democrats who control both the Assembly and the Senate. And that he knows this is not the time to enact major hard-to-sell changes.“Even though there was some good news, he delivered it in such a gloomy way that I was depressed,” said Assemblywoman Joan M. Quigley, a Democrat from Hudson County. “Armageddon is next year, there’s no doubt about it.”But Assemblyman Richard A. Merkt, a Republican from Morris County, was more cynical, saying: “The absence of any significant initiatives is intended to allow the Democrats to highlight their so-called property tax reform.”In contrast to last year, when a battle over a sales-tax increase led to a weeklong government shutdown, many agreed with the Assembly speaker, Joseph J. Roberts Jr., that “this will be an easy budget to pass this year.”Ever since Mr. Corzine, a former executive of the investment bank Goldman Sachs, took office in January 2006, he has talked frequently, and in the gravest of tones, about New Jersey’s structural deficits of billions of dollars each year.But with the state’s mixed record of borrowing more money to support transportation projects in his first year, and a new proposed budget dependent on ephemeral factors like excess reserve funds, some are questioning Mr. Corzine’s willingness to put the state’s money where his mouth is.“What the budget does is defer some really big-ticket items and decisions, and that’s almost like saying to your students, ‘Have a nice vacation, but when we come back, we have work to do, and that will be after November,’ ” said Jon Shure, president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonpartisan group.Mr. Shure, a former assistant to Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat who served in the early 1990s, added: “But I do think there’s also a recognition on his part that in an election year you’re only going to get so much from these people. So why put something in front of them that they won’t do?”One thing political analysts seemed to agree upon was that Mr. Corzine appears to agonize more than his predecessors did over the state’s finances.Ingrid W. Reed, a political science professor at Rutgers, said that when Gov. Christie Whitman cut income taxes, and Gov. James E. McGreevey increased local assistance, “you never felt that it was a hard decision and that they were agonizing over it when they gave they budget messages.”She added, “But Corzine, from the beginning, could not not face the dire circumstances that the state had come to with its finances.”Full details of the budget will be released next week, followed by months of hearings in the Legislature, which must vote on it before June 30.In the first 10 minutes of his speech on Thursday, Mr. Corzine promoted the main initiatives in his budget, most of which had been shared with lawmakers and reporters in briefings the day before.He said that 1.9 million property owners would see their tax bills lowered by an average of $1,000. He said that all the state’s school districts, not just the poorest ones, would receive a 3 percent increase in funding, for a total of $580 million. And he said that the state would raise to $40,000 from $20,000 the threshold for low-income families to qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit, which will cost the state $64 million.Among the items not promoted in advance were $9 million for a new comptroller’s office, which is intended to function as a fiscal watchdog; $20 million in incentives for local governments to share services; $10 million for stem-cell research; and $5 million for autism.But Mr. Corzine said he was “almost embarrassed to highlight them because they are a fraction of what we should really be doing.”And with that, the governor began a discussion of the state’s long-term woes, a good chunk of it devoted to the prospect of asset monetization, a term that bankers use for the possible lease of state assets like the turnpike and the lottery.First, he rattled off a series of numbers ranging from debt service (going up to $3.4 billion from $2.7 billion in the next five years) to health care ($2.8 billion versus $1.4 billion) and the state’s required pension contribution ($3.3 billion versus $1.3 billion).Then, he praised asset monetization — with some controls — as giving the state the potential to “reduce our crushing debt burden and meet New Jersey’s long-term capital needs in a way no other alternative provides.”“We can continue struggling every year, scraping by with duct tape and baling wire, and pulling together no-frills, investment-free budgets,” he said. “Or we can change course.”State Senator John H. Adler, a Democrat from Cherry Hill, said he saw it this way: “Essentially the governor is saying we should go along with the budget, get through the election and deal with hard problems next year.”'"
"'07-02-23,'0','The can and the change began appearing within a week after Warhol was buried. Mrs. Gibson speculated that the person behind the items was probably from near the cemetery and perhaps of the same Slovak background as Warhol. “They’re just too loyal to be anyone else, I think.”John Warhola, Warhol’s 81-year-old brother (Andy dropped the “a” when he went to New York), said he noticed the can shortly after his brother’s death but has never figured out who left the items, or the significance of the coins.The director of the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, Thomas Sokolowski, said he was equally baffled by the mystery visitor but he recounted that several people at Warhol’s funeral tossed money on top of the casket as it was lowered. “They may be coins to pay for passage to the other side,” Mr. Sokolowski speculated.Standing on a hillside where the only footprints in the virgin snow meander to this one plot at St. John the Baptist Cemetery where Warhol is buried alongside his mother and father, Mrs. Gibson said she fell into her duty because her husband dug Warhol’s grave.“I feel lucky,” she said, interrupting herself as she began to cry. “I never knew him when he was alive, but I feel like I’ve become close to him after his death.”Mr. Warhola said he is surprised by his brother’s continuing influence.“I still don’t know what the attraction is,” he said. “Why people keep visiting him. Why there is so much love for him. I thought it would stop after a while.”While some of Warhol’s New York friends lamented that he was taken from the city that made him famous, the decision on where to bury him was left to Mr. Warhola.Warhol left a will, but never addressed where or how he should be buried. Mr. Warhola reasoned that, despite some who believed Warhol despised his hometown, he would want to be buried here, particularly near his mother’s grave.“I thought it was only proper,” he said.He recalled Warhol once famously saying: “I never understood why when you died, you didn’t just vanish, everything could just keep going on the way it was only you just wouldn’t be there. I always thought I’d like my own tombstone to be blank. No epitaph, and no name. Well, actually, I’d like it to say ‘figment.’ ”Mr. Sokolowski said that Warhol’s use of the word “figment” was true to his character. “What endeared people to him and continues to do so is that he was a self-creation,” said Mr. Sokolowski, who knew Warhol. “That’s what is so lasting.”It was because Mrs. Gibson’s husband, Charles E. Gibson, 76, dug Andy’s grave — two feet deeper than normal to thwart would-be grave robbers — that she was asked by Mr. Warhola to maintain it. She is paid a small yearly sum by the Andy Warhol Foundation in New York. She said she has never raised her rate, and she preferred the dollar amount remain unmentioned.The Gibsons’s son, Charles W. Gibson, 45, is at the cemetery even more than she is, doing maintenance work or digging a grave at least three times a month. In 27 years of working at the cemetery — Mr. Gibson recently took over the business from his father — he said he has never been there when he has not seen a Warhol fan at the grave, or looking for it.“Most of them are younger people, 18- to 30-years-old, probably art students; a lot of punk-rocker-type people,” he said. But he said that unlike his mother, he is not a fan of Warhol’s work.“I’ve never really seen it. I’ve never been to Andy Warhol’s museum,” he said. “ I mean, I’m a gravedigger. I bury 300 people a year.”Picking up a casino chip and a soggy copy of Us magazine left at the base of the tombstone, Mrs. Gibson, a former florist, said she originally left bouquets with geraniums and marigolds at the grave, “more striking displays,” she said, that were truer to Warhol’s personality.But people kept stealing those, so in the winter, she now just uses evergreen wreaths with simple maroon bows. Tulips were her favorite to plant, but the deer kept eating those. She opts for daffodils now for summer color and plants a purple iris.“It stands out,” she said, and it helps guide people who otherwise might miss the gravestone.'"
"'07-02-23,'0','The relationship between prime brokers and hedge funds is a naturally strained one: Prime brokers want as much information as possible and hedge funds want to give them as little as possible. After all, most banks are in the same business as hedge funds (looking for investment ideas and making money from them). Most hedge funds use multiple prime brokers.In general, prime brokers operate with the assurance that if a client blows up, they are not on the line for the losses. Unless they have actual knowledge of a fraud, they should be O.K.The case involving Bear Stearns had its origins in 1996, when Michael Berger, an enterprising young Austrian, began the Manhattan Investment Fund. He bet that technology stocks would fall and when they didn’t, he constructed an elaborate scheme to hide his losses — about $400 million. The S.E.C. sued, and Mr. Berger pleaded guilty to securities fraud in 2000. The fund declared bankruptcy and Mr. Berger fled the country.Angry investors tried to sue a number of deep-pocketed parties, including Bear Stearns, who was the prime broker, for aiding and abetting the fraud. A federal judge threw that case out in 2001.Then the trustee tried something different: she sued Bear Stearns in bankruptcy court for $141.4 million — money that Manhattan Investment gave to Bear Stearns in the year before the collapse to allow Mr. Berger to trade. Those funds were later used for collateral to keep trading and to cover short positions once things started to fall apart.Bear Stearns, the trustee argued, was not merely a “conduit” for funds, but an actual “transferee” — which in bankruptcy means the creditors can come after it. She argued that Bear Stearns did not accept the transfers in good faith — essentially saying that the investment bank should have known about the fraud.Bear Stearns countered that it could not be a “transferee” because the funds did not belong to it. Under customer protection rules set by the S.E.C. and margin requirements set by the Federal Reserve and the New York Stock Exchange, the funds belonged to the Manhattan Investment Fund. It also argued that Bear made “good faith” efforts to uncover the fraud.The judge didn’t buy either argument, saying that the investment bank used the funds to cover positions it would have been on the hook for, making it a legitimate transferee. Bear Stearns said it was disappointed with the judge’s decision which “was not supported by either the law or the facts.” It will appeal the case.Judge Lifland’s opinion is a stark reminder that once a fund blows up, the look backward for red flags is never a pretty one. It poses a tough question for Wall Street: What does it need to know about its clients?Seems simple. It may not be.For example, did Bear Stearns fail to make a good-faith effort? In 1998, a prime brokerage executive who had nothing to do with the Manhattan Investment Fund, got wind at a cocktail party that the fund was up 20 percent, which seemed to contradict information he had inadvertently received — this was not his client — that the fund was losing money. He asked Mr. Berger to explain. Mr. Berger said he had multiple prime brokers — an explanation all parties agree was plausible. He made other efforts. But it was two years before Bear realized Manhattan was a fraud and reported it to the S.E.C.And now prime brokers, once off limits, suddenly look more promising.“It was such an ironclad gate for so long and now there’s an opening of the door,” said Ross B.

They are being forged in lieu of bigger deals, because, despite the talk of global consolidation, many countries continue to regard their exchanges as important national assets and thus limit foreign ownership.For a large, well-capitalized exchange, these deals can be a way to get a toehold in fast-growing emerging markets, and perhaps persuade their largest companies to list overseas. For smaller, very local exchanges, a big partner with international experience can bring greater marketing power, improved technology and usher in more foreign stock buyers. Years from now, they may result in an actual merger.“These will help global consolidation and integration of capital markets in key geographies,” said Mukarram Bhagat, chief executive and managing partner of ASK Raymond James in Mumbai, formerly Bombay. “Eventually, the trend seems to be the emergence of four or five large liquidity pools across the world, each servicing the capital needs of a major regional economic bloc.”Fast change may not happen, though. “In the near term, they’re unlikely to have a marked impact on the bottom line,” said Andrew Mitchell, an analyst with Fox-Pitt, Kelton in London. “But they don’t cost the exchanges much, and they give them options for the future.”Deutsche Börse’s purchase of 5 percent of the Bombay exchange “could give them a warmer, fuzzier feeling rather than really making an impact.,” said Michael Long, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London. But in the future, if the Bombay exchange “is doing really well they are in a good position,” he saidDeutsche Börse is looking at “5 to 10 years, not a short-term period,” said V. R. Srinivasan, chief executive of Brics Securities in Mumbai. The exchange is not looking for profit right away, he said, but “looking at how this investment can be leveraged.”The Bombay exchange did not provide any concrete details about how it would work with Deutsche Börse, but others have been a bit more forthcoming. Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange, for example, plan to meet regularly to discuss strategy in areas like market data products and technology, and may exchange personnel as well.Small-scale alliances are going to get more common as stock exchanges around the world convert from private members’ clubs to publicly traded entities. Exchanges that may go public in 2007 include the Mexico Stock Exchange, the Montreal Exchange, São Paulo’s exchange and the Warsaw Stock Exchange.At the same time, some ambitious start-up exchanges have arrived, like the Dubai International Financial Exchange. So far the DIFX, as it is known, has attracted just a handful of listed companies, but allying with a well-established exchange may be a good way to ensure high trading volume, bankers and analysts say.The DIFX is not ruling out such an alliance. “We’re aware of the potential benefits of cooperation with other exchanges, but there is nothing in the works at this time,” Mark Fisher, a spokesman for the exchange, said.Still, there are reasons to be skeptical about the trend. In general, alliances between stock exchanges that stop short of full-fledged mergers “have never worked in the past,” said Lynton Jones, the chairman of Bourse Consult, a consulting firm for stock exchanges. For example, a 10-exchange alliance that included the New York Stock Exchange, Euronext, Mexico and Australia, called the Global Equity Market, or GEM, was announced with great fanfare in 2000. It petered out within a year.“For an exchange to change its behavior radically, I suspect it needs to change its ownership completely,” Mr. Jones said.One looming problem may that of having too many partners. Even as the ink dried on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s agreement with the New York Exchange, Tokyo was in discussions with the London Stock Exchange about an alliance. Neither London nor Tokyo has provided any details of what that may look like, but it will require a careful balancing act for Tokyo exchange executives, analysts say.“It looks awkward and you wonder whether having these multiple arrangements won’t just negate them all,” Mr. Mitchell of Fox-Pitt said.'"
"'07-02-23,'0','Morgan Stanley has more than 900 employees in India, and about 600 of them are responsible for back-office functions.The bank does not break out its profit or revenue in India.The issuing of equity set records in India last year, and the country was the largest Asian target for private equity investment.Investment banking revenue in India grew more than 20 percent in 2006, according to Dealogic. Completed merger volume in South Asia, predominantly made up of India deals, more than doubled in 2006 from the year before, according to Thomson Financial.Prominent investment banks that saw opportunities years ago in India and paired up with local firms are now in a strong position to take advantage of this activity and are not likely to have problems obtaining local licenses to do business, financial advisers said.“The Indian government has shown in a lot of industries they like a transitional period where there are joint ventures,” said Chris Wyman, a partner with Clifford Chance, a law firm in London, who specializes in business in India.Still, foreign banks may face a challenge in India after they shed a partnership. Their former local partner has to attest that it does not object to the competition before the Indian government can give the stand-alone foreign bank a license.Securing the pledge can translate into rich buyout prices. JM Financial is not expected to create any technical obstacle to Morgan Stanley’s India business plans.JM Financial said it viewed the change as an opportunity and was changing its focus slightly. “We will be expanding our stable of clients,” said Vishal Kampani, a director of JM Financial and a managing director with JM Morgan Stanley, as the joint venture is known, in an interview.“Most of the foreign firms want to focus on the cross-border and large-cap transactions,” Mr. Kampani said, but JM Financial will also focus on medium-size companies.Morgan Stanley is paying $445 million for the 49 percent of the India joint venture’s institutional equities sales, trading and research platform that it does not already own.It is selling its 49 percent stake in the venture’s investment banking, fixed income and retail operation to JM Financial for $20 million.Together, JM Financial and Morgan Stanley have advised on deals like Singapore’s Temasek Holdings’ purchase of a stake in Tata Teleservices and Reliance Petroleum.As foreign banks pay more attention to India, there will still be plenty of room for domestic players, Mr. Kampani said.“Foreign firms bring credit and new products, but they are faceless, and a lot of clients don’t want to deal with a faceless organization” he said.“They have a competitive advantage in some things,” Mr. Kampani said, “and we have a competitive advantage in some things. We’ll see how it plays out in the next five years.”'"

"'07-02-23,'0','As hedge funds have grown, and as there have been instances of large collapses shaking the markets, pressures have mounted to impose greater regulation on them.But today’s decision not to do so represents a different approach to that undertaken by Washington for publicly traded companies, which in the last five years have faced a battery of new governance, auditing and disclosure rules following the scandals at Enron, WorldCom and other large companies.A previous effort by the Securities and Exchange Commission to make the funds more transparent by requiring them to register with the government failed last June, when a federal appeals court ruled that the agency did not have the authority to regulate them. The agency decided not to appeal the decision, and instead is preparing to write a regulation that would raise the net worth requirements for investors in such funds. That proposed regulation is not affected by today’s announcement.Today, the president’s working group, led by Mr. Paulson, instead proposed a series of nonbinding principles that put the onus primarily on companies, investors and the buyers and sellers of their complex securities to impose what he and other officials called a “market discipline” that should be adequate to protect investors and the marketplace.Among the nonbinding principles were two aimed at investors, saying they should not expose themselves to risk levels they cannot tolerate and that they should evaluate the background and experience of fund managers. At a briefing this afternoon, a senior Treasury Department official involved in drafting the principles said that no new regulations had been proposed because the administration did not want to discourage innovation and risk-taking.“We want to encourage risk-taking in an organized fashion,” said the official, who spoke only on condition of not being identified. The announcement was hailed by a major trade association for the funds and for companies involved in the derivatives markets.“The agreement highlights the central role that market discipline plays in addressing the question of systemic risk and encourages regulators, investors, counterparties and investment pools alike to be proactive in assuring the healthy functioning of the markets,” said Robert G. Pickel, the executive director of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.The association said the agreement among the agencies and the administration “ represented significant progress in both understanding the challenges posed by a more dynamic and liquid market, as well as encouraging measures which will ensure that the benefits presented by the global financial markets continue well into the future.”But other experts said the guidelines would have limited effect.“They are regulating around the peripheries,” said Jay G. Baris, a securities lawyer with Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel in New York. “They are turning up the heat on disclosures, on fiduciaries to determine suitability and on risk management. But they are going to stop short of substantive regulation of hedge funds or of unregistered hedge fund advisers.”'"
"'07-02-23,'0','Catalonia has a proud modern-dance tradition. And Ramón Oller (pronounced OH-yay) is one of its best-known choreographers, familiar to New York audiences from the works he created for Ballet Hispanico. Now he is back with his own Compañía Metros in “Carmen,” which opened on Wednesday night at the Joyce Theater for a two-week engagement.Mr. Oller’s Carmen, danced on opening night by Sandrine Rouet, is startlingly different from the sultry norm. She’s a tomboy who clambers down to the stage from a tower window of the cigarette factory where she works. She’s a child who crumples into a fetal position when abandoned by her lover and mocked by her fellow workers. But sadly this Carmen reverts to stereotype when she returns through the window in full sexy dress, puffing on a cigar and ready for grown-up peccadilloes.Mr. Oller tends to tell stories in his dances, usually at a leisurely, thoughtful pace. There is a mildness to his “Carmen,” set to the Bizet score and music by Martirio, that drags the narrative down. And he does not go far enough in his intriguing reworking of the main character.He has added what amounts to a live prop in the Gypsy, played by Mari Carmen García, an intrusive presence who seems to be an older Carmen looking back on her life. And the final outpouring of baptismal water seems an afterthought. If only we could have seen the child beneath the glamorous new Carmen for a moment or two.Sau-Ching Wong is a larger than life and luscious Micaela whose pain is palpable. And Javier García is a down-to-earth José, in a lead cast completed by Christian Lozano.But the choreography is sometimes bland. What happened to the gritty distinction of the young first wave of Catalan modern-dance artists who came to the United States in the late 1980s?'"

"'07-02-24,'0','The managers, on the other hand, are mostly conservative, from Protestant backgrounds with working- class roots, and have spent much less time outside Western Michigan.“We just happen to be a Jewish family sitting in the middle of this,” said Mitch Padnos, growing up and living in an area that has historically been heavily Dutch. He added that the elder Padnoses expected their children to behave in ways that reflected well on their religion. “My dad was very sensitive,” he said.As a result, the third-generation Padnoses view themselves as part entrepreneur, part social worker. And it is the latter quality they seem most anxious to pass along to the managers. “I’m becoming more and more missionarylike,” said Jeff Padnos. “Doing business right really is like applied religion.”He said he recently agreed to hire a man with a criminal record. If it works out, he said, “you remember that better than any buy-low, sell-high deal you’ve made.” The company said it never laid off workers.A family foundation holds about $7 million and contributes to many local organizations each year. The Padnos name is all over Western Michigan, adorning the Amtrak station here, the engineering school at nearby Grand Valley State University and sculpture gardens in the area.“They’re wonderful benefactors,” said the mayor of Holland, Al McGeehan.Sure, the Padnoses could sell the company and probably collect considerably more than $100 million. But selling, said Mitch Padnos, would make him just another idle, rich guy. “I have friends who have no place to go every day,” he said, his bow tie carefully knotted, mustache precisely trimmed. “Once you’ve sold your business, you’re done.”Indeed, many entrepreneurial dynasties build family customs around the business itself, meaning a sale can emotionally upend the family. “It’s really a quagmire,” said Ted Clark, executive director of the Northeastern University Center for Family Business. “We hear all the time: I never want to sell.”Thus three years ago, the Padnoses began talking to the managers about taking on more responsibility and perhaps one day running the company. “The first thing they all said was, ‘O.K., when?’ ” said Shelley Padnos, Mitch’s sister.She went to a business ethics seminar two years ago and met the speaker, Michael DeWilde. He teaches philosophy at Grand Valley State. A one-time carpenter and labor organizer, he became known in the Grand Rapids area for a program that brought literary classics to groups that normally do not read them, including some prisoners.Ms. Padnos was impressed, and invited Mr. DeWilde to meet with the managers. They communicated poorly with one another, often running problems through a family member, she said. She said she felt they were uncomfortable with ambiguity, seeing issues as black and white. And she worried their conservatism would change the way Padnos was run.“They would tell you, God helps them who help themselves,” she said. In her view, though, “that only works if the playing field is level.”“They need to be exposed to the big wide world,” Ms. Padnos recalled thinking. (She gave each one a Sunday New York Times subscription.) “It is not unusual to grow up in Holland and think most of the world is Christian Reformed and white.”The managers, mostly in their 30s, grew up in the area, went to college and, after a job or two, came to Padnos. Al Tomes, director of operations and a 16-year Padnos employee, grew up in a one-stoplight town near here, where his parents operated a campground, he said.Before enlisting in the Army and graduating from college, Mr. Tomes said, he mulled a career at his hometown grocery store. But he decided he would always be beneath the owner’s several children. “There just wasn’t going to be room,” he said.Perhaps it is too easy for the Padnoses to think of the managers as still-developing personalities, rather than merely as fellow adults with a different point of view. “We all came in here young,” said Matthew Heitmeier, a manager who buys and sells metals for Padnos. “It’s a parent-child relationship. I don’t think we’re as closed-minded as they think we are. They hire conservative people. They want us to appreciate the liberal mind-set.”When Mr. DeWilde, the professor, started meeting with the managers every two weeks in September 2005, he said they initially focused on traditional career concerns. Some saw the meetings as a way to advance themselves as candidates to run the company.Over time, however, they were persuaded that the Padnoses had no intention of naming a single heir apparent. The four family members practice an unusually democratic management. Each is paid exactly the same and no major decision is made unless all four agree.Beginning to think like a team, the managers offered each other constructive criticism.They told Scott O’Neil, the sales manager, he shoots from the hip at times.They told Al Tomes to dress more nicely and work on his grammar.And Mr. O’Neil told Timothy Beers, who manages administrative functions, to stop hanging around the office into the evening just because Jeff Padnos stays late (he also starts late). “Tim was always there,” Mr. O’Neil said. Mr. Beers denied hanging around unnecessarily.The managers were assigned readings of Thoreau, Sophocles and a recent essay on Freud. They spent a long weekend in Chicago seeing plays, touring exhibitions of art and architecture and eating at fancy restaurants. And in recent weeks they have debated how to give away $40,000 of the Padnoses’ money, an exercise in becoming philanthropists.Mr. Beers, a 12-year Padnos employee, said: “I’ve enjoyed it. But it hasn’t been an easy transition. While you’re sitting there watching a Shakespeare play, it’s hard not to think about all the things you could be getting done at work.”The founder, Louis Padnos, fled Russia at age 13, made his way to Amsterdam, learned to speak Dutch and got on a ship to the United States. He had relatives in Chicago. He became a junk peddler, common work among Dutch immigrants at the time. Because he did not speak English, someone suggested that he move across Lake Michigan to Holland, the Dutch enclave.From a cart and later a horse and wagon, his business prospered. He essentially scoured the area for scrap metal and other discards, then sold the stuff to mills as raw material. Two sons joined and expanded the business. By 1979, Mitch and Jeff Padnos, cousins, joined their fathers. Shelley and Jeff’s brother, Doug Padnos, joined later.It remains a tough business and it is dangerous. Two workers have died at Padnos plants in recent years. One was hit last year by a giant blade he was changing on a metal shredder. The other was run over in 2001 by a freight train as he swept scraps away from the tracks.Scrap prices, meanwhile, move wildly, and a dealer stuck with a lot of inventory in a plunging market can be wiped out. Padnos will not disclose profits on its annual sales of about $300 million. However, if its profit margin last year roughly matched the industry’s biggest company, Metal Management, Padnos could have had after-tax profit of $15 million to $20 million.The managers, implored to “act like owners,” do not see the financial statements, and that irks some of them.“If they want these people to be more like them, they need to have access to the same information,” said Mr. Clark, the Northeastern University family business director. Without the context of financial information, he added, the managers cannot be expected to make informed decisions.“It’s an inconsistency,” Jeff Padnos conceded. “It’s something we wrestle with.”'"
"'07-02-24,'0','WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 — A United States attorney in Grand Rapids, Mich., is leaving her job, the eighth federal prosecutor to be removed in a Justice Department shake-up of prosecutors, government officials said Friday.The prosecutor, Margaret M. Chiara, told her staff that she would leave office on March 16, making her the latest casualty of Justice Department dismissals that Democrats in Congress have criticized as politically motivated.Like the other ousted prosecutors, Ms. Chiara is a Republican. She took office in 2001 after twice being elected a county prosecutor. She had also served as policy director of the Michigan Supreme Court. Her office has said that she has emphasized reducing gun violence and improving law enforcement programs for American Indians.Justice Department officials declined to comment on Ms. Chiara’s removal, which was first reported on Friday by The Grand Rapids Press. A telephone call to her office was not returned, but other officials confirmed that she had been asked to leave.Senator Charles E.

"'07-02-24,'0','For now, administration officials say, Mr. Bush is happy to leave the Iranians guessing. He ordered an additional aircraft carrier into waters within striking distance of Iran and its nuclear facilities last month, a step that senior officials say they believe took the Iranian leadership by surprise. He has issued warnings to the Iranians not to meddle in Iraq and has focused on intelligence findings that the most deadly bombs used against Americans in Iraq bear marks of Iranian origins.But Mr. Bush has denied that he is trying to provoke Iran into a response that would provide a pretext for direct confrontation. “To say it is provoking Iran is just a wrong way to characterize the commander in chief’s decision to do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm’s way,” Mr. Bush said at a news conference on Feb. 15, shortly after accusing Iranian forces, but not necessarily the country’s leadership, of worsening the violence in Iraq.In interviews in recent days, three administration officials, all of whom insisted on anonymity because they were speaking about a strategy still being developed, said the carrier movements, the accusations about weapons in Iraq and the use of sanctions against the government were all intended to provide Mr. Bush with some leverage in dealing with Iran.The officials have made little secret of their desire to fuel dissatisfaction inside Iran with the country’s fiery president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who on Friday vowed anew to continue enriching uranium, saying, “If we show weakness in front of the enemies, they will increase their expectations.”R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for policy and the lead negotiator on Iran, said Thursday that the multipronged approach was showing an effect. “We’ve roiled their government, and I think we’ve shocked them a bit,” he said.Mr. Burns is headed to London for a meeting on Monday with France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China about devising a new, tighter set of sanctions against the Iranian government — one that might include a further crackdown on export credits or conventional arms sales.Mr. Burns will undoubtedly run into more resistance from the Russians and the Chinese, who told American officials flatly in December that they would not put additional economic pressure on the Iranians. But Mr. Burns said he was not looking for a major escalation of sanctions, and other administration officials say that modest steps would be fine for now.“The most important thing about the last resolution was that we achieved a consensus, we kept the Russians and Chinese on board,” one senior administration official said. “And in the end, that’s what has serious impact in Iran.”Administration officials say that the need to hold that consensus together is overriding the differences on Iran that roiled the administration in its first term. Back in 2002 and 2003, when the prospect of a nuclear-capable Iran was more distant, the administration decided not to explore several offers through intermediaries to open discussions. Mr. Cheney and others argued that the success they anticipated in Iraq would chasten the Iranians, bringing them to the table on more favorable terms.Mr. Cheney, however, appears increasingly isolated now that many of his protégés have departed the Defense Department, the State Department and other corners of the administration. He was described by several top officials as only a minor player in the president’s decision in May to offer incentives to Iran if it agreed to suspend its fuel production.But the Iranians did not accept last year’s offer, and if the administration and the Europeans are unable to find a formula that works for all sides, the talk of military options is bound to persist.“No one has defined where the red line is that we can’t let the Iranians step over,” one senior official said. But Mr. Bush, the official said, is determined “not to let them get one lugnut turn away from having a bomb.”Some diplomats who are trying to bridge the differences between Washington and Tehran insist that Mr. Bush is going to have to give some ground. “To focus only on suspension in my view is not the right approach,” Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said early this week to The Financial Times.In Vienna on Friday, Dr. ElBaradei repeated his idea of a “time out” to allow talks, with Tehran halting uranium enrichment and the United Nations suspending sanctions. And he has consistently preferred to allow a modest amount of face-saving “research and development” in Iran, and focus instead on preventing the country from having an industrial capacity to produce nuclear fuel.So far, though, Mr. Bush has said that even that much nuclear knowledge cannot be allowed in a country he does not trust.'"
"'07-02-24,'0','Fifteen years after the cold war’s end, it would seem that everyone involved should know better. But the Bush administration’s tone-deaf plan to station parts of a missile defense system in Eastern Europe and Moscow’s snarling response show that all sides could use a refresher course in diplomatic sense and civility.American officials insist that the 10 interceptors it is planning to place in Poland and the early warning radar for the Czech Republic are supposed to defend Europe from Iran’s missiles — not Russia’s. And there is no doubt they’re telling the truth. The untested system could be easily overwhelmed by Russia’s huge nuclear arsenal.It is unlikely, however, that more military posturing against Iran is going to persuade Tehran to give up its nuclear ambitions. Russia’s furious reaction to the stationing of even weak missile defenses near its borders (and on the territory of its former satellites), while wildly out of proportion, was also utterly predictable. A top Russian general — who sounded as if he’d slept through the last 15 years — warned the Poles and the Czechs that if they went along with America’s plans, Russia’s missiles “will be capable of targeting the facilities.”The mixture of crocodile tears and threats from Russian officials seems overly dramatic — and very much in character for President Vladimir Putin, who is hoping to divert attention from his own thuggery at home, not to mention his desire to reassert power in Russia’s old neighborhood.Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who cut her teeth on Kremlinology, should have expected Moscow’s reaction. And Ms. Rice, who’s been counting on Russia to help keep up the pressure against Iran’s nuclear efforts, should have known that provoking Moscow this way could be especially counterproductive. Add to that the fact that the move has annoyed “old European” allies, like Germany, which are central to efforts to contain Iran, and it seems like another example of diplomatic negligence.In any case, this is a fight that should be quickly reined in. Washington has wisely chosen to respond calmly to Russia’s vitriol, and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, has taken some welcome steps to moderate Moscow’s stance.'"
"'07-02-24,'0','Bundling new technology into Windows has long been the Microsoft game plan. The most storied case came a decade ago when Microsoft overcame the challenge posed by another Silicon Valley highflier, Netscape, offering another crucial layer of software, the Internet browser. Microsoft feared a competitor’s Web browser, running on top of the operating system, could reduce the power of Windows.“There are certainly some analogies here to what Microsoft did with Netscape,” said Mendel Rosenblum, a founder of VMware and its chief scientist.The tactics Microsoft used in the browser battle, of course, led to a host of antitrust troubles for the big software maker in the United States and Europe.This time, in the market for virtual-machine software, Microsoft is more restrained. Bowing to customer requests, Microsoft began more than a year ago to change its software licenses so its products could run in virtual machines like VMware offerings.But in recent months, according to VMware, Microsoft has introduced new restrictions on how Microsoft products can be used in virtual machines in new ways, beyond simply dividing a single physical computer into several virtual ones.This next wave of virtual technology, analysts say, includes software that lets virtual machines move freely across many physical machines, juggling computing chores, so that applications do not crash and Web response times are faster. Another promising new ability is running desktop personal computers as virtual-machine software, hosted and managed securely from a data center.VMware, however, points to license changes on Microsoft software that it says limit the ability to move virtual-machine software around data centers to automate the management of computing work. A white paper detailing VMware’s concerns will be posted Monday on its Web site (www.vmware.com), the company said.“Microsoft is looking for any way it can to gain the upper hand,” said Diane Greene, the president of VMware.Yet VMware is making no antitrust claims against Microsoft, and legal experts question whether the friction between the companies is anything more than two rivals taking different paths to an emerging market.“This seems to be a far more subtle, informed and polished form of competitive aggression than we’ve seen from Microsoft in the past,” said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. “And Microsoft has no obligation to facilitate a competitor.”In the past, said Mike Neil, general manager of virtualization strategy at Microsoft, customers paid a license fee when Windows was installed on a physical machine. But he said virtual-machine software breaks the tight link between the operating system and the hardware, raising the possibility that customers could be using Windows more but not paying for it. So now, he said, the license fee is based on when a copy of Windows is used, whether in a virtual or physical machine.The license changes, Mr. Neil added, were not designed as a competitive tool. And he sees no evidence of any anticompetitive impact. “Look at VMware’s financial success and you have to ask, How disadvantaged are they really?” he observed.VMware is certainly thriving these days. Its sales reached $709 million in 2006, nearly double the previous year’s figure. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $232 million, growing 100 percent from the year-earlier quarter.VMware was founded in 1998 by Mr. Rosenblum, an operating-systems expert and an associate professor at Stanford University; Ms. Greene, a veteran of Silicon Graphics, Tandem, Sybase and a couple of start-ups, who is also Mr. Rosenblum’s wife; and three other computer scientists, Scott Devine, Edouard Bugnion and Edward Wang.Virtual-machine software dates to the 1960s, when I.B.M. used the technology to coax greater performance from costly mainframes. The achievement of Mr. Rosenblum and his team of Stanford-trained researchers was to develop virtual-machine software that worked, fast and reliably, on today’s lower-cost machines powered by microchips made by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.By late 2003, VMware was profitable and growing strongly, and its payroll was approaching 400 people. Its future would depend on keeping its talented team of computer scientists in place, and Google and others were dangling offers. So VMware agreed to sell itself for $635 million in cash to EMC, a leader in data storage systems that was expanding into software. VMware had talked to other companies including I.B.M. and Microsoft. But EMC, not being a major software company, offered VMware more independence.This month, EMC said it would give VMware an added measure of independence with a separate stock listing and its own shares to help retain its current work force of more than 2,500, and lure new talent. EMC will sell 10 percent of VMware in an initial public offering in the summer that analysts say is likely to value the company at 10 times what EMC paid for it just three years ago.VMware’s growth is explained by the experience of customers like the International Truck and Engine Corporation, a producer of diesel engines, trucks and school buses. A few years ago, Barry Naber, a technology manager at International Truck, the operating company of Navistar International, began looking for ways to curb the growth of server computers in its data center.Mr. Naber opted for VMware virtual-machine software, and today the company runs 230 applications, including expense, accounting, training and Web programs on 18 computers in its computer center in suburban Chicago. He estimates the savings for each virtual machine at $7,500 in hardware and maintenance costs avoided, or about $1.7 million.Mr. Naber also looked at Microsoft’s virtualization offering, but in tests found it was far slower and less reliable than VMware. “We’re entrenched with VMware for now,” he said.One thing that Microsoft has lacked is a hypervisor, the lowest level of software that rests on the hardware and partitions the computer so it can cleanly and efficiently run several virtual machines. Microsoft is developing a Windows hypervisor code-named Viridian. It will be tailored for the next version of the Windows server operating system, called Longhorn, scheduled to ship by the end of 2007. Viridian will be ready shortly after that. “Virtualization, frankly, is a feature,” Mr. Neil, the Microsoft manager, said. “It’s a great operating system feature.”Microsoft has built up its virtual-machine team in the last few years with internal hiring and a couple of small acquisitions. And having identified virtual software technology as a core ingredient to its operating system, Microsoft promises to become a daunting competitor eventually.Yet today, VMware holds an estimated 80 percent of the market for virtual-machine software that runs on computers powered by industry-standard Intel and A.M.D. microprocessors. “The market could change depending on what Microsoft does down the road, but VMware is the 800-pound gorilla of virtualization,” said John Humphreys, an analyst at IDC, a research firm.In the long term, VMware will also face competition from start-ups in the virtual-machine software market like Virtual Iron and XenSource. The start-ups note that only 5 to 7 percent of computers in data centers use virtual software. They see a market that is just beginning to take off with plenty of opportunity, if they can match VMware’s technology and charge less.Virtual Iron and XenSource take opposing views on Microsoft’s recent moves. “Microsoft sees VMware coming between them and their customers,” said John Thibault, president of Virtual Iron. “So Microsoft is manipulating its license terms to see if it can freeze the market and slow down the trend.”For its part, XenSource signed a deal last year with Microsoft to collaborate so that XenSource’s software will work well with the virtualization technology Microsoft is developing for the Windows Longhorn server. “We set out to partner with Microsoft,” said Peter Levine, president of XenSource, “and VMware chose to compete with Microsoft.”VMware, according to Microsoft, should see the wisdom of the path XenSource chose. In his meeting with corporate customers recently, Mr. Ballmer sketched out a future in which Microsoft would put fundamental virtual-machine software in its operating systems, and “VMware builds on top.”VMware is leery of such an accommodation, fearing it would prove to be a one-sided bargain. “We will not sign agreements that give Microsoft control of this layer,” Ms. Greene said.'"
"'07-02-24,'0','OTTAWA, Feb. 23 — American, Mexican and Canadian cabinet ministers met here on Friday to set the agenda for a meeting later this year by the leaders of the three countries, with the discussions taking an increased focus on protecting cross-border trade in the face of increasing border security measures.Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez met their Canadian and Mexican counterparts amid concerns that new United States border restrictions — particularly the requirement of passports, beginning in January 2008, for land and sea crossings — would hamper the $880 billion in annual trade among the countries.No firm agenda emerged for a planned meeting later this year of President Bush, President Felipe Calderón of Mexico and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada. But officials here were optimistic that the countries could continue to increase trade despite concerns by Canada over the passport requirement and by Mexico about United States plans to erect a security wall along their border.“This is a broad agenda that is going to make life better for people, and it is the only way that we can achieve security and prosperity,” Ms. Rice said.The passport requirement has been controversial in Canada, but its leaders have said they will adjust to, and not protest, the changes.“We recognize that that will have an effect on life in general,” Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day said. “That is why we pursue the areas of seeing our countries being as competitive as possible.”'"
"'07-02-24,'0','Richard Lehman, a high-ranking Central Intelligence Agency analyst who, on orders from a perturbed President John F. Kennedy, developed the succinct intelligence summary that has been handed to presidents each morning for 45 years, died last Saturday near his home in Concord, N.H. He was 83.The cause was a stroke, his son David said.Mr. Lehman created the President’s Intelligence Check List (referred to as the “pickle”) in 1961, after President Kennedy complained of being overwhelmed by intelligence memorandums, many duplicating material while sometimes leaving out vital information.“Kennedy’s enthusiastic response to the PICL ensured that it became an agency institution,” Richard Kovar, a C.I.A. analyst, wrote in 2000, in an introduction to an interview he conducted with Mr. Lehman for “Studies in Intelligence,” the C.I.A.’s quarterly in-house journal. “For many years thereafter, Lehman played a key role in supervising the agency’s current intelligence support for the White House, including briefings of presidential candidates.”In his interview with Mr. Kovar, Mr. Lehman recalled how “Kennedy was blindsided a couple of times” because he had not received important briefings. The president complained to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who, Mr. Lehman said, “came down on” the senior White House military aide, Maj. Gen. Chester Clifton, “like a ton of bricks.”Mr. Lehman said General Clifton told him to produce a daily memo that would fit into a breast pocket so the president could carry it around with him. What the general wanted, Mr. Lehman said, was “a single publication, no sources barred, covering the whole ground, and written as much as possible in the president’s language rather than in officialese.”'"
"'07-02-24,'0','In one, relatives of British soldiers slain in Iraq began a peace vigil in blue nylon tents near Mr. Blair’s office, and in the other, Mr. Blair pondered a new military deployment in Afghanistan.Just two days after Mr. Blair announced a withdrawal of 1,600 of the 7,100 British soldiers in southern Iraq, Defense Secretary Des Browne said “some additional forces” — possibly about 1,000 soldiers — would be sent to join the 5,600 Britons who are part of NATO forces confronting an expected spring offensive by the Taliban in Afghanistan.Word of the missile defense negotiations followed remarks in Washington on Thursday by Lt. Gen. Henry A. Obering III, who discussed the deployment of missile defenses in Britain, saying, “We are always looking for new ways to partner with the United Kingdom, whether that be co-development or a hosting, or any of the activities of that nature.” He also said that radar systems were already in final testing in Britain.At first the American Embassy in London made remarks that the British news media seized on as a rebuff of Mr. Blair’s interest. David Johnson, the deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy in London, told a BBC radio interviewer: “I would see as we go forward. There may be opportunities for us to talk to other countries about other needs, but right now we’re concentrating on the Czech Republic and on Poland as the primary sites where we would be looking for this.”In a subsequent statement, Mr. Johnson said any suggestion that his remarks “were a rebuff to the British government is nonsense. We have been and will be in discussions with the British government as we develop our missile defense system and be open to opportunities for joint work as we go forward.”The negotiations are most likely to raise political hackles at a time when many in Mr. Blair’s Labor Party and in the opposition Conservatives are pressing for Britain to distance itself from the United States after their close and sometimes unpopular alliance in Iraq.The Conservatives said the government had given no information about its discussions with the United States. “If there is a request to base part of the U.S. National Missile Defense system in the U.K., we would need to see the exact nature of that request before taking a decision,” said Liam Fox, the Conservative spokesman on defense. The government, he said, needs “to be more honest with the opposition” to secure bipartisan support for the proposed missile deployment.Mr. Fox also took issue with the plan to deploy more troops to Afghanistan, saying other European countries, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain, should commit troops in the hazardous Helmand Province of southern Afghanistan, where many British soldiers are based.“It is clear that the government has failed to get our NATO allies to carry their share of the burden in Afghanistan,” he said, complaining that, with deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, “it is clear now that our army is so overstretched we can’t carry two conflicts.”Apart from Iraq and Afghanistan, British troops are deployed in the Balkans and in Northern Ireland.The political hazards of Mr. Blair’s military ventures were underlined by the protest on Whitehall, the broad boulevard running by the gated and closely guarded entrance to Downing Street, where Mr. Blair has his office and residence.Rose Gentle, whose 19-year-old son Gordon was killed in Basra, Iraq, in 2004, led a small group of protesters who pitched camp and submitted a letter addressed to Mr. Blair calling for a meeting with him.“This is our sixth such visit, and each time you have not seen fit to give us a few minutes of your time,” the letter said. “We have a number of questions that we need answered about the deaths of our sons in Iraq, and we insist that you meet us.”“Please believe us, Mr. Blair, that neither we nor these questions will go away,” the letter said.'"
"'07-02-24,'0','Mr. Wall was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1946 and has spent most of his career there. He is one of the most staunchly traditional of the untraditional artists to emerge from the turmoil of the 1970s, when art was pulled apart by the political ambition and visual privations of Conceptual Art. He is also one of the best.Over the years, his circle in Vancouver has included camera-friendly and concept-inclined artists like Ian Wallace, Rodney Graham, Ken Lum, Roy Arden and Stan Douglas. He also belongs to a far-flung but mostly New York-based branch of Pictures artists that specializes in staged or set-up photography and includes Cindy Sherman, James Casebere, Laurie Simmons, Thomas Demand and Gregory Crewdson. But Mr. Wall’s work has a breadth that few of his contemporaries match, as well as a missionary zeal that is cloaked by an extraordinary visual ambition.As with the German painter Gerhard Richter, all this has given Mr. Wall an unwavering approval rating. His work is sanctioned by academicians and art theorists, who believe fervently in art’s social and moral responsibilities and deplore its complicity in the culture industry. But his images are also a hit at market — a must-have for both museums and private collectors. And they are immensely accessible, enjoyed by even the most inexperienced art viewer.Artistically, Mr. Wall was both a prodigy and a late bloomer. He started painting young, in a studio in a shed in his family’s backyard, and as a teenager worked his way from Edward Hopper to Robert Motherwell. As an art student in the late 1960s, he gravitated to Conceptualism; he considered it the next, natural stage of Modernism, as well as the way to resist art’s commodity status.Peter Galassi, chief curator of the Modern’s department of photography, and Neal Benezra, director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, organized the exhibition. In his catalog essay, Mr. Galassi describes Mr. Wall as almost intimidatingly erudite: steeped in art history, criticism and theory. He depicts a true believer in the Modernist and then Post-Modernist mission that art should change the world, who has been continually forced into deeper artistic waters by his faith in painting.Mr. Wall had trouble reconciling this faith with Conceptual Art’s dismissal of the art object and tradition. By 1971 he had stopped making art and was studying art history, while also trying unsuccessfully to become a filmmaker and then a screenwriter. This foray left him thinking about photography and how it might be used to make something equal to painting. These inklings coalesced during a trip to Spain in 1977, where he visited the Prado’s wealth of painting and was struck by the luminosity of light-box advertisements on the streets of Barcelona.As installed by Mr. Galassi and Mr. Wall, the MoMA exhibition proceeds thematically and chronologically from austere, cerebral early works to more lush, complicated and mysterious later ones. But you grasp the complexity of Mr. Wall’s program with the first image, “The Destroyed Room,” which shows an extensively vandalized bedroom strewn with a woman’s clothing. Few viewers may realize that it is based on Delacroix’s “Death of Sardanapalus.” But you do see that this is the aftermath of some kind of cataclysm — whether domestic or climatic — and looking through the room’s makeshift door and window, you realize that it is all fake, built in a studio.As the images proceed in related clusters — landscapes dominate one gallery; single figures in interiors, another; people intensely looking, a third — you watch Mr. Wall’s techniques expand and contract.Some works are relatively straight images in a mode that he calls “near documentary,” like the panoramic vista of town, bay, bridge and mountain that seems to exalt both nature’s grandeur and human enterprise until you notice its title, “The Old Prison.” This draws your attention to a 19th-century structure with barred windows at the picture’s edge.Some scenes are staged but simple, like the bum in “Milk,” whose clenched gesture sends an elegant, pure spill of milk into the air — summing up a lifetime of frustration and rage. Others are elaborately orchestrated, like the astounding image of a black man hunched in a messy basement whose ceiling is an obsessive field of electric light bulbs. Created from scratch in the artist’s studio, this is a faithful recreation of an integral scene from Ralph Ellison’s novel “Invisible Man.”Other images resulted from scores of photographs digitally noodled together into a single consuming vision. The most exhilarating of these is “A Sudden Gust of Wind,” based on a famous Hokusai print in which several travelers are buffeted by unexpected turbulence that sends the sheets of a manuscript spiraling through the air.Another example is an elaborate battle scene made in 1992 but based on the Soviet Union’s conflict with Afghanistan in the 1980s. Continuing in the tradition of Otto Dix and George Grosz, but also harking back to the French academic painter Meissonier, the image has a strangely old-fashioned look, as if just exhumed from a war museum. Until you notice that this is a macabre vision: the dead Soviet soldiers strewn about are all awake — laughing, crying and fingering their gruesome wounds.Yet sometimes Mr. Wall’s complexity is deceiving. The riveting artificiality of “Restoration” actually shows three true conservators at work in Switzerland on a 19th-century diorama of an 1870 battle. The 180-degree image curves away from us with a vertiginous sweep, while creating a heady mix of art’s attempt to recreate life and life’s attempt to preserve art.In recent years, Mr. Wall has seemed to flounder a bit, but perhaps he is going still deeper. He has printed some images on paper — like “After ‘Spring Snow’ by Yukio Mishima,” another scene from a novel — that look a trifle drab without the help of the light box. Other images are still gorgeous but more conventionally poetic; for example, the surrealist “Flooded Grave” shows an open grave in a sodden cemetery filled not only with water but also with orange starfish and sea urchins. The final image of the show is of the spattered staining bench and cans in a furniture factory: it might almost be an expression of regret about the painting path not taken.Yet Mr. Wall’s images can still muster a challenging visual and psychic power. In “A View From an Apartment,” the landscape visible through a bay window forms an extraordinary yet intrusive picture-within-a-picture, though the two women who occupy the apartment seem oblivious to it. The everyday signs of their domestic life have a pleasant disorder that may bring to mind the ransacked bedroom depicted in the show’s first image. But this room is far from wrecked.'"
"'07-02-24,'0','On Thursday night the New York Philharmonic played the world premiere of a fine trombone concerto by Melinda Wagner. But from the program, you might have thought the point was to obscure the work, not highlight it.The piece was preceded by Mozart’s flute and harp concerto (with Robert Langevin and Nancy Allen) and Schumann’s Concertstück for four horns and orchestra. After it came Gershwin’s “American in Paris.”It was an odd patchwork of a program. On the one hand, it featured pieces that spotlight unusual instruments, to complement the trombone concerto; on the other, it seemed to sugarcoat the new work by surrounding it with light and easy standards, as if enticing the audience to sit through the contemporary piece, creating an overall program that was artistically not very heavy-hitting.One unintended advantage of this plan was that after the intermission, Ms. Wagner’s piece practically leapt off the stage, so vital and fresh did it sound, compared with what had gone before it. And this concerto certainly belongs on a program of unusual instruments. It is thickly sown with interesting sounds — not sound effects, but a range of timbres and textures, partly supplied by a large and varied battery of four percussionists, woven into the fabric of the music. To balance the mellow trombone — played with a beautiful, burnished richness by Joseph Alessi, for whom the piece was written — the composer pitched her work dark: lots of viola, cello, bass and other trombones anchored the music.Ms. Wagner writes strikingly well for orchestra; this piece used the whole spectrum of colors available to her without ever becoming dense or cloying. The thickest textures came in the second movement, “Elemental Things,” and even here, where movement slowed to the measured pace of a large beast waking up, long-held notes were brought into focus by details: the whisper of a brushed cymbal, the punctuation of piano.This smart, complex score retained an organic quality throughout, a kind of clear emotion running through its rich variety; its first movement, “Satyr,” was the most vivid of the three and fit Mr. Alessi perfectly.'"
"'07-02-24,'0','Mr. Johnson, whose name is pronounced jay, leaned back in his chair and said: “Joyce, we had 30 or 40 people here in my office last night for a preliminary meeting on this, and another 30 on the phone. One thing you learn quickly is that when the name Barack Obama is involved, you always have more people show up than you expected.”Mr. Johnson, a lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkin, Wharton & Garrison, is a linchpin in uphill efforts to build a donor base for Mr. Obama in New York, where many potential supporters have at some time in the last 16 years aided the Clintons.Mr. Obama’s ability to raise significant amounts of money depends on the success that people like Mr. Johnson have among New York’s all-important Democratic fund-raising circles, which the Clinton camp has moved aggressively to corral by battling any perception that elements of the party are drifting away. And part of Mr. Johnson’s pitch must be that by contributing to the Obama campaign, Democrats are not showing disloyalty to the Clintons, a fear that can be heard in his conversations with donors.“Look, if it doesn’t work out, then hopefully the nominee will get over it,” he told one donor in discussing the possibility of a Clinton victory and its ramifications for the Obama camp. “She’ll need all the help she can get, particularly from the people associated with his campaign.”The Clintons have dominated the fund-raising race for Democratic-party money in New York since long before Mrs. Clinton held office in the state, Mr. Johnson said. “She and her husband have been working New York for 16 years and they know where they are,” he added. “But I think we’re going to surprise a lot of people with who signs up.”The Obama campaign has already attracted a number of fund-raisers with ties to Mrs. Clinton or her husband, like Orin Kramer, a prominent hedge fund manager from New Jersey, and James S. Rubin, a private equity manager and son of Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary. The younger Mr. Rubin was also a finance director for New York during President Bill Clinton’s 1996 re-election campaign, and held positions at the Federal Communications Commission during the second Clinton administration.Other former Clintonites who are raising money for Mr. Obama include Joshua L. Steiner, a private equity principal; Michael Froman, a Citigroup executive; and Brian Mathis of Provident Group. All of them are young (in their 40s) and served in senior positions in Mr. Clinton’s Treasury Department a decade ago (Mr. Froman and Mr. Mathis were friends with Mr. Obama at Harvard Law School). Another high-profile Obama fund-raiser is Earl G. Graves, the publisher of Black Enterprise magazine, who in 2000 was listed by the White House as an overnight guest of the Clintons.The Obama campaign hopes to draw from pools that barely existed four years ago, particularly hedge fund and private-equity fund principals who only recently acquired their money and their interest in the political process.But another strategy holds that in order to keep up with Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Johnson and his cohorts will have to succeed at poaching traditional Clinton donors.Already, the bulk of New York’s traditional Democratic money elite — people on the level of Alan Patricof, Steven Rattner, and Hassan Nemazee — has pledged to support Mrs. Clinton.But the drift of some New York donors, along with the switch by some former Clinton backers on the West Coast, like David Geffen, has elevated hopes among Mr. Obama’s supporters. There is no consensus among his financial supporters as to whether the feud this week over Mr. Geffen’s critical comments about the Clintons is helping or hindering their efforts. Still, several of them said privately that they had been enjoying the sparring.“It’s important to demonstrate that Barack’s willing to hit back, though I’m not sure this is the opportunity I would’ve picked,” one said.Mr. Kramer, the hedge fund manager, remains an admirer of Mrs. Clinton, and said he agonized over the move but was swayed partially by the grass-roots approach of the Obama campaign. “Making choices involving people you genuinely care about is harrowing,” he said. “I made the decision when I did to bring the pain to an end.”Still, of his new endeavor, Mr. Kramer said, “It’s like the Red Sox looking for fans at Yankee Stadium.”Mr. Johnson, 49, is aware that his taking up with Mr. Obama marks a defection from the Clintons. He was the general counsel to the Air Force for more than two years during President Clinton’s second term. Mr. Clinton’s trusted adviser, Vernon E. Jordan Jr. — an old family friend of Mr. Johnson —helped him get that job.Mr. Johnson urged almost every person he reached by phone to look up the speech that Mr. Obama made before the Illinois Senate in October 2002. In the speech, Mr. Obama outlined his opposition to going to war in Iraq, highlighting the sharp contrast to Mrs. Clinton’s vote that year to authorize military action against Iraq.He is working his connections, which include a 300-person master list heavily weighted with fellow lawyers, members of a black professionals fraternity to which he belongs, and veterans of John Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign, for which he served as special counsel.“Among the attorneys on the Ivy League side, he definitely is appealing,” Mr. Johnson said of Mr. Obama. His pitch to one fellow lawyer with whom he had previously traded calls, was this efficient:“So, Barack.” Pause. “Sounds like all your buddies from Harvard Law are involved too.” Pause. “Have you met him before?” Pause. “The base level is $1,000.”Although campaign-finance regulations bar individual donors from giving more than $2,300 per election to a campaign, as a “bundler” Mr. Johnson is expected to raise much more on the breadth of his Rolodex and the depth of his persuasive skills. The invitation to the March 9 event lists Mr. Johnson and his wife, along with about a dozen other couples or individuals, as gala “chairs” who have pledged to raise $100,000 — all in increments of $2,300 or less.Despite Mr. Johnson’s considerable experience in the political sphere, participation in one of the Renaissance Weekend retreats made popular by the Clintons, and his volunteer position on the Kerry campaign, he did not until last June become a legitimate fund-raising player. He has since been sought out by candidates.“I got a call from the Menendez Senate campaign, and they asked me to host a party with Bobbi Brown, who has the cosmetics line,” Mr. Johnson recalled (his family and Ms. Brown’s live in Montclair, N.J., a state where Robert Menendez is a senator). “Menendez got Barack and Cory Booker to do this event with us. That was when I met Barack. We raised between $300,000 and $500,000 in one day, and my name was associated with that event.”In the months that followed, Mr. Johnson said: “John Edwards, Bill Richardson, Jim Webb, Harold Ford, they all came here. Harold Ford, he has his little entourage. He sat right there in the chair next to the TV.”He had expected to wait for the outcome of the 2008 primaries before signing on with a candidate, but after seeing Mr. Obama hold forth at a fall book-signing on the Upper East Side, Mr. Johnson was won over.Then, the day before Thanksgiving, Mr. Johnson received a call at home from Mr. Obama.“He said, ‘I’m thinking about running for president. Can you not commit to anybody until I decide?’ ” Mr. Johnson said. “Now, we really hit it off. I said, ‘Barack, I’m with you.’ ”'"

"'07-02-25,'0','Citigroup, one of the world’s largest banks, is expected to name Gary L. Crittenden as its new chief financial officer in a move that aims to appease frustrated investors and end weeks of top management turmoil.Mr. Crittenden, a 53-year-old executive who has been American Express’ financial chief for the last six years, could be named shortly, according to two people briefed on the search. He will replace Sallie L. Krawcheck, who was in that job for the past two years but was moved out in a recent management shuffle.Mr. Crittenden, a strong financial operator at American Express, is seen as someone who can potentially win Wall Street’s support for an ambitious integration strategy that Charles O. Prince III, Citigroup’s chairman and chief executive, has set in motion. So far, it has yielded few results. With a team of young and unproven managers at Citigroup, Mr. Crittenden now becomes the leading candidate to replace Mr. Prince at the helm of the global bank.For Mr. Prince, the selection of a new chief financial officer is a pivotal one. If it jumpstarts progress, Mr. Prince may be able to reverse the company’s severe underperformance and turn the barrage of public criticism against him into a wave of support. If it does not, he could find himself quickly out of a job.Mr. Prince is under pressure from investors to improve the company’s sluggish stock price at a time when many of its rivals, especially in investment banking, have reported banner years. Citigroup’s rising expenses have drawn serious concerns, and its revenues have slowed along with the rest of the American consumer economy.'"
"'07-02-25,'0','On Saturday, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who has led a Congressional investigation into the dismissals and has been briefed on the evaluations, said the reports showed that new legislation was needed to keep the Justice Department from politically motivated firings.“As we feared, the comprehensive evaluations show these U.S. attorneys did not deserve to be fired,” Mr. Schumer said. “To the contrary, they reveal they were effective, respected and set appropriate priorities.”In response, a senior Justice Department official said the reviews, which focused on management practices within each United States attorney’s office, did not provide a broad or complete picture of the prosecutors’ performance.The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of personnel information, said, “The reviews don’t take into account whether the U.S. attorneys carried out departmental priorities.”Referring to the 94 United States attorney’s districts, the official said, “You can’t have 94 different sets of priorities,” suggesting that the dismissed prosecutors had failed to follow priorities set by the Justice Department in Washington.However, each case report included a statement that each of the ousted prosecutors had established strategic goals set by the Justice Department in high priority areas like counterterrorism, narcotics and gun violence.Of the dismissed prosecutors who have spoken publicly, all have said they were given no reason for their dismissal. At first, most appeared willing to leave quietly with the understanding that they were presidential appointees who could be replaced at any time.But their willingness to step down without complaint changed abruptly when Paul J. McNulty, the deputy attorney general, said at a Senate hearing earlier this month that most of the dismissals were carried out to correct performance problems, according to associates of several prosecutors.In recent days, several of the prosecutors have described conflicts with the Justice Department over death penalty cases and pending political corruption investigations as a possible factor in their firings. Justice Department officials have denied such issues were a factor.One of the most glowing evaluations was given to H. E. Cummins III of Arkansas, who was asked to leave last summer. Mr. Cummins was replaced temporarily by J. Timothy Griffin, a military and civilian prosecutor who also had close ties to Karl Rove, the senior White House political adviser. Mr. Griffin has since withdrawn his name from consideration as Mr. Cummins’s permanent successor.A report dated Jan. 23-27, 2006, said, “United States Attorney Cummins was very competent and highly regarded by the federal, judiciary, law enforcement and civil client agencies.” It said Mr. Cummins’s office had a “well-managed” antiterrorism program and “very successful” counternarcotics efforts.Another report, dated Feb. 7-11, 2005 evaluating the performance of Carol C. Lam, who was dismissed as the United States attorney in San Diego, concluded that she was “an effective manager and respected leader in the district.”'"
"'07-02-25,'0','TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 24 — Mariano Rivera, the Yankees’ closer, smiled while he was told some of the recent developments regarding the Boston Red Sox. Curt Schilling will become a free agent after the season. Manny Ramírez is not yet in camp. Daisuke Matsuzaka is a pitching machine.But Rivera, who also said he would test free agency after 2007, turned serious when he was asked if he could envision himself pitching for Boston.“I don’t think so,” Rivera said. “I respect the players and I respect the organization, but we’ve had so much happen between us. I don’t think I could do it.”Ten days ago, Rivera said that the Yankees would not have an advantage and that every team would have “a free shot” once he entered the free-agent market. But before Rivera threw his first cut fastball of the regular season, the heated rivalry with the Red Sox caused him to unofficially trim his potential suitors by one marquee club.“There’s too much between the teams,” Rivera said. “I like some of their players. They’re my friends. I just don’t think it would be possible.”At one point, Rivera pressed his knuckles together to illustrate the tense competition between the Yankees and the Red Sox. Rivera, who has been a member of the Yankees organization since 1990, has known only wanting to beat Boston, and that mission appears unlikely to change.'"
"'07-02-25,'0','Ms. Holloway is not the only angry one. The reorganization has left a messy aftermath of recrimination and tears on this rural campus of 2,400 students, 50 miles southwest of Indianapolis.The mass eviction battered the self-esteem of many of the former sorority members, and some withdrew from classes in depression. There have been student protests, outraged letters from alumni and parents, and a faculty petition calling the sorority’s action unethical.DePauw’s president, Robert G. Bottoms, issued a two-page letter of reprimand to the sorority. In an interview in his office, Dr. Bottoms said he had been stunned by the sorority’s insensitivity.“I had no hint they were going to disrupt the chapter with a membership reduction of this proportion in the middle of the year,” he said. “It’s been very upsetting.”The president of Delta Zeta, which has its headquarters in Oxford, Ohio, and its other national officers declined to be interviewed. Responding by e-mail to questions, Cynthia Winslow Menges, the executive director, said the sorority had not evicted the 23 women, even though the national officers sent those women form letters that said: “The membership review team has recommended you for alumna status. Chapter members receiving alumnae status should plan to relocate from the chapter house no later than Jan. 29, 2007.”Ms. Menges asserted that the women themselves had, in effect, made their own decisions to leave by demonstrating a lack of commitment to meet recruitment goals. The sorority paid each woman who left $300 to cover the difference between sorority and campus housing.The sorority “is saddened that the isolated incident at DePauw has been mischaracterized,” Ms. Menges wrote. Asked for clarification, the sorority’s public relations representative e-mailed a statement saying its actions were aimed at the “enrichment of student life at DePauw.”This is not the first time that the DePauw chapter of Delta Zeta has stirred controversy. In 1982, it attracted national attention when a black student was not allowed to join, provoking accusations of racial discrimination.Earlier this month, an Alabama lawyer and several other DePauw alumni who graduated in 1970 described in a letter to The DePauw, the student newspaper, how Delta Zeta’s national leadership had tried unsuccessfully to block a young woman with a black father and a white mother from joining its DePauw chapter in 1967.Despite those incidents, the chapter appears to have been home to a diverse community over the years, partly because it has attracted brainy women, including many science and math majors, as well as talented disabled women, without focusing as exclusively as some sororities on potential recruits’ sex appeal, former sorority members said.“I had a sister I could go to a bar with if I had boy problems,” said Erin Swisshelm, a junior biochemistry major who withdrew from the sorority in October. “I had a sister I could talk about religion with. I had a sister I could be nerdy about science with. That’s why I liked Delta Zeta, because I had all these amazing women around me.”But over the years DePauw students had attached a negative stereotype to the chapter, as evidenced by the survey that Pam Propsom, a psychology professor, conducts each year in her class. That image had hurt recruitment, and the national officers had repeatedly warned the chapter that unless its membership increased, the chapter could close.At the start of the fall term the national office was especially determined to raise recruitment because 2009 is the 100th anniversary of the DePauw chapter’s founding. In September, Ms. Menges and Kathi Heatherly, a national vice president of the sorority, visited the chapter to announce a reorganization plan they said would include an interview with each woman about her commitment. The women were urged to look their best for the interviews.The tone left four women so unsettled that they withdrew from the chapter almost immediately.Robin Lamkin, a junior who is an editor at The DePauw and was one of the 23 women evicted, said many of her sisters bought new outfits and modeled them for each other before the interviews. Many women declared their willingness to recruit diligently, Ms. Lamkin said.A few days after the interviews, national representatives took over the house to hold a recruiting event. They asked most members to stay upstairs in their rooms. To welcome freshmen downstairs, they assembled a team that included several of the women eventually asked to stay in the sorority, along with some slender women invited from the sorority’s chapter at Indiana University, Ms. Holloway said.“They had these unassuming freshman girls downstairs with these plastic women from Indiana University, and 25 of my sisters hiding upstairs,” she said. “It was so fake, so completely dehumanized. I said, ‘This calls for a little joke.’ ”Ms. Holloway put on a wig and some John Lennon rose-colored glasses, burst through the front door and skipped around singing, “Ooooh! Delta Zeta!” and other chants.The face of one of the national representatives, she recalled, “was like I’d run over her puppy with my car.”The national representatives announced their decisions in the form letters, delivered on Dec. 2, which said that Delta Zeta intended to increase membership to 95 by the 2009 anniversary, and that it would recruit using a “core group of women.”Elizabeth Haneline, a senior computer science major who was among those evicted, returned to the house that afternoon and found some women in tears. Even the chapter’s president had been kicked out, Ms. Haneline said, while “other women who had done almost nothing for the chapter were asked to stay.”Six of the 12 women who were asked to stay left the sorority, including Joanna Kieschnick, a sophomore majoring in English literature. “They said, ‘You’re not good enough’ to so many people who have put their heart and soul into this chapter that I can’t stay,” she said.In the months since, Cynthia Babington, DePauw’s dean of students, has fielded angry calls from parents, she said. Robert Hershberger, chairman of the modern languages department, circulated the faculty petition; 55 professors signed it.“We were especially troubled that the women they expelled were less about image and more about academic achievement and social service,” Dr. Hershberger said.During rush activities this month, 11 first-year students accepted invitations to join Delta Zeta, but only three have sought membership.On Feb. 2, Rachel Pappas, a junior who is the chapter’s former secretary, printed 200 posters calling on students to gather that afternoon at the student union. About 50 students showed up and heard Ms. Pappas say the sorority’s national leaders had misrepresented the truth when they asserted they had evicted women for lack of commitment.“The injustice of the lies,” she said, “is contemptible.”'"
"'07-02-25,'0','He now finds himself under pressure from several sources. One is his popular Shiite base, which demands protection from devastating Sunni attacks. Another is Iran, with which he has had long but difficult ties. Then there are renegade factions of his own militia that resent his move into the political mainstream.Finally, the Americans, who have accused Iran of supplying Shiite militias, including Mr. Sadr’s, with an especially deadly roadside bomb known as an explosively formed projectile, or E.F.P, which has killed an increasing number of American soldiers.It is not clear whether the Americans will move directly against him. The United States has demanded that the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki act forcefully against the Mahdi Army; Mr. Maliki, however, owes much of his political strength in the ruling Shiite coalition to Mr. Sadr’s backing.For now, American and Iraqi officials say Mr. Sadr seems to be cooperating with the effort to pacify Baghdad, ordering his men not to fight even as American armored vehicles roll into Mahdi strongholds in eastern Baghdad. He seems to be cleaning house of fighters who could taint him by association with Iran or with death squad killings. His aides say he has called for a sectarian truce. “Moktada al-Sadr said to protect your clerics, protect your shrines and cooperate with the government,” said Hazim al-Araji, head of the Sadr office in western Baghdad. “So no actions have been taken.”In perhaps his boldest move yet, Mr. Sadr has assisted the joint Iraqi-American campaign against parts of his militia, signaling whom to arrest and telling others to flee, said two Mahdi commanders and a Shiite politician in Baghdad. On his own, they said, Mr. Sadr has “frozen” more than 40 commanders, including about 20 with links to Iran.The moves are part of an organizational overhaul, the Sadr aides said. Though Mr. Sadr’s whereabouts are unknown — the Americans say he is in Iran, which his aides and Iran dispute — a new Mahdi general for all of Baghdad has been appointed for the first time, they said. Mr. Sadr has also selected new commanders for east and west Baghdad.Some of the Sadr aides and commanders who described Mr. Sadr’s recent moves during separate interviews in Najaf and Baghdad refused to give their names, saying they had not been authorized to speak and feared reprisals from current or former members of the militia.They said the cleric allowed the arrests of members of his own militia, or suspended them himself, because evidence showed that they had not obeyed his orders and because he wanted to show Iran, American officials and his militia that he was a strong leader who must be respected and feared.“He wants to prove to the people that he has full control of his militia,” said a 47-year-old Mahdi commander from Sadr City who referred to himself as Jabar Abdul al-Hahdi. “He wants to show he’s in charge.”Mr. Sadr’s conflicted relationship with Iran mirrors Iraq’s. Each country’s majority Shiites revere the other’s clerics and visit the other’s religious shrines. But they speak different languages, are dominated by different ethnic groups, and fought each other in a long war in the 1980s.Mr. Sadr’s father, Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr, became one of Iraq’s most popular Shiite clerics largely because he set himself up as the rebel alternative to Iran’s religious leadership, focusing on poor, oppressed Iraqis, not just theological debate. His mix of social and religious resistance led Saddam Hussein to order his assassination in 1999.Moktada al-Sadr rose to prominence after the American invasion in 2003 with anti-American speeches and echoes of his father’s populism. But he was young, not yet 30, and less educated than his clerical rivals. So even as he railed against Iranian meddling, he sought money and support from Iran’s top clerics, meeting with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme religious leader, in June 2003. It was a dramatic reversal from family tradition.Less than a year later, he led a revolt against American troops in Najaf, and again Iran played the role of patron. On the 11th day of the revolt, with Mr. Sadr under siege, an Iranian delegation arrived in Iraq to mediate. The Iranians were joined by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq’s most revered Shiite cleric, who called for Shiite unity and calm.Mr. Sadr eventually agreed to stop fighting and join the political process. The Americans let him.His popularity rose with the speed of a pop star’s, and the Mahdi Army grew like a fan club, from a few hundred young men to thousands — including some who proved hard to control.Since then, according to some Shiite officials, Iran has funneled support to his organization. What it receives, how much and how consistently, remain a mystery, but some Shiite leaders say Mr. Sadr collects less from Iran than does a rival Shiite party: the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, which was founded in Iran by Iraqi exiles in 1984.Iran generally supports many groups simultaneously, including some Sunni ones, so that it can benefit from any eventuality, said Sami al-Askari, a Shiite member of Parliament who works closely with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki.“Iran intervenes in many ways, with many methods,” Mr. Askari said.In the case of the Mahdi Army, he said, Iran has recognized its diffuse nature, sprinkling support at high and low levels. Some support comes through ties to Hezbollah, the Shiite militia in Lebanon that also receives Iranian support. Beirut now has a Sadr office, and Mahdi commanders say they have been sending fighters to Hezbollah at least since last summer, when Hezbollah battled Israel.Iran also provides institutional assistance to Iraq, mainly to the Health Ministry, which is run by Mr. Sadr’s political bloc. Three days after bombs killed more than 140 people in Sadr City last fall, for example, 50 Iraqi ambulances carried some of the wounded to the Iranian border. They were transferred to Iranian ambulances and taken to Iranian hospitals, with much of the cost covered by organizations in Iran.Qasim Allawi, a spokesman for the Health Ministry who described the process, said another 25 wounded men and women from the recent Sadriya market bombing in Baghdad were to head to Iran any day.Iran’s more potent forms of aid are direct — and some goes not to Mr. Sadr, but to underlings.“Sometimes the aid comes for the leadership, and they get to decide where it goes,” Mr. Askari said. “Sometimes it goes to the local leadership, and this encourages them to rebel.”“Iran puts Moktada al-Sadr between two pressing sides,” he said. “On one hand, they are helping him and they have the ability to take that away. At the same time, they’re undermining him by helping people below him.”According to Sadr aides and Mahdi commanders, Mr. Sadr’s recent purges aim to put Iran on notice that he is in charge and independent. They said he also wanted to remind members of his militia that he would use every available tool, including Iraqi and American troops, to maintain control of the militia, the source of any political power he wields.“We’re going to end the decentralized system that we had before,” said one of the aides in Najaf.If Mr. Sadr consolidates power over his unruly militia, he could be held more responsible for the actions of its members. Until now, American and Iraqi efforts against the Mahdi Army have focused on so-called rogue elements.The 30 members of Parliament associated with the Sadr bloc have not been arrested, keeping Mr. Sadr’s legitimate influence intact. At the same time, American, Iraqi and British officials are engaged in classified negotiations with his envoys over how to address the Mahdi Army and its Sadr City stronghold, the neighborhood named for Mr. Sadr’s father.When asked about the talks, Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, the top military spokesman in Iraq, said the meetings represented a reasonable and appropriate attempt to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.“Anytime you can find a political solution instead of a military solution,” he said, “it’s always better.”But can Mr. Sadr deliver what the Americans want? Are his efforts adequate? Some American military officers remain skeptical.“You know what their intent is,” said Maj. Kevin Hosier, an intelligence officer with the Third Stryker Brigade Combat Team, as his unit prepared for sweeps through predominantly Shiite areas near Sadr City this month. “They want Baghdad. They want to make Baghdad a Shia city.”Peter Harling, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, a research organization, who wrote a thorough profile of Mr. Sadr last summer, said the impact of the Mahdi purges and command restructuring would likely be short-lived.“He has been excommunicating some of his key commanders, that’s a fact, but he has just put them in the corner,” Mr. Harling said, relying on interviews with several Mahdi commanders cited in his July profile. “Many of them, after Sadr really accused them in the harshest terms, actually came back in the movement and carried on with their careers. All this is kind of temporary.”According to Mr. Harling, Mr. Sadr has little choice but to trim at the edges of his organization. His hold on power remains tenuous, dependent on a loose association of clients all over the country who he knows could turn on him at any moment.“He remains in a strong position as a leader only as long as he is useful to all these smaller leaders,” Mr. Harling said. “He rules by consensus.”Vali Nasr, a professor of national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School and author of “The Shia Revival,” says Mr. Sadr should be viewed as a politician who was trying to preserve his power. Poor Shiites have made him an Iraqi celebrity, a national symbol whose bearded visage graces everything from wristwatches to alarm clocks and large posters. Above all else, he will be loyal to them, Mr. Nasr said.“Since the Samarra bombing last year, Moktada has received a lot of pressure to be tougher on the Sunnis,” he said, referring to the explosion in the northern city of Samarra last February that destroyed one of Shiite Islam’s holiest shrines. “He’s found that the tougher he’s been, the more his popularity has gone up.”In the long run, Mr. Nasr said, “he’s not very concerned with what the Americans think of him. What matters to him is what the Shiites think.”'"
"'07-02-25,'0','Times editors clearly were mindful of the W.M.D. coverage as they pursued the Iranian weapons issue. “W.M.D. has informed everything we’ve done on Iran,” Bill Keller, the executive editor, told me three days after the Baghdad briefing. “We don’t have to tell the reporters to be as skeptical as possible. W.M.D. restored a level of skepticism.”The skepticism and qualification, for example, were woven into The Times’s Feb. 12 article about the Baghdad briefing. The result was solid journalism that helped readers sort out the physical evidence — such as captured roadside bombs with serial numbers — from the intelligence assessments based on inferences and deductions.Consider this healthy skepticism in the third paragraph of the story by James Glanz from Baghdad: “The officials also asserted, without providing direct evidence, that Iranian leaders had authorized smuggling those weapons into Iraq for use against the Americans. The officials said such an assertion was an inference based on general intelligence assessments.”Qualifications appropriately permeated the article. The unnamed military officials, it said, asserted “without specific evidence that the Iranian security apparatus, called the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force controlled delivery of the materials to Iraq. And in a further inference, the officials asserted that the Quds Force, sometimes called the I.R.G.C.- Quds, could be involved only with Iranian government complicity.”The Times’s in-depth Saturday article laying out details of the E.F.P. issue contained a clear-cut qualification, prominently placed right in the second paragraph: “The assertion of an Iranian role in supplying the device to Shiite militias reflects broad agreement among American intelligence agencies, although officials acknowledge that the picture is not entirely complete.” The story by Michael R. Gordon, the paper’s chief military correspondent, had been in the works for more than two weeks and was published after The Times learned on Friday that the military briefing was scheduled for Sunday, Mr. Keller said.While the Saturday scoop relied heavily on anonymous sources from unnamed agencies, the article described an admirable search for those likely to have differing views. It cited interviews with “civilian and military officials from a broad range of government agencies,” and pointed out that group included “some whose agencies have previously been skeptical about the significance of Iran’s role in Iraq.”One intelligence “assessment” in the Saturday article, however, needed some qualification. “As part of its strategy in Iraq,” the story said, “Iran is implementing a deliberate, calibrated policy — approved by Supreme Leader [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei and carried out by the Quds Force. ...” To the extent that the assessment was based on inferences, readers deserved to be reminded of that. And they deserved a clearer sense of the extent to which the “broad agreement” cited high up in the article applied to this specific assessment.The Times continued to seek reaction to the E.F.P. intelligence from a variety of government officials, turning up what a Page 1 article on Feb. 13 termed a “healthy dose of skepticism.” The next day, President Bush addressed the credibility of the intelligence assessments at a news conference, saying he was certain that factions within the Iranian government had supplied the roadside bombs. But he carefully added: “I do not know whether or not the Quds Force was ordered from the top echelons of the government” — a point made in the lead paragraph of The Times’s story on Feb. 15.Editing vigilance on intelligence and national security coverage means dealing with the anonymous sourcing that many deem essential to bringing vital issues to light in that murky area. So editors need to ensure that unnamed sources are in a position to know and that any biases are clear to the reporter.The Times’s most important requirement for anonymous sources — that an editor must know their identity — was followed for Mr. Gordon’s Feb. 10 story. Douglas Jehl, a deputy chief of the Washington bureau and his editor, told me he knew the name of each anonymous source in the article. The story also attempted a generalized explanation of why the officials were willing to talk. I do wish, however, that the article had found a way to comply with the paper’s policy of explaining why sources are allowed to remain unnamed.The risk that the anonymity masked a policy-driven leak such as those that fed some of The Times’s pre-war W.M.D. coverage was reviewed before the Feb. 10 article was published. In an e-mail, Philip Taubman, the Washington bureau chief, wrote that he asked early on: “Did a tip or information come from the policy echelons of the government, from intelligence agencies, from American commanders and troops in Iraq?” In this case, he said: “Michael Gordon’s coverage started at ground level in Iraq, and has not been based on policy-driven leaks in Washington.”Failing to reach out for dissenting views was a pre-war shortcoming, The Times has previously acknowledged. So even after Mr. Gordon had “nailed” key parts of the Feb. 10 article, according to Mr. Keller, editors specifically asked him “to talk to places in government that had been skeptical of W.M.D.,” such as the State Department.Still, editors didn’t make sure all conflicting views were always clearly reported. For example, the article on Mr. Bush’s news conference pointed out that the position of the president — and the similar position taken earlier in the week by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — differed from the suggestion at the Sunday Baghdad briefing that the weapons effort involved top levels of the Iranian government. That story also should have noted, however, that the president’s view on this point differed from the intelligence assessment given readers of the Feb. 10 article.On balance, The Times’s E.F.P. stories of the past month — especially the carefully qualified Baghdad briefing article — reflected healthy levels of skepticism and editing vigilance. They also showed that it’s possible for coverage not to be totally dictated by government intelligence leaks. And that lesson could serve Times readers well if the administration should ever decide to publicly invoke intelligence assessments in its simmering struggle to restrain Iran’s development of a nuclear capability.'"
"'07-02-25,'0','SOME 3.6 billion prescriptions were purchased in the United States in 2005, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, an increase of more than 70 percent compared with the number in 1994, and a trend that has continued as the population ages and new drugs enter the market.But as Americans take an ever-increasing array of prescription and over-the-counter medications and herbal supplements, the nation’s patients and doctors find themselves facing a growing problem — too many patients are unwittingly taking dangerous combinations of drugs.Since the days of Hippocrates, physicians have recognized that some medications do not mix well with others. Certain drug combinations can be deadly, and many commonly prescribed or over-the-counter drugs have the potential to increase the dangerous risks of other medications when taken together. Physicians call these scenarios “adverse drug events,” and they run the gamut from upset stomach to coma or even death.In recent years, what had seemed like the occasional mishap has become a full-scale epidemic.There’s no question that these drugs offer patients the possibility of modern-day miracles. But sometimes patients mislead doctors about the medications they take. Or they might assume the doctor knows. Or patients taking an over-the-counter medication simply forget. Doctors can also fail to take a patient’s drug history or inquire whether other doctors have also prescribed medications for their patients.When that happens, the potential for problems is enormous.In 2004, 82 percent of the United States population reported using at least one prescription drug, over-the-counter medication, or dietary supplement in the previous week, and 30 percent reported using five or more of these during the same period, according to a study by the Sloan Epidemiology Center at Boston University. Among senior citizens, 75 percent of all Americans over the age of 65 took roughly four prescription drugs on a daily basis in 2005; the average 75-year-old in the United States swallowed eight different prescription medications each day. That same year, approximately 1.6 million American teenagers and children (almost 300,000 of whom were under 10) were given at least two psychiatric drugs in combination, according to an analysis performed by Medco Health Solutions for The New York Times.'"
"'07-02-25,'0','Such indignities need not be suffered by celebrities whose pockets go deeper than their commitment did — Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, Hilary Swank and Chad Lowe, Kate Hudson and Chris Robinson, to name a few.While money can’t buy love, it can buy a publicist, one who knows that keeping Tom Cruise- and Nicole Kidman-caliber exes apart can require a level of orchestration worthy of an Oscar nod. The goal is to avoid the photograph seen round the world of two exes in the same frame, or a deer-in-the-headlights moment on live television during Joan Rivers-generated gridlock.“The picture you never want out there is the third-wheel picture,” said Howard Bragman, the founder of Fifteen Minutes PR in Los Angeles. That is the photo, he said, where one ex is seen with a “fabulous new partner” and the other — a client — is seen standing forlornly alone.“Neither of them would want to be in the same frame,” said Susan Blond, the publicist who began her career with Andy Warhol and whose clients have included James Brown, Michael Jackson and Usher, adding that this would hold true “until years later” or “until something else wonderful has happened.”“One of you is hurt very badly,” she said.Before a high profile event, Mr. Torossian of 5W contacts other publicists and event planners to find out if or when one of his clients’ exes will be there. Because he is not always willing to take other publicists at their word, he will also call “friendly reporters” along the red carpet to confirm which famous faces have already arrived, he said. He reads the daily Associated Press schedule of newsworthy events, and tip sheets, too, “just to make sure we don’t get ambushed.”These protective services extend beyond public appearances and red carpet functions. If the exes are in the middle of a media frenzy, “We’ll call the gym or the grocery store beforehand so if somebody’s ex is there, my client won’t walk in,” Mr. Torossian said.It is the celebrity equivalent of telephoning a friend before a party and blurting out: “Is he going? Because if he’s going, I’m not going.”In fact, that is exactly what some celebrities tell their publicists. Yet when that ultimatum is passed along to the producers of an event, it can backfire. “Invitations are rescinded sometimes,” Mr. Bragman said, “depending on who’s the bigger draw.”Luckily for famous exes, when it comes to walking the red carpet at the Academy Awards, they are able to put more distance between themselves than one might expect. The carpet is about 33 feet wide and 500 feet long (were it hanging vertically it would be taller than the Great Pyramid of Giza).“They’re enormous,” said Gary Snegaroff, the executive producer of the “Live From the Red Carpet” shows on the E! Entertainment Network. “You could easily be on the carpet and never see a friend or somebody you don’t want to see.”Yet sometimes the stopping and posing flows when it should ebb, and exes draw dangerously close. Then it is up to nimble publicists to slow down, speed up or halt clients so they are not photographed with an ex.“Get someone onto an interview, delay them with the paparazzi,” said the publicist Lizzie Grubman, whose clients have included Jay-Z, Quincy Jones and Britney Spears. “If it’s a female, fix her makeup.”Mr. Torossian uses his client’s entourage of stylists and managers like hedges planted at strategic points to block the client from the ex. “The media is not getting the money shot that they’re looking for,” he said. “And our client is saved the embarrassment.”As for the event itself, publicists said they are almost always accommodated if they make a seating or arrival request for a client. After all, event organizers want (need) the celebrities to come back. (A spokeswoman for the Academy Awards declined to discuss the production process, including celebrity seating.)If not, one of the exes may simply skip the event to prevent a media tumult.“The person who isn’t up for the award generally stays out of the limelight for that year,” Ms. Grubman said.That can be a smart move, because events do not always unfold as planned. Which is why it may be better not to overcalculate, said Ken Sunshine, the publicist whose clients include Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Timberlake and Mr. Affleck (and who spoke about celebrity publicity, not specific clients).“If you try to put somebody way on the left and somebody way on the right, they’re both going to go to the bathroom at intermission and run into each other,” he said.'"
"'07-02-25,'0','Many years ago I received a phone call from a fellow traveler in the vintage-clothing world, directing me in hushed tones to a rummage sale in a church basement on the Upper West Side. “Sunny von Bülow,” he whispered. “Go.”So I went, and as a result I now own chiffon handkerchiefs monogrammed “Martha” (her real name), custom-made walking shoes and an exquisite embroidered nightgown, the execution of which must have driven a Swiss nun blind.Do I find these items creepy? Why, not at all. But then again, I’m the sort of girl who could stick her feet into a pair of 1920s pumps, feel something soft, shake out a dead mouse and buy them anyway. (Hey, they had diamanté buckles.) Maybe I’m not the one to ask.Unlike me, most people are occasionally creeped out by their purchases. Kitty Savage, who wears vintage almost exclusively and makes her living selling vintage jewelry, thinks the dead are happy for us to wear their things. “I truly believe that when people go, it’s to a higher place where possessions aren’t important,” she says. “Their soul is no longer in the stuff.” Which is why she can gallivant in a 1940s balmacaan and not feel that the previous owner is peering, Topper-like, over her shoulder. But some of her vintage-wearing customers are queasy about estate engagement and wedding rings. “They want to know if it came from a good family, or if the marriage worked out, or if I can tell them anything about the piece’s ‘essence,’ ” she says. Savage bristles a little when she notes that these same shoppers never express the slightest reservation when it comes to antique furniture, which they are willing to welcome into their homes, and, she adds, “You never hear ‘yeew.’ ”Liz Goldwyn, the author of “Pretty Things,” has no problem donning somebody’s old bullet bra or a used Cole of California swimsuit. But a hat with peacock feathers? “It’s such bad luck!” she says. O.K., how about a brooch made from the hair of a dead person? Bring it on! “I love hair jewelry,” she continues with a sigh. “There’s something really beautiful about ghosts.”Goldwyn likes to inhale the perfume left on secondhand ball gowns, transporting herself to the last place the dress danced before the party was over. Recently, she heard about a woman in California with psychic powers (no surprise) who can supposedly lay her hands on an object and uncover the secrets of its prior ownership. “I have a minaudière that belonged to my grandmother — it still has traces of her perfume, powder and red lipstick that’s almost exactly the color I wear,” she says dreamily, confessing that she’s considering having the clairvoyant put her paranormal paws on it.'"
"'07-02-25,'0','WHY watch “Grease: You’re the One That I Want” on television once a week, when you can see the reality show of the new Broadway musical “The Pirate Queen” at any moment by logging on to the show’s continuously updated Web site? The show begins previews at the Hilton Theater on March 6, but at thepiratequeen.com you can spy on actresses rejoicing as they enter their first Broadway dressing room; watch musicians clown during a break from playing uilleann pipes; hear dancers discuss new steps; and take in the exuberant words of the Pirate Queen herself, Stephanie J. Block: “You guys, it’s a big, fat Broadway show!” Can you not smell the greasepaint?The blog cum reality show known as Castcom, which made its debut last September, before the show’s pre-Broadway run in Chicago, is the brainchild of its producers, the Irish husband-and-wife team Moya Doherty and John McColgan. They wanted, Mr. McColgan said, to use the Web to reach a broad audience and to “tie in to America’s fascination with reality television.” By the end of the Chicago run Castcom had received 350,000 hits. “People would recognize us at the stage door because they’d seen us on Castcom,” Ms. Doherty recalled.Ms. Doherty and Mr. McColgan have business epiphanies the way other couples have dinner parties. A dozen years ago they came up with “Riverdance,” the Celtic dance spectacle (directed by Mr. McColgan) that has been seen by 20 million people in 30 countries and grossed more than $1 billion, the producers said. Ever since, they had longed to create what Mr. McColgan calls “a major musical.” Ms. Doherty had always been fascinated by the 16th-century Irish warrior queen Grace O’Malley, who persuaded Elizabeth I to quit warring against her through sheer charisma. Five years ago the couple decided that Grace’s story was the one they wanted to tell.They both were great fans of Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg, who converted historic tumult into song and dance in “Les Misérables” and “Miss Saigon,” and wanted them to create the new show. The producers invited them to see “Riverdance” in London to test the waters. The morning after the men saw the show, husband and wife appeared on Mr. Boublil’s doorstep. Ms. Doherty recalled, “We joked as we stood at the door and said, ‘If they didn’t like “Riverdance,” they won’t answer the door.’ ” She laughed. “They let us in.”Ms. Doherty and Mr. McColgan know that creating a Broadway musical from scratch is not for the faint of heart. But with their “Riverdance” reserves, they were willing to risk an original project. More than $10 million has been spent on “The Pirate Queen,” they said, and after the show received less than rapturous reviews in Chicago they brought aboard the lyricist Richard Maltby Jr. and the choreographer Graciela Daniele. Mr. McColgan said major changes were being made to the show.“Producing to us has a different meaning than investing,” Ms. Doherty said. “It means nurturing and encouraging, supporting and minding the creative team and the cast.”'"
"'07-02-25,'0','But Jon Steingart and Jenny Wiener, who founded Ars Nova in 2002 and now run it with Jason Eagan, say the financial model — which at first seems insane — makes sense if you understand their focus on new works, new artists and new audiences. Many companies aim for one or two; Ars Nova aims for all three at once.“A lot of not-for-profit theaters are driven by middle-aged women buying $100 tickets,” Mr. Steingart said. “But you can’t build a younger audience that way. And you can’t support younger artists if you charge $50 a ticket, because no one knows who they are. Our goal is to be as competitive as we can to a night at the movies. Even before we converted to not-for-profit status last year, it was never a commercial venture.”Ms. Wiener added, “We are only interested in development.”“That’s our role,” Mr. Eagan put in. “To throw it all up and see what sticks.”Just not on the lovely wallpaper.TUESDAY The next night offered a clue to Ars Nova’s finances in the unlikely form of Langhorne Slim, a 26-year-old Dylanesque troubadour in a frayed velvet suit. The capacity crowd, almost none over 30 and many well oiled at the bar, sang along with his slacker love songs: “Now I’m dreamin’ of leaving my demons/And the first one I’m leavin’ is you.”But what was this new audience new to? Perhaps to Ars Nova’s Uncharted series (“A forum for burgeoning singer-songwriters”) but certainly not to boozy club dates. And though the downtown director Alex Timbers had been hired for a day’s worth of guidance, it was hard to see this as a theatrical event. What was it doing here?The answer goes back to the founding of Ars Nova, a story Ms. Wiener, now 39, has told often enough that it no longer makes her cry.In 1997 her brother, Gabe, a recording executive and sound engineer, was building a new studio — christened Ars Nova, Latin for “new art” — in what was still called Hell’s Kitchen. The building’s foundation was poured, and two floors of steel were in place when he suddenly died of a burst brain aneurysm, at 26. For two years his sister, who had been producing Off Broadway theater, let the place sit fallow while she decided what to make of her loss and of the windfall (not just the property but also a lot of money from his estate) that came with it.“I thought if I could somehow turn what was undoubtedly the worst event of my life into a way for other people to create art,” she said, “it would be a way of keeping a living relationship with my brother.”Ms. Wiener had recently begun collaborating with Mr. Steingart, a Los Angeles film and comedy producer. Together they scouted ideas for the new venture among New York performance spaces like Fez and Westbeth (both now defunct), places that felt like a hub or clubhouse. Accordingly they revamped the unfinished building’s design to include a top-floor apartment, called the penthouse, for entertaining, and even a bedroom suite to lure out-of-town artists. In March 2002, six months before Ms. Wiener and Mr. Steingart were married, Ars Nova opened, a discreet glass panel in the building’s entranceway etched with the words “For Gabe.”If a building can be dedicated, this one surely was. Because Gabe was a musician, music would be part of its mission. And because Gabe had been so young, they would fill it with young people and encourage adventurousness.“It’s that incredibly rare thing in theater,” Mr. Timbers said, “a meritocracy.” He described the major institutional companies as “impenetrable” to a young director (he’s 28) and the usual downtown suspects (he’s artistic director of the avant-garde troupe Les Freres Corbusier) as threadbare. “But here, they work on hunches,” he said. He will be directing Ars Nova’s next extended-run production, an interactive comedy called “Dixie’s Tupperware Party,” this spring. “They’re willing to make this investment, in me even. And the lighting setup they have is unbelievable.”So is the sound setup, as Mr. Slim seemed at pains to prove.WEDNESDAY An entirely sensible career path at Ars Nova led Mary Faber from barkeep in 2002 to featured guest in its Broadway Spotlight Series in 2007. Granted, she landed a big job (as a replacement Kate Monster in “Avenue Q”) in between. But here she was, delighting a full house with almost anything but standards: skits, pseudo-autobiographical monologues and songs from unproduced new shows. ”I just wanted to do something anti-cabaret,” she said later. “I wanted to play.”Though there is little crossover among the audiences for its signature events, Ars Nova has managed to develop a brand image around youth, hipness (the remote location may actually help with this) and a kind of heartfelt snark. But in working this brand so successfully, and in dedicating its programs to developing talents and audiences, Ars Nova itself has landed at a developmental crossroads.For one thing, pretty much all of the money Ms. Wiener realized from her brother’s estate, money that financed the building and its operations, is now gone. Even with it, the budget was always tight; Mr. Steingart and Ms. Wiener do not even draw a salary. Two new ventures — a college touring program and a two-year development deal with NBC Universal — may increase revenue, but the pricing policy, the size of the facilities and even the core mission constrain the possibilities. After only five years the theater faces its version of the classic “success of the small” dilemma: What happens when the young artists you nurture start to think big?THURSDAY At 7 p.m. 11 “emerging” playwrights from Ars Nova’s twice a month Play Group splayed themselves around the penthouse, reading and discussing one another’s works-in-progress. The first, an oddball-brothers drama by 23-year-old Carly Mensch, still needed a title before its scheduled debut at Out Loud on March 12. It also needed a second half.Not that anyone chided her, even when she asked for criticism. Ars Nova’s 27-year-old literary manager, Kim Rosenstock, instead led the gentlest possible discussion. (“I thought the nicest moment was...” ) “It’s like a pep rally with pizza and beer,” said Ms. Mensch, who like a few of the others attends Juilliard by day. “At school I can only bring in my A material. Here I can bring in anything. And with no teachers it feels less like presenting than sharing.”The mounded bowls of M&M’s, not to mention the Sub-Zero fridge filled with wine, all contribute to the sense that Ars Nova considers these young playwrights’ art valuable regardless of whether it’s successful. And yet, with surprising frequency, it does succeed. A play by Liz Flahive, another member of the Play Group, was enough of a hit last year at Out Loud that Ars Nova wants to promote it to a “mainstage” production. But the play, “From Up Here,” is audacious in more than its writing: it requires a cast of eight and an actual set. Ars Nova’s space can’t accommodate it.To solve the problem, Mr. Steingart said, the theater is planning to collaborate with a larger not-for-profit in presenting “From Up Here” this fall. It could be a risky step.For all the control it gives away, Ars Nova can seem like one of Judy Gold’s Jewish mothers. That night, while the playwrights were being pampered upstairs, downstairs in the theater Bridget Everett was rampaging her way through a performance of “At Least It’s Pink,” a raunchy singspiel painstakingly developed by Mr. Eagan over the course of several years. He discovered Ms. Everett half-naked at a karaoke bar, gave her deadlines for new material, developed her stage savvy by making her host of Ars Nova’s Automatic Vaudeville series for 18 months; Mr. Steingart then fixed her up with the director Michael Patrick King. The result, while still raw (few uptown shows feature Dixieland-style songs about aborting twins), was infinitely more refined than earlier versions I’d seen.It was easy to understand how the process would appeal to Ms. Everett, emerging in more ways than one. But what was the appeal to Mr. King, better known as an executive producer of TV series like “Sex and the City."" ""If you’re not always emerging, you’re dead,” he said.FRIDAY Though it promised performances by the Varsity Interpretive Dance Squad and an obese transvestite in tights, I skipped most of Automatic Vaudeville, which began around 11 that Thursday night; emerging art is tough for people who have to make a train. Which is why Ars Nova’s biggest long-term problem, like every theater’s, won’t be finding acts and material but maintaining an audience for them. Hipsters age quickly.In part to address that problem, Ars Nova this year inaugurated an education program called Script and Stage. On Friday morning, after removing incriminating “At Least It’s Pink” memorabilia from the lobby, Ms. Rosenstock, who runs the program, welcomed two very excited classes of sixth graders from the Urban Assembly Academy of Arts and Letters. Two teaching artists put students named Sparkle, Heaven, Zippy, Dijon and about 40 others through warm-up exercises and writing rubrics; another two teaching artists were working with classes back at the school. Over the course of 15 weeks the students will develop, revise and rehearse monologues and scenes, and perform them, in June, on Ars Nova’s stage. Ms. Rosenstock said she has not yet determined how to accommodate all the family members who will want to see the results.Also not determined: how to pay for the program as it inevitably grows. Script and Stage is another total write-off for Ars Nova; the school covers the buses, the theater everything else.As Gabe Wiener’s cash disappears, Mr. Steingart, Ms. Wiener, Mr. Eagan and Ms. Rosenstock wonder if the rest of the city will step up to support what they made of his larger gift. As Mr. King said, if they’re not always emerging, they’re dead. Perhaps that’s why they hover anxiously near the students, practicing tongue twisters with them. “You need unique New York,” they keep saying.'"
"'07-02-25,'0','THE theater is rich with superstitions. Consider how many actors refuse to call Shakespeare’s Scottish play by its actual title, or those who can’t abide hearing “good luck” instead of “break a leg.” And just as there are things one cannot do in the theater, there are also things one must do: knock on wood, pray, do a headstand. Hey, whatever it takes to calm jittery nerves and ward off bad luck, especially before the most anxiety-filled performance of all: the opening.“I have a thing about opening night, which I just find terrifying,” said Stephanie March, who is appearing in “Talk Radio,” now in previews at the Longacre. “I’m very superstitious.”Of course there are those who do not believe (“It’s just another work day,” said David Greenspan, who will soon appear in “Some Men” at Second Stage Theater) or who have no ritual (“I always make sure I’m just underprepared enough,” said Kelsey Grammer, appearing in “My Fair Lady” with the New York Philharmonic next month, adding, “If I’ve got an element of flying by the seat of my pants, it tends to bump me up a notch.”)The nonbelievers are the exception, though, and good-luck rites are common. Some, like the gypsy robe ceremony, involve a show’s entire cast: on every Broadway musical’s opening night the performers gather onstage an hour before curtain, and the chorus member with the most Broadway credits is presented with a robe, which is covered in souvenirs from past shows. The previous wearer, from the last musical to open, makes the presentation, then everyone touches the robe. Sounds simple enough, but that ceremony has been passed along for more than 50 years.Despite the wearing of the robe, the wearing of Grandma’s favorite necklace and other more private gestures are the rule. More than 20 performers with shows opening this spring shared their opening-night customs. In the graphic above are some excerpts.'"
"'07-02-25,'0','NYLO Hotels, a new brand created by a group of veteran hoteliers including Michael Mueller, a former senior vice president of development for Starwood, will offer similar electronic features along with loftlike accommodations with high ceilings, exposed brick, and large windows. Each hotel will have a business center, a 24-hour restaurant and a gym with showers and steam rooms.Stephane DuPoux, who designed the Nikki Beach Club in Miami and the Buddha Bar in New York, is designing the rooms and the furnishings. Daniel Vosovic, the runner-up in 2005 on Bravo’s television series Project Runway, in which up-and-coming fashion designers compete for $100,000 to back their own clothing lines, is creating the staff’s uniforms. The first NYLO is scheduled to open in Plano, Tex., in November and the second in Warwick, R.I., in April 2008.Another new brand, Starwood’s Aloft, is being marketed as “carrying the DNA of W Hotels” with “stylish design, accessible technology and a hip urban attitude.” The hotels, which will begin to open in 2008, will feature exposed beams and blackened steel. Rooms will have nine-foot ceilings and bathrooms with oversized showers and toiletries created by Bliss Spa. Public spaces designed to draw guests from their rooms to interact include splash, an indoor or outdoor pool; the re:mix, a communal lobby area and bar where guests can grab drinks with friends or work on their laptops; and the backyard, an open-air area for socializing.Of course, for these hotels to offer such chic accommodations on the cheap, something has to give. For starters, the new brands are focusing on secondary markets like suburbs and airport locations rather than metropolitan downtowns, because the real estate is typically cheaper and the hotel markets less saturated. They’re also finding ways to cut back on everything from construction costs to labor.Open floor plans, designed to let guests mix and mingle, allow employees to see from the bar to the kitchen to the retail shop, enabling them to serve multiple areas during off-peak hours. Eating options are generally self-serve. And barebones building materials can both look stylish and translate to operational savings.NYLO, for example, said the exposed surfaces of brick and polished-concrete walls not only lend the brand its urban loft aesthetic, but also save labor and resources. “With no internal sheetrock, no base or crown moldings,” said John Russell, NYLO’s chief executive, “we are saving about 5 to 10 percent.” Concrete floors are also easy to clean and, he said, help stabilize indoor temperatures, reducing energy costs.New technology will be used to keep costs down by automating tasks normally handled by hotel staff members. At Hyatt Place, a new brand from Global Hyatt Corporation that opened its first hotel in Lombard, Ill., last year, guests can check in and get room keys at a lobby kiosk or grab snacks from a takeout area by punching in orders and swiping keycards to pay. Although hotel employees are still nearby, the do-it-yourself approach is less labor-intensive. It’s also a more efficient use of space, said Jim Abrahamson, a senior vice president at GlobalHyatt. “There isn’t a large nonpublic area or back of house, which allows us to invest more into the size of our guest rooms,” he said.Citistay Hotels, a new concept aimed at the young and middle-aged adults of Generations X and Y, with plans to open its first property in New York or Miami by the end of this year, is developing a computerized system to perform the function of a concierge. The system will link guests to businesses outside the hotel like restaurants and car services, as a concierge would, said Gregory Tubeck, founder of Citistay Hotels and, at 24, a Gen Y’er himself. The idea, said Mr. Tubeck in an e-mail message, is to “streamline both the guest and the operators (us) experience.”Bottom line: If you’re a traveler who likes someone to carry your bag to your room, rings for room service upon arrival and just likes to be fussed over, these new hotels aren’t for you. But they may be just the thing for a traveler on a budget who wants a hotel with all the basics and a bit of flair.'"
"'07-02-25,'0','Siem Reap, the increasingly popular base for visitors to Angkor Wat, is beginning to feel a little like the Las Vegas of Cambodia, with one showy hotel after another being built along the highway into town. (Is it just a matter of time before the signature of Steve Wynn graces the skyline?) Hôtel de la Paix is a coolly elegant oasis set in the middle of this busy town, comfortably sealed off from the chaos outside its walls.Though you'll be tempted not to leave the grounds of the Hôtel de la Paix, except for excursions to Angkor Wat and other temples, much of what Siem Reap has to offer — the Old Market, the cluster of shops selling Cambodian handicrafts and the late-night hangouts on aptly named Bar Street — is within easy walking distance.Even the standard rooms are huge: a soaring loft space with a large seating area, a comfortable, spacious bed on a wooden frame, and a terrazzo bathtub big enough for two (or three, for that matter), as well as a walk-in shower. The floor-to-ceiling windows are perfect if you are overlooking the lushly landscaped, lagoonlike pool — but a little unnerving if you are facing the street, and throw open the curtains in the morning to find yourself face to face with workmen on the construction site across the road. The high-tech rooms come with a TV, a DVD player and even a fully loaded Ipod with selections from Ella Fitzgerald to Bach to Cambodian pop singers. But nowhere, it seems, is there a clock or anything else that will give you the time of day, which is somewhat disorienting for travelers who have come from halfway across the world and wake up in the middle of the night, wondering whether it is midnight or 5 a.m.Many staff members wear T-shirts that read: “The answer is Yes. What is the question?” It's an all-too-apt description of the service, which is unfailingly polite, charming and eager to please, but can also fall victim to language barriers. Take this scene by the pool one day. “Do you have nonalcoholic beer?” a guest asked a passing waiter. “Yes sir, we have beer,” he was told. “But do you have nonalcoholic beer?” “Yes sir, we have beer,” the waiter said again, politely gesturing toward the menu. “But do you have ... Oh, forget it. Bring me a beer.” An observer couldn't help wondering whether, at that moment, someone was falling off the wagon, all because of a failure to communicate.A small, but well-appointed gym, plus a superb spa. The excellent — and addictive — massages start with a foot scrubbing and end with a warm cup of herbal tea, sending you off to your room in a haze of woozy contentment. The hotel also has Wi-Fi service in the inviting cafe, a popular hangout for tourists staying elsewhere.The hotel has a limited room service menu — and freshly baked cookies await you each evening — but most guests will want to eat in the comfortable main restaurant (especially if it's not too hot to sit in the garden), where the enormous buffet breakfast, included in the room charge, is a satisfying combination of expertly prepared hot dishes and fresh local fruit.'"

"'07-02-26,'0','WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 — A juror in the perjury trial of I. Lewis Libby Jr., Vice President Dick Cheney’s former chief of staff, was dismissed from the panel today after acknowledging that she had had outside contact with information related to the case.Judge Reggie B. Walton of the federal court here said the jury’s deliberations, which began at midday Wednesday and ended their third full day this afternoon without a verdict, could go on with 11 members on the panel. “I don’t think it would be appropriate to throw away those two and a half days,” he said, alluding to the work that jurors had done up to this morning.The judge’s decision came over the objection of the prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, who wanted one of two remaining alternates to be seated, bringing the jury panel back to 12. But that would have required the newly constituted jury to begin deliberations all over again, a development that the chief defense lawyer, Theodore V. Wells Jr., said would be prejudicial to his client.Judge Walton said the problem juror’s exposure to outside information was the result of a misunderstanding rather than intentional on her part. But he said he had no choice but to dismiss her. The woman, who now lives in Washington, was a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for decades.Mr. Libby is charged with obstruction of justice, lying to federal agents and perjuring himself before a grand jury amid an investigation over who made public the name of a C.I.A. operative, Valerie Wilson, whose husband, the former diplomat Joseph C. Wilson IV, was highly critical of the Bush administration’s rationale for going to war in Iraq.Before dismissing the juror, and ruling that the 11 remaining on the panel could continue to deliberate, Judge Walton questioned them individually. He then cautioned the jurors, as he has daily over the four-week trial, to avoid contact with any case-related information from outside the courtroom.'"
"'07-02-26,'0','The practical effect of the ruling is to spare Serbia from being forced to pay heavy financial reparations that Bosnia was seeking over the massacre.Groups like the Mothers of Srebrenica believe that the Serbian state was directly involved in the atrocities, and that direct evidence exists of Serbia’s role in war crimes. “Shame on the people who reached such a verdict,” Zinaida Mujic, a representative of Mothers of Srebrenica, told The Associated Press.The court found that the Serbian state could have prevented the massacre, and had failed in its duty to prosecute those who had been responsible. It demanded that Serbia hand over Ratko Mladic, the general who oversaw the Bosnian Serb attack on Srebrenica, to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.The panel of judges at the court had been deliberating on the case since May 2006, when nine weeks of hearings were completed.Many thousands of people were killed in ethnically mixed Bosnia during three years of civil war from 1992 to 1995, with Bosnians of Croatian, Serbian and Muslim background fighting one another for full control of the sections of the country where they were the majority.Although Serbia supported the Bosnian Serbs in the war, the court found that the Serbian state did not have effective control over the Bosnian Serb army and paramilitary units that carried out the massacres.The massacres at Srebrenica “were committed with the specific intent to destroy in part the group of the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina as such” and thus were “acts of genocide,” the judgment said.Following the court decision, the president of Serbia, Boris Tadic, urged the Serbian parliament today to condemn the massacre, the Reuters news agency reported. “For all of us, the very difficult part of the verdict is that Serbia did not do all it could to prevent genodice,” Mr. Tadic told reporters, according to Reuters.He said that the failure by Serbia to allow the accused perpetrators of the massacre to be extradited to face criminal charges could have serious political and economic repercussions for Serbia, which is seeking closer integration with the European Union.'"

Now the company is offering songs for those who enjoy its sneakers as lifestyle accessories.To recognize the 25th anniversary of its Air Force 1 sneaker, the company commissioned a song from some prominent hip-hop musicians: the producer Rick Rubin and the rappers Kanye West, Nas and KRS-One. It also paid for a remix by D J Premier that features the rapper Rakim. The song, “Better Than I’ve Ever Been,” has been available on iTunes since Tuesday.Nike paid the artists for their work, will own the copyright to the recordings and even supplied the song’s theme — perseverance.The company will donate all sales proceeds to youth programs in Baltimore, where the Air Force 1 first took off in independent stores.“We put together what would be the dream song,” said Jeff Tammes, a marketing director at Cornerstone, the promotions company that coordinates music products for Nike on iTunes. Cornerstone will also promote the song to radio stations. Nike also financed the production of an MTV special about the Air Force 1, which featured a performance by Kanye West, Nas, KRS-One and Rakim.G.

"'07-02-26,'0','There will soon be an answer to a question making the music industry very nervous: is having a lot of friends on MySpace better than having a record deal?Tila Tequila, born Tila Nguyen, became famous last year for having the most friends — currently about 1.7 million — on MySpace.com, the News Corporation’s social-networking site. She is now trying to break into the mainstream music industry. Her single “I Love U,” which was produced by the rapper Lil Jon, will be released on iTunes tomorrow.“This is really new territory, we’re about to find out what the connection is between social networking and music sales,” said Simon Renshaw, the head of Strategic Artist Management, which represents Ms. Tequila.The MySpace phenomenon has allowed many unknown bands to attract listeners and industry interest by posting music on their pages. But Ms. Tequila, a onetime model for Playboy.com born in Singapore, where her family moved after the Vietnam War, rejected offers from record companies and is hoping that her MySpace fame can help her break into the business on her own.“I’m very nervous because this has never been done before,” Ms. Tequila said. Thanks to online communities like MySpace, aspiring artists can “speak to people so much,” she said. “It’s not just advertising and music; it’s your fans really getting to know you.”If she does succeed in selling her single without going through the record companies, her efforts may have long-term implications for the industry. But according to Eric Garland, the chief executive of BigChampagne, an online market research firm, it may be too soon to mourn for the record companies. Though reluctant to make predictions, Mr. Garland said Ms. Tequila’s MySpace popularity had not helped her attract much interest at online communities devoted only to music.'"
"'07-02-26,'0','Both companies beam weather data to aviators and boaters through services that cost upwards of $50 a month. Later this year, XM will extend that by beaming weather information to a hand-held unit for hikers and hunters.But Sirius has also made tentative steps toward offering video. At trade shows, Sirius has displayed prototype systems for sending video to back-seat displays like those now used by in-car DVD players. And the company recently, if vaguely, outlined plans to deliver some form of video programming aimed at children later this year.Late last week, a specification sheet on the Web site for DaimlerChrysler indicated that such a system would be an option on the 2008 Dodge Magnum, a station wagon. A spokesman for the automaker, however, said that the information was incorrect and would be removed. A spokesman for Sirius, Patrick Reilly, declined requests for comment.The big question, however, is: what will be the quality of a television signal dropped from a satellite into a car moving at 60 miles an hour?Here, a merger of XM and Sirius could actually help. Assuming that duplicate channels would be eliminated — for example, there would be no reason to continue separate channels of, say, music hits from the 1940s — a combined company would be able to open up capacity on the systems’ satellites and the ground-based antennas that increase signals in urban areas. While that space could be filled with additional radio channels, several empty radio channels could be combined to transmit video.XM’s chairman, Gary M. Parsons, said that he was not willing to promise much in the way of satellite video. As he sees it, satellite radio systems would most likely be able to provide only “a minimal amount of streaming video.” It may be preferable, he said, to simply download video from satellites to in-car hard drives for later viewing.“People relate to video, so maybe they make too big a deal of it,” he said. “We are not in the video business.”He does concede, however, that the combined company’s future would mean more than just talk and music.“Our view has been that we are in the business of audio entertainment,” Mr. Parsons said. “But we look at how we can improve the listeners’ experience in ways that flow very naturally from the high-quality data platform we have.”The future services Mr. Parsons foresees are more modest. One, invisible to users, involves using the satellites to keep the data on in-car navigation systems constantly and automatically up to date. Another is a trick the iPod learned long ago: displaying album cover art when songs are playing.But there are limits to what even a combined satellite radio company can do. Satellite systems effectively do not allow two-way transmissions, ruling out services such as e-mail.And without enormous reinvestment, the systems are not likely to approach the transmission speeds of WiMax, a new wireless technology being developed by Nortel Networks and others that will probably start operating within the year.Those systems, like cellphone networks, will pass moving users from tower to tower and offer transmission speeds comparable to high-speed, wired connections in homes. Susan Kevorkian, an analyst with IDC, said that the satellite radio connections with automakers would give them a significant advantage over WiMax, at least in the short term.But she added that the new company might find more immediate benefits from changing the structure of radio pricing. Currently, subscribers are tied to receivers, not users. Ms. Kevorkian said that limits the willingness of people to own more than a single receiver as well as the time they spend listening to the systems.“Satellite radio is in and of itself a compelling service,” she said. “The way it’s been sold to date has not demonstrated that value to consumers.”'"

"'07-02-26,'0','Records show that the consulting business has been a consistently reliable stream of income for Mr. Bruno. Yet the firm does not advertise or have a published telephone number and Mr. Bruno has refused to publicly identify its clients, describing them only as “substantial and important business people.”Mr. Bruno, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has consistently defended his right to remain a businessman while serving in the Legislature, asserting that he has never used his power to enrich himself or his business associates.It is impossible to know the full extent of Mr. Bruno’s wealth because he is not required to provide details about his income or assets on disclosure forms made available to the public. There are no indications that he is in financial trouble; he lives on a sprawling farm in Rensselaer County, owns thoroughbred horses and earns $121,000 as majority leader.But interviews and documents suggested that Mr. Bruno, 77, has remained an active consultant and aggressive investor in part because he felt he needed the money. He suggested as much in an interview with The New York Times in December.“Nobody wants to hear it, but my being in office has cost me a fortune — millions, literally millions,” he said. “I’m worth a hell of a lot less today than I was 30 years ago. That’s kind of sad. I’m worth a hell of a lot less now than I was 10 years ago.”By his own account, Mr. Bruno overcame humble origins in upstate poverty by selling ice and frozen food, obtaining an undergraduate degree in business administration and, in the 1950s, teaming with an older businessman, Stanley B. Ringel, to sell insurance and mutual funds. In the late 1960s, Mr. Ringel and Mr. Bruno began selling office telephone equipment, forming what would become Coradian.Mr. Bruno, who associates said was a gifted salesman, handled the marketing side and pursued a second career in politics, while Mr. Ringel, the chief executive, managed the day-to-day operations. By 1981, Coradian had revenues of $35 million and employed about 500 people.But a major supplier dropped its contract, profits dried up, workers were let go, and an ailing Mr. Ringel stepped aside as chief executive, allowing Mr. Bruno to take over.In the years after Mr. Bruno was elected to the State Senate in 1976, questions were raised about possible ethical conflicts, since Coradian received $1.5 million in state contracts from 1983 to 1988, according to The Times Union of Albany. The State Commission on Government Integrity investigated Coradian’s contracts with state and local government agencies in 1988, but reported no evidence of wrongdoing.By 1989, with Coradian hemorrhaging cash and unable to pay its debts, the company was put up for sale. It hired a consultant to interview 24 prospective buyers, but 19 expressed no interest, securities filings showed.Mitel, a Canadian firm that was a major equipment supplier to Coradian, eventually agreed to buy it, paying $10 million in cash and assuming $13 million in debt. Numerous newspaper accounts since then, including in The Times, have stated or implied that the $23 million sale price resulted in a windfall for Mr. Bruno worth millions of dollars.In reality, Mr. Bruno owned only enough shares to earn at most $383,000 from the sale, according to the securities filings, and he agreed to remain with the newly merged company for a couple of years at his old salary of $110,000.George L. Benson, Coradian’s president at the time of the sale, recalled recently that “nobody made a lot of money out of it, I can tell you that. It was a graceful exit. That was all it was.”Even before leaving Coradian, Mr. Bruno began pursuing other ways to make money, an effort that intensified after the sale of the company. One of the earliest was a partnership called First Grafton that he created in 1987, along with his brother and some friends, to purchase and develop a large tract of forest into home sites, a project that seemed vexed from the start and would not be completed until just a few years ago.After two of his original partners bowed out, Mr. Bruno’s solution — to replace them with two lawyer-lobbyists he knew from his work at Coradian and the state capital — inflamed old charges of ethical carelessness that had begun to dog his Senate career. The ensuing uproar forced Mr. Bruno to place his interest in First Grafton into a blind trust.One of the lobbyists, James D. Featherstonhaugh, has represented dozens of special interest groups, including banks, insurance companies, the horse racing industry and labor unions. In December, the federal grand jury investigating Mr. Bruno sent a subpoena to Mr. Featherstonhaugh for First Grafton’s records.Mr. Featherstonhaugh said everyone involved in First Grafton had lost money, and he estimated Mr. Bruno’s losses totaled about $150,000 over the 17 years that the project dragged on. Despite that, he said Mr. Bruno “never seemed to be in financial stress.” The senator, he said, tended to be frugal.“He has never struck me as either outrageously wealthy or poor,” Mr. Featherstonhaugh said. “He just seemed to me to be kind of O.K.”Mr. Bruno’s willingness to mix public and private interests was apparent in another real estate deal he entered into in 1999, when he and his son Joseph bought a small apartment house in Troy from Russell C. Ball, a state contractor whose wife, Dori Evans, served as finance director for the Senate Republican campaign committee, which Mr. Bruno controls.Mr. Ball’s Brooklyn-based company, which does underground utility work, has had contracts on several major state projects, and a couple of years ago he created a nonprofit group that purchased full-page newspaper ads saluting Mr. Bruno. An official familiar with the investigation said the F.B.I. has questioned people about Mr. Ball’s relationship with Mr. Bruno. Mr. Ball had no comment.Not long after buying the building, Mr. Bruno’s son decided he wanted out, and Mr. Bruno tapped a friend and neighbor, Joseph L. Magno, to step in and replace his son in the investment and on a $235,000 loan used to buy the property.“He literally said, ‘Will you please help me out,’ ” said Mr. Magno, who is now a lobbyist. He said that he lost as much as $30,000 on the investment, and that Mr. Bruno lost money as well.Mr. Magno was not just a friend, but also an investor in high-tech companies. In 2000, Mr. Magno agreed to help Mr. Bruno, the senator secured $150,000 in state money to start a statewide trade association of technology firms headed by Mr. Magno.The same year, an Internet company called Go2pay, whose directors included Mr. Magno, received $250,000 in state economic development funds, at a ceremony presided over by Mr. Bruno and Gov. George E. Pataki.Mr. Bruno did not lose money on all his ventures. His financial disclosure statements showed that he seemed to have earned money, on a regular basis, from the consulting business he started, Capital Business Consultants L.L.C.In a news conference in December when he revealed the F.B.I. inquiry, Mr. Bruno said he provided advice on marketing and business development to lawyers and businesspeople. He declined to release information about his fees or the names of his clients, though some have been identified as a result of the investigation.One of his first clients was McGinn Smith, an Albany investment firm. Mr. Bruno has invested both personal and campaign funds in companies controlled by McGinn Smith’s chairman, Timothy M. McGinn. In 1999, Mr. Bruno reported making an undisclosed amount of money on the sale of stock in Pointe Financial, a bank holding company of which Mr. McGinn was chairman. It was one of Mr. Bruno’s few profitable stock investments in recent years.Another consulting client was Jared Abbruzzese, a businessman and friend who has flown Mr. Bruno around on private jets and who, until recently, was part of a group competing for a statewide horse racing franchise. From 2002 to 2004, Mr. Bruno decided to award $500,000 in discretionary state grants to a company in which Mr. Abbruzzese was a major investor, Evident Technologies.The F.B.I. is now investigating Mr. Bruno’s dealings with both McGinn Smith and Mr. Abbruzzese, people who have been briefed about the inquiry said.Mr. Bruno has defended his use of state money to support Evident and other businesses, saying his only goal was to create jobs. His aides have also shrugged off questions about his overlapping personal and public interests, saying that Mr. Bruno has been in business and politics so long that interaction with people in both spheres was unavoidable.To old friends and supporters, some of whom have benefited from the millions in public money that Mr. Bruno has directed to projects over the years, the senator’s current predicament is heartbreaking. Mr. Benson, who was once Mr. Bruno’s partner at Coradian, said he recently heard about the F.B.I. investigation while listening to the radio and immediately called Mr. Bruno.“Joe called me back and left a message, saying he was O.K., that he had been re-elected majority leader and that everything was under control,” Mr. Benson said from his home in Wisconsin. “But I have to say, he didn’t sound all that good.”'"

An adjustable-rate mortgage is considered a higher-risk loan because it typically draws borrowers in with an initial low, or ""teaser"" rate, which can rise substantially over time.Home-mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures are surging, especially for people who took out subprime mortgages -- higher-interest loans for those with blemished credit records or low incomes who are considered higher risks -- during the sizzling housing boom that waned in the latter half of 2005.Write-offs of home mortgage loans by banks and thrifts reached a three-year high in the fourth quarter last year, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

The plants generate hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and create hundreds of jobs at suppliers and support businessesAn announcement would come at a critical time for Toyota. It is on the verge of becoming the world’s biggest auto company, displacing General Motors, an event that could occur as soon as this year.In 2006, Toyota unseated DaimlerChrysler to become the third-biggest automaker in the United States. This year, it could move up to second biggest in American sales, displacing Ford Motor.Toyota already has plants in Ontario in Canada, Indiana and Kentucky; it recently opened one in San Antonio.In 2006, Toyota built more than 1.55 million vehicles and 1.4 million engines at its 14 plants in North America. In addition to these factories, it is building an assembly plant in Woodstock, Ontario, and it will begin building Camrys at a plant owned by Subaru in Indiana this year.In January, G.M.’s vice chairman, Robert A. Lutz, said Toyota had more influence in Washington than G.M. because of the number of states where it had plants.Mississippi was not on the original list of states considered by Toyota, which had said the factory would probably be in the South. Initially, the company considered locations in Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas and North Carolina.But when it became known that Toyota was considering another factory, more states entered the running, including Mississippi, where three counties banded together to promote a site.The Toyota plant would be the second big auto factory in Mississippi and would be an economic boost after the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Nissan Motor Company opened an assembly plant in Canton, outside Jackson, in 2003.Toyota also had considered expanding its plant in San Antonio, which builds a new version of its Tundra pickup. Its 2,000-acre plant site there is believed to be among the biggest in the world, and it is common for Toyota to expand factories after it begins production.Toyota executives see the newest Tundra, which competes with Detroit’s big pickups, as the most important vehicle the company has ever introduced in the United States.'"
"'07-02-27,'0','The United States was not the only country to respond to the horror of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks with policies that went much too far in curtailing basic rights and civil liberties in the name of public safety. Now we see that a nation can regain its senses after calm reflection and begin to rein back such excesses, but that heartening news comes from Canada and not the United States.Canada’s Supreme Court has struck down a law that the government used to detain foreign-born terrorism suspects indefinitely — employing secret evidence and not filing charges — while orders to deport them were reviewed. The law was actually passed in 1978, but was primarily employed to detain and deport foreign spies. After the 2001 attacks, the Canadian government began using it aggressively to hold terrorism suspects, claiming that it was an important tool for keeping Canada safe.That is just the sort of argument the Bush administration used to ram the excesses of the Patriot Act and the 2006 Military Commissions Act through Congress, and offered as an excuse for other abusive policies, like President Bush’s illegal wiretapping of international calls and e-mail.The Canadian justices rejected their government’s specious national security claim with a forceful 9-to-0 ruling that upheld every person’s right to fair treatment. “The overarching principle of fundamental justice that applies here is this: before the state can detain people for significant periods of time, it must accord them a fair judicial process,” Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin wrote.The contrast with the United States could not be more disturbing. The Canadian court ruling came just days after a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that Congress could deny inmates of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp the ancient right to challenge their confinement in court. The 2006 military tribunals law revoked that right for a select group who had been designated “illegal enemy combatants” without a semblance of judicial process.In late January, Canada created another unflattering contrast with United States policy when it offered a formal apology and financial compensation to Maher Arar, a Canadian citizen who was a victim of Mr. Bush’s decision to approve open-ended detentions, summary deportations and even torture after 9/11. Mr. Arar was detained in the United States and deported to Syria, where he was held for nearly a year and tortured.'"
"'07-02-27,'0','“These are drugs that were presumed to be entirely safe, given for supportive care and to improve quality of life,” not to actually treat cancer, said Dr. Eric Winer, director of breast oncology center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “So any concern that they could shorten someone’s life are taken quite seriously.”The Food and Drug Administration is planning to convene an advisory committee meeting to review the products, Dr. Richard Pazdur, the agency’s director for cancer drugs, said in an e-mail message last week alerting cancer doctors to the new findings.All the drugs are versions of erythropoietin, or Epo, a substance made by the human kidney that increases levels of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells.Amgen makes Aranesp, with sales of $4.1 billion last year, as well as Epogen, which had sales of $2.5 billion, although Epogen is supposed to be used only to treat anemia in kidney dialysis patients.Under license from Amgen, Johnson & Johnson sells Procrit in the United States and Eprex abroad, with combined sales last year of $3.2 billion.Roche’s drugs NeoRecormon and Epogin, now sold only outside the United States, had sales last year of $1.8 billion. But Roche is hoping to enter the American market with a new drug called Cera.Amgen has the most to lose from any setback because it relies more heavily on the Epo drugs, which account for nearly half its revenue. Amgen’s stock touched above $75 briefly in late January, before word of the negative studies began emerging. The shares closed yesterday at $66.20, down 3 cents.The new doubts about cancer safety add to those raised recently regarding the drugs’ other major use — to treat anemia caused by kidney disease. A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in November found that patients treated aggressively with Procrit had a higher risk of heart problems or death than those treated less aggressively.The run of bad news for cancer treatment started in late January when Amgen announced that in one of its clinical trials, patients getting Aranesp were more likely to die than those getting placebo. The trial was testing the drug in patients whose anemia was caused by the cancer itself, not by chemotherapy.On Feb. 16, the Cancer Letter, an influential Washington newsletter, reported that a Danish study in patients with head and neck cancer had been stopped early because the cancer seemed to recur more in patients being treated with Aranesp.Last week, The Journal of Clinical Oncology published a paper online describing a small Canadian trial in lung cancer patients that had been stopped early because those getting Eprex were dying sooner.And on Friday, Roche said it was suspending patient enrollment in a lung cancer trial comparing its Cera against Amgen’s Aranesp because of apparently greater than expected number of deaths in at least some of the arms of the trial.It is not known why the drugs cause problems, if they do. It is known that raising hemoglobin levels too high increases the risk of blood clots. And most of these new trials did aim to increase hemoglobin above the levels recommended in the drugs’ labels, though that was not the case with Amgen’s own trial.But there is some evidence that clots were not the problem in these trials. Rather, some experts say, Epo may spur tumor growth. Some studies suggest that certain tumor cells, such as those in head and neck cancer, have proteins on their surface that bind to Epo. When that happens it sets off a cascade of reactions spurring growth.“I think there’s enough biologic plausibility to the argument that they can serve as a growth factor for the cancer cell,” said Dr. Jennifer R. Grandis, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has done studies of the matter. She said the head and neck cancer practice at her institution does not routinely use Epo and that she would not want it herself.But Dr. David P. Steensma at the Mayo Clinic, who has reviewed studies of Epo safety, said the existence of Epo receptors on tumors had not been proved because the studies have been flawed. He said that there have been previous studies of the drugs that suggested they actually had a positive effect on survival.A combined analysis of 57 trials concluded the impact of the drugs on survival was uncertain.Dr. Steensma said he was still comfortable using the drugs to correct severe anemia, but added, “I think we need to be real careful about going beyond that.”Concerns about the safety of the drugs for cancer were first raised in 2003 by two studies that showed patients getting Epo had worse outcomes. But some experts said those studies were flawed and not convincing.'"
"'07-02-27,'0','“The constant refrain in this office is, ‘Are we really Catholic?’ ” Ms. Kissling said here in a recent interview. “I know with every ounce of my being that you don’t have to agree with the positions of the church on issues of abortion and contraception to be Catholic.”Many Catholics passionately disagree. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued statements challenging the right of Catholics for a Free Choice to call itself Catholic. Critics dismiss Ms. Kissling’s organization as a mouthpiece for bigger, secular abortion rights groups and a front for anti-Catholic bigotry.“They could get special attention and get special digs at the church because of their name,” said Helen M. Alvaré, an associate professor of law at the Catholic University of America and a former planning director of the Secretariat for Pro-Life Activities at the Catholic Bishops conference. “They had no grass-roots base among Catholics. There was nothing very different about them from other pro-choice groups in the arguments they made.”Catholics for a Free Choice says it gives voice to the large percentage of Roman Catholics who disagree with the church’s position on reproductive issues. Its $3 million budget is largely financed by well-known secular foundations, including the Ford Foundation.Ms. Kissling agrees with her detractors that her organization has not affected church doctrine. Instead, it has focused on working with lay Catholics and others to build momentum for its causes.With other groups, it successfully lobbied against the naming of John Klink, a former representative of the Holy See at the United Nations, to lead the State Department Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration in 2001. Most recently, it worked with staff members for Representatives Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, and Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, to draft legislation intended to decrease abortions, partly by increasing financing for family planning.Sitting in her Washington office, Ms. Kissling was unequivocal in her distaste for the church hierarchy. “I think that in many ways, the church has become an unjust institution,” she said. On one wall of her office was a cherub, on another a Che Guevara calendar. In a corner stood a candle that looked like a bishop’s miter, yet to be lit.Ms. Kissling continued: “It abuses nuns, anyone who thinks, homosexuals, women who have abortions. It sexually abuses children. It treats people badly, and something has to be done to change its abusive nature.”Ms. Kissling was born Frances Romanski into a working-class Polish family in New York, the oldest of four children. When she was a child, her mother divorced and later married a man named Kissling, which in the eyes of the church made her an adulteress, Ms. Kissling said.Despite her frustration with such beliefs, Ms. Kissling said, she was inspired by the nuns at her Catholic school. In the early 1960s, she joined a convent, at age 19.Convent life demanded that she look deep inside herself, she said, and she discovered that she did not agree with the church’s teachings on divorce and birth control. She left after six months to attend the New School.Avowedly heterosexual, she said she never had a desire to marry or have children. She became active in the women’s movement in the 1960s. Then in 1970, when abortion was legalized in New York, she was asked to direct an abortion clinic in Pelham. She had no experience, she said, but neither did anyone else, so she took the position.In 1978, she joined the board of Catholics for a Free Choice, and in 1982, she took over as president.Critics and supporters say Ms. Kissling has a more nuanced view of abortion than many in the abortion rights movement. She said her experience working at an abortion clinic and her upbringing in the church made her believe “there was a certain void in the pro-choice movement around the questions of morality and ethics.”In late 2004, she published an article in her group’s magazine, Conscience, titled “How to Think About the Fetus.” She said that while the fetus might not be a person, it was part of the continuum of humanity. She wrote that the fetus “is not nothing,” and that women who consider abortion know that.Ms. Kissling said that abortion rights leaders feared acknowledging the value of a fetus because they did not want to further stigmatize abortion. But, she contends, that reticence has cast the abortion rights movement as casual about the emotional realities of abortion.“Women know that something is inside them, and they know that something will become a baby if they don’t act in some way,” she said. “I don’t think we could say anything to them about the value of fetal life that they haven’t thought of already.”Many abortion rights leaders said the article was damaging, especially because it came out while politicians were considering bans on so-called partial-birth abortions. But others, including some in the anti-abortion camp, commended Ms. Kissling.“With her approach, she has found the real-life stuff,” said Representative Ryan, a Catholic who opposes abortion. “Those of us in the debate get hooked on philosophy and theory and dogma, and what Frances brings is reality: that abortion is a difficult decision for a woman.”Ms. Kissling said she had decided to step down because she believed that her efficacy might soon wane, that she was on the “verge of becoming boring or predictable.” Jon O’Brien, 41, executive vice president of Catholics for a Free Choice, is to take over as president.Ms. Kissling hopes to write a book about the value of the fetus, or teach, or finish the house she is building on the coast of Uruguay, she said. She has no plans to leave the Catholic Church.“There are days when I think I can’t be a Catholic and that I want to go join a community where I am welcomed, honored, where I can join a parish,” she said. “But in the end, I don’t want to be a Methodist. I’m a member of the greatest religion in the world.”'"

"'07-02-27,'0','If Judge Walton had replaced the juror, he would have been required to instruct the newly reconstituted jury to begin its deliberations from the beginning, as if there had been no previous discussions.Theodore V. Wells Jr., Mr. Libby’s lead defense lawyer, said that to add a new juror and restart deliberations would be prejudicial to his client. “It would be inappropriate and unfair” to discard the deliberations thus far, Mr. Wells argued.Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the chief prosecutor, said that the government believed a replacement juror should be seated and that there was no doubt the 11 remaining jurors would follow the judge’s instructions to begin their deliberations anew.But Judge Walton said he did not want to “throw away” the time the jury had already spent considering the case.The alternates are two women who sat through the entire case as part of a panel of 14 jurors and were informed by Judge Walton that they were alternates only just before deliberations began. He told them at the time that they could be recalled to participate in the deliberations if needed and warned them to continue to abide by his instructions to avoid any news coverage of the case.The decision by Mr. Libby’s defense team to urge that the trial proceed without a new 12th juror seemed to be counter to conventional wisdom in such situations, lawyers said.Because a unanimous jury is needed for a guilty verdict, a defendant need convince only one juror of his innocence to avoid a conviction. As a result, lawyers said, defense lawyers prefer to have as many sitting jurors as possible to increase the chances of having someone who refuses to vote for a guilty verdict.But Neal R. Sonnett, a Miami lawyer who is the former president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said there were often other factors at play. Mr. Libby’s defense team would have made a judgment about the alternate’s inclination toward the case, Mr. Sonnett said.“The lawyers are always looking at who that person would be,” he said. “And then they are engaging in a little mind-reading, trying to guess from that person’s body language” whether it would be helpful or harmful to insert him into the deliberations.In this case, the replacement juror would have been a middle-aged woman who identified herself as an insurance industry consultant. Some reporters at the trial observed her taking notes assiduously during the monthlong proceedings.The dismissed juror was also notable in that she was the only one of the pool of 14 who declined to don a T-shirt with a heart on Valentine’s Day as a gesture of good will to the judge and the court staff.Mr. Libby, who is known by his nickname, Scooter, is the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. He is charged with five felony counts, accused of lying to a grand jury and F.B.I. agents investigating the leak in the summer of 2003 of the identity of a C.I.A. operative, Valerie Wilson.Her identity was first disclosed publicly in a July 14, 2003, column by Robert D. Novak. Only days earlier, The New York Times had published an Op-Ed article by her husband, Joseph C. Wilson IV, asserting that the Bush White House had willfully distorted intelligence as to whether Iraq had tried to obtain uranium from Africa to bolster the case for going to war.Mr. Fitzgerald, who was named special counsel for the investigation, never charged anybody with illegally leaking Ms. Wilson’s name. But he said Mr. Libby had discussed Ms. Wilson in conversations with two reporters and had denied under oath having done so. Mr. Libby’s lawyers said that the reporters were mistaken about those conversations and that, in any event, any misstatements he made were a result of innocent failures of memory.'"
"'07-02-27,'0','PETA has sent a letter to Commissioner Roger Goodell asking that Babineaux be suspended for a year if he is found guilty. It has also asked that the Falcons suspend Babineaux, 25, if the case is not resolved by the start of the season, and that the team cut him if he is found guilty.“It’s the kind of thing people can’t identify with,” said Dan Shannon, the manager of youth outreach and programs at PETA’s Virginia headquarters. “You just can’t think there is any way you’d kill a dog.”Babineaux and his girlfriend, Blair Anderson, argued last Sunday, and Anderson was at the movies when Babineaux called to tell her she should come home to check on the dog, according to the police.When she got there, the dog was in “severe physical distress,” the police said. Kilo vomited blood in the car as Anderson drove to the Animal Emergency Center in Lawrenceville, Ga. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. Doctors called the police.At the time, Babineaux told the police he had had physical contact with the dog but nothing that would have caused its death. The police said Babineaux’s explanation was inconsistent with the physical evidence, and he was arrested.Since then, an Atlanta television station has reported — and a league official has confirmed — that Babineaux said he was following the advice of a dog trainer recommended by his veterinarian to try to train the dog not to be aggressive. And in turning the dog repeatedly in a circle until it became disoriented, the dog accidentally smacked its head against the wall.“I don’t know of any trainer that would offer that kind of advice,” said Richard Rice, the state program manager in the Atlanta office of the Humane Society of the United States.Babineaux’s lawyer, Pat McDonough, would not confirm the television station’s account. But he said Babineaux had been falsely accused.“He’s done absolutely nothing wrong,” McDonough said in a telephone interview last night. “I’m confident people are going to realize they are jumping to conclusions based on wrong information.”The autopsy is expected to show whether a weapon was used to kill Kilo. If one was, that would surprise the Falcons, who were shocked by Babineaux’s arrest because he is well regarded by the franchise. He is said to be distraught about the case.The N.F.L. will handle the case under the much discussed personal conduct policy, which would allow Goodell to fine or suspend Babineaux. The Falcons spokesman Reggie Roberts said the team would wait until the case was complete before deciding Babineaux’s fate, although the Falcons’ owner, Arthur Blank, is known for his concern about behavior and image issues. Earlier this off-season, Atlanta quarterback Michael Vick had a water bottle with a secret compartment seized at the Miami airport.Roberts said of Blank, “Any time any of our guys makes the papers in a negative light, he’s not happy.”One league official who is not authorized to speak publicly for the team said Babineaux would not be released. One possible benefit of the dog’s death, however it happened, is that the Falcons will most likely recommend that Babineaux donate money for each tackle he makes next season to the Humane Society.'"
"'07-02-27,'0','Lyondell Chemical said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its titanium dioxide pigment business to an affiliate of the National Industrialization Company of Saudi Arabia for about $1.2 billion.Lyondell said that the deal would include a cash payment of $1.05 billion, and estimated its after-tax proceeds at $975 million.National Industrialization owns 66 percent of the buyer, the National Titanium Dioxide Company, also known as Cristal. Titanium dioxide is a white pigment commonly used in consumer products like paint and toothpaste.Lyondell said the deal was expected to close in the first half, and added that it intended to use the proceeds to reduce debt.The operations being sold include eight factories in Europe, Australia and the Americas, National Industrialization said in a statement on the Saudi stock market Web site.Prince Walid bin Talal, a Saudi billionaire and member of the royal family, is a shareholder of National Industrialization. Last month, the prince said he had raised his stake in the company from 10 percent, without saying how much he had bought.Lyondell’s chief financial officer, T.

"'07-02-27,'0','Mr. Gelb, who is in his first season as general manager, has staked the Met’s future on deepening the theatrical presence on the stage, exemplified by his hiring of the film and theater director Anthony Minghella to direct this season’s opener, “Madama Butterfly,” which sold out and will return next season. While most of next season’s plans were already in place before his arrival, Mr. Gelb has made his mark by bringing in directors with mainly nonoperatic experience.They include Mary Zimmerman for “Lucia,” Richard Jones for “Hansel” and John Doyle (who won a Tony Award for “Sweeney Todd”) for “Grimes.” The leaders of London’s theater troupe Improbable will direct “Satyagraha.”The new productions brought in by Mr. Gelb are “Lucia,” “Hansel and Gretel” and “Satyagraha.” Mr. Gelb acknowledged that new productions are expensive but said that ticket sales and increased donations brought in by their buzz would make up the cost, and then some. He said ticket revenue this year already equals last year’s total.Mr. Gelb also said the Met would expand its increasingly popular live broadcasts in movie theaters, which started this season, to at least eight from six, and beam them into a handful of New York schools. He said he would raise the number of open houses to three from one and repeat the opening-night simulcast in Times Square and Lincoln Center Plaza.Tan Dun’s sprawling new work, “The First Emperor,” which ran to mixed reviews but full houses this winter, will return at the end of the 2007-8 season for three performances. Mr. Gelb said he had asked Mr. Tan to make cuts to improve the dramatic flow. “He didn’t have the benefit of a rewrite,” Mr. Gelb said.One reason for bringing the work back, he said, was to have it ready for a tour to China tied to the 2008 Olympics. The tour is not a sure thing, but Mr. Gelb said Chinese government officials had expressed strong interest, even promising financial support. “The Met would like to go,” he said.In revivals Karita Mattila will sing Puccini’s “Manon Lescaut” for the first time at the house. Valery Gergiev will conduct two Prokofiev works, “The Gambler” and “War and Peace.” Renée Fleming will return in “La Traviata,” which she once turned down at the Met earlier in her career because she felt she was not ready. She will also sing Desdemona in Verdi’s “Otello.” Mr. Gelb said Robert Wilson would direct Bellini’s “Norma” for Ms. Fleming in 2011.Diana Damrau will sing Pamina in “Der Zauberflöte,” then step around to the other side of the plate to sing the Queen of the Night in later performances. Mr. Gelb said that unusual bit of casting had come about because Ms. Damrau had asked to be excused from the final Pamina performances in order to be available for concerts with Riccardo Muti. But the concerts fell through. Since a substitute had already been found, and the role of the Queen (a Damrau specialty) remained open, it went to her.Mr. Gelb said he was hoping to cast Audra McDonald, the Broadway singer, to perform the role of Kitty, J. Robert Oppenheimer’s wife, in John Adams’s “Doctor Atomic,” for the 2008-9 season. “We’re wooing her,” Mr. Gelb said. Ms. McDonald sang an excerpt with the New York Philharmonic two seasons ago.'"
"'07-02-27,'0','PhRMA, a trade group, reports that its members spent more than $38 billion in 2004 on research and development, exceeding the entire budget of the National Institutes of Health.Of the industry-sponsored studies in 2003, 84 percent had positive results, compared with 62 percent of those with no backing from drug manufacturers. That year, two of every three independently financed studies were randomized, compared with one of three industry-sponsored studies. This result, the authors wrote, confirms earlier findings.Alan Goldhammer, deputy vice president for regulatory affairs at PhRMA, defended the design and the generally positive tenor of the industry studies.“Compounds are not taken into the clinic for trials unless there’s a reasonable expectation that the outcome will be successful,” Mr. Goldhammer said. “Protocols are submitted in advance to regulatory agencies, and in the case of the F.D.A., agreements are made with respect to the statistical design of those trials.”Three of the four authors of the review, which was published online yesterday by the journal Cancer and will appear in its April 1 issue, are paid consultants for or receive research financing from pharmaceutical companies.“This is typical of relationships between clinical investigators and academic oncologists on the one hand and the pharmaceutical industry on the other,” Dr. Peppercorn said. “Because we’re considered experts in the management of these diseases, we’re often asked to consult on the design of new therapies or trials or to give educational and, sometimes, promotional talks explaining breast cancer management.”Dr. Joseph D. Purvis, executive director for clinical research at AstraZeneca, said he found the study useful.“It’s perfectly appropriate to ask questions about this kind of issue,” Dr. Purvis said. “If we’re not delivering good-quality clinical trials, then we’re in trouble. We have always thought that we have to publish and make public even negative results, even though we’d obviously like them to be positive, as would the rest of society.”The problem, Dr. Peppercorn said, is not that pharmaceutical companies are in some way cheating or concealing negative information, but rather that they are interested just in certain types of investigations.For example, the authors write, it is essential to understand the effects of the timing and duration of therapy, to learn which patients are most likely to develop toxicity to drugs and to figure out the long-term outcomes of current therapies. Those questions may not interest drug companies.“I don’t think drug companies should be criticized for not pursuing these questions,” Dr. Peppercorn said. “But funding sources, policy makers and clinical researchers need to make sure that important questions that are not being explored by pharmaceutical companies are still addressed.”'"
"'07-02-27,'0','“Given the circumstances surrounding Ms. Hatto’s sickness and fate, there may be deeply felt — if misguided — personal reasons for it,” Mr. von Bahr said.Ms. Hatto’s career as a concert pianist was cut short in 1976 when she fell ill with ovarian cancer. She moved to the countryside with her husband, a sound engineer, and continued to record well-known works from the piano repertory. Barely two years ago, music critics began praising those recordings, with one critic heralding Ms. Hatto as “the greatest living pianist that almost no one has ever heard of.”On its Web site on Monday, Gramophone said that in his letter to BIS Records, Mr. Barrington-Coupe said he had used other pianists’ recordings to give his wife “the illusion of a great end to an unfairly (as he terms it) overlooked career.”Mr. Barrington-Coupe is quoted as saying that after CD technology arrived in the early 1980s, his attempts to transfer her cassette recordings to CDs proved unsuccessful. He and his wife therefore decided to re-record her repertory.“Although she kept up a rigorous practice regime, Barrington-Coupe says that Hatto was suffering more than she admitted, even to herself,” Mr. Inverne wrote. “Recording session after recording session was marred by her many grunts of pain as she played, and her husband was at a loss to know how to cover the problem passages.”It was then that Mr. Barrington-Coupe began inserting small patches from other recordings to cover his wife’s grunts, Mr. Inverne said. Subsequently, he used longer passages and discovered how to stretch the time of the original recordings digitally to disguise their origin. “However, he maintains that his wife knew nothing of the deception,” Mr. Inverne added.Mr. Inverne said he pressed Mr. Barrington-Coupe to provide a full list of the recordings used on behalf of Ms. Hatto. “Only then will we know how good she actually was,” he said, “and only then can at least some of her reputation be salvaged.”But Mr. Barrington-Coupe, 76, apparently declined to provide more information in his conversation with Mr. Inverne on Monday. “I’m tired,” Mr. Inverne quoted him as saying. “I’m not very well. I’ve closed the operation down. I’ve had the stock completely destroyed, and I’m not producing more. Now I just want a little bit of peace.”In the music recording world, though, the search to find the pianists behind other recordings carrying Ms. Hatto’s name continues. Andrew Rose, a British sound engineer who first confirmed that Ms. Hatto’s recording of Liszt’s Transcendental Études was copied, noted on Monday on his Web site (pristineclassical.com/HattoHoax.html) that “we have yet to investigate a Hatto recording that has not proved to be a hoax.”'"
"'07-02-27,'0','The Microsoft move comes at a time of increased investment in online health ventures, rising traffic at consumer health sites on the Web and profits at the most popular sites. Last month, a venture firm headed by Stephen M. Case, the former chief executive of America Online, introduced an ambitious new consumer health site, RevolutionHealth.com.WebMD, the leading health-related site, last week reported strong quarterly profit of $8.9 million on revenue of $80.6 million, surpassing Wall Street’s expectations. The stock price of WebMD — an Internet pioneer in health information that struggled for years — has surged in the last year.In health-related search, Healthline Networks, a start-up in San Francisco, reports rising traffic on its Web site and a growing string of deals to provide the search engine for sites of other companies, including Merck and PacifiCare. At Google, Adam Bosworth, a vice president for engineering, is leading the effort to develop a health-information offering.These companies and others are seeking ways to build businesses on the Internet that profit from what is called consumer-driven health care. The notion is that shifts in demographics, economics, technology and policy will inevitably mean that individuals will want to, and be forced to, make more health care decisions themselves.Aging baby boomers, accustomed to personal choice and to technology, tend to want a say in their treatment decisions. And the Internet is already an important source of health information. Eight million people in the United States go online for health information every day, according to a study last year by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, a nonprofit group.Financially, the pressure by Medicare and private health insurers to hold down costs and shift more of the burden to individuals, analysts say, will force people to make more health care spending choices.In Medstory, Microsoft is acquiring “some of the best deep technology” in the emerging field of medical search, said Esther Dyson, an industry analyst who is also an investor in Medstory. That technology, Ms. Dyson said, is “not so much a search engine, but an ontology engine,” with a capability to find and identify concepts in health and not just sort through words and Web links.The longer-range goal, Mr. Neupert said, is to link personal information like age, sex, drug regimens, family history and even genetic markers to search. The ideal is that search results are tailored individually, identifying treatments, drug interactions and medical journal articles of interest.“Health search could be way more relevant,” he said. “You don’t need to see thousands of results. What you want to know is, what does this mean to me personally?”Dr. Alain T. Rappaport, the founder and chief executive of Medstory, said he was impressed by the importance Microsoft placed on “intelligent search” in health care and by the promise that Microsoft’s global reach and resources could accelerate the spread of the technology his team developed.Microsoft had talked to Healthline recently about using its health search service, said West Shell III, the chief executive of Healthline. “This means Microsoft has decided to go it alone,” Mr. Shell said.'"
"'07-02-27,'0','As a consequence, more travelers are thinking of the miles as a little like Green Stamps or Monopoly play money. And online booking sites, including airlines, are thinking up new ways to both earn and use the miles.Now, I am not the one you want to turn to for detailed advice on how to figure out the weird mileage-redemption economy. The various Web sites all explain their terms in great detail.Me, I have a new Cingular cellphone (internationally enabled, capable of taking pictures, making videos, surfing the Internet and, perhaps, opening my garage door), and I stare anxiously at it when it merely rings. I recently installed Mozilla Firefox on my desktop to supplant Internet Explorer, and the two browsers have been at full-fledged war with each other since.But here’s the simple question frequent fliers like me have been asking: Why should I book on a third-party site when my favored airlines and hotels are desperately trying to keep me loyal with their own new and revised promotions?“Well, increasingly we’re hearing from consumers that it’s very hard to redeem frequent-flier miles,” said Jeffrey Glueck, the chief marketing officer of Travelocity. “You have to almost always pay double miles, and good luck finding a date to a popular destination.”True enough. Aware of that, airlines have been redesigning their Web sites to make it easier to see which dates are available and at what price in miles.The third-party online sites are scrambling to change a perception — which many business travelers swear by — that booking directly with an airline or hotel ensures you better customer service, especially if something goes wrong on the road. The third-party sites are also inflating the miles earned in combination with use of a credit card issued by a mileage partner, and stressing ways to earn travel without those hated airline restrictions.Travelocity, for example, promotes a Travelocity Rewards MasterCard, which enables you to redeem awards on any airline and most hotels. Earning 20,000 points translates into a value of $400, which “you can spend with no seat or inventory restrictions, or on hotels,” Mr. Glueck said.In October, Travelocity started its own elite program called V.I.P., offering triple points and other promotions to its most loyal customers. Expedia followed with a loyalty program called ThankYou Network.Orbitz recently designed a Web site called Road Warrior for small-business travelers who book their own travel. Among its features are real-time alerts direct to your cellphone or other device, and to any six other people you designate, on changes to your travel plans.Travelocity now has a feature that works in conjunction with the new Microsoft Vista system. It “pops up with a message to alert you anytime an airline lowers a fare” on one of three routes you choose to be advised about, Mr. Glueck said.“You can use us for absolute rock-bottom fares, and it will automatically check for lower fares at airports within 50 miles, or plus-or-minus three days” of a departure date that you choose, he said.This sounds swell, but quite complicated to a slow adapter like me. As I said, my Firefox and Internet Explorer are engaged in open hostilities on my desktop. My new cellphone just rang, and I think I heard the garage door open.'"

"'07-02-28,'1','In Shanghai, share prices actually closed up 3.94 percent Wednesday, one day after slumping 8.8 percent -- which was their biggest single day loss in 10 years.The rebound helped Tokyo to pare its losses, with the benchmark Nikkei-225 index ending down 2.85 percent by the close.Commenting on the falls in Europe, Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities in London, said: ""I think giving up a few percentage points isn't a big deal, in the context of things, when we've had four great years of rising stock markets.""People tend to focus on the billions (of dollars) that have been lost yesterday (Tuesday) and possibly today but look at the trillions that were actually made over the past four year. I think one has to put it into perspective.""I am not particularly worried about the end to the Chinese speculative boom,"" Lenhoff added.""I don't think there's an end to the Chinese economic boom. I think that's going to continue and I don't think anybody is suggesting that it isn't going to continue. What's going on in the (Chinese) economy is for real and that will continue. What's going on in the stock market has been a lot of punting.""The chief economist for Asia at Societe Generale, Glenn Maguire, said: ""What we are seeing is the echo of the fall in the Chinese market (on Tuesday) and more importantly the fall that we saw in the US equity market overnight.""I don't think these moves significantly change the macroeconomic outlook for China which remains relatively firm at this stage. I think the markets should stabilise across the rest of the (Asian) region,"" he added.Market players were meanwhile nervously awaiting the start of trade on Wall Street later in the day after the Dow Jones (NYSE:DJ) Industrial Average ended down 3.29 percent on Tuesday -- the worst day on Wall Street since 2001.Comments from former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and rising tension about Iran's nuclear programme added to undermine investor jitters.Greenspan had warned on Monday that the US economy had been expanding since 2001 and that there were signs that the current economic cycle was coming to an end.""I feel relatively confident that we're still going to see a decent year out of the US and with that in mind it's just a matter of time before the correction produces a buying opportunity,"" Lenhoff said.""I don't feel this is the start of something really serious that is going to take us all the way back to where we started four years ago.""On the foreign exchange market, the dollar rebounded but dealers predicted the recovery could be short-lived amid fresh volatility on stock markets and concerns about tensions in Iran and Afghanistan.Oil prices were meanwhile down about 50 cents in London and New York.'"
"'07-02-28,'1','In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell 2.5 percent. It, too, showed a slight recovery from heavier losses in morning trading.Practically every other stock index in Asia outside of mainland China also fell.Major European markets opened with swift, steep falls, but soon began to retrace some of losses, and by early afternoon had pared their losses to around 1 percent. Investors in Asia and Europe appeared to pay less attention to the Chinese markets than to the drop on Tuesday in American stock indices, and to a Commerce Department report on Tuesday that manufacturing in the United States is ailing more than had previously been realized.Given the rebound today in mainland Chinese stocks, “this morning’s price reaction in Europe shows it is not just China,” Nigel Richardson, the Hong Kong-based chief investment officer in Asia for AXA Investment Managers, said.The managing director general of the Asian Development Bank, Rajat M. Nag, said in an interview in Hong Kong this morning that the economic fundamentals of most Asian economies were strong. But the region remains dependent on exports, especially to the United States, Mr. Nag said. China is among the most dependent of all, he said, with international trade in goods equal to 65 percent of its economic output last year.“We are still fairly bullish on the Chinese economy’s growth potential,” Mr. Nag said, but he added that its dependence on exports “is a vulnerability.”China’s current difficulties are partly a case of the Beijing government getting what it wished for, only to regret it.The Chinese government has limited the appreciation of the country’s currency, the yuan, by buying dollars on a massive scale. As a result, it has accumulated more than $1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves.To pay for the dollars, the Chinese central bank has issued hundreds of billions of yuan.The central bank has been able to absorb some of these extra yuan by selling more government bonds to Chinese banks and the public. But part of the extra cash issued to pay for currency market intervention has made its way into the financial system.This has contributed to steep rises in stock prices — the Shanghai stock market rose 130 percent last year — and in real estate prices. The slump in share prices on Tuesday has raised questions about the long-term sustainability of high prices for Chinese assets.But it remains unclear how much the rest of the world should care about mainland Chinese stock market prices.Government regulations have kept foreign investment in these markets to insignificant levels by international standards. In addition, most Chinese still put their money in bank accounts or in real estate instead of buying stocks, and Tuesday’s plunge, while dramatic, merely returned the Shanghai stock market to where it began the month.The consensus of economists today was that the volatility in mainland stocks would have little if any effect on the enduring strength of economic growth in China.The stocks of Asian companies that export to the United States, such as the Sony Corporation, suffered particularly heavy losses today following the report on Tuesday from the Commerce Department that orders for cars, washing machines and other durable goods dropped 8 percent in January.“There is a worry that U.S. consumption could slow substantially, and that is a much bigger factor than China’s stock market,” the chief Asia economist in the Hong Kong offices of Credit Suisse, Tao Dong, said.Analysts said the biggest factors were concerns about a possible downturn by the American economy and whether that would lead to cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. That could in turn undermine the value of Japan’s currency, the yen. They said the effect of the Shanghai drop was felt indirectly via its impact on New York.Many investors in Tokyo took a wait-and-see attitude on Wednesday, staying on the sidelines and watching for signs of whether the sell-off would continue in New York.“What comes next here really depends on New York, not Shanghai,” said Eiji Kinouchi, chief technical analyst at the research arm of Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. “If Shanghai had been the real cause of the sell-off, it would have happened yesterday, not today.”Tokyo and Hong Kong markets had barely seemed to blink on Tuesday as Shanghai fell. The Nikkei 225 index slipped a mere 0.5 percent that day and the Hang Seng fell 1.8 percent.Analysts pointed out that Tokyo and even Hong Kong have rarely taken their cues from Shanghai, a small and highly volatile market that often seems to sit on the fringes of global capital flows because of the government regulations that have limited foreign investments to less than 1 percent of the market capitalization.One factor behind the rebound today in mainland markets was a report in the Shanghai media that the government might increase the cap on foreign investment to 10 percent of the market. That report, together with signs the government would not move quickly to impose capital gains taxes, helped offset continuing nervousness about the Chinese central bank’s ongoing campaign to put the brakes on the economy by pushing banks to slow their rapid growth in lending.Elsewhere in Asia today, the Indian market fell 4 percent, Singapore dropped 3.7 percent, South Korea was down 2.8 percent, Australia dipped 2.7 percent and Thailand crept down by 1 percent. Most markets pared their losses in the afternoon following steeper declines in the morning.The worst performer for the day in Asia was the Philippines, the market with the earliest closing time. It fell nearly 8 percent without benefiting from the afternoon rebounds elsewhere. Foreign investors were the main sellers in the Philippines and many other markets.Luz Lorenzo, an economist in Manila at ATR Kim Eng Securities, said that were it not for purchases by domestic institutions in the Philippines on Wednesday “it could have been worse.”The broad extent of the decline in Asia underlined the region’s deepening connection to global financial markets and growing reliance on exports to the industrialized world.“Every morning, most traders will get a fix on how the Asian markets are trading and how did the Nasdaq close — I think people have gotten more globalized,” Sandeep Nanda, head of research at Sharekhan, a large retail brokerage firm in India, said.Some customers at brokerages in Asia admitted to being mystified by the sharp movements in share prices. “I am buying in the hope that the share price will rise — I really feel like a gambler sometimes,” said Moon Chung-lien, a 65-year-old retiree who wore a puzzled expression and knitted brow as he busily punched stock codes into a computer at the Hong Kong offices of the Shanghai Commerical Bank early this afternoon.Tim Condon, the head of financial markets research at ING Financial Markets in Singapore, said that the most significant feature of the worldwide drop in stock markets was that it was the first such global shock to financial markets that has emerged from China.“It’s a recognition of the fact that China is a big part of the rally in risky assets,“ Mr. Condon said.The sharp drop in durable goods orders in the United States prompted concerns that Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, may be forced to cut interest rates to reinvigorate economic growth. Lower interest rates would be likely to drive down the dollar versus the yen, hurting the profits of exporters, such as Toyota and Sony, by eroding the yen value of overseas profits.The prospect of lower American interest rates brought a sharp rise by the yen overnight in New York, where it climbed from about 120 yen per dollar to around 117.93 yen. In Tokyo trading, the yen yielded some of those gains, slipping to 118.32 yen.The possibility of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve also kindled concerns that American interest rates might eventually fall far enough to significantly close the gap with Japan’s rock-bottom rates. That gap is wide now. Japanese overnight lending rates are 0.5 percent compared to 5.25 percent in the United States.But if the gap shrinks, it could slow or halt the so-called yen carry trade, in which investors borrow hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Japanese money to invest in stock markets across Asia and around the world in search of higher returns.If this flow of money stops, or reverses, it could prompt larger sell-offs on Wall Street and drive the yen even higher, hurting Japanese exporters even more, analysts said.“Bernanke holds the trigger,” said Kiichi Fujita, a strategist in Tokyo for Nomura Securities. “If he cuts interest rates in America, the worry is that the yen carry trade will unwind.”Part of the financing for the abundant cash flowing through global markets has also come from what many economists say is a surplus of savings by China, including China’s more than $1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. China is now a leading source of global capital, with the money funneled back into global financial markets through Chinese investments in Treasury bonds and other securities. “So when people get anxious that China may turn that tap off, we get market reactions like yesterday,” Mr. Condon said.In Thailand and many other southeast Asian countries, a major concern is the prospect of further weakness in the dollar, combined with weak demand from the United States. Thai exports of cars, rice, sugar, and electronics have already become more expensive on the world market after a 17 percent rise by the baht against the dollar in 2006.There is less concern in Thailand about the stock market. The Thai market has been dragged down by the country’s long-running political crisis. It fell about 5 percent in 2006, even as Shanghai’s market rose 130 percent last year.Supavud Saicheua, the managing director of Phatra Securities, which conducts research for Merrill Lynch in Thailand, said that the Thai market was unlikely to fall much further. But he cautioned that it was hard to predict how long international stock markets would continue to be worried by broader concerns.“The problem,” Mr. Supavud said, “is that we don’t know how big of a worry this is going to be.”'"

"'07-02-28,'1','SAN DIEGO, Feb. 27 (AP) — The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego said Tuesday that it planned to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to put off going to trial in more than 140 lawsuits accusing priests of sexual abuse.In a letter posted on the diocese’s Web site, Bishop Robert H. Brom said the diocese made its decision because any damage awards in the earlier trials could deplete “diocesan and insurance resources” and leave nothing for other victims.Micheal Webb, a lawyer for the diocese, said officials planned to file for bankruptcy protection by midnight, just hours before the first abuse case was scheduled to go to trial. A Chapter 11 filing automatically halts court proceedings.San Diego would become the fifth diocese in the nation to file for bankruptcy protection.Diocese officials and lawyers for the plaintiffs failed to reach a settlement during two days of negotiations that ended Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court.The diocese called plaintiffs’ lawyers on Tuesday morning to make a “final and best” settlement offer, Mr. Webb said. He declined to specify how much the church had offered, but said it was higher than total settlements reached in other dioceses in the Unites States.“When they rejected it, we were left with no choice,” Mr. Webb said.Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the amount the church offered was insufficient because the diocese had more plaintiffs than other jurisdictions.'"

"'07-02-28,'1','Security administration officers are already allowed to join a union. But few do, as current federal law does not permit the union to bargain on their behalf to contest workplace assignments, file grievances or represent them in disciplinary matters. Backers of the measure say giving the T.S.A. workers broader rights does not create security problems.“There’s no good reason to deny these rights to these people,” Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, said Tuesday, as the Senate took up the matter.What collective bargaining rights Department of Homeland Security employees should have has been under dispute since shortly after the 2001 attacks.The disagreement so divided Congress in 2002 that for months it prevented passage of the bill to create the department. Republicans successfully used the delay, for which they blamed Democrats, to help defeat Senator Max Cleland, the incumbent Democrat of Georgia, that year, openly questioning his commitment to fight terrorism.Republicans ultimately prevailed, both with T.S.A., which initially was part of the Department of Transportation, and with Homeland Security, which has since taken over.But union leaders have been pushing ever since to reassert bargaining rights for department employees.Union leaders say airport screeners are frequently required to work unscheduled overtime, suffer high injury and illness rates — nearly 30 percent compared with 5 percent for all federal employees — and have an attrition rate 10 times as high as the federal average.“How safe is the public if officers who see security breaches that result from mismanagement cannot disclose that because they fear they could be fired?” said Mark D. Roth of the American Federation of Government Employees.Under the proposal, the security officers would not have the right to strike, and the union would not have the power to negotiate wages. But it would be authorized to bargain on their behalf to establish work rules to govern overtime and temporary transfers, and to protect them if they file a grievance.Union officials said that T.S.A., under the proposal, would still have the power, in emergencies, to change work assignments. But Kip Hawley, the security agency’s administrator, said such shifts were necessary not just in emergencies but when routine events like weather delays required work reassignments or overtime.“We require an infinitely flexible security regime that allows us to change what we do and where we do it,” Mr. Hawley said, adding that hiring staff members to handle union relations would cost $160 million.The debate over the collective bargaining rights is just one of several points of contention expected to surface as the Senate takes up its version of the Sept. 11 Commission bill. House Democrats passed their own version in January.House Democrats, who also included a provision granting collective bargaining rights to airport screeners, have language in their bill that would mandate inspection of all ship containers headed to the United States from overseas, a provision that the Bush administration and many Republicans oppose. A push by Democrats is expected in the coming week to add such language to the Senate bill.The Senate bill is also likely to include measures intended to increase rail and transit security. And there may be an effort, also opposed by the Bush administration, to delay a 2008 mandate that the states begin to issue a standardized, tamper-proof driver’s license.Officials in many states have said they will not be ready in time and that the federal government should cover the cost of issuing the new licenses.'"

Last season the Braves ended up fifth in the regular season, lost in the conference final, and beat Kansas and Pittsburgh in the N.C.A.A. tournament.Bradley Coach Jim Les noted that his Braves had the same R.P.I. as they did a year ago at this time and still got into the N.C.A.A. tournament as an at-large team.“We believe our league deserves multiple bids, potentially three or four, and we’d like to believe we’re in the hunt,” he said.Elgin and the coaches said the argument for the conference strength was at the bottom of the league, not the top. The seventh- through 10th-place teams entered the week with a total of 57 wins. Only the Southeastern Conference had more wins from its bottom four teams, with 61.An early-season surprise, Wichita State (17-13) slipped during conference play. The Shockers joined Bradley in last season’s Round of 16 after eliminating Seton Hall and Tennessee, and they were as high as No. 8 in the Associated Press top 25 this season. But losses to three of the four bottom teams left them sixth in the conference standings.The M.V.C.’s 79-32 nonconference record was highlighted by Missouri State’s win over Wisconsin in November.

"'07-02-28,'1','ATLANTA, Feb. 27 — After a new investigation of the notorious 1955 killing of Emmett Till, a grand jury in Leflore County, Miss., has declined to issue any new indictments, effectively ending any further prosecution of a crime that fueled the civil rights movement.Two men, now dead, admitted to the killing in 1956 after they were acquitted by an all-white jury in Sumner, Miss. But the Justice Department reopened the case in 2004 in search of others who had participated in the beating and shooting of Emmett, a black 14-year-old. By then, so much time had passed that the country store where the victim was said to have whistled at a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, was in ruins.The new inquiry was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which turned over a report of more than 8,000 pages to the district attorney, Joyce L. Chiles. Ms. Chiles sought a manslaughter charge against Ms. Bryant, 73, the last known living suspect in the case, but the grand jury decided last week not to issue an indictment, a court clerk said. The action was reported Tuesday in The Jackson Clarion-Ledger.“If Carolyn Bryant is truly not guilty in being involved in the killing of Emmett Till or there is insufficient evidence to indict her, then the grand jury did the right thing,” said Alvin Sykes, the president of the Emmett Till Justice Campaign.The grand jury’s decision illustrates the difficulty of prosecuting such old cases, even as the Justice Department has begun its first systematic effort to identify them. At a news conference on Tuesday in Washington, Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales and Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the F.B.I., said about a dozen such cases had been selected, from a list of about 100, for immediate action.“New information, sometimes an innocuous small bit of information, can be crucial to breaking these decades-old cases,” Mr. Gonzales said. “A secret harbored for many years can be the piece of evidence we need to make our case.”'"
"'07-02-28,'1','WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 (AP) — The F.B.I. has reopened investigations of about 12 suspicious deaths from the civil rights era, officials said Tuesday.The cases are among an estimated 100 being reviewed. Attorney General Alberto R.

But we are committed to re-examining these cases and doing all we can to bring justice to the criminals who may have avoided punishment for so long.”Addressing violators, Mr. Gonzales said: “You have not gotten away with anything. We are still on your trail.”Officials would not release details about the cases but said nearly all were in 14 Southern states. Investigators confirmed, for example, that the unsolved lynching of four sharecroppers in 1946 on Moore’s Ford Bridge near Monroe, Ga., was among the cases.The officials would not say whether another big case was included. It involved Maceo Snipes, a black World War II veteran shot in the back in 1946 by four white men a day after he voted for the first time.'"
"'07-02-28,'1','Martin Bandier, the chairman and co-chief executive of EMI Group’s EMI Music Publishing unit, will take the reins of the music-publishing unit at the rival Sony Corporation after his EMI contract expires at the end of next month.As part of the arrangement, which was announced yesterday, Mr. Bandier is making an unspecified investment in the Sony unit, known as Sony/ATV Music Publishing, where he will become chairman and chief executive. His compensation will be linked to increasing the value of the unit, which controls more than 400,000 copyrights, including songs by Joni Mitchell, Brooks & Dunn and the Beatles. The unit is a venture with the pop star Michael Jackson.Mr. Bandier’s future in the music business has been the subject of much speculation since he announced in October that he would resign from EMI, which he had helped transform into the industry’s biggest music publisher, with control of an estimated one million copyrights.Mr. Bandier held talks with one rival, the Warner Music Group, about taking charge of its publishing division, Warner-Chappell, and also consulted with private investors about various possible ventures.But Mr. Bandier said he was not interested in starting his own company. “I’m not about starting from scratch again,” he said yesterday. “I’m used to playing on a big stage.”Mr. Bandier was recruited to the Sony job primarily by Robert S. Wiesenthal, the company’s chief financial officer, who has directly overseen Sony/ATV since 2004, when the Japanese electronics giant split off its recorded music division and folded it into a venture with Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate.Since then, Mr. Wiesenthal has moved to consolidate Sony’s control of the unit, in part by working out a complex arrangement that provides the company with an option to buy half of Mr. Jackson’s stake.'"
"'07-02-28,'1','Brokers say this conversion trend is striking because the demand is exceptionally strong now for both office and retail space.When an earlier wave of conversions from office space to retailing took place in the early 1990s, the office market was very weak, said Gene Spiegelman, an executive director of retail services at Cushman & Wakefield. “Then, in the late ’90s, the office market tightened up and the landlords really didn’t need the retailers anymore on the second or third floors,” he said.But with the overall vacancy rate in the city’s office market only 6 percent at the end of January, the lowest since the first quarter of 2001, according to Cushman & Wakefield, it would be hard to argue that office landlords need retail tenants now. Still, there is an incentive to transform office space into stores since retailers are willing to pay much higher rents.For example, Mr. Hirsch said, Boymelgreen is asking $70 to $75 a square foot for retail space on the second and third floors of 15 Broad Street; the same space would fetch $40 to $45 a square foot if rented to office tenants. The landlord is asking $300 a square foot at the street level.Mr. Spiegelman said many large store owners were now willing to rent multilevel retail space in Manhattan so that they could blend the extreme rents at street level with much cheaper rents above and below ground level.But this assumes that shoppers are entering a multilevel store from the sidewalk. In some cases, the entrance to the store itself will be on the second floor, with no ground-floor space.Faith Hope Consolo, chairwoman of the retail division at Prudential Douglas Elliman, represented two tenants that leased former office space on the second floor of buildings on or near Madison Avenue last year. Erika Bloom, a Pilates instructor, opened a studio at 795 Madison Avenue, between 65th and 66th Streets. And Berman Galleries, an antiques dealer based in Philadelphia, rented space at 33 East 65th Street, where it plans to open a gallery this spring.In both cases, Ms. Consolo said, the landlords are earning two to three times the $50 a square foot they might have gotten from office tenants. “It’s the richest ZIP code in the city,” Ms. Consolo said, and both tenants believed it was more important to be there than at the street level in another neighborhood.Some real estate professionals think bargain-conscious shoppers are willing to go as far as the fourth or fifth floor. C. Brad Mendelson, an executive director in Cushman & Wakefield’s retail division, points to 2 Herald Square, which has a shopping mall featuring H & M and Victoria’s Secret on the first three floors and offices above.Sitt Asset Management of Manhattan has agreed to buy the property for $500 million. The sale is expected to close in March, and Sitt is already consulting with Mr. Mendelson about transforming 50,000 square feet on the fourth and fifth floors into retail space. Several small offices rent space there now, but their leases expire at the end of this year.Mr. Mendelson estimates that Sitt could get more than double the $35 a square foot that it might charge for the space as offices. But first, he said, the new owner would need to create a separate entrance, with elevators that go directly to the fourth and fifth floors.Bruce Nelligan of Nelligan White, the New York architect who is converting the retail space in the old J. P. Morgan building, said his biggest challenge would be making sure that shoppers did not lose their way. He said it was easy to get lost wandering through the cavernous space, which includes vacant executive offices, conference rooms, four auditoriums and a bridge connecting the two buildings. “People do not like to go places where they become disoriented,” he said.But the market for retail space is stretched thin in certain areas of Manhattan — Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue and Herald Square, for example. Many retailers may have to count on New Yorkers and tourists alike finding them in out-of-the-way places.'"
"'07-02-28,'1','I see mandatory requirements for this vaccine as a sign that our society perceives good parenting to be failing. David Alter, M.D.I agree with your editorial position that this is a valuable vaccine that should be widely available and should be mandated. But the cost of this vaccine can be a deterrent not only to the patient but also to the pediatrician or family practitioner who wishes to stock it.Because it costs so much, and because three doses are necessary, the outlay of funds to buy it for the office is very large. Since most insurers pay the doctor only $5 to $10 above the vaccine cost, there is no way to break even.If we had a national health care system, these issues would virtually disappear. Barbara Gold, M.D.If the goal is to sharply reduce the risk of cervical cancer, the vaccine should be promoted for boys, too, since boys and men transmit the virus. This would make epidemiological sense. So would promoting male circumcision.In a rational world, the government would also negotiate a reduced price with the manufacturer, and licensing of the production to other manufacturers, as a condition for public support for the vaccination.To mandate that young girls or anyone be guinea pigs for a drug with no long-term safety evidence is reckless and against the freedom on which this country was founded.The controversy surrounding the vaccine Gardasil obviously reflects many things. But too little mentioned is the general erosion of trust in the pharmaceutical industry, and particularly in new products heavily promoted and lobbied for.Uncertain confidence in Gardasil — which may well be an excellent vaccine — may also be the first and most obvious casualty of what the industry’s trespasses have done to itself and, by extension, to all of us.The writer is a faculty scholar in integrative medicine, University of Michigan Medical Center.'"

It’s just too ... male.“It’s not very nourishing emotionally,” said Ann Cooper, author of “ ‘A Woman’s Place Is in the Kitchen,’ ” a history of female chefs in America. “This is a huge generalization, but women’s cooking has always been based on nurturing. Tall food was a male invention; women weren’t doing much of it. Basically, women feed people.”Yet the few women who do work in the new culinary laboratories tell a different story. They don’t feel like interlopers or male impersonators. They’re simply becoming chefs — and they’re doing it in an entirely different way from the women who preceded them.Traditionally, the only way for an ambitious woman to get experience in the world of professional cooking was to plunge into the chaos of a typical testosterone-driven restaurant kitchen. That’s if she was lucky enough to get in the door in the first place. (California has long been an exception: female-friendly kitchens have been standard there ever since Alice Waters opened Chez Panisse in 1971.) But when it comes to the new cuisine, the old rules don’t seem to apply.Pamela Yung, for instance, didn’t have to steel herself to face a hostile French kitchen, nor did she train in California. She didn’t train anywhere. After majoring in computer science and design at the University of Michigan, she was working in a Detroit design firm when she saw a notice on eGullet, the food-maven Web site. Mr. Goldfarb was about to open Room 4 Dessert and needed a stagiaire, or trainee, who would work long hours for low pay. “On a whim, I e-mailed him,” said Ms. Yung, 24.She started work the day the before the restaurant opened. “I was completely overwhelmed,” she said. “I just did whatever I was told.” But she wasn’t intimidated by the machinery, and today she’s a believer, perfectly comfortable turning out white beer sorbets, Earl Grey tea panna cottas and apricot flake salt.“The machines just give you more options,” she said. “They’re not traditional cooking utensils, but they’re cooking utensils, and they’re going to become the norm.”Her best friend in the food world is Rosio Sanchez, also 24, who studied pastry in the Cordon Bleu program in Chicago and worked briefly at Park Avenue Cafe before being hired by Alex Stupak, the pastry chef at WD-50 on the Lower East Side. “I was very nervous,” Ms. Sanchez said. “So many chemicals — gums, methylcellulose, maltodextrin.”But she credited Mr. Stupak and Wylie Dufresne, the founder of WD-50, with running a nonhierarchical kitchen where beginners, including women, can thrive. “It’s a great place to get trained,” she said. “We’ve got total access to all the ingredients, and anyone with free time will grab stuff and try things. If you mess up, nobody yells at you, because we’re all trying to learn.”Then there’s Danielle Soranno, 23, a station chef at Alinea who had a few years of professional cooking when she started there four months ago. Although she is the only woman among 30 cooks, she said she has nothing but admiration for how the place runs. “This is the smoothest, cleanest, best-organized kitchen I’ve ever seen,” she said.What’s more, women working in the new mode say they don’t feel they are missing out on the elemental satisfactions of traditional cooking. Elena Arzak, the much-praised Spanish chef at her family’s century-old Restaurante Arzak in San Sebastian, was profoundly influenced by El Bulli and is developing her own take on Mr. Adrià’s innovations. But she insisted that a chemistry-based cuisine can be as warm and personal as any other. “The science just helps me cook,” she said.Ms. Soranno pointed out that the cooks at Alinea have to know all the classics — stocks, reductions, even cakes — as well as be able to experiment. (She admitted that she likes to make soup and bake bread on her days off.) Ms. Yung is just happy to be in the business of feeding people. “It’s so natural and fundamental,” she said. “That’s why I wanted to cook. So I’m giving someone foam, instead of a piece of cake. What’s the difference?”The women who work in these new-style kitchens say ideas and open-mindedness are the currency, not vitriol and bravado, and that the heavy lifting is not physical but intellectual. David Arnold, director of culinary technology at the French Culinary Institute in New York, said that women are just as intrigued as men when he gives demonstrations of the new ingredients and techniques. “I don’t think this mode of cooking is skewed by gender,” he said.Maybe all the machines and chemicals are contributing to a revolution other than the one about frozen air and warm gelatin. “Restaurant kitchens were organized like military brigades, because that was the only way to turn out such a volume of work and make all the fast decisions that were necessary,” said Mr. Goldfarb of Room 4 Dessert. “Now it’s more like the modern military, using technology as opposed to brute strength.”But many women dreaming of a restaurant career still may not see the appeal of a laboratory kitchen. Ms. Yung and Ms. Sanchez have been struck by how few women are in high-end restaurant kitchens of any sort. “We’re always wondering where the girls are,” Ms. Yung said.Maybe settling on an official name for the movement would help. The chief contenders — “space age,” “hypermodern” or “extreme” cuisine — come straight from boys’ comic books. But in America, at least, the movement has a history its partisans never talk about — a history that happens to be packed with women.It was the home economists of the late 19th century who first had the idea of transforming the old-fashioned kitchen into a sleek, modern chemistry lab, so that cooking would no longer be seen as traditional women’s drudgery but would rise to the status of a science worthy of the finest male mind. Why not acknowledge these roots and call it “Celebrity Home Ec”?If women do start showing up in the new technocooking in significant numbers, Gabrielle Hamilton, who provides unpretentious but flavor-packed food at her restaurant, Prune, in the East Village, will be watching with interest.“Historically, when women move into men’s work it loses value,” she said. “Maybe we’ll see the pay drop, and the science suddenly getting called ‘soft.’ I’ll say this: If you see me doing foams at Prune, you’ll know the whole thing has gone down the tube.”'"
"'07-02-28,'1','It also produces vehicles in Ontario, where a new factory in Woodstock also is under construction. This year, it will begin building Camry sedans at an Indiana plant owned by Subaru.These plants generate hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and create hundreds of jobs at suppliers and support businesses.“Toyota is the world’s premier auto manufacturer, and our state will be the best partner the company has,” said Mississippi’s governor, Haley Barbour, who announced the plant during an event at Tupelo High School.The announcement comes as Toyota is on the verge of becoming the world’s biggest auto company, displacing General Motors, an event that could happen as soon as this year.In 2006, Toyota unseated DaimlerChrysler to become the third-biggest automaker in the United States. This year, it could move up to second biggest in American sales, displacing Ford Motor.Over the last 18 months, G.M., Ford and the Chrysler Group have each announced plans to close factories and eliminate jobs. Collectively, more than 86,000 blue- and white-collar jobs at the Detroit companies will disappear as the three companies restructure.In 2006, Toyota built more than 1.55 million vehicles and 1.4 million engines at its 14 plants in North America.In January, G.M.’s vice chairman, Robert A. Lutz, said Toyota had more influence in Washington than G.M. because of the number of states where it had plants.Mississippi was not on the original list of states considered by Toyota, which had said the factory would probably be in the South. Initially, the company considered sites in Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas and North Carolina.But when it became known that Toyota was considering another factory, more states entered the running, including Mississippi, where three counties banded together to promote the Blue Springs site.The Toyota plant would be the second big auto factory in Mississippi and would be an economic boost after the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The Nissan Motor Company opened an assembly plant in Canton, outside Jackson, in 2003.Toyota also had considered expanding its plant in San Antonio, which builds a new version of its Tundra pickup. Its 2,000-acre plant site there is believed to be among the biggest in the world, and it is common for Toyota to expand factories after it begins production.Toyota executives see the newest Tundra, which competes with Detroit’s big pickups, as the most important vehicle the company has ever introduced in the United States.'"
"'07-02-28,'1','For months now, the economy seemed to shrug off the forces weighing on it and just kept on growing. But those forces never went away. If anything, a number of them have gotten stronger. And that’s the most worrisome part of the bad news from the nation’s factories: it fits into a larger story.As stocks were dropping yesterday morning, an economist named Ian Shepherdson wrote one of his regular e-mail messages to clients: “Manuf is in recession; Fed please take note.” Mr. Shepherdson, it’s important to mention, is not one of Wall Street’s perma-bears. When manufacturing last shrank, back in 2003, he correctly insisted that it was a false harbinger.But this time, the manufacturing downturn stems from a couple of larger economic problems. One, of course, is the housing slump, which has caused a big drop in new construction and much less demand for doors, windows, countertops and a lot of other things that kept factories busy in recent years.In recent weeks, the troubles in housing have spilled into the financial sector. Big lenders like NovaStar Financial are paying the price for extending credit to people who couldn’t actually afford the homes they bought during the real estate boom. With many of those homeowners falling behind on their mortgage payments, lenders are making it tougher to get loans.That’s a sensible, and overdue, move. But it will hurt economic growth in the months ahead. The second big problem for manufacturers is the series of interest rate increases that the Federal Reserve has imposed since 2004.They may seem like old news, because the last of them came eight months ago, but it typically takes a year to a year and a half for a rate increase to have its full impact. A lot of the big decisions affected by interest rates, like whether to buy a new car or a new piece of factory equipment, aren’t everyday decisions. Only now are some families and businesses starting to react to the higher rates.The economic news certainly isn’t all bad. The housing problems still haven’t turned into a crisis, thanks in part to interest rates that are still not high by historical standards. So the most likely situation is not a full-blown recession (often defined as two consecutive quarters of a shrinking economy).The forecasters at the Economic Cycle Research Institute in New York, who have accurately predicted each of the last three recessions, argue that the current slowdown won’t amount to much more than a lull. By the middle of the year, they say, low interest rates and healthy corporate spending will have the economy growing nicely once again.Lakshman Achuthan, the institute’s managing director, told me yesterday that he thought the odds of a recession over the next year were less than 20 percent. Mr. Shepherdson — the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, who’s more bearish than most forecasters right now — still puts the odds at only 30 percent.But for all the attention that formal recessions get on Wall Street, they are not really the benchmark that matters to most people. A significant slowdown that falls short of a recession can do a lot of damage to stock prices, profits and wages.Only in the last few months, for example, has the current expansion grown strong enough to give most American workers pay increases that outpace inflation. Those raises would be endangered if the economy were to slow from last year’s growth rate of 3.4 percent to even 2 percent.“This is going to get worse before it gets better,” Mr. Shepherdson argues. “We’re in danger of slipping into something very like a recession, if not necessarily hitting the technical definition. It would be big enough to hurt, that’s for sure.”The main message of yesterday’s worldwide stock sell-off — as well as the stealth manufacturing downturn — is that the economy is facing bigger risks than we imagined just a few weeks ago.In mid-February, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, told members of Congress that he was worried about inflation taking off. The clear implication was that the Fed’s next move might be to raise rates yet again to keep the economy from overheating.Until yesterday, that seemed plausible. It doesn’t this morning. Like stocks, the price of a futures contract tied to Fed policy shifted sharply yesterday.Before the day began, investors expected the Fed to hold its benchmark rate steady through the end of the summer. Now they are betting that the rate will be cut once before July and again by the end of the year. If that’s all that is necessary to keep the economy healthy, it will be a relief.'"
