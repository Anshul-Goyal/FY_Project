"'08-09-01,'0','On Election Day 2004, exit polls showed there were as many voters claiming allegiance to the Republican Party as there were self-identified Democrats. Nearly four years later, surveys show Democrats with an edge of nearly 10 percentage points in party self-identification.To win under those circumstances, McCain strategists calculate that he must draw roughly 55 percent of independents and 15 percent of Democrats, besting the 48 percent and 11 percent that Mr. Bush drew four years ago. If Mr. Obama’s mobilization drive succeeds in enlarging the Democratic electorate, Mr. McCain’s hill would grow even steeper.One high-risk response for Mr. McCain would have been to select Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, above, as his running mate. As a former congressman, governor and Homeland Security secretary, Mr. Ridge would have met anyone’s definition of readiness to step in as president. He could have improved Mr. McCain’s odds of snatching Pennsylvania’s 21 electoral votes, disrupting Mr. Obama’s electoral math.Because he favors abortion rights, Mr. Ridge also could have enhanced the party’s appeal to affluent suburbanites with moderate social views. But for the same reason, choosing him would have risked eroding the support of the religious right, as well as the ticket’s appeal to culturally conservative blue-collar swing voters.Ms. Palin presented a different set of calculations. As a young, charismatic politician with a reformer’s image, she could add spark and the stamp of history to the campaign of Mr. McCain, 72, who trails Mr. Obama by more than 10 percentage points among women. As a social conservative who is staunchly anti-abortion, she could energize the party’s base.But Ms. Palin brought one huge risk: that voters would judge her two years in statewide elected office inadequate to meet the presidential readiness test that every nominee invokes as a paramount consideration. And that could undercut Mr. McCain’s argument that Mr. Obama is not “ready to lead.”Both choices offered the opportunity to reinforce Mr. McCain’s image as a free-wheeling maverick. But in the calculus of contemporary Republican politics, the dangers associated with Mr. Ridge appeared greater.Mr. Obama faced a similar cost-benefit calculation in his running mate deliberations. He has campaigned as a post-partisan leader eager to bridge the nation’s deepest differences, and to underscore that credential some Democrats urged him to choose Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, below.Mr. Hagel’s sharp criticism of the Iraq war lent plausibility to the idea. But Mr. Hagel’s solid anti-abortion voting record drew strong opposition from the party’s liberal base; he didn’t make Mr. Obama’s short list.The values divide on the issue has proved inviolable since 1980. Seven years after Roe v. Wade, the Republican Party platform backed an anti-abortion constitutional amendment, and the elder George Bush, placed on the ticket by Ronald Reagan, reversed his previous support for abortion rights.Since then, Republicans have not nominated a candidate who favors abortion rights; Democrats have not nominated one who opposes them.The 2004 exit polls show why: Three-fourths of those who said abortion should be legal voted for John Kerry, while three-fourths of those who said abortion should be outlawed voted for President Bush. Neither 2008 candidate was willing to challenge that pattern.'"

"'08-09-01,'0','Gustav inevitably meant a re-examination of the event which arguably marked the beginning of the huge political decline that has afflicted Mr. Bush and the : . Mr. McCain eventually came to criticize Mr. Bush for the administration’s tepid response to the storm, and the federal government’s continuing problems to help rebuild the city. But the last thing Mr. McCain’s advisers wanted this week was a reciting of how Mr. Bush served Mr. McCain birthday cake on the day Katrina begin whipping New Orleans three years ago.What is more, conventions are directed not only at the television-watching audience. They also provide an opportunity  with speeches and parties and all kinds of hoopla — way of whipping up the morale of delegates. Even after Mr. McCain’s selection of Gov. of as his vice president, which was well received by many conservatives, this is a party that still needs a boost.But there’s a positive side to the equation -- and Mr. McCain and his advisers have worked aggressively to make the most of it. The easiest way to appreciate that is to take a stroll on the convention floor here, where worker crews are still setting up lights, and gaze around the arena, which is plastered with two words mentioned over and over: “Country First.”Those words are the central theme of the convention, and Mr. McCain and his advisers did not waste a minute in suggesting that his decision to scale back the festivities was evidence of the fact that Mr. McCain, given the choice between doing what is best for him and doing what is best for his country, did what was best for the country. (Even before the storm was on the radar screen, Mr. McCain’s advisers were planning to set that up as one of the big McCain-Obama contrasts.)Even as convention organizers spent he weekend debating what to do as the storm’s approached, Mr. McCain went on television to announce that he was thinking of suspending the convention. He then flew to Mississippi for a tour of storm preparations and a news conference. And his aides suggested that he might dispense with coming here at all  remember Country First?  and address the gathering through a video link-up.In short, he managed to control the day  and in the process, pushed the memory of Mr. Obama’s convention just a little more into the distance.Coming in here, Mr. McCain was understandably concerned that his acceptance speech in the arena here on Thursday would be compared against the one Mr. Obama delivered last week in . Whatever Mr. McCain’s strengths as a candidate, delivering compelling speeches to big audiences is not one of them. The storm might have done Mr. McCain a favor: Not only does it take a little pressure off of him, it gives him a chance to talk about something that has always been a weak suit: Domestic issues. And it provides him an opportunity to accomplish what is one his toughest tasks here: To distance himself from President Bush at a convention where Mr. Bush continues to be popular.Finally, as has been frequently remarked, the storm accomplished something that Mr. McCain’s advisers could not: Disinvite President Bush and Vice President from speaking, at least on Monday night. Mr. McCain’s advisers had done what they would to lesson the impact of those speeches  they were slated to speak on night, Mr. Cheney was to have spoken well before prime time, and Mr. McCain made sure he was nowhere near St. Paul when Mr. Bush took the stage  but they had long been resigned to the fact that they were handing the Democrats a gift.'"

"'08-09-01,'0','Senator John McCain’s rival, Senator Barack Obama, once was a lonely voice demanding the withdrawal of all combat forces by mid-2010.But now, Iraq’s leaders are pushing a timetable that would have American troops out in 2011.Even President Bush — who had long scorned the notion of a withdrawal deadline as defeatist — looks set to go along. Iraq’s leaders are demanding that Mr. Bush accept that deadline in exchange for legalizing the continued American military presence in the country.That leaves Mr. McCain as the stubborn man out.While the war is no longer front-page news, thousands of Americans are still fighting and dying there. The war is costing American taxpayers $10 billion a month — that is $10 billion that cannot be spent on health care, education and many other urgent priorities.Mr. McCain told veterans on Aug. 11 that he would end the war, but intended to “win it first” and assured them that “victory in Iraq is finally in sight.”He needs to explain what he means by victory. A free and democratic Iraq, as Mr. Bush originally promised? That would take generations. Even after spending nearly $700 billion, the United States will be lucky to leave behind a marginally functioning central government in a very fragile country.Iraq’s leaders have at least agreed on one thing: they want the Americans gone, sooner rather than later. But they are still squabbling over the political reforms that might bolster stability — squabbling that Mr. Bush enabled by insisting that America’s patience was unlimited. Mr. McCain seems eager to repeat that mistake.'"
"'08-09-01,'0','Later this week the Republican National Convention will formally send John McCain to go forth and do battle for the White House with Barack Obama. One cannot envy Mr. McCain, burdened as he is with the toxic legacies of the Bush administration — including a fragile economy, a battered middle class, an increasingly unequal society and a grinding, unnecessary war that has exacted a huge toll in lives, money, civil liberties and America’s reputation abroad.Mr. McCain’s task is to persuade the American people that electing him will not merely mean more of President Bush’s ideology and incompetence. This is a huge challenge, and his performance at this convention could give us some sense of whether he can rise to it.Mr. McCain’s week is complicated by Hurricane Gustav, which prompted President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to cancel plans to appear in St. Paul on Monday. That will relieve Mr. McCain of having to pay homage to the very man whose shadow he is desperately trying to escape — and the president did the right thing in response to a looming disaster, this time.But Gustav’s arrival will remind Americans of one of the most shameful chapters of the Bush presidency — its unforgivably uncaring response to Hurricane Katrina, which came to symbolize the incompetence, cronyism and ideological blindness of the Bush administration. These many years later, Mr. Bush has made no effort to keep the promises he made about addressing the deep-rooted poverty and racism laid bare by Katrina.For Mr. McCain, presuming his convention proceeds as planned, it will do no good to simply throw ideological red meat to the delegates. According to a New York Times/CBS News poll, they sit well to the right of the country and even Republicans as a whole. These delegates have nowhere else to go.'"
"'08-09-01,'0','LOS ANGELES (AP) — The executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union has stepped aside while accusations that she paid thousands of dollars in union money to a former boyfriend are being investigated, The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.The vice president, Annelle Grajeda, is the third major official of the union to be placed on leave in recent months amid accusations of misspending union money.Ms. Grajeda was also president of the union’s state council for California and president of the Los Angeles local, which represents 77,000 county workers.She is on leave from all three positions, the union said.On Saturday, The Times quoted Ms. Grajeda as saying she was “very confident” that she would be exonerated.The union said it had demanded that her former companion, Alejandro Stephens, a former Los Angeles chapter president, return money he had received from the local and the state council.Those entities paid him nearly $89,000 in consulting fees and “disbursements for official business” last year, according to the union’s financial filings with the federal Department of Labor.Two other union leaders were placed on leave recently amid accusations that the group’s largest local, United Long-Term Care Workers, misspent $1 million of members’ dues.'"
"'08-09-01,'0','Gustav was headed directly toward about 3,000 oil and gas platforms, although it appears that its eye is veering away from several important refineries along the Texas coast. The hurricane represents the first test for oil company executives who have said their platforms are far more storm-resistant than they were three years ago.More anchor lines have been installed on rigs and platforms, and equipment has been raised higher out of the water. Many older platforms that were paralyzed by the 2005 storms remain out of commission, while new stronger platforms have been constructed.Some companies took several months to restore their operations after the 2005 hurricanes, in part because their electrical and diesel generators, communications and other logistical systems were damaged and because key personnel were preoccupied with having lost their homes in the storms. But the companies say that this time logistical systems have been improved along with support for staff members whose families may be affected by the hurricane.“The production bounce-back time is going to be much faster than last time,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, an oil expert at Rice University.So far, gasoline prices across the nation have risen only modestly the last few days, even though about 96 percent of Gulf oil production and 82 percent of natural gas production had been shut down by midday Sunday, according to the federal Minerals Management Service. AAA reported on Sunday that the average price for unleaded regular gasoline was $3.69, about half a cent higher than on Saturday and still 20 cents below a month ago.Ms. Jaffe said oil prices were relatively stable because the Bush administration said last week it was willing to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to avert a disruption in supplies. Although gasoline use rose over the weekend to fuel the evacuation of southern Louisiana, she added that traders were still convinced that demand for oil products over all was falling.Over the first six months of the year, oil consumption was down by 130,000 barrels a day, or 1.5 percent, because of slower economic activity and because people were beginning to drive less and drive smaller cars in response to higher gasoline prices.Electronic trading in energy futures normally begins at 6 p.m. on Sundays to coincide with the opening of Asian markets, but because of the approaching hurricane, electronic trading began at 2:30 p.m. Sunday to allow traders to ease their risks.“We wanted to provide our customers with the opportunity to respond to the storm’s potential impact to energy markets as quickly as possible,” Bryan Durkin, chief operating officer for the CME Group, said in a statement. The CME Group runs the New York exchange.With the eye of the hurricane seeming to be headed for the Louisiana coast, ConocoPhillips prepared to shut down all operations at its Lake Charles and Belle Chasse, La., refineries by Monday morning. Exxon Mobil said it would shut down its refinery at Chalmette, La., which it operates jointly with Citgo, a unit of the Venezuelan national oil company. Valero said it was suspending production of its Norco, La., refinery, and slowing production at two Texas refineries.BP, Royal Dutch Shell and other major producers announced a halt to offshore operations.All told, about a dozen refineries have either shut down or reduced output, representing about 10 percent of refinery production in the United States.Though electronic trading was moved up to an earlier start on Sunday, floor trading remained closed.Esa Ramasamy, editorial director for oil market reporting at Platts, a provider of energy and commodities information, welcomed the exchange’s decision to start early. On Friday, many traders were still unsure whether the storm would intensify or dissipate, and by Sunday they were more sure that the storm would hit the refineries along the Gulf Coast.“Anything to serve the market is always a good idea,” he said. “This allows players to hedge their positions. It only helps to stabilize the market.”'"
"'08-09-01,'0','As unintended consequences go, Hurricane Gustav does present some political opportunities for Mr. McCain. He looked like a man in charge on television Sunday as he described meeting with Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi and federal disaster officials. The tumult may also limit comparisons, which may have been unfavorable, between the Republican convention this week and the Democratic convention in Denver last week, where Mr. Obama’s acceptance speech drew more than 40 million television viewers.Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney announced that they would not attend the convention as planned on Monday; both men, while popular with the Republican base, are far less helpful to Mr. McCain among swing voters.Among the downsides, however, was probably a missed opportunity for Republicans who were planning four days of high-profile attacks on Mr. Obama. It appears from Mr. McCain’s pledge to turn the convention from “a party event to a call to the nation for action” that such broadsides against Mr. Obama will be lost.In St. Paul, the McCain campaign chartered a plane to fly a dozen members of the Louisiana delegation home and created a Gulf states briefing committee, made up of top Republican officials from the region. Party organizers, meanwhile, considered whether to tamp down on the celebrations, although events for major donors and delegate parties were going ahead Sunday night. Democrats who gathered here to counter the Republican message canceled a gathering with reporters on Sunday and said they would determine each day how to calibrate the tone of their activities.Rick Davis, the McCain-Palin campaign manager, said at a news conference here that Monday’s convention session would be scaled back to open at 3 p.m. Central time and probably end by 5:30 p.m. It will be limited to official business like adopting the platform and electing convention officers.At least one night of speakers and guaranteed news coverage will be lost, something Mr. Davis alluded to only obliquely, saying the campaign had obviously hoped it could have “a more traditional” convention.“Events have conspired to do otherwise,” said Mr. Davis, adding later when pressed that “we really don’t have the luxury of trying to evaluate the politics of this kind of situation.”As Mr. McCain traveled to Mississippi on Sunday, Mr. Obama decided to monitor the approach of Hurricane Gustav from afar. Mr. Obama was briefed on the evacuation in a telephone call with Michael Chertoff, the secretary of Homeland Security, on Sunday afternoon, as well as conversations with the Louisiana governor, the New Orleans mayor and other officials.Mr. Obama told reporters that he might visit the Gulf Coast after “things have settled down.” He and his advisers discussed making a weekend trip to the region, but they concluded that visiting the area before the storm would complicate the efforts of the authorities there.When Mr. Obama asked how he could help, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana told Mr. Obama that he could help amplify the message of the mandatory evacuation, particularly among the black residents of New Orleans. So on Sunday morning, Mr. Obama conducted telephone interviews with four New Orleans television stations and one radio station, lending his voice to those who were warning residents to heed the evacuation order.After Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Obama introduced legislation in the Senate requiring officials take specific steps to evacuate the elderly and the disadvantaged. In his call with Mr. Chertoff on Sunday, aides said, Mr. Obama asked if the new evacuation plan was being followed.Mr. Obama said his campaign would mobilize its e-mail list of supporters, to volunteer or send contributions, as soon as the impact of Hurricane Gustav became known.“We can activate an e-mail list of a couple million people who want to give back,” Mr. Obama told reporters after services at St. Luke’s Lutheran Church in Lima, Ohio. “I think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary.”Asked if he believed it was appropriate for Mr. McCain to travel to the Gulf Coast, Mr. Obama said: “A big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns, and I think for John to want to find out what’s going on is fine.”Mr. McCain also urged Americans to donate their time and money as needed. He made the decision to halt some convention activities during a conference call Sunday morning that included Mr. Davis and senior advisers Steve Schmidt and Nicolle Wallace, among others.The potential for disaster along the Gulf Coast has overshadowed not only the Republicans this weekend: It has diverted news media attention from both the Democrats’ glow over their convention in Denver last week and their criticism and questioning of Ms. Palin, whom Mr. McCain introduced as his running mate on Friday.The major television networks are pulling some of their top talent out of Minnesota, promising to diminish, if not upend, coverage of the convention. Katie Couric will head to the Gulf Coast to open the “CBS Evening News” from there Monday night, instead of from the convention hall as planned. Charles Gibson of ABC News and Brian Williams of NBC are expected to do the same.As of now, the networks still expected to devote one hour a night to the convention, from 10 to 11, and the cable news channels will almost certainly juggle both stories.Still, the networks’ decision is a potential blow to Mr. McCain, whose campaign was hoping to use the Republican convention to give him a burst of positive coverage going into the final stretch of the campaign. And it has cut into the Obama campaign’s plans to portray Ms. Palin as inadequate to the job of the vice presidency.Ms. Palin, midway through her second year as governor, was by and large a surprise choice. Mr. McCain barely knew her before Friday, and she was not widely discussed as a likely vice presidential nominee. Democrats have been framing Ms. Palin as a purely political selection, based on her potential appeal to women who favored Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York over Mr. Obama during the primaries this year. That message has largely been overshadowed by Hurricane Gustav’s approach.Still, on ABC on Sunday, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the 2004 Democratic nominee for president, said the selection of Ms. Palin reflected poor decision-making on Mr. McCain’s part.“I think John McCain’s judgment is once again put at issue, because he’s chosen somebody who clearly does not meet the national security threshold, who is not ready to be president tomorrow,” Mr. Kerry said.Also appearing on the ABC News program “This Week” on Sunday, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina echoed other Republicans on the Sunday talk shows in praising Ms. Palin as a bold choice and as a reformer. He said he believed that Ms. Palin was ready to be commander in chief today.“Oh, I think so, I think so,” Mr. Graham said. “Compared to Barack Obama, absolutely.”'"
"'08-09-01,'0','ST. PAUL — Advisers to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said on Sunday that Senator John McCain’s selection of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate would lead to a greater role for Mrs. Clinton as she campaigned this fall on behalf of her former rival, Senator Barack Obama.Mrs. Clinton’s friends said she was galled that Ms. Palin might try to capitalize on a movement that Mrs. Clinton, of New York, built among women in the primaries. And Democrats used strong words on Sunday to rebut the notion: Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said that women would not be “seduced” by the Republican ticket, and Guy Cecil, the former political director of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, said it was “insulting” for Republicans to compare Ms. Palin to Mrs. Clinton.Nevertheless, Clinton advisers said they expected that a bloc of her female supporters would give Mr. McCain a second look because of Ms. Palin, and that Mrs. Clinton was probably Mr. Obama’s best weapon in response. But asked if the Palin pick would lead to a new political marriage between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, a senior Clinton adviser, Ann Lewis, said: “Not a political marriage. She is not on the ticket. Senator Obama chose Joe Biden as his running mate. Hillary will do what she can to help.”Mrs. Clinton’s advisers said they expected that in light of the Palin selection, she would focus her efforts especially on working women — middle- and working-class, married and single — in swing states where she ran strong, like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.Mr. Obama’s advisers sharply disputed the argument that Clinton supporters might be drawn to Ms. Palin on the basis of sex, given that Ms. Palin opposes abortion rights and other commonly held positions for Democrats. But Clinton advisers presented a more nuanced view, saying that some of her supporters — they could not specify how many — could be open to the McCain-Palin ticket depending on how Ms. Palin performed and whether she appeared to be a forceful, sincere advocate for the concerns of working women, their families and for policies that would help them.“With Palin, there is a core group of Hillary supporters who are not available to this ticket or any Republican,” Ms. Lewis said. “Supreme Court appointments is the bottom line. There is a second group who are now giving McCain-Palin a second look, and it depends on how Palin performs. These voters see Hillary as someone who fought and rose to challenges with persistence, and who spoke in real ways to their lives.'"
"'08-09-01,'0','It was a gamble that Mr. McCain could turn to his advantage a situation that otherwise threatened to wash away his opportunity to introduce himself and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, through the careful choreography of his convention.“There are two sides to the coin,” said Joe Gaylord, who was a top adviser to Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker. “On the one hand, you’d like the time to be able to present your message to the public. On the other hand, when the country’s going through something like this — and remember just how searing Hurricane Katrina really was for the country — to have that happen almost on the anniversary in almost the exact location, to not pay attention would be a huge mistake.”Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush were not the only ones to put aside the campaign for a moment in deference to the storm. Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, said he would tap his broad fund-raising list to solicit donations and volunteers to help hurricane victims. But this was to be the Republicans’ week, and politically they would seem to have the most to gain or lose.For Mr. Bush, it was a chance for a do-over. Though many Bush advisers continue to make the case that he was unfairly blamed for the uneven response to Hurricane Katrina, he has few opportunities left before he leaves office in less than five months to burnish his legacy, and this was clearly one.So on Sunday, Mr. Bush met with federal emergency officials in Washington and, while he will again stay away from New Orleans for the moment to avoid getting in the way, he made plans to travel on Monday to Texas to be in the neighborhood.For Mr. Bush, the television pictures may bring back haunting memories and spur thoughts of what he could have done differently in 2005.“We kept making the point that the state of Louisiana and the city of New Orleans were dysfunctional,” said Dan Bartlett, the former Bush White House counselor, in a recent interview. “Yeah, but that’s why people wanted us to do something. But it was hard to see that when you were in the middle of it.”Mr. Bush may never erase the black mark, but now at least he has a chance for redemption. “This is an opportunity for the administration to show that it’s learned some hard lessons,” said Mark McKinnon, a former consultant to both Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain. “It’s an opportunity to show government working this time. And if it does, that’ll be good for New Orleans, that’ll be good for the country and it’ll be good for the administration and for the party.”Mr. McCain’s decision to get out front and center played into his “Country First” campaign slogan, allowing him to reinforce his message that he is not a typical partisan and to draw a sharp contrast with the Bush administration’s response of three years ago.Even some Democrats agreed. “McCain has the opportunity, as long as he doesn’t look like he’s politicizing it, to look like he’s putting political rhetoric aside,” said Robert Shrum, a Democratic consultant who has been involved in conventions since 1972.Neither Mr. Shrum nor other veteran political strategists could remember a convention turned on its head in quite this way, and so there was little precedent to consult in deciding how to adjust. Convention organizers watched helplessly as cable television focused nonstop on the hurricane on a day that otherwise would have been devoted to chewing over Mr. McCain’s biography or his selection of Ms. Palin as his running mate.But the unspoken advantage for Mr. McCain may be a convention without Mr. Bush or Vice President Dick Cheney. The senator’s campaign was never enthusiastic about showcasing the unpopular president at Mr. McCain’s coming-out party. As it was, Mr. Bush had been scheduled to leave after his opening-night speech and retreat to Camp David, never appearing with Mr. McCain, who would not arrive until later in the week.Now the hurricane has done what the McCain team did not think it could do. “For McCain and the Republicans, it’s already blown Bush and Cheney out of the convention,” Mr. Shrum said. “There was no other way to keep them away.”'"
"'08-09-01,'0','The views of the Republican delegates on the issues, especially the economy, and on Mr. Bush are sharply at odds with voters generally. In mid-August, only 20 percent of voters said the economy was in good shape, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll of the nation. The Republican delegates see the economy very differently. While they, too, say it is the country’s most pressing problem, they say it is largely in good shape.Ninety percent of the Democratic delegates said the nation was in a recession, while 72 percent of the Republican delegates say it is not.“If we were in a recession, people would not be eating out — they would be in the grocery store and cooking at home,” said Phyllis Gorman, 59, a business owner and delegate from Oklahoma, in an interview after the delegate poll was taken. “When I drive by McDonald’s, there are so many people in line there. There are still a lot of cars on the road. If we were still in a recession like we were in the ’70s, people wouldn’t be doing anything.”Republican delegates also strongly support the president, whose job-approval ratings among voters generally have for many months been among the lowest registered for a modern president.Barbara Lawrence, a Kansas delegate, said in an interview that, despite the bad polls, Mr. Bush “remained convinced what he was doing was right. And a man who doesn’t waiver when adversity comes is certainly a leader.”Delegates say Mr. Bush has turned out to be the president they expected, yet nearly half say his presidency has weakened the party. They split over whether he should campaign for Mr. McCain and other Republicans.The poll, of 854 of the 2,380 Republican delegates was conducted July 23 to Aug. 26 over the phone or by the Internet. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant. The nationwide poll of voters that is cited for comparison was done Aug. 15-20 with 1,014 voters, and has the same margin of sampling error.The sharp contrast between the Republican and Democratic delegates’ stands on the issues offers something of a refutation of the popular lament among some Americans that there is no difference between the two major parties.For example, just 7 percent of the Republican delegates would choose expanded health care coverage over lower taxes, compared with 94 percent of Democratic delegates who would. The two parties’ views on the war in Iraq, abortion rights and same-sex marriage are similarly at odds.'"
"'08-09-01,'0','PITTSBURGH (AP) — To the Milwaukee Brewers, C. C. Sabathia pitched a no-hitter that wasn’t, even if Sabathia might have been the only player in their clubhouse who was not upset that the best-pitched game of his career will go down as a one-hitter.Sabathia limited the Pirates to Andy LaRoche’s infield single leading off the fifth inning — a play Milwaukee Manager Ned Yost contended was an error on Sabathia — and the Brewers beat Pittsburgh, 7-0, on Sunday for their eighth victory in nine games.“He accomplished a no-hitter and wasn’t given what he deserved,” Yost said. “That should have been a no-hitter. That’s a stinking no-hitter we all got cheated from. I feel horrible for C. C.”The Brewers said they would send a DVD of the play to Major League Baseball, asking that the call be overturned. But according to baseball’s rulebook, only the official scorer can change a judgment scoring call.If the official scorer, Bob Webb, decides to change the call, it would be the first time in major league history a no-hitter was awarded retroactively.LaRoche’s softly hit grounder on a 2-2 pitch rolled about 45 feet between the plate and the mound before Sabathia (9-0) picked it up barehanded, only to drop it. The ball might have been hit too softly for Sabathia to get LaRoche at first, even if he had fielded the ball cleanly.'"
"'08-09-01,'0','In the opera Hoffmann recounts the stories of three tempestuous affairs that end badly. He falls madly in love with a female automaton he thinks is real, an ailing young soprano who literally sings herself to death, and a duplicitous Venetian courtesan who wants to steal his reflection from a mirror.Rachel Coates, a spokeswoman for the troupe, said, “We feel it’s a fantasy opera and the setting on the waterfront area is conducive to the imagination.” (As it did last year, American Stevedoring, operator of the Red Hook container port, is hosting the company.)Seth Baumrin, co-director of the production, said the dockside exercises were inspired by his training with key members of the Odin Teatret, an experimental theater in Holstebro, Denmark. “So many opera singers fall into older habits and traditions that go back to the 18th century,” he said. “I want to get them estranged from the habit. So the exercises replace that old language with the new movements.”Mr. Baumrin said that he hoped the movements of the singers would blend well with the impressive backdrop. “I don’t want the skyline to distract people from the opera, so I need to integrate what’s going on onstage with the skyline,” he said.The singers, he added, “need to work organically with the skyline and become part of it, which is not easy.”William Browning, a baritone and former truck driver from Kansas who sings one of the Villains in this “Hoffmann,” described the unusual rehearsal exercises (which included the singers’ daubing one another’s faces with brightly colored paint) as a “character-building experience.”He arrived late to a rehearsal in Cobble Hill a few weeks ago and found the cast members tied together with toilet paper. He said, laughing, that he thought to himself, “What have I gotten into?”Mr. Baumrin’s 13-year-old son, Asher, sings in the chorus, and his 10-year-old daughter, Mikah, is making costumes. They are part of an eclectic group of professional and budding singers and Red Hook residents recruited to participate in the production.Peter Szep, the music director, said it is important to involve local residents. “I care about the community connection,” he said. “It feels like a guerrilla opera company.”In a small, cluttered room with a view of the docks the Red Hook resident Michelle Velez, a school-bus driver, was enthusiastically making costumes. She worked as a volunteer usher last year and recruited two of her seven children to help out this time, as well as “other local kids who never had the opportunity to do stuff like that.”“It’s better than doing nothing for the summer,” she added, directing a pointed look at her 16-year-old daughter, Michelle.She was busy putting glitter on sneakers for a look that Dixie Rich, the costume designer, said would be “European trash” and “a little retro,” with “the chorus all layered and mixed up and cross-dressed.”The younger Michelle said: “I am enjoying it. I get to destroy shoes and decorate them.”Nearby Nilsa Rivera, Ms. Velez’s 18-year-old niece, was using a sewing machine to create a costume. Ms. Velez’s 13-year-old daughter, Justina, is in the chorus.The senior Ms. Velez was recruited by her friend and chorus member Sandy Serrano, an education advocate for the Red Hook Initiative, a community organization. Last year Ms. Serrano recruited several teenagers through the initiative and hopes to entice more to usher this year.Some singers found their way into the production through unusual routes. Kirk Bangstad, a tenor, had just moved to Cobble Hill from the Chicago area and by chance overheard the auditions taking place from the street. He walked in unannounced and began singing.Ms. Barnes assumed he was the tenor scheduled to audition, only realizing that Mr. Bangstad’s appearance was impromptu when the expected singer showed up.Mr. Bangstad’s daring paid off, and he was given the roles of Pitichinaccio, Nathanael, Cochenille and Frantz. “I think only in New York” could something like that happen, he said.'"
"'08-09-01,'0','The era was fairly brief. But for many locals like Ms. Meffert, a trip to the pool became as much a weekend tradition as brunch or hangovers, a no-planning-necessary good time and a place to see friends and be seen. Dressed in a vintage romper, with an armful of brown office-supply rubber bands worn as bracelets, Ms. Meffert, who works in fashion public relations, admitted that she took extra care selecting outfits for McCarren. (“But don’t print that,” she said. “It’s supposed to be effortless.”)The mood at the last two concerts felt like the end of summer camp: ready for fun, but tinged with early-onset nostalgia. The Yo La Tengo show was one of the most crowded of the season, the organizers said. (Even the V.I.P. section filled to capacity early.) Though Sonic Youth did not sell out, many people picnicked outside or stopped by the gates to listen; using a knotted rubber hose slung over a low branch, two enterprising men even climbed a tree for a view over the fence, and a few others hopped a wall to get in.The audience ranged in age from second-generation rockist kids to 50-something Sonic Youth fans. Joined by Mark Ibold, the former bassist for Pavement, the band played for more than an hour and a half, opening with two songs so new they had neither titles nor lyrics. “I’ll sing whatever comes into my head,” Mr. Moore said.On his day off Abraham Lopez, 28, a deliveryman for a Chinese restaurant who lives in Greenpoint, rode by on his bike and stopped to rock out. “I love this music,” he said, even though he didn’t know the band. “I come from Mexico, and in Mexico there is little music like that.”But the pool’s narrowly focused indie-rock programming was not always well received in the diverse neighborhood, with many longtime residents complaining that it attracted only the newer arrivals.On Saturday, Alesa Syk, 66, who moved to the neighborhood a decade ago from Warsaw, was walking around the track in McCarren Park with the highly amplified drone of the Detroit band Wolf Eyes, one of Sonic Youth’s openers, as a soundtrack. “This music, very noisy,” she said, shaking her head. “Swimming, O.K.”Nearby, Raul Roman Sr. was playing boccie with his family. Mr. Roman, a Williamsburg, Brooklyn, native, had gone to the pool to swim as a child and visited it recently for an opera concert. He would have gone more often if there had been classic-rock concerts, he said, and he was looking forward to taking his granddaughter to swim.Still, he said, the changes in the neighborhood exemplified by the crowds in the pool — and the high-rise apartment buildings now surrounding it — had made the area safer. He noted that he had recently left his bicycle unlocked in the park when he went for a run.Bars and restaurants in the area have benefited from the crowds. Serkan Uzel, an owner of Lokal, a nearby restaurant, said his business increased by about 30 percent on show days. “It’s bringing a crowd not just from here, but from the Upper East Side, the Upper West, the Village,” he said, adding that he did not expect the same increase when the pool opens.Enid’s, a buzzy spot across the street from the park, had to hire extra waiters and cooks to deal with the pre- and postconcert crowds, said Sera McGovern, a manager there; now they will have to reshuffle that staff. “I’m sad to see it go because it’s so good for business,” she said on Saturday, “but I’m kind of relieved that today is the last one. You get the floods of people all at the same time, and the bathroom lines even from people who don’t order. It’s so chaotic.”The new energy of the area was part of the attraction for Tina Thor, 45, a jewelry designer and manager for actors, who bought a $750,000 two-bedroom apartment overlooking the park last year. She had not bothered to go to the pool because she can see and hear it clearly from her sixth-floor balcony. When she was home, she had friends over to watch the shows, even though, she said, “half the time I don’t even know who it is.”“I love when there’s that music and there’s music from the kickball” games in the park, Ms. Thor added as she took her dog, Rickson, a Great Dane-boxer mix with a Louis Vuitton collar, out for a walk. “It’s so festive.” But, she added, “I’d still rather have a pool.”Not so Fawn Lansley, 26, a design assistant who came to the free Sunday concerts nearly every week for the Slip ’N Slide and said proudly that she had taken the very last run on it. Like the dodgeball games, the slide became as popular as a setting for YouTube videos and Flickr slideshows as it was for the retro experience.The McCarren pool phenomenon was among the best documented of the city’s summertime diversions. It attracted local celebrities: the audience for the last show included the musicians Norman Reedus and Rain Phoenix; the actor and musician Michael Pitt; Craig Finn, the singer of the Hold Steady, which played at McCarren; and Michelle Williams and Spike Jonze.And it created its own microcelebrities, like Joe Heffernan, a drummer and JellyNYC employee who has the world’s least-threatening neck tattoo (it reads, “Fun”), and a man known alternately as Shirtless Tom or Captain America. (He favors well-worn American-flag shorts.) At the Yo La Tengo show Tom, 25, who declined to give his last name because he teaches at a tony Manhattan school, was approached by a fellow dodgeball player, Jacque Morris, 22, a grad student visiting from Portland, Ore. She held out a deflated ball for him to autograph as a memento.Backstage after the Sonic Youth show, Mr. Moore, whose band has played at the pool every year since it has been open for music, said he would miss it. “It’s always been kind of sweet — sweet sounding, sweet vibe,” he said. But, he added, “I’m looking forward to coming here and doing the backstroke.”Among his hipster audience, this was not a popular sentiment. Most said that they thought the pool would be too dirty, and really there was no way doing laps could be as cool. As Mr. Finn said, “I don’t like sports where I have to take off my glasses.”'"

"'08-09-02,'0','“The idea was really generated based on the Target take on Fashion Week,” she added. “This would be a way we could bring affordable design to the masses.”At the pop-up stores — which will be open for four days from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. — merchandise will be priced on average at $25.Target often sells less expensive offerings from brand-name designers. In the spring, Rogan Gregory, whose designs are sold in Barneys New York for $230 to $450, created a line of clothes for Target that sold for $14.99 to $44.99. Several pieces from the collection, though, are now on clearance. A Rogan for Target sleeveless button-front dress is marked down to $8.74, from $34.99, on Target.com.As much as Target is promoting its fashion credibility in New York, it is also focusing on its role as a discounter for struggling consumers across the chain.“We can emphasize ‘Expect more’ or ‘Pay less’ depending on the economy,” said Ms. Tesija, playing on the company’s tagline. “We are putting a little bit more emphasis on ‘Pay less.’ ”In its circulars, Target is advertising fewer items and giving more prominent display to prices. In its stores, many displays draw attention to low-price sundries.Target reported that profit for the three months ended Aug. 2 fell 7.6 percent, to $634 million, compared with $686 million, for the same period last year.Sales at stores open at least a year, a measure of retail health, declined 0.4 percent for the quarter.“The merchandise mix of, say, Wal-Mart for example is much more suited to customers now than the merchandise mix of Target,” said Bill Dreher, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. “Wal-Mart is much more of a supermarket-style discount store, and Target’s much more of a department store-style discount store.”Analysts say the current economy is not suited to Target’s core strengths, but its prospects are nonetheless strong.“What’s unique about Target within the American retailing landscape is they still have immense opportunity to grow,” said Mr. Dreher, adding that the retailer could easily double, even triple, the number of its stores, particularly in areas like New York and New England.In Manhattan, he suggested, Target would be a logical successor to the retail space currently occupied by the aging Kmarts at Pennsylvania Station and Astor Place, near New York University.“You could imagine most of the N.Y.U. dorms being outfitted from that store,” Mr. Dreher said.'"

"'08-09-02,'0','In Europe, stocks fell more modestly. Britain’s FTSE 100 closed down 0.60 percent at 5,602.80, Germany’s DAX fell 0.01 percent to 6,421.80 and France’s CAC slipped 0.23 percent to 4,472.13. The markets often take cues from Wall Street, but United States exchanges were closed for Labor Day.Global investors were uneasy after the United States released figures on Friday showing decreasing personal incomes and weak consumer spending, suggesting softer demand for foreign goods.Oil prices also were a concern as Gustav churned along the Gulf Coast, where oil companies had shut down drilling and refining operations. Signs that Gustav was weakening, however, eased some of investors’ uneasiness as the day wore on.While crude rose $2.79 to $118.25 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile exchange early in the day, it later retreated to trade at $111.12 a barrel, down $4.34 from Friday’s settlement.Although oil has fallen substantially since hitting a record of $147.27 in July, it remains expensive and a drag on economies.“There’s not much positive news. We have slowing down in the U.S and higher oil prices. So investors are clearly still worried,” said Alex Tang, head of research at Core Pacific-Yamaichi in Hong Kong.Across Asia, companies that depend on the United States and other export markets took a beating, with cautious comments from the computer maker Dell weighing on the technology sector.The Hon Hai Precision Industry Company, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer that supplies Apple and other leading brands, fell 6.9 percent after posting a decline in profits.In South Korea, Hynix Semiconductor, the world’s second-largest manufacturer of computer memory chips, slid 11.3 percent. The handset maker LG Electronics fell 9.6 percent.South Korean airlines slumped, with Korean Air Lines declining by its daily limit of 14.95 percent.

"'08-09-02,'0','“It’s not necessarily a bad thing,” Mr. Berkowitz said. “It’s becoming a little more affordable, like one of those more affordable luxuries. If you’re going to indulge, you might as well indulge at a discount.”Even though the price is down, Jose Soliva, 37, an architect from Wellesley, Mass., is trying to save money and was buying his first lobsters of the summer on Friday for himself and his wife.“A few years back we had it more often,” Mr. Soliva said. “But since the economy is bad we’re now a lot more conservative about when we treat ourselves.”Soft-shell lobsters, which are harvested in summer and typically served in restaurants, are the least expensive this year, while hard-shell lobsters, which are usually no smaller than a pound and a half, are slightly more expensive.While diners like lower lobster prices, lobster fishermen do not. The fishermen have spent much of this year modifying how they set and haul in their traps. Some are allowing traps to sit in the water a day or two longer, which helps save gas and bait prices. Lobster fishermen are absorbing fuel costs twice — for their own boats and for those of the bait fishermen, who have raised prices.“You have to let your traps set longer,” Mr. Eaton said. “If it’s a windy, blowy day you don’t do a half-day’s work anymore.“In the end it pays off because you’re not wasting fuel. It’s not costing you two days’ fuel to haul one day’s work.”The high price of fuel has forced some lobster fishermen to stop working, said Bob Bayer, executive director of the Lobster Institute at the University of Maine, and low prices will make things even more difficult.“This means hard times, and it means some are not going to make it,” Professor Bayer said. “The boats have gotten bigger and bigger over the years. They’re diesel engines, and with fuel over $5 a gallon, it’s going to be tough.”The worst may be ahead, Professor Bayer said, as lobster consumption and prices typically drop in September.Bernie Feeney, who traps lobsters out of Boston Harbor, said he knew many lobstermen who had taken second jobs in recent years. Mr. Feeney, who has been a lobsterman since 1978, said he had been doing marine surveying for the last five years to help pay the bills.“In a year where our fuel costs are almost doubled and bait costs have gone up 50 to 60 percent as a result of fuel,” Mr. Feeney said, “it’s a squeeze from both ends.”Partly as a result, young people are not going into the lobstering business, he said, adding that the average age of a fisherman in Massachusetts is 59.“There aren’t many young entrants,” said Mr. Feeney, a past president of the Massachusetts Lobstermen’s Association. “The startup costs of this business are astronomical compared to what they used to be.”At James Hook and Company, a retailer in Boston, lobster was selling at $1 or $2 less a pound than usual: a soft-shell lobster was $6.99 a pound, while a one-pound hard-shell lobster was $8.99.'"
"'08-09-02,'0','Air miles are responsible for 3 percent to 13 percent of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, according to various reports. A single round-trip coast-to-coast flight can create about three tons of carbon dioxide emissions, about the same amount as driving a midsize car for six months.Another, more controversial, option that the Apollo Alliance considered was carbon offsets.On paper at least, offsets pay for reductions in carbon dioxide production. Offset providers, both nonprofit and for-profit, finance renewable energy projects that reduce the need for electricity from fossil fuel, provide upfront costs for energy efficiency programs, or pay to plant trees.But there has been criticism of offsetting, with some likening them to medieval papal indulgences, allowing individuals, companies and organizations to continue their polluting ways by simply paying a fee.As carbon offsets increase in popularity — sales in the United States rose to $88 million in 2007 from $39 million in 2006, according to the research firm New Carbon Finance — many travelers have questions about the practice.“I talk to a lot of people about carbon offsets these days,” said Rusty Pritchard, a former environmental economist at Emory University who serves as outreach director for the Evangelical Environmental Network, a national Christian organization. “They have questions that range from the scientific, like, ‘How does paying for energy efficiency in Brazil offset the carbon you’re emitting on a flight to New York?’ to ‘Is it fair to claim this as a business expense?’ I’ve even had people at universities ask, ‘How do we explain this to our donors?’ ”Specialists in global warming say the best way for business travelers to reduce their carbon emissions is to limit the time they spend on the road. “The average American creates about 20 tons of CO2 — about twice the emissions of the average European and far more than people in the rest of the world,” said Anja Kollmuss, senior scientist at the nonprofit Stockholm Environment Institute, a science-based policy institute. “So, if you fly to Europe and back a couple of times, that adds quite a lot to your carbon footprint.”Once a traveler has reduced flying time, “carbon offsets are worth doing, if you do them right,” said Mark C. Trexler, a carbon reduction strategies consultant and author of a 2006 report, “A Consumer’s Guide to Retail Carbon Offset Providers.”The challenge is to find quality offsets, because no universally accepted method of certification or verification exists, though some voluntary standards — like the Voluntary Carbon Standard, the Gold Standard and Green-E Climate certification — are gaining acceptance.“You need careful monitoring to make sure these offsets are transparent and verifiable, that you can document that the offset is permanent and additional,” said Representative Peter F. Welch, Democrat of Vermont and a sponsor of the Carbon Neutrality Act of 2007. The legislation would guarantee that offset providers deliver what they promise, much in the way the Agriculture Department verifies organic farming practices.Crucial to finding quality carbon offsets is looking for what in the field is called “additionality.”“You want to invest in a project that would not have happened otherwise,” Ms. Kollmuss said. Consider a program that helps build wind farms, she says. If a particular wind farm would not have been built without the capital provided by the offset vendor, the project is additional.“But if it’s required by law,” to, say, help meet a state’s renewable energy requirements, “it’s not additional.”To help sort through the confusion and decide which providers to use, John B. Izzo, an author of business books and a management consultant, used several online references, including a guide to offsetting published by the Nature Conservancy and an offset-provider rating compiled by the Tufts Climate Initiative.He chose a Swiss-based offset provider, Myclimate, because of its high ranking on the Tufts survey.Similarly, Mr. Welch offsets the travel associated with his work by using the Vermont-based offset provider Native Energy. He pays more than $800 out of pocket to offset 71-plus tons of carbon each year.'"
"'08-09-02,'0','BANGKOK — After 14 high-profile months as owner, Thaksin Shinawatra, the former Thai prime minister, has agreed to sell the Manchester City soccer club to Abu Dhabi United Group, based in the United Arab Emirates. The financial terms were not made public.The sale of Manchester City, a fixture in the English Premier League, has implications not only for soccer but probably also for Thai politics, now in an upheaval that may bring down the current prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, Mr. Thaksin’s loyal ally.Ousted from power two years ago, Mr. Thaksin is a fugitive from justice in Thailand, charged with corruption. Thai authorities have frozen more than $2 billion worth of his assets, and the sale of Manchester City was interpreted by some as a sign that Mr. Thaksin needed cash.That perception may diminish his standing in Thai politics among those who assumed he had a bottomless war chest with which to finance his political allies.“But there are others,” said Panitan Wattanayagorn of Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, “who see the sale of Manchester City as a way to raise money to try to finance the next election in Thailand. This man has been known to be very smart in terms of his money management.”Soccer fans say Mr. Thaksin’s reign at Manchester City was similar to his five-year tenure as prime minister: spirited, brash, experimental and at times erratic. He bought the club in July 2007 for nearly $163 million and, according to outside estimates, invested an additional $70 million to $140 million.'"
"'08-09-02,'0','Google’s browser project has been under way for more than a year, a person close to the company said.In a brief statement, Microsoft welcomed the new entry and expressed confidence that people would prefer Explorer, which is on every Windows PC sold.“The browser landscape is highly competitive,” said Dean Hachamovitch, general manager of the Internet Explorer group. “But people will choose Internet Explorer 8 for the way it puts the services they want right at their fingertips, respects their personal choices about how they want to browse and, more than any other browsing technology, puts them in control of their personal data online.”Google has clashed with Microsoft before, saying it had designed IE to gain ground in search, a market where Google is the runaway leader.After Microsoft introduced IE 7 in 2006, Google complained that the browser’s search box favored Microsoft’s search service. Microsoft responded and made modifications, and a federal judge overseeing the antitrust consent decree against Microsoft determined that the browser design was not anticompetitive.The first round of the browser wars in the 1990s led to a sweeping federal antitrust suit against Microsoft for the tactics it used to stifle competition from the commercial pioneer in browsing software, Netscape Communications. A federal appeals court ruled in 2001 that Microsoft had repeatedly violated the nation’s antitrust laws. Microsoft later reached a settlement with the Bush administration, which included some sanctions but left the company free to bundle browsing software with Windows, which runs more than 90 percent of all personal computers.Microsoft recently stepped up its own browser development efforts, given the increasing importance of the browser and signs that Firefox is nibbling at its lead. Microsoft released a new version, IE8, last week to generally favorable reviews.Microsoft still holds 73 percent of the browser market, according to Net Applications, a research firm. The market share for Firefox has climbed to 19 percent, while Apple’s Safari has 6 percent.Chrome also puts Google in competition with an ally, the Mozilla Corporation, which manages the Firefox project. Just last week, Google renewed its deal with Mozilla. Under the arrangement, Google Search is the home page for Firefox and Google is its default search bar, and Google makes substantial payments to Mozilla. The agreement runs through November 2011, and will continue.Google’s cooperation with Mozilla, however friendly, meant that it was ceding control of the Internet’s vital gateway technology — and the dominant supplier of that technology is its archrival, Microsoft.Given the increasing importance of the browser and its widening competition with Microsoft, Google’s entry into the market is not surprising, said John Lilly, chief executive of Mozilla.“It would be more surprising to me if Google didn’t do something in the browser space,” Mr. Lilly said. “After all, Google is 100 percent on the Web.”Google’s move, he said, would put “more competitive pressure on us to keep coming up with great browser technology. But having more smart people competing to improve browser technology and the user experience is a good thing.”Mr. Lilly also noted that Mozilla, while a private company, is entirely owned by the Mozilla Foundation. The browser project was begun to provide an alternative to Microsoft’s browser. “The mission of Mozilla is to keep the Web open, a pure public benefit,” he said. “Others have other motivations and Google’s move also serves to highlight our position in the marketplace.”Chrome will be available to download in a test, or beta, version on Tuesday, Google announced on its Web site Monday afternoon. The browser will run on Windows. Google is also working on Chrome versions for Apple’s Macintosh, as well as Linux, an open source operating system.In a curious twist, Google made its online announcement after its plans appeared as a digital “comic book” that was posted by Google Blogoscoped, a Web site that tracks the Internet search giant.According to Google’s Web site post, by Sundar Pichai, an engineering director and vice president for product management, Chrome is designed for speed and ease of use.But the other design goal, it seems, was to make sure Google could control how well the growing range of Web-based software it is developing will perform, instead of having to run on a Microsoft browser.“Under the hood,” Mr. Pichai wrote, “we were able to build the foundation of a browser that runs today’s complex Web applications much better.”Later, he wrote, “we improved speed and responsiveness across the board. We also built a more powerful JavaScript engine, V8, to power the next generation of Web applications that aren’t even possible in today’s browsers.”Chrome is based on an open-source rendering engine, WebKit, and an open-source version of Google’s Gears technology. Chrome will also be able to run in a privacy mode, InCognito, so that no information about a person’s browsing is collected. With IE8 last week, Microsoft added a privacy mode of browsing, called InPrivate.The privacy features, analysts note, could undercut the Internet advertising business of Google, but also Microsoft, Yahoo and others that depend on ads aimed at users based on their browsing behavior. But it is unclear, analysts say, how large a share of users will opt for the privacy browsing mode and give up the convenience of having a browser store sites recently visited in tabbed settings for easy navigation.'"
"'08-09-02,'0','In addition, Ms. Fassihi — who spent her childhood in Iran before moving to the United States with her family shortly after the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war — does a memorable job of describing Iran’s growing influence in a post-Saddam Iraq, noting the Islamic religiosity that began sweeping parts of the country and the growing constraints placed on women.It is Ms. Fassihi’s snapshots of individual Iraqis — who have lost their homes, their businesses or the simple security of knowing they can go grocery shopping or take their children to school without the fear of a bomb or sniper attack — that lodge most insistently in the reader’s mind. She introduces us to Omar Jumah, whose home happens to be in the American-controlled Green Zone, and who faces up to six hours of checkpoint traffic — and the risk of being blown up — every time he leaves the zone to visit relatives or friends in other parts of the city. She talks to an ambulance driver named Majid Bechai Leftah, who worries every day that he will be killed by Americans or insurgents or criminals as he makes his daily rounds.And she describes the elaborate security precautions a man named Sabah takes in an effort to ensure that his son’s wedding will come off safely. The service is moved from the family’s regular church to one near the reception hall (to save guests from the hazards of driving long distances around Baghdad); armed guards are hired to stand by the door to help thwart a kidnapping or insurgent attack; and guests, heading from the church to the reception, are told to leave in 15-minute intervals to avoid a long procession that might attract attention.Ms. Fassihi tells the story of one of her bureau’s drivers, Nahid, who is kidnapped along with his uncle, and the kidnappers’ demand that the family turn over half a million dollars ransom within 24 hours; and the story of Haqqi, the Wall Street Journal’s principal interpreter and office manager, who proudly votes in his first free election, only to rush back to the office in search of a Band-Aid, so that he can cover the purple ink on his finger.“I don’t want anyone in the street or in my neighborhood to see I voted,” he says of the telltale ink. “It would get me killed.”Given the constant hazards of life in occupied Iraq and Iraqis’ reluctance to talk about their feelings or admit psychological trauma, Ms. Fassihi says, it’s not surprising that many “pop antidepressants, anti-anxiety and sleeping pills like candy.” Dr. Hashim Zainy, a psychiatrist at the Ibn Roshd psychiatric hospital, describes the Iraqi psyche like this:“Anything can happen at any moment. You can’t plan for the next day or the next hour. You are always afraid, in every waking hour and in your sleep. This chronic stress gives you a deep sense of helplessness, an inability to take charge of your life and make decisions. There is an internal weakening inside every Iraqi personality.”As a reporter in an increasingly dangerous Baghdad, Ms. Fassihi has her own share of close calls: A car bomb explodes outside the house that she and several other journalists share, and on another occasion she and her driver narrowly escape kidnappers, who pursue them in a mad car chase through the streets of Baghdad. She begins spending more time worrying about her own safety and that of her staff than actually reporting, and finds herself becoming increasingly superstitious.“I have lucky boots for military embeds, a lucky scarf for road trips, a lucky handbag, and lucky days of the week,” she writes. “I tap into my gut for ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ feelings about such simple things as whether I should go grocery shopping. On several occasions I’ve backed away from interviews at the last minute, once at the doorstep of the source’s house, because my gut suddenly turned against it.”Ms. Fassihi says she has not met a single Iraqi whose “life hasn’t been touched by the war or altered” because of the everyday violence. “I have heard this phrase from Iraqis over and over, ‘Until now, we are still waiting,’ ” she says. “What are they waiting for, I wonder. Perhaps just for an ordinary day.”'"
"'08-09-02,'0','People who buy ayurvedic medicines, commonly used around the world by Indians and other people from South Asia, may be getting more than they bargained for.Researchers who looked at almost 200 ayurvedic products bought in the United States found that about a fifth contained lead, mercury or arsenic, sometimes at dangerously high levels.Writing in the Aug. 27 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, the researchers said government regulators should establish daily dose limits for toxic metals in dietary supplements and require manufacturers to have their products tested for compliance.The researchers, led by Dr. Robert B. Saper of the Boston Medical Center, bought the medicines over the Internet in 2005. Some of the products were made in India and others in the United States, but the prevalence of the metals was about the same for both countries, the study said.In some cases, the presence of the metals may have been no accident. A form of ayurveda, rasa shastra, involves adding some of the materials to the medicine, the researchers said, and those types of products had the highest levels of the metals. But the metals were also found in some of the medicines described as herbal only.The researchers questioned the belief of rasa shastra practitioners that when the preparations are made correctly, the metals cause no harm.'"

"'08-09-02,'0','“They told us if we didn’t know how to text message, to ask our kids,"" said one Texas delegate, MerryLynn Gerstenschlager.The floor was the usual convention mix of coordinated outfits and funny hats – Texans in blue jeans shirts and straw ten-gallon hats; Coloradans in navy golf shirts; Floridians in Hawaiian shirts.The mood was festive, but the floor action was brief and perfunctory, lasting no more than 20 minutes. After Mr. Duncan called the convention to order, he suspended the floor activity to convene committees that will handle the routine matters – setting credentials, handling platform issues – necessary to allow the convention to proceed. Instead of a line-up that was to have included President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, the first day of the proceedings in the Xcel Center will feature appearances by First Lady Laura Bush and Cindy McCain, the nominee’s wife, who are to call for help for victims of the storm. Trying to strike the right tone, organizers of glitzy parties being staged around the Twin Cities are also converting them into fundraisers. Mr. McCain visited a relief center in Ohio.At the same time, the family of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, Mr. McCain’s surprise choice as his running mate, announced that Governor Palin’s unmarried 17-year-old daughter was five months pregnant and would marry the father of the child, illustrating the intense public scrutiny accompanying the new status of the relatively unknown Governor Palin.“Our beautiful daughter Bristol came to us with news that as parents we knew would make her grow up faster than we had ever planned,” Sarah Palin and her husband, Todd, said in a statement released by the McCain campaign. “We’re proud of Bristol’s decision to have her baby and even prouder to become grandparents. As Bristol faces the responsibilities of adulthood, she knows she has our unconditional love and support.”McCain aides said the pregnancy was announced to counter mounting Internet rumors that Governor Palin had claimed to have given birth to her fifth child last April as a way of covering up for what the rumors asserted was for her daughter’s childbirth. A top McCain adviser said he did not see any impact on the way voters would judge Governor Palin.“The notion that that would bear on her capacity to be vice president of the United States is demeaning,” said Steve Schmidt, Mr. McCain’s senior adviser. “I doubt you would ask that question if it was a man. The tradition in our politics has been that we leave the kids alone.” Another McCain aide said the campaign would have preferred that the news of the pregnancy not be become public, allowing the family to deal with it privately. But they said Mr. McCain was made aware of it in a long private conversation with Governor Palin before he selected her as his running mate.In his first comments on the issue, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the Democratic nominee, said the pregnancy was not relevant to the campaign.“I think people’s families are off-limits,” Mr. Obama said, speaking to reporters here on Monday. “People’s children are especially off limits. This shouldn’t be part of our politics.”Several of those attending the convention offered quick support for the Palins, saying the pregnancy was an issue that many families confront. “This happens to people in all walks of life,” said Karen Minnis, 54, a state representative from Oregon.And in another problem facing the party, hundreds of protesters threatened to disrupt the convention. In an incident more serious than any that occurred at the Democratic convention in Denver last week, protesters with black handkerchiefs covering their faces marched downtown toward the convention center and smashed windows of a department store and a bank.“I feel like the Bush administration destroys more property everyday,” one masked protester said. Besides using chemical spray, police officers used their bicycles as a make-shift fence to push back the marchers.The Republicans are conducting internal party business at the convention on Monday afternoon as a necessary prelude to formally nominating Mr. McCain later this week. As the initial reports from the Gulf Coast indicated that Gustav would not inflict the same type of devastation as Katrina three years ago, Republicans said they would make evaluations on a daily basis as to if and when they would return to the planned convention schedule. They noted that first reports on the ground sometimes underestimate the damage.“Obviously, we hope we will get back to our regular program,” said Mr. Duncan.The political ramifications of shrinking the convention remained unclear. Republicans were almost certain to get less exposure than Democrats did last week in Denver. But party strategists also privately pointed to advantages in the absence of Mr. Bush, who was monitoring the storm, and Mr. Cheney, allowing Mr. McCain to keep some distance from the leaders of an unpopular administration. But the hurricane also provided a potent reminder of the administration’s mishandling of the aftermath of Katrina.The McCain campaign team said they were uncertain of the impact of cutting back the proceedings but would cope with it. “This was not the plan,” Mr. Schmidt said ruefully.Mrs. Bush, though, did make a swing through the bustling, heavily-secured convention city, meeting with the Louisiana delegation and conducting a series of television interviews.“I know the delegates are disappointed,” Mrs. Bush said on CNN. “They come from all over the country to have this big celebration but on the other hand I know they understand.”Having invested millions of dollars in convention-related events, Republicans and their political allies were moving ahead with the dozens of parties but trying to strike a more somber tone until the extent of the storm damage is known.For example, the “Spirits of Minnesota” party to be staged Monday night by the Distilled Spirits Council and more than a dozen cosponsors is being converted into the “Spirits of the Gulf Coast,” with the more than 1,000 invited guests being asked to make contributions to the Minnesota Red Cross. “All the money had already been spent so why not turn it into something for the good,” said Frank Coleman, senior vice president of the spirits council, explaining the decision to proceed with the party.In addition, Republicans are planning to assemble thousands of “comfort packages” to be distributed to those affected by the storm. Republicans consider Minnesota an important element of their presidential calculation and the staging of the convention in St. Paul is intended to help build support in a state that has trended Democratic in presidential elections.'"
"'08-09-02,'0','Allianz, for its part, is moving beyond a failed merger strategy to return to a focus on its core business of insurance. It will, however, become the largest shareholder of the combined bank, with close to a 30 percent stake.The agreement could help to hasten the wave of deals now under way in Germany, the largest banking market in Europe. In July, Crédit Mutuel of France paid 4.9 billion euros for Citigroup’s 340 German branches and 3.3 million customers in Germany. Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, has been thought to be focused on a possible acquisition of Postbank, the banking arm of the German postal service, which could cost it $10 billion or more, though its interest has cooled recently, according to executives there. And less than two weeks ago, Lone Star Funds, a private equity firm based in Dallas, acquired IKB Deutsche Industriebank, one of the first victims of the collapse of the subprime mortgage market.Michael Diekmann, chief executive of Allianz, said in a statement that the deal was “a milestone in the consolidation of the German banking sector.”A combined Commerzbank-Dresdner will have assets of about 1.1 trillion euros and nearly 67,000 employees. Deutsche Bank, in comparison, has assets of more than 2 trillion euros and more than 80,000 employees. Commerzbank said that as many as 9,000 jobs would be cut “in a socially responsible way,” 6,500 of them in Germany. It said more than two-thirds of the jobs would be in back-office and control units.Allianz, the biggest European insurance company, had hoped when it acquired Dresdner Bank in July 2001 for about $20 billion that it would be able to use the institution as a vehicle for cross-marketing its insurance products. The anticipated synergies never materialized, and Dresdner Bank has been a millstone around Allianz’s neck. Dresdner Bank last month reported its fourth consecutive quarterly loss.By maintaining a stake, Allianz will ensure that its insurance products continue to be distributed via the combined bank’s branches. It said Monday that it intended to keep the stake “for some time.”Dresdner Kleinwort, the troubled investment banking unit that has been responsible for billions of dollars in losses since 2001, will be reined in, Commerzbank said.Commerzbank, whose strength lies in the small and midsize companies among its clients that are the backbone of the German economy, will pay for the deal in cash and shares and issue new equity to raise money. The deal is structured so that it will pay about 8.8 billion euros by 2009, and put 975 million euros into a trust account against certain asset-backed securities held by Dresdner Bank. The final amount paid will depend on the fate of those Dresdner Bank investments. The amount of that fund not realized as losses will be paid to Allianz in 2018.“We don’t like the transaction at all,” Matthias Dürr, an analyst at DZ Bank, told Reuters. Commerzbank’s plans to raise capital are very unattractive, considering its current share price, he said.'"

"'08-09-03,'1','But on a night when Republicans gave top billing to other speakers, the president’s physical distance from the gathering in St. Paul — his huge image was beamed out over an empty lectern to a crowd in the arena that cheered mostly at mentions of Mr. McCain — also underscored the gulf between the Bush camp and the McCain one.If the subplot of the Democratic convention in was the lingering resentment between Mr. Obama and Senator , the undercurrent here is the longstanding tension between Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain, and Mr. McCain’s efforts to distance himself politically from the man he hopes to succeed. Though Mr. McCain campaigned diligently for Mr. Bush in 2004, the senator was seared by their clash during the 2000 presidential primaries, and Tuesday night brought their complex relationship full circle, with Mr. Bush symbolically handing over the party to Mr. McCain.Mr. Bush did not command the hour being broadcast on national network television, which began with a video tribute to a far more popular Republican president, Reagan, and included an old photograph of Reagan with a young member of Congress, Mr. McCain. It was left to , the first lady, to recount what the White House views as her husband’s accomplishments: his education bill, his global program, his religion-based initiative, his conservative appointees.Then came the red-meat portion of the program. Former Senator of rallied the crowd with sharp attacks on Mr. Obama, calling him “the most liberal, most inexperienced nominee to ever run for president.” He was followed by the evening’s marquee speaker, Senator of , a Democrat turned independent who came close to being Mr. McCain’s running mate and made an impassioned argument that Mr. McCain transcends partisanship.“What, after all, is a Democrat like me doing at a Republican convention like this?” Mr. Lieberman asked. “The answer is simple. I’m here to support John McCain because country matters more than party.”While Mr. Bush did not explicitly criticize Mr. Obama, Mr. Lieberman did, over the war in — the issue that binds him to Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush.“When others wanted to retreat in defeat from the field of battle, when Barack Obama was voting to cut off funding for our troops on the ground, John McCain had the courage to stand against the tide of public opinion and support the surge,” Mr. Lieberman said, “and because of that, today, our troops are at last beginning to come home, not in failure, but in honor.”Mr. McCain’s allies said they hoped Mr. Lieberman’s journey from 2000 Democratic vice-presidential candidate to staunch McCain supporter would be the story of the night, an even more powerful moment than the appearance at the 2004 Republican convention by of , a Democrat who turned on his own party.“I don’t think we’re going to be talking about President Bush’s speech Sunday,” said Senator of , one of Mr. McCain’s closest advisers, predicting that the talk would be eclipsed by other news. “The big political story is not what President Bush says about himself. It’s how Joe Lieberman explains himself.”Both White House and Republican officials said the choice not to attend the convention in person was Mr. Bush’s. With memories of — an event that many Republicans believe harmed their party — still raw, the president will travel to on Wednesday to inspect storm damage, and was not inclined to leave before the complete effect of the storm was known, aides said.“There was very much a proceed-with-caution approach here,” said Kevin Sullivan, Mr. Bush’s communications director, “that just because things seem to have gone pretty well, let’s not take our eye off the ball.”But Mr. McCain’s team was clearly more interested in using the convention to advance its aims — trying to define Mr. Obama in negative terms and building a positive narrative for Mr. McCain and his running mate, Gov. of — than in looking back at Mr. Bush’s presidency or allowing Mr. McCain to become too closely identified with the president. And it used Mr. Bush to do just that, by laying out some key elements of Mr. McCain’s biography in language intended to rally the Republican base.“Fellow citizens,” the president said at one point, “if the Hilton could not break John McCain’s resolve to do what is best for his country, you can be sure the angry left never will.”Republican officials said they had intended to use Tuesday night to get back on message and recover from the chaos of Monday, when floor action was cut short because of the storm and news coverage was dominated by the announcement that Ms. Palin’s 17-year-old daughter is pregnant. Party officials also tried, unsuccessfully, to recover lost television time, by urging networks to expand evening coverage, which would have captured Mr. Bush’s speech.The evening’s goal was to reintroduce Mr. McCain to the public, through testimonies from people who know him well, including Orson Swindle, a cellmate from Mr. McCain’s days as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, and Mr. Lieberman, who has traveled extensively with Mr. McCain.“You’re going to see the person of John McCain being developed tonight by people who know him intimately,” the party chairman, Mike Duncan, said in an interview. Mr. Lieberman’s job, Mr. Duncan said, was to present the candidate as “John McCain the maverick, the one who gets things done in Washington.”As Republicans try to put the Bush presidency behind them, many feel deeply ambivalent about the man who has occupied the Oval Office for the past eight years, and that sentiment was evident on the convention floor on Tuesday evening. Those here represent the core of the party faithful, the roughly 30 percent of Americans who polling suggests believe that Mr. Bush is doing a good job.“He is our president, and we respect him as our president,” said Lynne Cottrell, a delegate from . “But we are moving forward.”For Mr. Bush, and the extended Bush family, the speech represents a passing of the torch. The president’s parents were at the Center here on Tuesday, a reminder that the nation’s ruling Republican dynasty is out of the family business, at least for now. The United States has had a Bush in the White House as president or vice president for 20 of the past 28 years.In some respects, Mr. Bush’s diminished presence offered a kind of bookend to the 2000 Republican convention in , when Mr. Bush accepted the nomination after a bitter primary fight with Mr. McCain. Mr. McCain spoke in Philadelphia, but only after the Bush camp insisted on approving his speech.Republicans said the McCain camp did not edit or approve the president’s talk on Tuesday night. But there was close coordination between the campaign and the White House about the themes Mr. Bush should sound.Mr. Bush, well aware that a McCain victory would bolster his own legacy, has said all along that he will do whatever Mr. McCain wants, even if it means keeping a low profile or staying out of the senator’s way.Dan Bartlett, Mr. Bush’s former counselor, said the president had “given orders to his staff for there to be maximum flexibility in deference” to the McCain campaign.“He’s a smart politician,” Mr. Bartlett said of Mr. Bush. “He understands what the objective is here.”'"
"'08-09-03,'1','ST. PAUL — Senator Joseph I. Lieberman’s speech to Republicans here on Tuesday night represented the culmination of an improbable path for a politician who just eight years ago was accepting the Democratic nomination for vice president and hailing his party’s nominee, Al Gore, as “a man of courage and conviction.”During that time, Mr. Lieberman came to champion, with Mr. McCain, the American invasion of Iraq, and in doing so was frozen out by liberals in his party and denied renomination as a Democrat to the Senate. He won re-election as an independent, in 2006, and spoke to Republicans on Tuesday portraying himself as a man who transcends party lines.“Dear friends, I’m here because John McCain’s whole life testifies to a great truth: being a Democrat or a Republican is important, but it is nowhere near as important as being an American,” Mr. Lieberman said to cheers, as electronic screens around the convention hall here flashed “Country First,” one of Mr. McCain’s campaign themes.Mr. Lieberman and Mr. McCain have been close friends for more than a dozen years, working together on peace in the Balkans, regulations of gun shows after the Columbine High School shootings and promoting measures to curb carbon emissions. But it was the Iraq war that marked the turning point in Mr. Lieberman’s journey to the McCain camp.His invitation to speak here was largely because of their political kinship as Washington leaders who have often felt uncomfortable in the boundaries of their parties.'"
"'08-09-03,'1','The hedge fund manager Ospraie Management will close its flagship fund after it fell 27 percent in August on losses in energy, mining and natural resources equity holdings, in one of the biggest ever closures of a commodities-focused hedge fund.The closure of the fund, announced Tuesday by the firm’s founder, Dwight Anderson, in a letter to investors, could be more bad news for Lehman Brothers Holdings, which took a 20 percent stake in the hedge fund manager in 2005.“This is just adding to the fire for commodity-related names,” said Peter Holst, managing director at Delta Global Advisors in Southern California. “Even this morning when the market opened, some of the names that Ospraie has positions in were getting hammered.”In the letter, Ospraie Management said it planned to distribute 40 percent of Ospraie Fund’s assets to investors by Sept. 30 and an additional 40 percent by year-end. The remaining 20 percent of the fund’s assets are mostly illiquid and could take up to three years to give back to investors, it said.Based on a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Ospraie Management held shares in companies including Alcoa and Arch Coal. It was not immediately clear which fund held what stocks.Mr. Anderson said in the letter that he was extremely disappointed with the outcome.“Not only as a portfolio manager, but as one of the largest investors in the Ospraie Fund L.P., I have shared in the losses with you,” he wrote. “After nine years of striving to be a good steward of your capital, I am very sorry for this outcome.”He said the decision to close the fund was reached after it breached a threshold that would have allowed investors to redeem their money irrespective of the fund’s lock-up provisions.'"
"'08-09-03,'1','That is likely to be a central element of Mr. McCain’s campaign coming out of the convention, his policy aides here said. But it may be one of the few areas where he and Mr. Bush are on the same page: Mr. McCain plans to call for far more vigorous efforts to reduce dependence on Middle East oil, his senior policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said Tuesday, an area “where I think you’ll see some overlap between our position and the Democrats’.”In describing himself and Mr. McCain as like-minded on Iraq, Mr. Bush was rewriting a good deal of modern history.Mr. McCain’s “early and consistent call,” which began in the fall of 2003, was long dismissed by the White House, which insisted that the president was following the advice of his commanders. Mr. McCain returned from each of his trips to Iraq arguing that the commanders needed more troops, and lambasted Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld as “irresponsible” for urging a quick turnover of the effort to Iraqis.Mr. McCain also claimed that Mr. Bush needed “more details of what’s going on,” depicting him as out of touch with the realities of the war. The two men did not come into rough agreement until Mr. Rumsfeld resigned right after the Congressional elections of November 2006 and Mr. Bush ordered the “surge” that Mr. McCain had demanded.The turnabout in Anbar is particularly important to Mr. McCain now that the political debate over Iraq with Senator Barack Obama has become much more about the past than about the way forward. At the Democratic convention in Denver last week, Mr. Obama repeated his claim that he showed the right judgment when he argued against the invasion to begin with. Mr. McCain has taken the opposite position, arguing in essence that the war would have been successful much earlier had Mr. Bush and Mr. Rumsfeld not resisted sending more troops.Mr. McCain, his aides say, plans to cite the Anbar turnover in campaign stops and during the debates with Mr. Obama. During the Democratic convention, there was virtually no mention of the surge or its tactical successes; instead, Mr. Obama and others talked about engineering a “responsible” withdrawal.But neither Mr. Obama’s aides nor Mr. McCain’s expect the timetable for that withdrawal to be a major issue of disagreement, as it was in the spring.“The fact is that Maliki has declared that at the end of 2011 all American forces should be out,” said one McCain foreign policy adviser, referring to the Iraqi prime minister. “What are we going to argue about? McCain’s supposed to say the troops should be around longer than the Iraqis want them?”'"
"'08-09-03,'1','Mr. McCain has met with small groups of Christian conservatives in pivotal states like Michigan and Ohio — even persuading one Ohio advocate to send a mass e-mail message announcing his switch from “no way” to “I can’t wait” to support Mr. McCain.He used a recent appearance with the Rev. Rick Warren at Saddleback Church in California to embrace opposition to abortion more explicitly than President Bush ever did. Asked when a fetus gains human rights, Mr. McCain responded, “At the moment of conception.”And he has abandoned previous calls to moderate the Republican platform’s support for a ban on abortion without exception. Instead, he allowed conservative organizers like Phyllis Schlafly to shape what many advocates say is the most conservative platform in the party’s history. At Ms. Schlafly’s behest, for example, the party approved an immigration plank calling for new laws to speed widespread deportations and other punitive measures at odds with Mr. McCain’s stance on one of his signature issues.To make up for a history of conflict with the Christian conservative wing of his party, Mr. McCain has in some ways gone further than Mr. Bush to reassure the right of his intentions, even at the risk of spooking more moderate voters.“I am now more confident about a John McCain presidency than I am about a George Bush presidency,” said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. “The campaign has courted conservatives aggressively, and it has turned around remarkably in just the last few weeks.”For skeptical Christian conservatives, Mr. Perkins said, the selection of Ms. Palin was evidence that when it came to the Supreme Court, Mr. McCain would deliver on the principles he laid out at Saddleback Church.The mood of the party’s conservative base may play a pivotal role for Mr. McCain in the fall election, in part because his campaign lags far behind his Democratic opponent, Senator Barack Obama, in assembling paid staff and building get-out-the-vote operations in swing states like Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania, Republican officials in those states say. To make up the difference, Mr. McCain is banking on his personal appeal, dusting off a four-year-old Republican Party operation built around Mr. Bush’s very different candidacy and turning to conservative grass-roots groups.Mr. McCain has been sparring with leaders of the Christian conservative movement since some attacked the 1989 nomination of his friend John G. Tower as defense secretary. Many objected that his campaign finance reforms would hurt their groups. And their opposition hardened when he campaigned in 2000 as the moderate alternative to Mr. Bush — including urging the party to soften its platform’s total opposition to abortion.His early efforts to woo Christian conservatives this year stumbled as well. When he addressed a gathering of the Council for National Policy in New Orleans this year, he made little impression, several participants said. Asked about his own faith, he appeared awkward, repeating stories he often tells about displays of faith he saw as a prisoner in Vietnam — stories, one person present noted, that involved only the beliefs of others.Then, on June 2, the McCain campaign sent a pair of organizers to Ohio to meet with about 40 state-level Christian conservative leaders, hoping to enlist them in the kind of voter turnout efforts they had engaged in for Mr. Bush four years before. But the response was notably cool, several participants said.Phil Burress, head of the Ohio group Citizens for Community Values and a driving force in church-based get-out-the-vote efforts four years ago, had already said publicly that he would do nothing to help the McCain campaign, and he made clear that he left the meeting unconvinced, people present said.McCain aides took notice. Two weeks later, Mr. McCain sat down for an hour with six Christian conservative organizers in Ohio, including Mr. Burress, who grilled him on his views.“For me this election is primarily about the next Supreme Court appointments,” Mr. Burress later wrote in an e-mail message explaining that Mr. McCain had won him over. “John McCain, unlike most politicians, will not be bullied, threatened, paid off or pressured into changing his position.”Colin Hanna, a prominent conservative organizer in Pennsylvania and Ohio said, “The candidate and his brain trust have evidently concluded what we have always held as a given: that he cannot succeed without the enthusiastic support of the conservative base.”In July, when James C. Dobson, the influential founder of Focus on the Family, said on his radio broadcast that he, too, might drop his staunch opposition to a McCain presidency, campaign operatives quickly called to express their thanks and ask Dr. Dobson to meet alone with the candidate, a spokesman for Dr. Dobson said.That conversation has not yet taken place, but on Friday, Dr. Dobson said the Palin selection had persuaded him to endorse Mr. McCain. Dr. Dobson said in a statement that the nomination “gives us confidence he will keep his pledges to voters regarding the kinds of justices he would nominate to the Supreme Court.”In Minneapolis, “it was as if the whole Republican convention had started drinking Red Bull,"" said Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention, who added that when the McCain campaign had sought his input weeks before he had suggested picking Ms. Palin.'"
"'08-09-03,'1','As far as we can tell, Mr. McCain and his aides did almost no due diligence before choosing Ms. Palin, raising serious questions about his management skills. The fact that Ms. Palin’s 17-year-old daughter is pregnant is irrelevant to her candidacy. There are, however, very serious questions about her political past and her ideology, including her links to a party advocating Alaska’s secession from the nation.If Mr. McCain wanted to break with his party’s past and choose the Republicans’ first female presidential candidate, there are a number of politicians out there with far greater experience and stature than Ms. Palin, who has been in Alaska’s Statehouse for less than two years.Before she was elected governor, she was mayor of a tiny suburb, where her greatest accomplishment was raising the sales tax to build a hockey rink. According to Time magazine, she also sought to have books banned from the local library and threatened to fire the librarian.For Mr. McCain to go on claiming that Mr. Obama has too little experience to be president after almost four years in the is laughable now that he has announced that someone with no national or foreign policy experience is qualified to replace him, if necessary.Senator , the South Carolina Republican who has been one of Mr. McCain’s most loyal friends, said Tuesday that he was certain that Ms. Palin would take the right positions on issues like , ’s invasion of and ’s nuclear weapons ambitions. That seemed based largely on his repeated assertion that Ms. Palin would be tended by Mr. McCain’s foreign policy advisers. That was not much of an endorsement.Some of the things Ms. Palin has had to say in the recent past about foreign policy are especially worrisome. In a speech last June to her former church in Wasilla, Ms. Palin said the war in Iraq was “a task that is from God.” Mr. Bush made similar claims as he rejected all sound mortal advice on how to conduct the war.Mr. McCain, Mr. Graham and others also claim that Ms. Palin is a fearless reformer who is committed to fighting waste, fraud and earmarks. Ms. Palin did show courage taking on some of the Alaska ’s most sleazy politicians. But she also was an eager recipient of earmarked money as a mayor and governor.Mayor Palin gathered up $27 million in subsidies from Washington, $15 million of it for a railroad from her town to the resort hometown of Senator , now under indictment for failing to report gifts.The Republicans are presenting Ms. Palin as a crusader against Mr. Stevens’s infamous The record says otherwise; she initially supported Mr. Stevens’s boondoggle, diverting the money to other projects when the bridge became a political disaster. In her speech to the Wasilla Assembly of God in June, Ms. Palin said it was “God’s will” that the federal government contribute to a $30 billion gas pipeline she wants built in Alaska.Mr. McCain will make his acceptance speech on Thursday, and Ms. Palin will speak on Wednesday. Those two appearances will go a long way to forming voters’ views of this Republican ticket.As Senator Graham noted, Mr. McCain has to reach out beyond the party’s loyal base. “We’re going to have to win this thing,” he said. “This is not our race to lose.”Mr. McCain’s hurdles are substantial. To start, he has to overcome Mr. Bush’s record of failures. (The president addressed the convention Tuesday night and now, McCain strategists fervently hope, will retire quietly to the Rose .) That record includes the disastrous war in Iraq, a ballooning deficit, the mortgage crisis — and the list goes on.To address those many problems, this country needs a leader with sound judgment and strong leadership skills. Choosing Ms. Palin raises serious questions about Mr. McCain’s qualifications.'"
"'08-09-03,'1','The match eventually went to a fifth set, and a turning point came when Federer broke Andreev’s serve to take a 2-0 lead. With Federer seemingly in control, the drama returned at 4-2, when Andreev failed to convert on four break points in a game that went to deuce six times.Federer attacked the net, winning 58 of 84 net approaches, including 15 of 19 in the fifth set. Andreev won 12 of his 28 net approaches.Federer attributed his net play to his gold medal victory in doubles at the Olympics. “We don’t have that many guys at the net anymore,” Federer said, adding that after winning last month in Beijing, “I’m a little more confident in that.”But Federer also led in unforced errors, committing 60 to Andreev’s 42.Despite Federer’s record at the Open, skeptics had wondered if he was up to the challenge this year after losing to Rafael Nadal in the finals at Wimbledon and the French Open and after surrendering his No. 1 ranking to Nadal last month.Federer insisted that a five-set match, even given his performance this season, was more fun than stressful. “Being part of these dogfights is fun for me,” he said.Federer will face Gilles Muller of Luxembourg, a qualifier who upset the No. 5 seed, Nikolay Davydenko, in the quarterfinals. Federer laughed when he was asked if he was concerned about Muller because Muller had nothing to lose.“It’s been that way for four and a half years,” Federer said. “This is just a guy who’s got even less to lose.”Djokovic’s victory was also hard-won. After struggling against the 15th-seeded Tommy Robredo in five sets and nearly four hours of play, the third-seeded Djokovic laughed about being unsteady on his feet in a brief courtside interview.“I need to stand next to the net, otherwise I will fall down,” Djokovic said.He prevailed, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3, but only after calling a trainer to examine him for an injured right hip and a turned right ankle. Robredo did not escape unscathed, either, tumbling in the fifth set with the score tied at 2-2.Djokovic advanced to the quarterfinals; he will meet the winner of the Andy Roddick-Fernando González match, which was played Tuesday night.Djokovic said did not feel well when he woke up Tuesday morning, blaming a late-night match Sunday against Marin Cilic. He said adrenaline from the match with Cilic kept him up until 4:30 a.m. on Monday.“I didn’t feel well,” Djokovic said. “The moment I stepped on the court, I felt already, as you said, less energy in the tank.”His claim of multiple ailments drew skepticism from Robredo, who said after the match that he was hurting, too.“I have pain, as well,” Robredo said. “I was running like hell and my feet were burning, but I say nothing, no? I think that if you’re not fit enough, then don’t play.”Robredo seemed to come into his own in the fourth set, breaking serve to tie it at 3-3. The crowd was behind him, cheering his clever shots and booing Djokovic when he threw down his racket in disgust.In the fourth set, Djokovic said he began to doubt himself. “I didn’t know if I was able to continue going on that high level, and he was just getting into the game more and more,” he said.But he somehow found that level and moved into the quarterfinals.If the Djokovic and Federer victories came after long brawls, the Dementieva match ended more predictably. She continued her Olympic bounce by beating Schnyder, 6-2, 6-3. Dementieva won 80 percent of her serves. Schnyder squandered her only chance to take the lead in the second set. After breaking serve to tie the set at 3-3, she failed to hold hers in the next game and Dementieva took the lead.“It was a very, very important moment for me to break her again,” said Dementieva, who will play the No. 2 seed, Jelena Jankovic, in the semifinals. “I’m very happy that I was able to do this.”'"
"'08-09-03,'1','P.& G., Dow Chemical, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, as well as other big users of oil-based raw materials, are waiting to see if oil prices will stay down or continue to fall before they commit to price cuts.“Everybody still feels there is too much uncertainty to be clear about what action they should take,” said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, who specializes in companies that use oil-based raw materials in making a variety of consumer products. “They won’t immediately drop their prices.”Until recently, robust growth in Europe and a seemingly endless thirst for petroleum in China and developing nations lifted global demand for oil, and the price with it. But now some economies, especially in Europe, are weakening almost more rapidly than America’s, lifting the dollar. That should help relieve price pressures over all by making imports — as well as oil prices — cheaper.This uncertainty helps to explain why Dow Chemical, for example, which had raised prices this year by nearly 50 percent for the oil-based raw materials that go into the manufacture of products like diapers and polystyrene, does not want to give up those increases until the company recovers its old profit margins. “Our prices continue to lag our cost increases,” the spokesman, David Winder, said.And Goodyear Tire and Rubber, which has raised tire prices by 15 percent this year, said it was still making synthetic rubber tires from oil-based feed stocks bought at relatively high prices more than three months ago.Keith Price, a Goodyear spokesman, said Goodyear could not consider canceling the price increase until it knew whether oil prices were going to stay down.The decline in oil prices has also dragged the cost of other commodities sharply lower since early summer. Corn, in particular, has slumped: it settled on Tuesday at $5.69 a bushel, down 29 percent since June 27. Soybean prices are down 21 percent in the same period.Despite the steep declines in the cost of raw ingredients, prices for packaged foods sold at supermarkets are likely to remain higher than they were last year, said Ephraim Leibtag, an economist who studies food markets for the Agriculture Department.With oil prices in sharp decline, the nation’s millions of car owners are a little better off. The average price of a gallon of gas settled at $3.68 on Tuesday, down from a record $4.11 in mid-July. “That’s a 43-cent decline,” said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, chief economist for the Ford Motor Company. “It’s almost like a tax cut for consumers.”Just the opposite holds for commuters who travel on the nation’s airlines. The major carriers have pushed through 15 price increases since the beginning of the year, with 11 of them depicted as fuel surcharges. None of the domestic airlines has stated how or when the surcharges might be removed, making them the equivalent of price increases, said Rick Seaney, who runs FareCompare.com, a Web site offering information on plane fares.Like Procter & Gamble, Dow Chemical and Goodyear, the airlines suggest that what they do with fares depends on what happens to the price of oil over the long run.“We would love to see it come down and stay down,” said Betsy E. Talton, a Delta spokeswoman.Interest rates were slightly lower with the rate on the 10-year Treasury note at 3.73 percent, down from 3.81 percent late Friday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rose 21/32, to 102 6/32.Following are the results of Tuesday’s auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:'"

The company needs to raise $2 million by Sept. 10, including $500,000 in cash, to avoid bankruptcy, and $4 million more by the end of the fiscal year in June. Robin Arena, the chairwoman, said she accepted some responsibility for the disarray and also blamed outdated bylaws, a management committee that was “dysfunctional,” ineffective fund-raising and John Toohey, the managing director, for the situation. In August, the company canceled a tour of China because it was short of money. About $700,000 has been raised, but much of that is in pledges. The ballet needs money to pay creditors, make payroll and take care of other expenses.'"
"'08-09-03,'1','ONE of the most bizarre political events I ever attended was the second Democratic nominating convention of 1972. It was held in August at a Washington hotel ballroom, not in a big arena like the Miami Beach Convention Center, where the party had nominated George McGovern for president four weeks earlier.All the elements of a normal convention were there, but in a shrunken condition. There were token delegations from all the states, each with its upright name-standard. The nominating and seconding speeches were delivered, followed by a full roll call, an acclamation and an acceptance speech — delivered by R. Sargent Shriver, who officially became Mr. McGovern’s new running mate. Perfunctory balloons were dropped and a band prodded false cheer from the delegates. This sheepishly formal charade had to be gone through, since the man nominated at the regular convention, Thomas Eagleton, had been forced off the ticket two weeks after winning the nomination.The original ticket was not so far from this year’s Republican pair. Mr. McGovern, the senator from South Dakota, was a decorated (Distinguished Flying Cross) war pilot. His running mate was a young politician (a 42-year-old man) about whom little was known. He had been the youngest attorney general and youngest lieutenant governor of his state (Missouri), but he had served only two-thirds of his first term in the Senate. The McGovern team had not vetted him thoroughly, and he had not told the man at the top of the ticket about a potentially embarrassing fact: he had hospitalized himself three times in the early 1960s for nervous exhaustion, and twice he had been given electroshock therapy — a treatment more common and better regarded at that time than it is now.There should, perhaps, be no prejudice against the healthy practice of seeking therapy, but the prejudice existed then. Mr. McGovern, when the facts came out, tried to stay loyal to his pick, saying he supported him “a thousand percent.” But the talk and rumors and jokes became an insurmountable distraction to the campaign, and the candidate had to ask Senator Eagleton to leave the ticket. Hence the huggermugger conventionette in Washington.The lesson for succeeding races was that a vice presidential candidate should be thoroughly vetted — a lesson apparently neglected by Senator John McCain.Perhaps Senator McCain knew everything that has, with dizzying suddenness, emerged about his vice presidential pick, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska — that she was a director of a political committee in support of Ted Stevens, the Alaska senator now under indictment; an initial supporter of the so-called bridge to nowhere; an appointer of a man who had been officially reprimanded for sexual harassment as the public safety commissioner in Alaska; a mother of an unwed and pregnant 17-year-old; and other things being ferreted out by the minute. But it is an insult to Senator McCain’s intelligence to think even half of these or other matters were known to him before he chose her.Perhaps Senator McGovern should not have deserted Tom Eagleton. Perhaps Senator McCain should stick by Governor Palin. But if he does soldier on with her by his side for a while, will he end up having to call another midget convention like the one that had to be cobbled together to nominate Sargent Shriver? That is hardly in his best interests.'"
"'08-09-03,'1','The K. K. Birla Academy does scientific, historical and cultural research and has been planning a scientific museum. He was the chancellor of Birla Institute of Technology and Science, created by his father in the desert of Rajasthan, expanding it from Goa and Hyderabad to Dubai.He was also a prominent three-term member of the upper house of the Indian Parliament and was close to Indian political leaders like Indira Gandhi, Rajeev Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. Loyal to the Congress Party, which his father helped finance, he had friends across the political spectrum.Born at Pilani in the northwestern Indian state Rajasthan on Nov. 12, 1918, Krishna Kumar Birla was part of India’s leading industrial family, the eldest of the three sons of Maha Devi and Ghanshyam Das Birla, who was a staunch follower of Mohandas Gandhi and a financier of his Congress Party.The younger Mr. Birla earned a B.A. degree in 1939 from Lahore University and went to work the next year to build India’s sugar industry. He quickly expanded the business, acquiring interests in textiles, engineering, shipping and fertilizers.Like his father, he was a visionary and always maintained that it was the duty of industry to contribute to building the nation.His social views were far more progressive than those of most members of his class and generation. A strong believer in equality for women, he broke with family tradition and handed his companies over to his three daughters.With his trademark silver hair, black rimmed spectacles and Savile Row tailoring, he loved to travel with his wife and extended family. He routinely took over a wing of the Grosvenor House hotel when staying in London.He is survived by his daughters Nandini Nopany, Jyoti Poddar and Shobhana Bhartia, who is the vice chairwoman and editorial director of The Hindustan Times, and several grandchildren.He was president of the Bridge Federation of India for a number of years and also headed the Indian Lawn Tennis Association.Punctual and courteous in his business dealings at all levels, he would sometimes schedule meetings of exactly 8 minutes or 12 minutes.Although he was a deeply religious Hindu and a noted patron of temples in Calcutta and Delhi, he never deviated from the path of secularism for the Indian nation.Mr. Birla’s literary achievements included “Indira Gandhi: Reminiscences,” an empathetic and unprejudiced biography, and “Partners in Progress: Collection of Selected Speeches and Writings.” He also chronicled his foreign travels for The Hindustan Times.Mr. Birla’s widely read and critically acclaimed autobiography, “Brushes With History,” was published last December.'"
"'08-09-03,'1','Although “we’re still pretty optimistic about the fall season,” said Jack Hruska, executive vice president for creative services at Bloomingdale’s in New York, “we’re in a tough economy; there’s no denying that.”Still, those retailers “who play up their strengths will emerge stronger when the economy comes back than those who retreat or scale back,” Mr. Hruska added. “We’ve seen that time and time again.”“We’re not foolish; we don’t invest unwisely,” he said, adding: “Our customer has always expected something interesting, a more active environment, from Bloomingdale’s than other retailers. We have to continue to give the customer good reasons, interesting reasons, to come visit us.”At Saks, said Denise Incandela, president of the Saks Direct unit in New York, “we were very excited” with the results of an experiment with a virtual catalog in the spring. Among the highlights was selling out 25 percent of the featured merchandise.“We’re looking for anything that’s going to move the needle,” Ms. Incandela said, “driving outsized growth with innovative initiatives.” The fall version of the Saks virtual catalog is scheduled to be available on Wednesday. The video clips present apparel and shoes from designers like Stacey Bendet, Christian Dior, Salvatore Ferragamo, Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Zac Posen, Brian Reyes and Donatella Versace.There is also advice on hair care, from Frederic Fekkai; makeup, from Bobbi Brown; and fragrances, from Jo Malone. Video catalogs are “closer to simulating the in-store environment” than their paper counterparts, Ms. Incandela said.“For luxury goods, there’s an expectation of a higher level of service,” she added. “This is a way we’re trying to accommodate that.”As for the age profile of online shoppers compared with their in-store counterparts, “our customer is a little bit older,” Ms. Incandela acknowledged, “but we have a younger customer we want to reach out to.”Other such attempts to appeal to youthful shoppers include “an outreach campaign to almost 100 blogs,” she added, and a presence on social media sites like Facebook.Any sales attributable to the virtual catalog, from customers of whatever age, would be welcomed by Saks, which last month reported more red ink for its second quarter. Its net loss rose to $31.7 million, from a net loss of $24.6 million in the comparable quarter the previous year. Revenue fell, to $669.2 million from $694.1 million, and a widely followed measure of retail health, known as same-store sales, fell too, by 4 percent.At Macy’s Inc., there was black ink in the second quarter, the company reported last month, but less than the same quarter a year ago ($73 million compared with $74 million). Revenue declined, to $5.7 billion from $5.9 billion, and same-store sales declined as well, by 2.1 percent.At both Saks Direct and Bloomingdale’s, plans for the fall campaigns predate the current economic conditions. At Bloomingdale’s, Mr. Hruska said, the development of the music campaign began not long after the completion last fall of a campaign that was focused on art.The music campaign includes print advertisements, e-mail messages, catalogs, the bloomingdales.com Web site, shopping bags and window displays. There will be live performances by musicians and bands in stores. And Bloomingdale’s will sell CDs and DVDs by artists who are distributed by the Sony Music Label Group division of Sony BMG Music Entertainment.An inspiration for the music campaign, Mr. Hruska said, was the recent fashion trend for clothing inspired by rock ’n’ roll like “rocker T-shirts, skinny pants, leather and siren skirts.” But many other musical genres will also be part of the campaign, among them jazz, show tunes, pop and classical.For example, among the artists whose music will be sold by Bloomingdale’s will be Joshua Bell, Teddy Geiger, Wyclef Jean and Cyndi Lauper.There are also plans for music to be an integral part of the Bloomingdale’s Christmas campaign, which is scheduled to start Nov. 20.Partners for the fall campaign include, in addition to Sony Music and the instrument makers, the Infiniti division of the Nissan Motor Company. For instance, Bloomingdale’s will offer customers a chance to win a 2009 Infiniti FX50 that is already equipped with 1,000 songs from the Sony Music library.“We are looking for ways that are nontraditional to reach the hearts and minds of our customers,” said Ben Poore, vice president for marketing at Infiniti in Franklin, Tenn.“There’s a really good fit between Bloomingdale’s and us, starting with the customer base,” he added.'"
"'08-09-03,'1','JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli agents who kidnapped the Nazi mastermind Adolf Eichmann from Argentina in 1960 found the notorious death camp doctor Josef Mengele but let him get away, one of the operatives said Tuesday.The operative, Rafi Eitan, now an 81-year-old Israeli cabinet minister, said that he and other Mossad agents located Mengele in a Buenos Aires apartment with his wife at the time of Eichmann’s capture in 1960. But the operatives decided that trying to seize him would risk sabotaging the capture of Eichmann, who was being held in a safe house before being whisked out of the country.Mr. Eitan’s comments indicated that the Israelis were closer to Mengele than had been previously thought and shed light on why they decided to abandon an attempt to catch him.“When you have one operation, you’re taking a certain level of risk,” he said. “If you’re doing a second operation at the same time, you double the risk not only for the second operation but for the first one, as well.”'"
"'08-09-03,'1','Russian leaders fanned out across the region for talks in neighboring countries, acting swiftly to try to consolidate Russia’s position, even as Vice President Dick Cheney left Washington on Tuesday on a trip to Azerbaijan, Ukraine and Georgia, former Soviet republics that have strong ties to the United States.Mr. Putin, in Uzbekistan, announced an agreement to build a new natural gas pipeline to Russia from Central Asia, frustrating European and American efforts to ship oil and gas directly to the West. A Western-backed pipeline project, Nabucco, is now in doubt, as it would have to pass close to South Ossetia.Over all, Moscow greeted the European warning as a victory. The Baltic nations, Poland and Britain had pushed for concrete sanctions, but the European leaders agreed on only one measure, a threat to postpone talks on a strategic partnership with Russia, combined with the written reproach.Mr. Medvedev made it clear that he was stung by the criticism from Europe, which condemned Russia’s actions as “a disproportionate response” to a Georgian attack on separatists in South Ossetia. Asked whether the conflict was headed to a cold-war-type standoff, he cast Russia as the aggrieved party and referred pointedly to the Bush administration’s plan to place a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic.“I would like our respected partners to pay attention to the fact that we are not the ones broadening the borders of military presence, it’s NATO,” he said. “We are not the ones creating new bases, it’s NATO. We are not deploying the missile defense system, it’s NATO.”“We were in constant dialogue” about the planned missile defense system, he said. “We asked why we needed it. But since the decision has been made, if the radar is going to be turned on, we have to respond to this. Because we got no reasonable explanation of why it was done.”The long-simmering conflict in Georgia escalated quickly on Aug. 8, soon after Georgian troops attacked the capital of the separatist enclave of South Ossetia.Moscow, which has long supported the separatists, responded by sending troops deep into Georgian territory, saying it was necessary to protect its citizens. Although South Ossetia is within Georgia’s borders, many people there carry Russian passports.Last week, Russia formally recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia, a second separatist area on the Black Sea coast, as independent states. So far, no other country has followed suit. Though Russia has withdrawn most of its forces, peacekeeping troops remain in a “buffer zone” outside the enclaves, which France says is a violation of the agreement.On Tuesday, Russia made it clear that its military remained on alert. Officials in Moscow said Georgians were rebuilding their ruined positions near South Ossetia, and Mr. Putin suggested that the United States was shipping military supplies to Georgia under the guise of humanitarian aid.“Why is it necessary to deliver humanitarian aid on military vessels?” asked Mr. Putin, in Tashkent for talks with the Uzbek president, Islam A. Karimov. “And on ships that are armed with modern missile systems?”On Sunday, Mr. Putin was in the Far East checking on the construction of a trans-Siberian oil pipeline to China, emphasizing that Russia could find alternative export markets to Europe.On Tuesday came the announcement of the new Central Asian pipeline, which would carry 900 billion to 1 trillion cubic feet of gas per year and run parallel to the Soviet-era pipeline system, called Central Asia-Center.'"
"'08-09-03,'1','And second, what does it say about John McCain’s judgment that he knowingly asked a parent in this situation to be his running mate, without apparent consideration for the effect that this would necessarily have on her family, and particularly on those members of her family most in need? What does this say about John McCain’s cynicism?What does all this say about the commitment to family values so loudly endorsed by so many McCain supporters?It was good that Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska and her husband, Todd, issued a statement that brought their daughter’s pregnancy out in the open.I am rather perturbed with those on the left who would try to use this information to attack Governor Palin.I believe that families ought to be off limits in political campaigns. The reality is that all families face problems, including problems like teenage pregnancy.I praise Ms. Palin and her husband for their love and support of their daughter in this difficult matter.I love how the pregnancy of Sarah Palin’s daughter is, according to John McCain’s campaign, “a private family matter.” This, after the Republican Party has spent 30 years making policy on women’s bodies. Why can’t Republicans recognize that reproductive decisions are private for all American women?In John McCain’s first major decision as a presidential candidate, instead of appointing the running mate he wants, he caves in to the religious right and appoints someone he doesn’t know and barely vetted.This is not the action of a “maverick,” this is toadyism plain and simple.If this decision represents how he will run the country, it tells me all I need to know about Mr. McCain. Pam ArnoldI agree with Barack Obama and John McCain that the news that the daughter of Gov. Sarah Palin is pregnant is not per se relevant to Governor Palin’s credentials to be vice president.But her lack of significant qualifications and experience with respect to national public policy, her relatively limited education, her lack of international engagement and her rejection of science in various arenas are.Given that Governor Palin is willing to impose her views on private family matters on others, in terms of her opposition to abortion and her commitment to abstinence-only sex education, it is legitimate to question such a parent’s responsibilities to her children.In pursuing the vice-presidential nomination, was Ms. Palin willing to put her ambitions ahead of the interests of her daughter? Surely she knew that her nomination would bring worldwide attention to her daughter’s pregnancy.Is this a positive example of commitment to family values? Gayle BinionThe writer is a professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara.Re “A New Twist in the Debate Over Mothers” (front page, Sept. 2):As a 74-year-old mother of five children, including a special-needs child, I am uniquely qualified to evaluate Gov. Sarah Palin’s ability to “do it all.”Ms. Palin’s primary responsibility and moral obligation is to give all of her children the attention they deserve and only a mother can provide.It is my belief that running for vice president of the United States does not serve this obligation well. I have read and listened to various political pundits marvel at her ability to “do it all.” The honest truth is she can’t. Trust me, I know. Myrna OlsenMommy wars may seem like a hot story, but the media would serve us better by focusing on the debate over what parents need to manage work and family.How Gov. Sarah Palin and her family handle these matters is their business. But it’s the business of voters to know why Ms. Palin and Senator John McCain oppose every measure that would help working families: guaranteeing paid sick days, making family leave more accessible and affordable, ensuring equal pay, financing health insurance for needy kids.Yes, many families have to deal with teenage pregnancy. Fewer would if schools provided comprehensive sex education.Yet the McCain-Palin ticket supports abstinence-only education, despite Congressional reports documenting its ineffectiveness. Nearly $180 million in taxpayer dollars was wasted on such programs last year.Our families and our country can’t afford such extreme positions.The writer is an author and activist for working women.“A New Twist in the Debate Over Mothers” includes comments by women who question Sarah Palin’s ability to be an adequate mother of five children while serving as vice president of the United States. Haven’t we had presidents and vice presidents before who raised children at the same time?Bill Clinton was president while a parent of Chelsea, who was still young. Richard Nixon’s girls were still young in the White House. This is not a rare event.If Governor Palin is elected, her husband (a commercial fisherman) is unlikely to hold a job and thus it seems that Vice President Palin would not need to be an equal contributor to child care. Her husband could certainly be the primary parent.The writer is the author of “The Case Against Women Raising Children: Why the Mother Should Never Be the Primary Care-Giver.”Gov. Sarah Palin has said she decided to carry to term her child who has Down syndrome. Of her daughter’s premarital pregnancy, she also says, “We’re proud of Bristol’s decision to have her baby.”But how can one claim to be anti-choice and twice speak about “decisions”? A true pro-life candidate must believe that there is no choice but to bear the child, and that the law should bar any such decisions to the contrary.Indeed, if the governor learned of her own child’s Down syndrome from prenatal testing, is it not hypocrisy to ever have such a test since the fetus has a right to life regardless?Perhaps Governor Palin is, in fact, a proponent of choice after all.'"
"'08-09-03,'1','Arcalyst, also known as rilonacept or IL-1 Trap, was approved in February as a treatment for a group of extremely rare inflammatory diseases called cryopirin-associated periodic syndromes, which can cause fevers, chills and joint pain. Each weekly injection costs about $5,000, so it would be prohibitively expensive for doctors to use Arcalyst off-label to treat gout. The company is expecting sales of about $10 million this year for the medicine, which is its first drug to reach the market.Regeneron, which is based in Tarrytown, N.Y., has said it would sharply reduce the price if the drug were to win approval as a treatment for a more common condition like gout.Gout occurs when uric acid builds up in the blood to the point where it can no longer stay in solution. It forms crystals that lodge in the joints, often of the big toe.Patients can take drugs, particularly one called allopurinol, to reduce the level of uric acid and eventually eliminate symptoms of gout. But for reasons not fully understood, the effect of such treatment over the first several months is to increase the risk of gout’s flaring up.“People may actually sense they are getting worse before they are getting better, and to some extent it’s true,” said Dr. John S. Sundy, an associate professor at Duke who has gotten research support and consulting fees from Regeneron. That discourages many patients from starting treatment to reduce uric acid levels.The Arcalyst clinical trial was intended to see if the drug could prevent flare-ups, which can last up to 10 days, in patients starting treatment with allopurinol.Only 14.6 percent of the patients who received Arcalyst experienced a flare-up over the 12 weeks of the trial, and none had more than one flare-up. Among those treated with a placebo, 45.2 percent had at least one flare-up, and many of them had more than one.The mean number of flare-ups per patient was 0.15 with Arcalyst and 0.79 with placebo, an 81 percent reduction.Arcalyst works by blocking the action of an inflammatory protein called interleukin-1.'"
"'08-09-03,'1','The Museum of the Confederacy may be facing the limitations of that position. Annual attendance, from a 1991 peak of 91,000, has been dropping, to about 48,000 in the last year. Its 1976 building, like the adjacent White House, is also hemmed in by a growing hospital complex. So the institution has put together an ambitious $15 million plan to create a system of four museums in historic Virginia areas, increasing display space for its extensive collection.The American Civil War Center, which raised $13.6 million before opening in 2006 to much praise, has fewer apparent problems, though attendance is still low (about 25,000 in the past year). It creates a broader panorama, offering not one perspective but three: those of the Union, the Confederacy and the African-Americans.Such retellings are proliferating, perhaps in anticipation of the 150th anniversary of the war’s start, in 2011. A new visitor center recently opened next to the Gettysburg battlefield in Pennsylvania, and this fall the New-York Historical Society presents an exhibition about Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee that it is modifying from a show first mounted by the Virginia Historical Society, shifting the Southern perspective northward.An empathetic exposition of the Confederate perspective poses some knotty problems. Confederate symbols are more than mere artifacts. The flag was the badge of segregationists in the civil rights era; it retains that resonance. Sensitivities to such allusions are high: a controversy erupted recently over the American Civil War Center’s acceptance of a statue of Davis donated by the Sons of Confederate Veterans.The Museum of the Confederacy, then, has a daunting task. It was founded in the 1890s by the daughters of Lee and Davis and other women, who solicited memorabilia from Confederate families to create a nostalgic shrine to what was then called the Lost Cause. During the last two decades the museum has been delicately redefining itself. It has an extraordinary collection of 15,000 artifacts and 100,000 manuscripts. It has become a scholarly resource and has published valuable books like “Before Freedom Came: African-American Life in the Antebellum South.”But whiffs of the Old South still emerge here and there, particularly in its main exhibition, “The Confederate Years.” For example, in describing the war’s opening battle at Fort Sumter in Charleston, S.C., the wall text oddly states that because Lincoln was determined not to begin the war against the seceding South, he “succeeded in maneuvering the Confederacy into firing the first shot of the war.”There is also little discussion of slavery before or during the Confederacy. Instead there is a short display titled “Confederate Preparation for War: Mobilizing the African-American Population.” This mobilization called up “tens of thousands of African-American laborers” described as both “enslaved and free.” This is so peculiar a reference to a society in which, in 1860, one-third of the South’s population — 3,950,511 souls — was enslaved, that it seems deluded or obfuscatory. The exhibition’s refusal to illuminate fully the lives of the Confederacy’s black inhabitants (during the war more than a half-million fled to freedom in the North) suggests that an embrace of the Lost Cause has not been fully relinquished.The other flaw is the museum’s almost exclusive attention to the war and the lives of soldiers. But an exhibition on Virginia and the Confederacy on the museum’s lower level is far more frank about slavery and demonstrates how powerful a truly complete portrait of Confederate society might one day be, perhaps even showing the strains on the very institutions — plantations and slavery —that secession was meant to protect.Despite such limitations, the museum sheds light on a dark time. The Confederacy fully believed it was fighting a second American Revolution. Davis spoke of “the holy cause of constitutional liberty.” Slavery and associated attitudes were so commonplace that they were taken for granted. But some similarities appear between the Union and the Confederacy: each saw itself as heir to the nation’s founders; each saw the other as tyrannical.For the South, the cost of these convictions was particularly high. The museum’s chronological accounts of battles; its displays of uniforms with faded blood spots, of Lee’s battlefield tent, of a blood-stained letter written by a dying soldier to his father — all this reveals something touchingly human. The only problem is that you never come to grasp precisely why these men were sacrificing their lives.For greater understanding you must go to the American Civil War Center, housed in the historic Tredegar Iron Works that once supplied the Confederacy with much weaponry. A scrupulous timeline, along with artifacts (some lent by the Museum of the Confederacy), chronicles the economic impact of slavery, debates about secession, westward expansion, the North’s mixed motives, the Emancipation Proclamation, General Sherman’s onslaught, the flawed Reconstruction, the evolving modern nation.There are times when the tell-all-sides pose becomes intrusive, particularly since competing ideological positions are strangely called Union, Home and Freedom. Their initials — U, H and F — confusedly dot maps of battles. There are times, too, when the narrative strains to reassure the advocates of Home (the South): in one film an actor irrelevantly points out that although the North lacked slavery, it did have children working inhumanly long hours in factories, so no side had a “monopoly on virtue.”But you do get a valuable sense of how differing perspectives intertwine. The evolution of Lincoln’s pragmatic stance toward emancipation, for example, is subtly illuminated.If anything, the museum’s tale is too sweepingly abstract; it is so preoccupied with multiple perspectives that it does not provide a strong sense of the people who embodied them. And while the framework of multiple poses is intended to reassure local constituencies, the museum works not because it offers different historical narratives but because it creates out of many, one.Both institutions also inadvertently provide lessons on the limits of relativism. Yes, the Confederacy is a part of American history that needs to be better understood, and slavery and race should not be the only windows through which it is viewed. But another kind of judgment is also needed here. Much depends on whether we view the Civil War as the apocalyptic end of a roseate past or the bloody beginning of a promising future. And that is what contemporary controversies over the Civil War are all about.'"
"'08-09-03,'1','There is a game within a game going on. Before oil was discovered in the United Arab Emirates in 1958, the families ruling the kingdoms of Abu Dhabi and Dubai — the Nahyans and the Maktoums — amused themselves with competitive falconry. They still do falconry, and the families today are somewhat intermarried, but in recent years Abu Dhabi has felt overshadowed by the more entrepreneurial and flamboyant rulers of Dubai, who have turned it into a Middle Eastern mecca for global business.Despite commanding more than 9 percent of the world’s oil supply, Abu Dhabi has sometimes seemed jealous of Dubai’s ability to draw attention to itself, in part by creating a hub in the Middle East for prestigious sporting events.As the Emirates get richer, Western entrepreneurs who bought into British soccer on the expectation of making money are finding that they cannot keep up. That is why most experts in the field say that it is only a matter of time before the American sports entrepreneurs who control Liverpool, Tom Hicks, who owns the Texas Rangers, and George N. Gillett Jr., owner of the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League, cut their losses and sell the club to the persistent bidders from Dubai.As for Abu Dhabi, it accrues a yearly cash surplus exceeding $50 billion. Its sovereign economic fund, the Abu Dhabi United Group, is, by most outside estimates, worth a trillion dollars, and rising. It has a 7 percent stake in Citigroup. It invests in Ferrari and General Motors. And among its other projects is a new campus opening in 2010 that will become a branch of New York University and a $1 billion museum modeled on the Louvre in Paris.It is debatable that none of those achieved the same global headlines as the takeover of Manchester City, and hours later the team’s signing of Robinho, a Brazilian world star from Real Madrid, for 32.5 million pounds ($58.6 million). Hours before that midnight deal in Madrid, Chelsea, the London club owned by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, was trying to tie up a $50 million deal for the same player.Mr. Abramovich has already spent five times that sum on Chelsea’s team after rescuing the club from indebtedness five years ago. Mr. Abramovich never talks publicly about his motives, or complains publicly when, for example, he unloads players — as he did with Andrei Shevchenko to A.C. Milan and Shaun Wright-Phillips to Manchester City for a fraction of the $100 million he spent on them.He knows, as most of the entrepreneurs must, that buying into soccer is a financial loser. Mohamed al-Fayed, the Egyptian owner of Harrods, the London department store, who became the first foreigner to buy an English team, Fulham, in 1997, also says it is impossible to make money owning a club.That is despite the $5.3 billion that the 20 clubs share from television rights in the league’s current three-year contract. As quickly as the money trickles in, it seeps out on multimillion-dollar contracts to acquire some of the world’s best players.So why do so many rich foreigners invest in English soccer?Mr. Abramovich bought the Chelsea team at a time when one or two other Russian oligarchs were being locked up in Moscow jails. In buying Manchester City, Thaksin Shinawatra, the former Thai prime minister, bought a way of keeping himself in the public eye in England, where he seeks asylum before his desired return to Thailand.By contrast, the Glazer family that borrowed the money to buy Manchester United and the two American owners of Liverpool made what they thought were sound investments in an English sport they believed could be more profitably marketed.But many years ago, when Gianni Agnelli, the chairman of the Fiat empire in Italy, bought world famous players for his team Juventus, he conceded that it was a frivolous pleasure that had became addictive.He preferred it to buying paintings to lock away in a vault or racehorses or acquiring more property than he could manage. “I spend more than I should, in time and money,” he once said. “But I find it compelling.”'"

"'08-09-03,'1','Members of the machinists’ union at the Boeing Company are set to cast two votes on Wednesday that will determine whether they accept a new contract or strike the aircraft maker at a crucial moment in the development of its newest plane, the Dreamliner.The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers is urging 27,000 workers in Kansas, Oregon and Washington State to reject Boeing’s latest contract offer, made last week. It also is asking workers to vote in favor of a strike.Even if the contract is rejected, two-thirds of those voting must agree to a walkout in order for one to occur. If that happens, the strike against Boeing would begin at 3:01 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on Thursday.Boeing workers have followed the recommendations of union leaders in three of the last four contract talks. In the most recent negotiations, workers struck Boeing for a month in 2005. They did not agree to a walkout in 2002, however.The negotiations, now in recess, have been taking place in Seattle as Boeing prepares for the first test flight later this year of the 787, known as the Dreamliner. The plane, already more than a year late, is a long-range jet for which Boeing has already received about 900 orders. With innovations like a lightweight composite airframe and more fuel-efficient engines, the 787 can fly farther on less fuel.The plane has been delayed three times, because of problems with suppliers, and analysts said each additional day that it is pushed back would cost Boeing about $100 million.'"
"'08-09-03,'1','But on a night when Republicans gave top billing to other speakers, the president’s physical distance from the gathering in St. Paul — his huge image was beamed out over an empty lectern to a crowd in the arena that cheered mostly at mentions of Mr. McCain — also underscored the gulf between the Bush and the McCain camps.If the subplot of the Democratic convention in Denver was the lingering resentment between Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, the undercurrent here is the longstanding tension between Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain, and Mr. McCain’s efforts to distance himself politically from the man he hopes to succeed.Though Mr. McCain campaigned diligently for Mr. Bush in 2004, the senator was seared by their clash during the 2000 presidential primaries, and Tuesday night brought their complex relationship full circle, with Mr. Bush symbolically handing over the party to Mr. McCain.Mr. Bush did not command the hour being broadcast on national network television, which began with a video tribute to a far more popular Republican president, Reagan, and included an old photograph of Reagan with a young member of Congress, Mr. McCain. It was left to Laura Bush, the first lady, to recount what the White House views as her husband’s accomplishments — his education bill, his global AIDS program, his religion-based initiative, his conservative Supreme Court appointees.Then came the red-meat portion of the program with former Senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee rallying the crowd with sharp attacks on Mr. Obama, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat turned independent who came close to being Mr. McCain’s running mate, making an impassioned argument that Mr. McCain transcends partisanship.“What, after all, is a Democrat like me doing at a Republican convention like this?” Mr. Lieberman asked. “The answer is simple. I’m here to support John McCain because country matters more than party.”While Mr. Bush did not explicitly criticize Mr. Obama, Mr. Lieberman did, over the war in Iraq — the issue that binds him to Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush.“When others wanted to retreat in defeat from the field of battle, when Barack Obama was voting to cut off funding for our troops on the ground, John McCain had the courage to stand against the tide of public opinion and support the surge,” Mr. Lieberman said, “and because of that, today, our troops are at last beginning to come home, not in failure, but in honor.”Mr. McCain’s allies said they hoped Mr. Lieberman’s journey from 2000 Democratic vice-presidential candidate to staunch McCain supporter — with its message of transcending partisanship — would be the story of the night, an even more powerful moment than the appearance at the 2004 Republican convention by Senator Zell Miller of Georgia, a Democrat who turned on his own party.“I don’t think we’re going to be talking about President Bush’s speech Sunday,” said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Mr. McCain’s closest advisers, predicting that the talk would be eclipsed by other news. “The big political story is not what President Bush says about himself. It’s how Joe Lieberman explains himself.”Both White House and Republican officials said the choice not to attend the convention in person was Mr. Bush’s. With memories of Hurricane Katrina — an event that many Republicans believe harmed their party — still raw, the president will travel to Louisiana on Wednesday to inspect storm damage, and was not inclined to leave Washington before the complete fallout of the storm was known, aides said.“There was very much a proceed-with-caution approach here,” Kevin Sullivan, Mr. Bush’s communications director, said, “that just because things seem to have gone pretty well, let’s not take our eye off the ball.”But Mr. McCain’s team was clearly more interested in using the convention to advance their aims — trying to define Mr. Obama in negative terms and building a positive narrative for Mr. McCain and his new running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska — than in looking back at Mr. Bush’s presidency or allowing Mr. McCain to become too closely identified with the president. And they used Mr. Bush to do just that, by laying out some key elements of Mr. McCain’s biography in language intended to rally the Republican base.“Fellow citizens,” the president said at one point, “if the Hanoi Hilton could not break John McCain’s resolve to do what is best for his country, you can be sure the angry left never will.”Republican officials said they intended to use Tuesday night to get back on message and recover from the chaos of Monday, when floor action was cut short because of the storm and media coverage was dominated by the news that the 17-year-old daughter of Ms. Palin is pregnant. Party officials were also trying, so far unsuccessfully, to recover lost television time, by persuading networks to expand evening coverage, which would have captured Mr. Bush’s speech.The evening’s specific goal was to reintroduce Mr. McCain to the public, through testimonies from people who know him well, including Orson Swindle, a cellmate from Mr. McCain’s days as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, and Mr. Lieberman, who has traveled extensively with Mr. McCain.“You’re going to see the person of John McCain being developed tonight by people who know him intimately,” the party chairman, Mike Duncan, said in an interview. Mr. Lieberman’s job, he said, was to present the candidate as “John McCain the maverick, the one who gets things done in Washington.”As Republicans try to put the Bush presidency behind them, many feel deeply ambivalent about the man who has occupied the Oval Office for the past eight years, and that sentiment was evident on the convention floor on Tuesday evening. Those here represent the core of the party faithful, the roughly 30 percent of Americans who polling suggests believe that Mr. Bush is doing a good job.“He is our president, and we respect him as our president,” said Lynne Cottrell, a delegate from Colorado. “But we are moving forward.”For Mr. Bush, and the extended Bush family, the speech represents a passing of the torch. The president’s parents were at the Xcel Energy Center here on Tuesday — a reminder that the nation’s United States’ ruling Republican dynasty is out of the family business, at least for now. The United States has had a Bush in the White House as president or vice president for 20 of the past 28 years; soon, the Bush clan will include two former presidents.In some respects, Mr. Bush’s diminished presence offered a kind of bookend to the 2000 Republican convention in Philadelphia, when Mr. Bush accepted the nomination after a bitter primary fight with Mr. McCain. Mr. McCain spoke in Philadelphia, but only after the Bush camp insisted on approving his speech.Republicans said the McCain camp did not edit or approve the president’s talk on Tuesday night. But there was close coordination between the campaign and the White House about the themes Mr. Bush should sound.Mr. Bush, well aware that a McCain victory would bolster his own legacy, has said all along that he will do whatever Mr. McCain wants — even if it means keeping a low profile or staying out of the senator’s way. Dan Bartlett, Mr. Bush’s former counselor, said the president had “given orders to his staff for there to be maximum flexibility in deference” to the McCain campaign.“He’s a smart politician,” Mr. Bartlett said. “He understands what the objective is here.”'"
"'08-09-03,'1','Shares on Wall Street turned negative Tuesday afternoon after the Dow Jones industrial average soared more than 200 points in morning trading after a decline in oil prices.The gains were erased by the afternoon after shares of energy companies fell sharply, as investors bet that falling oil prices could hurt refineries and oil giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron. The Dow closed down 26.63 points, to 11,516.92, while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropped about 0.41 percent or 5.25 points to 1,277.58. The Nasdaq declined 18.28 points, or 0.77 percent, to 2,349.24The drop in oil prices dragged down the entire commodities sector, and initially lifted the stock markets as investors hoped that cheaper energy could nudge up consumer spending.Crude oil futures fell to just over $105 a barrel in early trading, a five-month low, on Tuesday morning before climbing back slightly. Some investors had been concerned that Hurricane Gustav would disrupt refinery activity and oil supply chains in the Gulf Coast, but the storm passed over much of the region’s energy infrastructure.“The storm, thank God, was not as bad as initially thought,” said Tom Bentz, an energy analyst at BNP Paribas in New York, which led investors to sell off their bets that the price of oil would move higher. Oil declined $5.75 to settle at $109.71 a barrel.'"

"'08-09-04,'0','Cherry, a male pit bull terrier, is so terrified of people that he won’t walk on a leash. He just prostrates himself and refuses to budge, so he has to be carried everywhere. Later, when he is finally persuaded to take short walks, he skulks, pressing himself against the nearest wall or fence, as if trying to be invisible.What could traumatize a dog to that degree? Maybe you’ve heard the name Michael Vick.“Saving the Michael Vick Dogs,” the two-hour season premiere of “DogTown,” Friday night on the National Geographic Channel, explores Cherry’s experience and offers some reassurance to dog lovers that good is being done for him and other dogs like him. The show does not deal at great length with Mr. Vick’s crimes, except to show black-and-white film of dogfights (not graphic but still upsetting), and the back story is crucial to putting this episode in perspective.You don’t have to read the sports pages to know who Mr. Vick is. Or used to be. Star quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons, looking at $130 million in paychecks over the next decade, not counting the product-endorsement money. A man, still in his 20s, who had the world on a string — and certainly didn’t need to moonlight to make ends meet. Yet he decided, for fun and profit, to force dogs to fight, sometimes to the death, in an operation he called Bad Newz Kennels. And someone at Bad Newz decided to hang, shoot, drown or electrocute animals that didn’t meet expectations.“DogTown” follows the progress of 4 of the 50 or so dogs rescued from Mr. Vick’s Virginia property. Cherry’s pathological shyness and fear leads trainers to believe he was used as a bait dog. Meryl (the dogs’ names are all new, given after their rescue) is deemed “too aggressive to ever leave DogTown,” a shelter on a 3,700-acre animal sanctuary and rehabilitation center in Utah. Denzel, who arrives very sick, has a parasite that can be contracted from deep puncture wounds.Georgia is covered in scars and has clearly been bred repeatedly, leading trainers to believe that she was a champion fighter whose puppies would have been extremely valuable. All of Georgia’s teeth are gone: DogTown workers concluded after taking X-rays that the teeth were pulled by a veterinarian, probably to prevent Georgia from attacking the male dog during forced breeding.The series is something of an advertisement for Best Friends Animal Society, which operates DogTown, where the 22 toughest cases from Bad Newz Kennels were sent. This particular episode also is meant to demonstrate the lovability of pit bulls, a breed that its admirers consider unfairly maligned.As the aggressive Meryl jumps playfully through tires and runs happily through agility-course tunnels, the terrified Cherry plays with another dog for the first time, and the fighter Georgia cuddles a giant stuffed animal, that point of view appears justified. And the capacity for healing, from even the most devastating damage, takes a bow.'"

"'08-09-04,'0','But at the end of the Gulf War, at the moment of his greatest achievement, George Bush did not ask our acclaim for himself. He gave all the credit to America's sons and daughters who were the force behind Desert Storm.Our victory in the Gulf also provided the President and the American people an opportunity to say to the veterans of another war, for whom there were no parades, ""welcome home, job well done."" Those of us who fought in Vietnam will be forever grateful.The American people stood with the President as he resisted the violent ambitions of Saddam Hussein. The Democrats, the one's who claim to be political visionaries, were the President's only critics. Angered at being proven so utterly wrong, they now seek to re-write the history of the President's finest hour. Lacking the courage of what few convictions they have, they attack the President to hide their own mistakes.Such is the typical arrogance of liberals who, when they find themselves yet again in opposition to the people's will, always respond, ""we know better than the people."" When they fail to convince us, they belittle us. They dismiss the President's accomplishments abroad as irrelevant to our nation's well-being, and not worthy of debate in the elections. Tell that to the veterans of Desert Storm.Does Bill Clinton believe that the liberation of Eastern Europe, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the democratization of our own hemisphere, this global triumph of freedom have no consequences for Americans?George Bush, tested in crisis and under fire, has helped secure a world in which our children need not sleep with the fear of nuclear annihilation; in which war will not so frequently claim the best of American generations; in which the American taxpayers' resources need not be drained to defend ourselves from hostile superpowers; in which nations can share the common values of free societies, and pursue together peace and prosperity.With President Bush, we have a leader who demonstrates courage in action and leaves the false heroics to others. You cannot lead as courageously as George Bush has led us without a vision worthy of our great civilization. His vision is our vision -- it is our faith in an idea, an idea which has now overcome the greatest tyrants in history.Someone once defined genius as knowing one big thing. Such is the source of America's genius.For when the Berlin Wall was breached, and communism quickly collapsed, we Americans were overjoyed but we were not entirely surprised, because we Americans knew one big thing -- we knew that walls are made of impermanent things, but the will to freedom is eternal.There is a quote by the great writer, William Faulkner, which I have always admired. ""I decline to accept the end of man,"" he wrote. ""I believe that man will not merely endure, he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul of spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance.""Today, on every continent, Faulkner's hopeful creed has been affirmed. Nearly half a billion people have emerged from communism and authoritarianism into a new age of enlightenment. No nation has contributed more to the global success of liberty than America. And no President has served this noble cause with greater courage and wisdom than President George Bush.Permit me now to call the roll of nations which began their advance from tyranny to freedom since George Bush became the leader of the free world: Afghanistan, Albania, Angola, Armenia, Belarus, Benin, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Chile, Congo, Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Estonia, Ethiopia, Georgia, Hungary, Khazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Kuwait, Latvia, Lithuania, Muldova, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Panama, Paraguay, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, South Africa, Ukraine and Zambia.Bill Clinton and his party would have us believe that the Iron Curtain collapsed by accident. Tell that to the American people who have always had faith that their beliefs, values and unwavering love of freedom would someday prevail in the world.Tell that to America's veterans. They know, better than most, that the triumph of freedom in the world today is a direct consequence of the blood shed by their compatriots on battlefields too numerous to mention. And they know it is the consequence of resolute American leadership, leadership of the quality provided by President George Bush and Ronald Reagan.No, it is no accident that thousands of Kuwaiti children born since February 1991 bear the name George. It is no accident that China's brave students raised a statue of liberty in Tianenman Square to signify their common cause with the glorious cause that was the American revolution.And it was no accident when a young Czech worker stood above a Prague Square, before a million of his countrymen, and read with simple dignity a manifesto -- a manifesto that declared a new day for the peoples of Eastern Europe. But he began that new day with borrowed words, when, trembling with emotion, he proclaimed, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights' among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""In America we celebrate the virtues of the quiet hero; the modest man who does his duty without complaint or expectation of praise; the man who listens closely for the call of his country, and when she calls, he answers without reservation -- not for fame or reward, but for love. He loves his country.Tonight, my friends, we come to celebrate such a man, and bestow upon him the greatest honor our party is empowered to grant -- our nomination for the President of the United States. But our purpose is not only to give tribute to this man -- though a fitting tribute it is. Our purpose is much larger than that. Our purpose is our country's greatness, which we mean to preserve by offering to this nation the leadership of the man from Russell, Kan.Tonight we ask Bob Dole to answer his country's call again, and stand a post for America, the first post of the land, not for his sake, but for ours; not for his glory, but for the dreams we dream for our children, and for the dreams they will dream for theirs.We nominate Bob Dole for President because he is a man of honor, a man of firm purpose and deep commitment to his country's cause. We nominate Bob Dole for president because this nation deserves better than the aimless direction we have endured for four years. We nominate Bob Dole for President because we will not take our leave of this century without affirming to the world that America -- blessed, bountiful, beautiful America -- will remain what she has always been: ''the last best hope of earth.''Ours is not a blind conceit for a country that's been good to us. We have heard the voices of those who have yet to share in the promise of America.But Bob Dole wants to lead an America where every father's child can do as well as his father's child has done, because he knows in his heart how great is the promise of America, how generous is the dream of America, how just is the cause of America.The Americans who fought in the second World War came home to the G.I. Bill and a booming economy. They immediately began building prosperous lives and a better nation. They used their opportunities to create greater opportunities for other Americans. And they gave a name to this century. They call it the American century.Like a lot of guys, Bob Dole went to war for his country's sake, and he came home a little bit broken by the experience. He had to rebuild himself before he could build his career. But he didn't do it alone. He had a lot of help. He had a family that never let him down. He had a lot of friends and neighbors in Russell who gave what little money they had to help pay for Bob's recovery. They were good people, these Kansans -- the very best. Many of them are gone now, but I know Bob sees their faces every day. Every day. He knows what he owes them.They gave him hope. And they told him to serve the hopes of others. This is what Bob Dole has done all his life. In his plain-spoken, dignified way Bob has carried our deepest cares and held our brightest hopes. And that, my friends, is why the American people will elect this decent, honorable man to lead this great country to the next American century.Others, others may offer you sound bites and showmanship. But Bob Dole offers you leadership -- leadership, leadership evident in the stature of a man who risked his life for love of country, and considers service to America his honor.All I want you to believe about Bob Dole is that he gets his vision from you. Your hopes are his mission. Your cares are his cause. Your dreams are his purpose and your country is the love of his life. America, we cannot spare this man.I have had the honor in my life of being commanded by a great many brave, resourceful and decent leaders, but none more so than my friend, Bob Dole. A long time ago, in another walk of life, I was deprived of my liberty. The brave men I served with there wanted nothing more than to keep faith with our country and for our country to keep faith with us.When the United States Senate tried to cut off funding for the war in Vietnam before America's prisoners of war were released, Bob Dole led the opposition. For seven weeks, for seven weeks he forcefully debated the measure and succeeded in preventing America from leaving the field while so many of her sons remained the prisoners of our enemies. All the while he waged that debate, all the while he waged that debate, Bob Dole wore a P.O.W. bracelet that bore my name.I never knew that Bob had done me that great honor until very recently. Bob never told me he wore my bracelet. He never sought my thanks. He never imposed on me an obligation to him for the support he gave me at a time when I needed it most. I learned of it, just last winter during a debate on Bosnia, when Bob mentioned it only to emphasize the point that no matter how strong our opposition to the President's policy, we must never let our troops doubt for a second that they had the full support of the United States Congress and people.Although Bob Dole never asked me for recognition for his kindness to me, I have felt since learning of it, that this modest, good man deserved from me a heartfelt expression of gratitude. I wish to do so now. For myself, for my comrades who came home with me to the country we loved so dearly, and for the many thousands who did not: Thank you, Bob, thank you for the honor of your concern and support. We fought in different wars, but we keep the same faith. I shall always be grateful.As a down payment on my gratitude, I am privileged to render you a small service this evening, but, by so doing, I render a far greater service to my country by placing before this convention, the name of my friend, the honorable Robert Dole of Russell, Kansas, in nomination for the presidency of the greatest nation on earth.When we nominate Governor Bush for president, here in the city where our great nation was born, we invest him with the faith of our founding fathers, and charge him with the care of the cause they called glorious.We are blessed to be Americans, not just in times of prosperity, but at all times. We are part of something providential; a great experiment to prove to the world that democracy is not only the most effective form of government, but the only moral government. And through the years, generation after generations of Americans has held fast to the believe that we were meant to transform history.On an early December morning, many years ago, I watched my father leave for war. He joined millions of Americans to fight a world war that would decide the fate of humanity. They fought against a cruel and formidable enemy bent on world domination. They fought not just for themselves and their families, not just to preserve the quality of their own lives. They fought for love, for love of an idea: that America stood for something greater than the sum of our individual interests.From where did the courage come to make the maximum effort in that decisive moment in history? It marched with the sons of a nation that believed deeply in itself, in its history, in the justice of its cause, in its magnificent destiny. Americans went into battle armed against despair with the common conviction that the country that sent them there was worth their sacrifice. Their families, their schools, their faith, their history, their heroes taught them that the freedom with which they were blessed deserved patriots to defend it.Many would never come home -- many would never come home. But those who did returned with an even deeper civic love. They believed that if America were worth dying for, then surely she was worth living for. They were, as Tocqueville said of Americans, ''haunted by visions of what will be.''They built an even greater nation than the one they had left their homes to defend; an America that offered more opportunities to more of its people than ever before; an America that began to redress the injustices that had been visited on too many of her citizens for too long.They bound up the wounds of war for ally and enemy alike. And when faced with a new, terrible threat to the security and freedom of the world, they fought that, too. As did their sons and daughters. And they prevailed.Now we stand unsurpassed in our wealth and power. What shall we make of it? Let us take courage from their example and, from the new world they built, build a better one.This new century will be an age of untold possibilities for us and for all mankind. Many nations now share our love of liberty and aspire to the ordered progress of democracy. But the world is still home to tyrants, haters and aggressors hostile to America and our ideals. We are obliged to seize this moment to help build a safer, freer and more prosperous world, completely free of the tyranny that made the last century such a violent age.We are strong, confident people. We know that our ideals, our courage, our ingenuity ensure our success. Isolationism and protectionism are fool's errands. We shouldn't build walls to the global success of our interests and values. Walls are for cowards, my friends, not for Americans.No nation complacent in its greatness will long sustain it. . . .My friend, Governor Bush, believes in an America that is so much more than the sum of its divided parts. He wants to give you back a government that serves all the people no matter the circumstances of their birth. And he wants to lead a Republican Party that is as big as the country we serve.He wants nothing to divide us into separate nations. Not our color. Not our race. Not our wealth. Not our religion. Not our politics. He wants us to live for America, as one nation, and together profess the American Creed of self evident truths.I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud of him.He is a good man from a good family that has, in good times and bad, dedicated themselves to America. Many years ago, the Governor's father served in the Pacific, with distinction, under the command of my grandfather. Now it as my turn to serve under the son of my grandfather's brave subordinate.I am proud to do so for I know that by supporting George W. Bush I serve my country well.My grandfather was an aviator, my father a submariner. They gave their lives to their country. In Tokyo Harbor, on the day the Japanese surrendered, they were re-united for the last time. My grandfather would die a few days later. His last words to my father were 'it's an honor to die for your country and your principles.'' I have been an imperfect servant of my country for over forty years, and my many mistakes rightly humble me. But I am their son, and they taught me to love my country, and that has made all the difference, my fiends, all the difference in the world.I am so grateful to have seen America rise to such prominence. But America's greatness is a quest without end, the object beyond the horizon, And it is an inescapable and bittersweet irony of life, that the older we are the more distant the horizon becomes. I will not see what's over America's horizon. The years that remain are not too few, I trust, but the immortality that was the aspiration of my youth, has, like all the treasures of youth, quietly slipped away.But I have faith. I have faith in you. I have faith in your patriotism, in your passion to build upon the accomplishments of our storied past. I have faith that people who are free to act in their own interests will perceive their interests in an enlightened way and live as one nation, in a kinship of ideals, served by a government that kindles the pride of every one of you.I have faith that just beyond the distant horizon live a people who gratefully accept the obligation of their freedom to make of their power and wealth a civilization for the ages -- a civilization in which all people share in the promise of freedom.I have such faith in you, my fellow Americans. And I am haunted by the vision of what will be.Thank you, Lindsey. Thank you. Thank you. (Cheers and applause continuing.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Lindsey. (Cheers and applause continuing.) Thank you very much.Thank you, my fellow Republicans, and thank you, Lindsey.I'm truly grateful for the privilege of addressing you.This week millions of Americans, not all Republicans, will weigh our claim on their support for the two men who have led our country in these challenging times with moral courage and firm resolve.So I begin with the words of a great American from the other party, given at his party's convention in the year I was born. My purpose is not imitation, for I can't match his eloquence, but respect for the relevance in our time of his rousing summons to greatness of an earlier generation of Americans.In a time of deep distress at home, as tyranny strangled the aspirations to liberty of millions, and as war clouds gathered in the East and West, Franklin Delano Roosevelt accepted his party's nomination by observing:""There is a mysterious cycle in human events. To some generations much is given. Of other generations much is expected. This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny."" (Cheers, applause.)The awful events of September 11th, 2001 declared a war we were vaguely aware of, but hadn't really comprehended how near the threat was and how terrible were the plans of our enemies. It's a big thing, this war. It's a fight between a just regard for human dignity and a malevolent force that defiles an honorable religion by disputing God's love for every soul on Earth. It's a fight between right and wrong, good and evil. (Cheers, applause.) And, my friends -- and, my friends, should our enemies acquire for their arsenal the chemical, biological and nuclear weapons they seek, this war will become a much bigger thing.So it is, whether we wished it or not, that we have come to the test of our generation, to our rendezvous with destiny, and much is expected of us. We are engaged in a hard struggle against a cruel and determined adversary. Our enemies have made clear the danger they pose to our security and to the very essence of our culture, liberty.Only the most deluded of us could doubt the necessity of this war. Like all wars, this one will have its ups and downs. But we must fight. We must. (Cheers, applause.)The sacrifices borne in our defense are not shared equally by all Americans. But all Americans must share a resolve to see this war through to a just end.We must not be complacent at moments of success, and we must not despair over setbacks. We must learn from our mistakes, improve on our successes and vanquish this unpardonable enemy. (Applause.)If we do less -- if we do less, we will fail the one mission no American generation has ever failed: to provide to our children a stronger, better country than the one we were blessed to inherit.You remember how we felt when the serenity of a bright September morning was destroyed by a savage atrocity so hostile to all human virtue we could scarcely imagine any human being capable of it. We were united, first in sorrow and anger; then in recognition we were attacked not for a wrong we had done, but for who we are -- a nation united in a kinship of ideals, committed to the notion that the people are sovereign, not governments, not armies, not a pitiless theocracy, not kings, mullahs or tyrants, but the people.In that moment -- (applause) -- in that moment, we were not different races. We were not poor or rich. We were not Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative. We were not two countries. We were Americans. (Cheers, applause.)All of us, despite the differences that enliven our politics, are united in the one big idea that freedom is our birthright and its defense is always our first responsibility.All other responsibilities come second. We must not lose sight of that as we debate among us who should bear the greatest responsibility for keeping us safe and free. We must, whatever our disagreements, stick together in this great challenge of our time.My friends in the Democratic Party -- and I'm fortunate to call many of them my friends -- assure us they share the conviction that winning the war against terrorism is our government's most important obligation. I don't doubt their sincerity.They emphasize that military action alone won't protect us, that this war has many fronts: in courts, financial institutions, in the shadowy world of intelligence, and in diplomacy. They stress that America needs the help of her friends to combat an evil that threatens us all; that our alliances are as important to victory as are our armies.We agree. And, as we've been a good friend to other countries in moments of shared perils, so we have good reason to expect their solidarity with us in this struggle. (Cheers, applause.)That is what the president believes. That is what the president believes. And thanks to his efforts, we have received valuable assistance from many good friends around the globe, even if we have at times been disappointed with the reactions of some.I don't doubt the sincerity of my Democratic friends. And they should not doubt ours. (Cheers, applause.)Our president -- our president will work with all nations willing to help us defeat this scourge that afflicts us all.War is an awful business. The lives of a nation's finest patriots are sacrificed. Innocent people suffer. Commerce is disrupted, economies are damaged. Strategic interests shielded by years of statecraft are endangered as the demands of war and diplomacy conflict.However just the cause, we should mourn for all that is lost when war claims its wages from us. But there is no avoiding this war. We tried that and our reluctance cost us dearly. (Cheers, applause.) And -- and while this war has many components, we can't make victory on the battlefield harder to achieve so that our diplomacy is easier to conduct. This is not just an expression of strength; it is a measure of our wisdom.That's why I commend to my country the reelection of President Bushand the -- (cheers, applause, chants of ""Four more years, four more years!"") -- and -- and the steady, experienced, public-spirited man who serves as our vice president, Dick Cheney. (Cheers, applause.)Four years ago -- four years ago in Philadelphia, I spoke of my confidence that President Bush would accept the responsibilities that come with America's distinction as the world's only superpower. I promised he would not let America ""retreat behind empty threats, false promises and uncertain diplomacy;"" that he would ""confidently defend our interests and values wherever they are threatened.""I knew -- I knew my confidence was well placed when I watched him stand on the rubble of the World Trade Center with his arm around a hero of September 11th and, in our moment of mourning and anger, strengthen our unity and summon our resolve by promising to right this terrible wrong, and to stand up and fight for the values we hold dear.He promised our enemies would soon hear from us. And so they did. So they did. (Cheers, applause.)He ordered American forces to Afghanistan and took the fight to our enemies and away from our shores, seriously injuring al Qaeda and destroying the regime that gave them safe haven.He worked effectively to secure the cooperation of Pakistan, a relationship that's critical to our success against al Qaeda.He encouraged other friends to recognize the peril that terrorism posed for them, and won their help in apprehending many of those who would attack us again and in helping to freeze the assets they used to fund their bloody work.After years of failed diplomacy and limited military pressure to restrain Saddam Hussein, President Bush made the difficult decision to liberate Iraq. (Cheers, applause.) Those who criticize that decision would have us believe that the choice was between a status quo that was well enough left alone, and war.But there was no status quo to be left alone. (Applause.) The years -- the years of keeping Saddam in a box were coming to a close. The international consensus that he be kept isolated and unarmed had eroded to the point that many critics of military action had decided the time had come again to do business with Saddam, despite his near- daily attacks on our pilots and his refusal, until his last day in power, to allow the unrestricted inspection of his arsenal.Our choice wasn't between a benign status quo and the bloodshed of war. It was between war and a graver threat. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise -- (cheers, applause) -- not -- not our political opponents, not -- and certainly not -- and certainly not a disingenuous filmmaker who would have us believe -- (cheers, applause, extended booing) -- who would have us believe -- (booing, chants of ""Four more years!"") -- who -- (booing, chanting) -- who -- (chants of ""Four more years!"") -- that was -- that was -- (chants of ""Four more years!"") -- that -- (chants of ""Four more years!"") -- please. Please, my friends.That -- (whistles, whoops) -- that line was so good, I'll use it again -- (cheers, applause) -- certainly not a disingenuous filmmaker who would have us believe, my friends -- who would have us believe that Saddam's Iraq was an oasis of peace, when in fact -- when in fact it was a place of indescribable cruelty, torture chambers, mass graves and prisons that destroyed the lives of the small children inside their walls. (Cheers, applause.)Whether or not -- whether or not Saddam possessed the terrible weapons he once had and used, free from international pressure and the threat military action, he would have acquired them again.My friends, the central security concern of our time is to keep such devastating weapons beyond the reach of terrorists who can't be dissuaded from using them by the threat of mutual destruction.We couldn't afford the risk posed by an unconstrained Saddam in these dangerous times. By destroying his regime we gave hope to a people long oppressed that if they have the courage to fight for it, they may live in peace and freedom. (Cheers, applause.) Most importantly -- most importantly, our efforts may encourage the people of a region that has never known peace or freedom or lasting stability that they may someday possess these rights.I believe as strongly today as ever, the mission was necessary, achievable and noble. (Cheers, applause.)For his -- for his determination to undertake it, and for his unflagging resolve to see it through to a just end, President Bush deserves not only our support, but our admiration. (Cheers, applause.)As the president rightly reminds us -- as the president rightly reminds us, we are safer than we were on September 11th -- (cheers, applause) -- but we're not yet safe. We're not yet safe. We are still closer to the beginning than the end of this fight.We need a leader with the experience to make the tough decisions and the resolve to stick with them; a leader who will keep us moving forward even if it's easier to rest. And this president will not rest until America is stronger and safer still -- (cheers, applause) -- and this -- (continued applause, cheers) -- and this hateful iniquity is vanquished.He has been tested and has risen to the most important challenge of our time, and I salute him. I salute his determination to make this world a better, safer, freer place. He has not wavered. He has not flinched from the hard choices. He will not yield, and neither will we. (Cheers, applause.)I said earlier that the sacrifices in this war will not be shared equally by all Americans. The president is the first to observe most of the sacrifices fall, as they have before, to the brave men and women of our armed forces. We may be good citizens, but make no mistake, they are the very best of us. (Cheers, applause.)It is -- it's an honor -- it's an honor to live in a country that is so well and so bravely defended by such patriots. May God bless them, the living and the fallen, as He has blessed us with their service. (Applause.) For their families -- for their families, for their friends, for America, for mankind they sacrifice to affirm that right makes might, that good triumphs over evil, that freedom is stronger than tyranny, and that love is greater than hate. (Cheers, applause.)It's left to us -- it's left to us to keep their generous benefaction alive and our blessed, beautiful country worthy of their courage. We should be thankful for the privilege.Our country's security doesn't depend on the heroism of every citizen, but we have to be worthy of the sacrifices made on our behalf. We have to love our freedom not just for the material benefits it provides, not just for the autonomy it guarantees us, but for the goodness it makes possible. We have to love it as much, if not as heroically, as the brave Americans who defend us at the risk and often the cost of their lives. (Applause.)No American -- no American alive today will ever forget what happened on the morning of September 11th. That day was the moment when the pendulum of history swung toward a new era.The opening chapter was tinged with great sadness and uncertainty. It shook us from our complacency in the belief that the Cold War's end had ushered in a time of global tranquility.But an absence of complacency should not provoke an absence of confidence. What our enemies have sought to destroy is beyond their reach. It cannot be taken from us. It can only be surrendered. (Cheers, applause.)My friends, we are again met on the field of political competition with our fellow countrymen. It's more than appropriate, it's necessary that even in times of crisis we have these contests and engage in spirited disagreement over the shape and course of our government.We have nothing to fear from each other. We are arguing over the means to better secure our freedom and support the general welfare. But it should remain an argument among friends who share an unshaken belief in our great cause and in the goodness of each other. We are Americans first, Americans last, Americans always. (Cheers, applause.)Let us -- (cheers and applause continuing) -- let us argue -- let us argue our differences, but remember we are not enemies, but comrades in a war against a real enemy, and take courage from the knowledge that our military superiority is matched only by the superiority of our ideals and our unconquerable love for them.Our adversaries are weaker than us in arms and men, but weaker still in causes. They fight to express -- they fight to express a hatred for all that is good in humanity. We fight for love of freedom and justice, a love that is invincible. Keep that faith. Keep your courage. Stick together. Stay strong.Do not yield. Do not flinch. Stand up. Stand up with our president and fight.We're Americans. We're Americans, and we'll never surrender. They will. (Cheers, applause.)'"

He alleged that Susan Polgar and her husband, Paul Truong, had posted thousands of remarks in Mr. Sloan’s name, many obscene or defamatory, on public Internet bulletin boards over a two-year period in an effort to win election to the board.Ms. Polgar and Mr. Truong were elected last year and Mr. Sloan was defeated.Mr. Sloan filed his lawsuit after an administrator at the federation posted a report on the group’s internal discussion forum saying that the person who had posted the items attributed to Mr. Sloan was almost certainly Mr. Truong.Mr. Truong has repeatedly denied being the author.Mr. Sloan’s lawsuit named Ms. Polgar, Mr. Truong, other members of the board, several of the group’s officials, the federation and Texas Tech University, where Ms. Polgar and Mr. Truong work, as defendants.Mr. Sloan said in his suit that Ms. Polgar and Mr. Truong broke a federal law prohibiting using electronic means to annoy or harass another person.'"
"'08-09-04,'0','He reminded the audience of the “dangerous world” in which we live, saying we must stay on the offensive and understand the lessons of Sept. 11. Never mind that the Bush administration continues to pour (divert) billions of dollars each month into Iraq while our school system is in financial straits; our roads and bridges are crumbling; health care is out of reach for many Americans, not to mention the energy crisis or simply having a home to live in.What this country should fear most is becoming a second-rate nation and losing the respect of the rest of the world. Our next president must address these real issues head-on and stop the hemorrhaging of our nation’s resources and taxpayer money overseas.Re “Palin Start: Politics Not as Usual” (front page, Sept. 3), about Sarah Palin’s tenure as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska:Actually, stumbles in early office (or last week, for that matter) aside, it’s refreshing to know that Sarah Palin has actually run something in an executive capacity.That is far more comforting than the Democrats’ top of the ticket, Barack Obama, who has never served in an executive capacity, spent his first election methodically working on disqualifying potential primary opponents (unlike Ms. Palin, who beat opponents on “wedge issues”), and spent his years in office preening, posturing and embellishing his life story.I sure know which outstanding basketball player I’d rely upon in a local, national or international political crisis.I would normally agree with your statement, “The fact that Ms. Palin’s 17-year-old daughter is pregnant is irrelevant to her candidacy” (“Candidate McCain’s Big Decision,” editorial, Sept. 3). Indeed, it should be irrelevant. In this case, however, Sarah Palin is running under the flag of “family values.”What little we have in the way of a public record gives strong indication that she would use her high government office as a base from which to impose her views of morality and religion on her fellow citizens.Reports indicate that as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, Ms. Palin considered the idea of banning certain books from the public library on moral grounds (“Palin Start: Politics Not as Usual,” front page, Sept. 3). Since Ms. Palin would have government intervene in the private morality of Americans, her personal morality and her practice of “family values” are very much relevant to the decision that the voters will need to make in November. Sol GlasnerAmerica is facing one of its most important presidential elections ever (“Life of Her Party,” by Maureen Dowd, column, Sept. 3). John McCain’s selection of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate has turned his campaign into a tear-jerking soap opera. He realized that he needed to do something to add some excitement to his dull, unexciting campaign, so he picked Ms. Palin.Did Mr. McCain put the country first by selecting someone so unqualified to be president? In pandering to the religious right, he shows that he is not his own man, the person he was in the 2000 presidential campaign. John McCain’s judgment is declining; he is no longer a maverick. Paul L. Whiteley Sr.Garry Wills’s Sept. 3 Op-Ed article, “McCain’s McGovern Moment,” mistreats Senator George McGovern, whose error in 1972 was more understandable than Senator John McCain’s so far appears to be.A last-minute vice-presidential pick at a contested convention was still the norm in 1972, but the McCain campaign had the good fortune of several months to vet prospects.Thomas Eagleton was a senator and a national figure, recommended to Mr. McGovern by several fellow senators; Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska was little known outside her own state, and Republicans in Washington seemed to possess scant information about her before last Friday.Mr. McGovern was unaware of one explosive secret about Mr. Eagleton; Mr. McCain appears not to have known many odd things that are still emerging in the press about Ms. Palin.Thanks to David Brooks for his description of the myriad complexities a president must confront, and for pointing out the possible shortcomings of Senator John McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin when it comes to dealing with complex problems.But I disagree with his portrayal of Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin as tending to “lead life as a string of virtuous crusades.”Better schools, universal health care, the right to a fair trial, the death penalty, and narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor are among the most crucial moral issues the country faces today, yet they have received scant attention from the Republican candidates.At this stage of the campaign, it is Barack Obama, with his message of community service, inclusiveness and compassion, who seems best able to provide the moral leadership that the Bush administration, for all its religiosity, failed to provide.'"
"'08-09-04,'0','The Irish Republican Army’s ruling Army Council is no longer operational and does not pose a threat to peace in Northern Ireland, an independent watchdog said Wednesday. The I.R.A. was responsible for more than half of the 3,600 sectarian killings in Northern Ireland during three decades of violence that largely ended with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. “Now that that campaign is well and truly over, the Army Council by deliberate choice is no longer operational or functional,” the watchdog group, the Independent Monitoring Commission, said in a report. The I.R.A. pledged in 2005 to disarm, but its continued existence has remained a concern among unionists who favor British sovereignty in Northern Ireland.'"
"'08-09-04,'0','“There is space between this document and every Republican in the country,” said Senator Richard M. Burr, the North Carolina Republican who was co-chairman of the platform committee. “We didn’t write a document that 100 percent of Republicans would align 100 percent with. We wrote a document that we felt embraced Republican principles.”Other party officials, in acknowledging differences with Mr. McCain’s positioning, credited his strong views on climate change for winning recognition in the platform that human activity has increased heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. It says “common sense dictates that the United States should take measured and reasonable steps today to reduce any impact on the environment.” That statement runs counter to the view of many conservatives, including Governor Palin, who question the role of humans in altering Earth’s temperature.But the platform warns that empowering Washington with regulatory powers to combat global warming “will only lead to unintended consequences and unimagined economic and environmental pain,” statements that stand in contrast to Mr. McCain’s prominent support of a new regulatory system to lower emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide.And while Mr. McCain has differed with many in his party by endorsing giving illegal immigrants a path to citizenship, the Republican platform takes a hard line on immigration, strongly emphasizing enforcement of immigration laws and border protection as well as expedited deportation. “It means enforcing the law against those who overstay their visas, rather than letting millions flout the generosity that gave them temporary entry,” it says. It also rejects “en masse legalizations.”The platform drew condemnation from Hispanic advocacy groups. “It urges the federal government to continue with failed deportation-only strategies that tear families apart, divide communities and fail our nation,” the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda said in a statement.That would also appear to clash with Mr. McCain’s authorship of failed immigration legislation that would have opened the door to potential citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants.The platform also backs a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, an amendment that Mr. McCain has opposed in the Senate, saying marriage laws were more the purview of individual states.""Senator McCain showed courage by bucking his own party’s leadership and the president — twice voting against the amendment,” said Patrick Sammon, president of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights advocacy group, in announcing its endorsement this week of Mr. McCain. On another social issue of major importance to conservative Republican voters, the platform opposes expanded embryonic stem cell research, a provision at cross purposes with Mr. McCain’s voting record.On national security and foreign policy issues, Mr. McCain and the platform agree down the line. Republican officials say the McCain campaign decided to take a soft touch on the platform, avoiding major clashes with conservatives on what is an advisory document that gets little attention outside the convention.And on an issue that has taken on greater significance in the wake of his selection of Ms. Palin as the vice-presidential candidate, Mr. McCain prevailed, keeping a call for immediate drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge out of the platform. It instead says Republicans “oppose any efforts that would permanently block access to the coastal plain” of the refuge. Ms. Palin, on the other hand, has been a strong advocate for drilling there.“Last week that was probably the case,” said Mr. Burr, referring to the governor’s view before joining Mr. McCain’s ticket. “This week she is probably where John McCain is.”'"
"'08-09-04,'0','And Mr. McCain’s campaign has made its anti-news-media message central to the convention program here. In her first speech before a prime-time national audience Wednesday, as the crowd booed the word “media,” Ms. Palin said, “Here’s a little news flash for those reporters and commentators: I’m not going to Washington to seek their good opinion — I’m going to Washington to serve the people of this great country.”The accusations of unfairness rebounded around the conservative talk show and commentary circuit, with the conservative columnist Peggy Noonan, for instance, writing that Ms. Palin “could become a transformative political presence,” and that therefore the “American left” and Mr. Obama’s campaign “are going to have to kill her, and kill her quick.”But, seeming to undermine the campaign’s argument that questions about Ms. Palin stem from bias, Ms. Noonan was heard on a live microphone on MSNBC answering a question about Ms. Palin’s experience: “Most qualified?” she said. “No.” Using a barnyard epithet, she said Mr. McCain had chosen Ms. Palin more for her personal story. “Every time Republicans do that,” she said, “they blow it.”A former McCain strategist, Mike Murphy, agreed, saying, “The greatest of McCain is no cynicism, and it is cynical.”Ms. Noonan later apologized for the epithet on The Journal’s Web site and said she liked Ms. Palin.Some of the friction with the news media was a natural outcome of Mr. McCain’s choice of a relatively unknown running mate, sending the press corps to vet her and raise questions about whether Mr. McCain had done so thoroughly enough.But his aides said the reporting had included inaccuracies and unfair approaches. They pointed to the cover of Us Weekly, which features a photograph of Ms. Palin and the words “Babies, Lies and Scandals.” Us is owned by Jann Wenner, a supporter of Senator Barack Obama. A cover in June featured Mr. Obama and his family with the headline, “Why Barack Loves Her.”“We’d vastly prefer to criticize our opponent’s record before we ever criticize the media’s,” said Tucker Bounds, the spokesman who scrapped with Ms. Brown of CNN. “But there has to be attention given to the fact that reporters are not being responsible brokers of information.”But the campaign’s attacks on the news media have been viewed by journalists and some strategists here as also serving tactical needs. Among them are to build a case that Ms. Palin is a victim of sexism, to change the subject, or, in the words of Leonard Downie Jr., the executive editor of The Washington Post, “to put boundaries on the press’s pursuit of the Palin story.”That Mr. McCain is behind these emphatic attacks has startled many, especially those journalists who have known Mr. McCain longest. “Probably no one in American politics over the last 20 years has had a closer relationship with the national press than John McCain,” said Albert R. Hunt, the executive Washington editor for Bloomberg News.Contemplating Mr. Schmidt’s comments, made in an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday, Mr. Schieffer, of CBS, said, “It’s just kind of odd.”'"
"'08-09-04,'0','Wall Street finished mixed Wednesday, with investors unsettled about the economy ahead of Friday’s employment report and only somewhat relieved about sliding commodities prices.The Commerce Department gave the market just modest comfort when it said orders for manufactured products rose by 1.3 percent in July. The department also revised upward its June reading to an increase of 2.1 percent.However, many traders brushed off the report as old news, given that it is now September. With automakers releasing sluggish August sales and the Federal Reserve reporting weak economic activity throughout the nation, investors proceeded cautiously.Anxiety about the Labor Department’s August jobs report, due Friday, also prevented many investors from making any major commitments. It also had them largely shrugging off another drop in commodities, although a large pullback in commodities since earlier in the summer has helped alleviate some of Wall Street’s inflation worries.Light, sweet crude futures ended the day down 36 cents at $109.35 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.'"

"'08-09-04,'0','Murray had raced to a 3-1 lead in the third set, looking to close out the match. But del Potro, the hottest player on tour not named Rafael Nadal, the winner of 23 consecutive matches, won 12 of the set’s last 13 points to send the pair to a fourth set.As the crowd swelled outside the stadium for the marquee night match featuring the Williams sisters, Murray finally buckled down. He lost his serve twice, but he broke del Potro three times, including the final game. When del Potro’s backhand sailed wide, Murray let out a scream.“Very relieved,” Murray said in an on-court interview. “Juan has been on an unbelievable run and had so much confidence.”But so is Murray now. His ranking will rise to a career-high No. 4 in the world, as he came into the Open having won three titles this season. He had advanced to the quarterfinals of Wimbledon, where he lost to Nadal in straight sets.“I am excited to get to the semifinals, but it’s still going,” said Murray, who will meet the winner of the Nadal-Mardy Fish match. “I said at the start of the tournament, I want to try to win it.”Until the Round of 16 here, Murray had never even played on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court. The 2004 United States Open boys’ champion, he was more a regular of the Grandstand court and the Armstrong court in the last three years, where his emotions and his fitness held him back.But that has changed. After storming back from two sets down to win in the third round Saturday, he defeated 10th-seeded Stanislas Wawrinka in straight sets in the Round of 16. But in Wednesday afternoon’s match — which started late because a women’s doubles match on center court took 2:31 — Murray was distracted by his surroundings.He was upset by his image flashing on the scoreboard high above the stadium in real time during his points, and he asked for it to be shut off. That request was not granted.He used nearly the maximum amount of challenges, and was 2 for 12 against the Hawk-Eye instant replay. Murray said he knew he would be wrong 75 percent of the time, but does it just to test the system.Between the challenges and the seven service breaks per player, Murray always seemed to give away his momentum as soon as he claimed it. When he had his final opportunity to break del Potro’s serve, though, Murray did not waste it.“Andy is a very good performer and in good shape,” said del Potro, who played with a wrap on his sore left knee since the first set. “He’s the best winner.”Neither player had such affinity for the other back in May, when they played in Rome. They exchanged harsh words when Murray thought del Potro struck a ball at him deliberately. Del Potro retired after splitting the first two sets.Wednesday night, when they met at the net, del Potro offered congratulations and an apology for what happened in May.“Early on in the match, there was a feeling of respect between us,” Murray said. “I told him it was a great run he had been on. I’m sure we’ll have some great matches in the future.”Murray’s future, though, is now.'"
"'08-09-04,'0','Two rookies attending an N.B.A. seminar that teaches players how to avoid trouble were sent home on the event’s first day for violating the program’s rules.Mario Chalmers and Darrell Arthur, who were teammates at Kansas, were dismissed Wednesday from the annual rookie transition program, a three-day event at a resort in Rye Brook, N.Y. They will have to enroll in the program again next year and may be subject to further discipline.The rookie seminar is held annually and is mandatory for first-year players. The program includes lectures on money management and officiating, as well as drug use, gambling and groupies.According to two people with direct knowledge of the situation, Chalmers and Arthur had women in their hotel rooms Tuesday night, a violation of the program’s rules. Both people — a league official and a business associate of one of the players — spoke on condition of anonymity because the league considers this a private matter.It is extremely rare for rookies to be kicked out of the orientation program. The last player to be sent home was Ron Artest in 1999.The N.B.A. confirmed that Chalmers and Arthur had been dismissed, but declined to offer a specific explanation, other than to say they violated the rules.'"

"'08-09-04,'0','The (Shifting) Law of the LandThe legal concept regarding copying is called fair use. But what is fair to do without the copyright holder’s permission? The legal precedent that lets people transfer CDs to their iPods was established in Sony Corporation of America v. Universal City Studios, known as the Betamax case. Essentially, the ruling said that people could record copyrighted material for personal, noncommercial use.But that’s where it gets tricky. Suppose you have a vinyl record and you want to hear it on your iPod. Does the recording have to come from your own album, or can you download a copy from LimeWire, which provides access to a whole world of legal and illegal content? After all, you have paid for the right to hear the song; does it matter where your specific copy comes from?“It’s a gray area; there has never been a court case covering it. I would argue it’s fair use,” said Fred von Lohmann, a senior staff lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a free speech advocacy group. He added, “I am willing to admit a court might see it differently.”Because the rule is blurry, chances are low that you will be zinged for it. The Recording Industry Association of America and the record companies are going after the most egregious cases, in which people offer hundreds of copyrighted songs for downloading, they say.Reports of the association suing a woman over 24 songs are technically correct, but it was because of a quirk of the law. The woman in question had more than 1,000 songs in her shared directory, the association says. Rather than file paperwork to prove ownership of all of them, the association sued over just a portion.Where to Get ItSome free music sources are, without question, legitimate. Apple’s iTunes, which has helped to popularize paid downloading, gives away a song by a new artist every week. A different free iTunes song is given away at Starbucks stores each week, as well. Amazon offers free downloads on its MP3 page. Rolling Stone’s Web site has free MP3s on its Rock & Roll Daily page. Artistdirect.com offers more than 200 free downloads, as does MP3.com. Many smaller labels, like Sub Pop, Dischord and Fat Wreck Chords, among others, also give away music.There are other sources for free, legal downloads besides individual labels. Creative Commons is a site that helps copyright holders decide which rights they want to share — for instance making songs free for personal use and distribution, but not for sampling or commercial use. The five-year-old organization said it had licensed about 1 million songs, and lists them at creativecommons.org/legalmusicforvideos. One user of Creative Commons, the eclectic radio station WFMU-FM, posts legal in-studio performances at freemusicarchive.org.Another method that is unlikely to get you in trouble is recording songs from Internet radio. While trouble is unlikely, it can’t be entirely ruled out, because some lawyers say it’s legal under the Home Recording Act of 1992, while others say the act specifically prohibits digital recording. Either way, if you record songs for your own use, no one will know you have them. Many online stations have high-quality audio feeds, including Mr. Dederer’s company, nuTsie, as well as FlyTunes, SpiralFrog and Jango.Recording songs from Internet radio requires a streaming audio recorder and a sound editor. Windows users can download Audacity free from Sourceforge.net. The application will record any audio that plays over your computer’s speakers, save it and export it to iTunes or any other music player. Unfortunately, the simplest option for Mac users is more costly: WireTap Studio, from Ambrosia Software, has a 30-day free trial but then costs $69.What You Can Do With ItSince the songs are free, it should be O.K. not only to download them to your PC or MP3 player, but also to upload them to sites where other people can retrieve them, right? Not according to Mark Fischer, a digital rights lawyer at Fish & Richardson, a law firm in Boston that specializes in intellectual property.“The fact the artist is providing it for free doesn’t take away the copyright,” Mr. Fischer said. Just because the artists give it away does not mean that users can — unless the artist gives explicit permission to share the files.But not so fast, says Mr. Von Lohmann. One of the other tenets of fair use is economic harm. If you pass along a song that the artist has given away, the artist loses no income, so it could be fair use, he said.It’s a case the recording industry group is unlikely to bring, because even the bands are usually unaware they need to give pass-around permission. Typical of many artists, the band Wilco, which has often offered giveaways, not only expects but encourages downloaders to share, even though it has never posted explicit permission.“We hope you won’t sell it, but you can use it, listen to it, put it on an iPod, make a CD, share it with your friends, whatever,” said Tony Margherita, Wilco’s manager.Granted, going semi-legit is not as easy as firing up LimeWire and taking all the songs you want. All of these gray-area sites require some sifting, choices are limited and sometimes a lot of work is required. You probably won’t find all of your old favorites by the biggest artists, but you won’t hear from their lawyers, either.'"
"'08-09-04,'0','He said the union would give Boeing 48 hours to make a new proposal and come to an agreement. Otherwise, Mr. Blondin said, the union would walk off the job early Saturday. Boeing had no immediate comment.Mr. Blondin’s announcement, broadcast live via the Internet, was greeted with loud jeers from Boeing workers, who waved picket signs and shouted, “Strike, strike, strike!” before he announced the vote results. “Your vote will count!” Mr. Blondin shouted over booing from the workers.The dramatic development came after a last-minute campaign by Boeing to convince workers not to stage the walkout that their leaders had recommended.Machinists have followed the recommendations of union leaders in three of the last four contract talks. In the most recent negotiations, workers struck Boeing for a month in 2005. They did not agree to a walkout in 2002, however.On Wednesday, union members held a boisterous march from Boeing’s plant in Everett, Wash., to a union hall where the voting took place. Some workers said they were prepared for a strike of several months. If a strike lasted more than two weeks, Boeing workers would draw $150 a week in strike pay.Negotiations between the company and the union were recessed last week, after Boeing delivered its proposal. They have been taking place in Seattle, the home base of Boeing Commercial Aircraft and much of Boeing’s production plants, as Boeing prepares for the first test flight later this year of the Dreamliner.The plane, Boeing’s first new jet in more than a decade, is a long-range plane that is intended to be 20 percent more fuel efficient than previous Boeing jets. Introduced with fanfare in the middle of this decade, the Dreamliner is more than a year late.Its first test flight is scheduled late this year, and the first deliveries are set for the third quarter of 2009. Boeing has nearly 900 orders for the plane, whose main United States customer is Northwest Airlines.Every additional day that the plane is pushed back will cost Boeing about $100 million, analysts said.Talks between Boeing and the machinists were marked by unusual candor and confrontation about offers and demands at the bargaining table.Last week, Boeing posted what it called its “best and final offer” on its Web site, and recessed talks to let workers consider the proposal over the Labor Day weekend.The terms of the three-year contract include an 11 percent raise, up from an earlier offer of 9 percent, for the average machinist, who earns about $27 an hour, or $56,000 a year.Boeing also proposed an increase in pension financing, as well as a proposal for workers to take on more of their health care expenses.The union, meanwhile, has pushed for a 13 percent raise and richer pensions, and is balking at higher medical expenses. The current contract was extended while talks continue.Mr. Blondin and other union officials were critical of Boeing’s decision to appeal directly to workers to accept the contract offer, rather than continue negotiations until the deadline on Wednesday.“This union was willing to talk right up to expiration,” Mr. Blondin said. “When you bargain, you keep it at the table.”'"

"'08-09-05,'1','British air safety investigators said Thursday that the Boeing 777 that crashed on approach to Heathrow Airport outside London on Jan. 17 was “most probably” caused by ice within the fuel system. The finding is worrisome because the fuel apparently met specifications for water content and the weather was not abnormal.In response, Boeing immediately recommended new procedures to British Airways, which flew the 777 plane that crashed, as well as to Delta, American and other operators of 228 of the jets. The procedures call for pilots to run engines at higher-than-normal settings for brief periods to flush out ice that may be accumulating in the system.The Federal Aviation Administration said it would issue an order in the next day or two to make the new steps mandatory. That order would take effect in 10 days, an unusually short period.The problem is apparently limited to 777s that are equipped with one type of Rolls-Royce engine, although investigators are looking at other models as well.In an interim report on Thursday, the British agency looking into the crash, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, said that another possible solution would be fuel additives to reduce ice formation in fuel. The additives are widely used in military and corporate jets.The plane that crashed was approaching Heathrow at the end of a flight from Beijing. It lost power in one engine at an altitude of 720 feet, and in the other engine shortly afterwards; it crashed just short of the runway. One of the 136 passengers on board was seriously injured; 8 more passengers, and 4 of the 16 crew members, suffered minor injuries. The plane was destroyed.During the flight, the fuel reached as low as minus 29 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 34 degrees Celsius); “whilst this is unusual,” the report said of the fuel temperature, “it is not exceptional.”'"

"'08-09-05,'1','The Yazoo Pumps are dead. This time for real.In a victory for clean water and wetlands protection, the Environmental Protection Agency has killed a crazy yet seemingly indestructible scheme hatched more than 60 years ago by Congress and the Army Corps of Engineers to build a giant pumping station in the Mississippi Delta north of Vicksburg.Billed as a flood-control project by its Senate champions, the pumps would have cost $220 million and drained thousands of acres of valuable wetlands and hardwood forests merely to serve the interests of a handful of soybean farmers who already drink liberally from the public trough. The wetlands marked for destruction already provide considerable flood protection.The project had been kept alive by a succession of Mississippi legislators and by other members of Congress eager to protect their own deals with the corps. The retirement of one backer, Senator Trent Lott, apparently gave Stephen Johnson, the E.P.A. administrator, the opening and the courage that he needed to kill it.Mr. Johnson — - along with agency scientists and environmental groups like American Rivers who kept up the pressure — deserves further credit for standing up to the corps, which few of his predecessors have been willing to do. Under the Clean Water Act, the agency can technically overrule the corps, but rarely does.Over the years, the cozy relationship between the corps and its pork-loving paymasters in Congress have produced one environmental outrage after another. There are other dubious projects in the works, so one can only hope that Mr. Johnson’s decisions signals a long period of vigorous oversight.'"
"'08-09-05,'1','By the time took the stage on Thursday night, we wondered if there would be any sign of the senator we long respected — the conservative who fought fair and sometimes bucked party orthodoxy.Certainly, the convention that nominated him bore no resemblance to that John McCain. Rather than remaking ’s in his own image, Mr. McCain allowed the practitioners of the politics of fear and division to run the show.Thursday night, Americans mainly saw the old John McCain. He spoke in a moving way about the horrors he endured in . He talked with quiet civility about fighting corruption. He said the Republicans “had lost the trust” of the American people and promised to regain it. He decried “the constant partisan rancor that stops us from solving” problems.But there were also chilling glimpses of the new John McCain, who questioned the patriotism of his opponents as the “me first, country second” crowd and threw out a list of false claims about ’s record, saying, for example, that Mr. Obama opposed nuclear power. There was no mention of reform or , Mr. McCain’s signature issues before he decided to veer right to win the nomination.In the end, we couldn’t explain the huge difference between the John McCain of Thursday night and the one who ran such an angry and derisive campaign and convention — other than to conclude that he has decided he can have it both ways. He can talk loftily of bipartisanship and allow his team to savage his opponent.'"
"'08-09-05,'1','The Yankees opened this trip with three victories, overcoming shoddy starting pitching in two of them. But they could not do so on Thursday, with Darrell Rasner delivering his shortest start of the season and Scott Kazmir humbling the Yankees’ hitters.Kazmir worked six shutout innings and allowed one hit, a bloop double by Cody Ramson in the fifth. He improved to 11-6 and shoved the third-place Yankees 11 games behind the Rays in the American League East. The Yankees are also in third place in the wild-card race, seven and a half behind Boston and two behind Minnesota.“Crazier things have happened,” said the Yankees’ Alex Rodriguez, who mashed his 550th career home run. “We saw what happened with Philly last year.”The Phillies took advantage of the Mets’ collapse last September, clawing from a seven-game hole with 17 to play to take the National League East. Rodriguez also cited last year’s Colorado Rockies, who won 14 of their last 15 to grab a playoff spot.“Colorado showed the world last year that it could be done,” he said.But Rodriguez made no secret of the mountain the Yankees must scale to reach the postseason for the 14th year in a row. Every game is urgent, he said, and games like Thursday’s are disheartening.The Rays blistered Rasner for five runs and six hits in one and a third innings. Meanwhile, Kazmir pitched confidently with his fastball, spotting it at the knees on the outside corner or firing it high in the zone, daring the Yankees to hit it.He walked four and reached 98 pitches by the end of the sixth. But the Yankees took few good swings and never seemed to have a chance.“We did not hit a ball hard off him,” Damon said, before referring to Xavier Nady. “Our first hard-hit ball was Nady’s in the eighth inning. Those guys had it going on. They were hitting their spots. Sometimes it goes that way.”More often than not, it does not go Rasner’s way. He has been a good soldier for the Yankees, working diligently, never complaining and challenging hitters with average stuff. Yet his earned run average in his last 14 starts is 7.02, and only once in that span has he met the minimum standards for a quality start: six innings, three earned runs.On Thursday, Rasner said, he had his usual problem. He rushed his delivery and felt as if he was pushing the ball instead of driving it toward the plate. His pitches were high in the zone and flat, appetizing for the hitters.“I’m ashamed of what I did tonight,” Rasner said. “That’s embarrassing. I could never get into a rhythm. The strikes I threw weren’t good strikes.”The Rays had a tougher time with his replacement, Alfredo Aceves, who gave up one run in five innings. Aceves would be in line to start in Rasner’s spot on Tuesday, but Girardi would not discuss the possibility.“I’ve got to do whatever I can to help this team win,” Rasner said. “I have a lot of respect for these guys, and whatever their decision is, I respect it.”Bobby Abreu jammed his left wrist on a slide Wednesday and was scratched from the lineup on Thursday. Abreu, whose X-rays were negative, left for Seattle with the wrist wrapped and said he would test it in the batting cage Friday. The Yankees promoted Melky Cabrera from Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to add depth in the outfield. ... Jeremy Bleich, the Stanford left-hander who was the highest-drafted player to sign with the Yankees this summer, allowed two runs in three innings in his professional debut for Class A Staten Island on Thursday. ... Alfredo Aceves threw 97 pitches Thursday, the most by a Yankees reliever since Esteban Loaiza threw 109 in relief of Kevin Brown on Sept. 26, 2004.'"
"'08-09-05,'1','After Mr. Schulz’s death in 2000, Mr. Melendez animated several more “Peanuts” specials, among them “Lucy Must Be Traded, Charlie Brown,” first broadcast in 2003.José Cuauhtémoc Melendez was born on Nov. 15, 1916, in Hermosillo, in the Mexican state of Sonora. His father, a Mexican Army cavalry officer who later became a general, was a romantic who gave his children Aztec names, Steven Melendez said on Thursday. (Cuauhtémoc was a 16th-century Aztec ruler.)Growing up, José drew everything in sight: horses, cattle, cowboys. In 1928 his mother moved with him and his siblings to Arizona so they could learn English. José, then about 12, was placed in a kindergarten class, a humiliation, his son said, that forced him to learn his new language in a hurry. The family later moved to Los Angeles.As a young man, Mr. Melendez planned to be an engineer, but the Depression intervened. He held a series of odd jobs, including working in a lumberyard, before a friend persuaded him to show his drawings to the Walt Disney company.Disney suggested formal training; after Mr. Melendez studied briefly at the Chouinard Art Institute, Disney hired him in 1938. There he helped animate “Fantasia” (1940), “Pinocchio” (1940) and myriad Mickey Mouse cartoons. He also acquired a new name. After asking Disney to bill him as Cuauhtémoc Melendez, he was informed that his name was too wide for the credits and that he would hereafter be known as Bill.In 1941 Mr. Melendez left Disney after an animators’ strike he helped organize. He joined Leon Schlesinger Productions (later acquired by Warner Brothers), where he worked on Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. He formed his own studio, Bill Melendez Productions, in 1964.Mr. Melendez and Mr. Schulz met in the late 1950s over a Ford Falcon. Mr. Melendez had been engaged by the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency to produce an animated commercial for the car. The Ford Motor Company wanted to use “Peanuts” characters in the spot.Mr. Schulz demurred until he saw Mr. Melendez’s drawings. They were noteworthy for their fealty to Mr. Schulz’s style; instead of embellishing the comic strip’s flat figures and clean, simple lines, Mr. Melendez kept them much as they were.Mr. Melendez’s other work included the TV special “The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe” (1979); he also animated the specials “Garfield on the Town” (1983) and “Cathy” (1987), both of which won Emmys.Besides his son, Steven Cuitlahuac, the president of Bill Melendez Productions, Mr. Melendez is survived by his wife, the former Helen Huhn, whom he married in 1940; another son, Rodrigo Cuauhtémoc, a retired rear admiral of the United States Navy; six grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.Mr. Melendez’s second career as the voice of Snoopy happened entirely by accident. Because Mr. Schulz would not countenance the idea of a beagle uttering English dialogue, Mr. Melendez recited gibberish into a tape recorder, speeded it up and put the result on the soundtrack.For his decades of squeaks, squawks and grunts, Mr. Melendez received residuals to the end of his life.'"
"'08-09-05,'1','The 30-inning threshold is an indicator rather than a hard-and-fast rule, Verducci said. And there are exceptions, like Detroit’s Justin Verlander, who followed a 56-inning increase from 2005 to 2006 (when he won 17 games and the American League Rookie of the Year award) by going 18-6 with a nearly identical E.R.A. in 2007.But of the seven pitchers Verducci considered at risk for problems going into this season, four have indeed been injured — Ian Kennedy of the Yankees, Cleveland’s Fausto Carmona, Yovani Gallardo of Milwaukee and Toronto’s Dustin McGowan. A fifth, Tom Gorzelanny of Pittsburgh, is having a poor season.Most major league organizations now seem so wedded to the 30-inning principle that Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman is saying that Joba Chamberlain will again begin next season in the bullpen to minimize his increase in innings.In the case of Pelfrey, however, the Mets seem to feel they have no choice.With John Maine on the disabled list, with uncertainty over what an aging Pedro Martínez can give them and with last season’s collapse still in the background, the Mets are leaning on Pelfrey. They do not want to lose out to the Phillies again, which makes it hard to let Pelfrey, the club’s top winner at 13-8, miss a start or two.Mets Manager Jerry Manuel indicated as much last week when he said: “Somebody will have to do something they’ve never done before. Somebody will have to play more games or do more than they’ve ever done before. That’s the price you have to pay.”Manuel said Wednesday that General Manager Omar Minaya had not told him to go easy on Pelfrey. Still, Warthen worries.“When he had those back-to-back complete games at 108 pitches, you start to wonder, are we going too far?” Warthen said, referring to Pelfrey’s victories over Atlanta and Houston last month. Then, in his last start, Pelfrey threw 116 pitches, his second-highest total of the year, in six and two-thirds innings against Florida.“There are some uncharted territories,” Warthen said. “We feel comfortable in that he hasn’t shown fatigue. We’ve backed off all his bullpens. He’s a big, strong kid.”Indeed, Warthen hopes Pelfrey’s large frame (6 feet 7 inches and 230 pounds) and steady mechanics can handle the work. Pelfrey said he now throws only 15 to 30 pitches in a bullpen session, usually on flat ground or uphill, instead of 45 off a bullpen mound, and that he does not throw long-toss as much.“I don’t even feel like I’ve had the same workload as last year,” he said. “I feel like I’ve been a lot more efficient this year. Last year, several times I went out and threw 100 pitches in five innings. It’s a lot harder to do that than to throw 100 pitches in eight innings or so. It’s a lot more stressful, a lot more taxing on your body and arm.”Pelfrey’s innings total is not the only mounting number being scrutinized in baseball. The pitch totals being compiled by Milwaukee’s standout left-hander C. C. Sabathia are also attracting attention.Undefeated since being acquired from Cleveland, Sabathia (9-0, 1.43 E.R.A.) has thrown more pitches this season (3,161) than anyone in baseball except Toronto’s A. J. Burnett (3,198). Sabathia also leads baseball with an average of 109 pitches per start.As a Brewer, Sabathia already has six complete games and three shutouts, the latest his near no-hitter last Sunday in Pittsburgh. The complete games probably stem in part from the Brewers’ shaky bullpen, which one major league scout called the worst of all the playoff contenders, including the Mets. Still, his high number of pitches, and the fact that he has completed games in which the Brewers have had a sizable lead, has led to speculation that the Brewers are milking Sabathia for everything he is worth because they have little expectation of re-signing him when he becomes a free agent after the season.Milwaukee Manager Ned Yost insisted that he carefully watches the 28-year-old Sabathia for signs of fatigue. “I think about it every day,” Yost said. “I really do.”“I understand the rationale of, why’s he in the game when it’s 7-0?” Yost said. “But he’s got a chance for a shutout and a complete game. My concern is that we win, and that C. C. benefits from his talents and abilities. Who would not pay extra for a guy who finishes what he starts?”Still, as the pitches mount for Sabathia and the innings mount for Pelfrey, more than just money is at stake.'"
"'08-09-05,'1','Michael Hammer, the co-author of a best-selling book, “Reengineering the Corporation,” which some business experts say significantly influenced the way many corporations have reorganized their workplaces by focusing on the expertise of their employees, died Wednesday in Boston. He was 60 and lived in Newton, Mass.The cause was complications of a brain hemorrhage, said Joseph Tischler, a family friend.Dr. Hammer wrote the book with James Champy; after it was published by Harper Business in 1993, it was on The New York Times nonfiction paperback best-seller list for 41 weeks. Its influence led to Dr. Hammer’s inclusion, in 1996, on Time magazine’s list of “America’s 25 Most Influential People.”“Reengineering the Corporation” promoted the idea of simplifying and reorganizing business departments by having the workers break down their activities into logical, bite-size pieces, then take a “clean sheet” approach to reassembling their work for greater efficiency and productivity.“Managers have to switch from supervisory roles to acting as facilitators, as enablers, and as people whose jobs are the development of people and their skills so that those people will be able to perform value-adding processes themselves,” the book said. At the same time, it said, “those empowered to make the changes at lower levels must know they have the support of top management, or change won’t occur.”By challenging traditional assumptions about the division of labor, Dr. Hammer often said, the book called for “the undoing of the Industrial Revolution.”'"
"'08-09-05,'1','WASHINGTON — Announcing what it called new “surf and turf” standards, the Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday set stricter antipollution rules for engines that run pleasure boats, lawn mowers and weed trimmers.The agency said the rules would take effect in 2011 for lawn and garden equipment of 25 horsepower or less, and in 2010 for a wide range of inboard and outboard boat engines. Meeting the requirements will probably mean that catalytic converters, standard in modern cars, will become commonplace in lawn-equipment and boat engines.As if to head off any notion that it is just not worth the trouble to make boats, mowers and weed trimmers cleaner to run, the agency’s administrator, Stephen L. Johnson, offered some attention-getting estimates.“When fully implemented,” Mr. Johnson said, “the rule will yield annual emission reductions of 600,000 tons of hydrocarbons, 130,000 tons of nitrogen oxide, 5,500 tons of direct particulate matter and 1.5 million tons of carbon monoxide.”Furthermore, he added, Americans could save about 190 million gallons of gasoline each year.The new rules, which were initially resisted by engine-makers, are expected to make lawn-equipment and boat engines more expensive.But the agency said the public health benefits would more than compensate for initial consumer costs, and environmentalists agreed. “Cleaner lawn mowers mean less summertime smog and healthier air for millions of kids,” said Vickie Patton of the Environmental Defense Fund.'"
"'08-09-05,'1','WASHINGTON (AP) — The Food and Drug Administration ordered stronger warnings Thursday on four medications widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other serious illnesses, saying they can raise the risk of possibly fatal fungal infections.The drugs — Enbrel, Remicade, Humira and Cimzia — work by suppressing the immune system to keep it from attacking the body. For patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the treatment provides relief from swollen and painful joints, but it is “a double-edged sword,” said Dr. Jeffrey Siegel of the drug agency. That is because the drugs also lower the body’s defenses to infections.Dr. Siegel, who heads the office that oversees arthritis drugs, said the agency became concerned after discovering that doctors seemed to be overlooking a kind of fungal infection called histoplasmosis. Of 240 cases reported to the agency in which patients taking one of the four drugs developed this infection, 45 died. That is about 20 percent.The infection, which mimics the flu, is prevalent in the middle part of the country. It can have grave consequences if it is not caught and spreads from the respiratory system to other organs.Dr. Siegel said the investigation began with a single case of a woman who was taking one of the drugs and later died of histoplasmosis. Delving into the case, doctors at the agency found that the woman had been sick with the fungal infection for a long time. Patients should call their doctors if they develop persistent fever, cough, shortness of breath or fatigue, which can be signs of the fungal infection.Separately, the agency is investigating a possible link between the four medications and cancer in young patients. The agency said earlier this year that it had received 30 reports of cancers, mainly lymphomas, in patients who began taking the medications when they were 18 or younger. That investigation is expected to take the rest of the year.'"
"'08-09-05,'1','The former Pro Bowl quarterback Daunte Culpepper summed up his thoughts Thursday in two words.With that, a career once filled with such promise came to a most unceremonious end.Culpepper, who starred for the Minnesota Vikings before a major knee injury in 2005 curtailed his career, announced his retirement in an e-mail message Thursday morning, saying he had simply grown tired of fighting for one more opportunity.Culpepper, 31, was the Vikings’ first-round draft choice in 1999. He became their starter a year later, and teamed with Randy Moss to pile up yards and touchdowns at an impressive rate.But he injured his right knee in October 2005, never played for the Vikings again, and never seemed to return to his past level.The Miami Dolphins acquired Culpepper in 2006 in exchange for a second-round draft pick, but Culpepper played only four games before being shut downbecause of knee problems.BILLS LINEBACKER ENDS SEASON The Buffalo Bills placed the starting linebacker Angelo Crowell on injured reserve after Crowell decided to have surgery on his left knee.'"
"'08-09-05,'1','“They are playing a balancing game,” said Michael Wittner, the global head for oil research at Société Générale, in London. “If prices are too high, they will kill the golden goose and hurt consumption. But at the same time, they see the weakening economy and are thinking the world doesn’t need so much oil right now.”Oil settled at $107.89 a barrel on Thursday, the lowest level in five months. The drop accelerated even after Hurricane Gustav’s passage over the Gulf of Mexico caused modest disruption to oil and gas production.Despite a fall from the record high of $145.29 a barrel on July 3, oil prices are up 14 percent this year. They have more than quadrupled in five years.Drivers are getting some relief as gasoline falls from this summer’s records. If oil drops below $100 a barrel, that would most likely drive gasoline prices below $3.50 a gallon, down from July’s peak of $4.11. Gasoline now sells for an average of $3.68 a gallon. But falling oil prices could jeopardize investments in new sources of energy, whose economics would look less favorable.Producers have gotten used to the high prices, which have fueled an unprecedented economic boom in the Middle East, Russia and South America. From the gleaming towers of Abu Dhabi to the new cities burgeoning in Saudi Arabia, producers are relying on a petroleum windfall to develop industries, attract businesses and expand their economies.This year, OPEC’s export revenues are likely to exceed $1 trillion, according to estimates from the Energy Department. The exporters have earned $642 billion during the first seven months of 2008, nearly as much as they did for all of last year.Demand for oil in the United States, the world’s biggest market, has fallen by about one million barrels a day as a result of high prices, sluggish economic growth and the tight credit market. The economic slump is spreading to Europe, and could also affect Asia, the main driver of growth in oil demand.At a meeting of producers and consumers in Jeddah this year, Saudi Arabia pledged to keep pumping at full throttle to bring prices down. The kingdom is OPEC’s biggest producer and the group’s de facto leader. At the same time, analysts said, the Saudis realize that if they keep their output at the present level, they will create a glut. The kingdom is pumping about 600,000 barrels a day more than its official OPEC quota of about nine million barrels a day.Some analysts believe the group may opt for an informal cut in production, reducing output without much fanfare, instead of a formal announcement that could prove politically tricky.Another option may be to convene another meeting in six to eight weeks and announce a big reduction then. The group is already scheduled to meet in December, but that could be too late to act if prices keep declining.“The focus of the debate among OPEC ministers gathering in Vienna next week will not be whether there is a need to cut crude oil production, but rather when,” a consulting firm, PFC Energy, said in a note.Some analysts suspect that OPEC is already trying to prevent prices from dropping below $100 a barrel by discreetly paring production.Saudi Arabia, for example, has reduced its output in the last month by 50,000 to 100,000 barrels a day, according to estimates. Saudi Arabia, like most OPEC producers, does not provide real-time production figures.Many questions will hover over next week’s meeting, among them: What is the minimum price that OPEC is willing to defend? Will the cartel prove more effective than it has in the past at keeping discipline among its members?OPEC’s 13 members account for about 40 percent of the world’s oil production. It does not set prices directly. Instead, its members manage global supplies through production quotas that are periodically assigned to all countries except Iraq.“While OPEC does not appear unhappy to see oil prices falling back from close to $150 a barrel, the point may be rapidly approaching when that sentiment changes,” according to a recent analysis by the Center for Global Energy Studies, a consulting firm in London. “The danger for those looking forward to more reasonable oil prices is that OPEC, haunted by the price crash of 1998, overreacts and cuts production too sharply.”'"
"'08-09-05,'1','“It’s a very serious issue,” said Chris Sanger, head of tax policy at Ernst & Young in London. “There will be knock-on effects of top management leaving the U.K. to make important decisions and the government needs to do something to address it.”British companies are required to pay tax on profits earned in other countries where the corporate tax rate is less than Britain’s 28 percent. Other countries, including the United States, have similar laws, but Britain has a stricter interpretation and offers fewer discounts, according to tax advisers.For all its effort, the government reaps less than £1 billion in taxes on profits companies made abroad — a fraction of the £47 billion it drew in corporate tax revenue last tax year. To some politicians, it’s not clear that such gains are worth the risk to London’s reputation as a global business hub, especially if more companies begin to set up tax residencies abroad.In an open letter published last week, George Osborne, the opposition Conservative Party’s candidate for chancellor of the Exchequer, asked the government to cut the tax and simplify the tax system to prevent companies from relocating. “With companies leaving Britain, weakening an already ailing British economy,” he said, the government should revisit the tax “to restore our competitiveness and help prevent more companies from deciding to leave the U.K.”His remarks drew a separate warning from John Cridland, deputy director general of the Confederation of British Industry, which represents about 200,000 British businesses. The “U.K.’s uncompetitive corporate tax system is driving firms overseas,” he said recently, and predicted more might follow.Alistair Darling, Britain’s finance minister, said that was an exaggeration, given that the British corporate tax rate is below America’s 35 percent and France’s 34 percent (although it is higher than in Luxembourg, Iceland and Canada). The government, he said recently, is “actively engaging with business to ensure that we continue to discuss any concerns and respond effectively.”Still, British-domiciled companies are finding it hard to ignore the siren call of other countries with efficient financial and infrastructure environments.Michael Foster, the chief executive of Charter, was already attracted to Ireland because of its 12.5 percent corporate tax rate. But the icing on the cake was that the tax system appeared more stable than in Britain, where the government’s yearlong review of the controversial tax law has heightened uncertainty about how much tax companies will have to pay in the future.“We are really concerned about the complexity and insecurity of the tax laws,” Mr. Foster said. “We need security to be able to manage our costs as effectively as we can.”As Britain loses some of its competitive advantage, taxes will move up the list of criteria companies look for when searching for a home, Mr. Sanger said.Moving a company’s tax residency entails months of preparations by tax advisers and accountants, and relocating a company’s head office and secretarial staff abroad. The firm must prove that all major decisions concerning its strategy are made there.Shire, the British pharmaceutical group, is already mostly out the door. It is preparing to hold its first annual shareholder meeting outside Britain since the company was set up in 1986 by a team of British entrepreneurs. Members plan to meet in Dublin later this month after Shire moved its tax residence to Ireland in April, saying the tax system there was more attractive for an international company.Like Shire, Charter, headquartered in London, is also preparing to hold its board meetings in Dublin, Mr. Foster said.If a pattern forms, Britain is unlikely to face major job losses. But analysts expect some migration if companies expand their head offices abroad over time — an unwelcome development as Britain suffers from an economic downturn.“For the U.K., the economic damage will come with the jobs that will be inevitably created abroad over time,” said William Dodwell, a partner at the tax advisory firm Deloitte in London. “Companies tend to hire lawyers, tax advisers and other services locally.”Regus, which plans to complete a move to Luxembourg from Britain next month, expects the move to save it nearly £10 million in the first year, a spokeswoman said.To make the move easier, the company, which is based in Surrey, England, just appointed three new nonexecutive directors to its board. Two of them already live in Luxembourg.'"
"'08-09-05,'1','Mr. McCain also returned to what has been his signature theme as a candidate, including in his unsuccessful 2000 campaign: that he is a politician prepared to defy his own party. He used the word “fight” 43 times in the course of the speech, as he sought to present himself as the insurgent he was known as before the primaries, when he veered to the right.“Stand up, stand up, stand up and fight,” he said at the end of his speech. “Nothing is inevitable here. We’re Americans, and we never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history.”Much of the address, though delivered at one of the most prominent moments of a presidential campaign, was little different from the stump speech he has been delivering across the country. And it was often offered in a monotone as he stood before a solid-color backdrop that flicked from green to blue. The reaction was far more subdued than it was the night before for his running mate, Ms. Palin. There were stretches in which he drew only a smattering of applause.“I liked the conservative tone and that he talking about being prolife, self-sufficient — let’s keep the money from countries that don’t like us,” said Peggy Lambert, a delegate from Maryville, Tenn.. “But man, Sarah Palin! John is gonna have trouble keeping up with her.”One of the livelier moments of the evening came when Mr. McCain was interrupted by several antiwar protestors who had infiltrated the hall. Their signs were quickly ripped from their hands, and they were carried out of the arena as the crowd shouted, “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!”Mr. McCain, who by now has become accustomed to these kinds of interruptions, responded with a smile. “Please don’t be diverted by the ground noise and the static,” Mr. McCain said, before adding “Americans want us to stop yelling at each other.”Mr. McCain faced the challenge on Thursday of pivoting from making an appeal to Republican base voters to reaching out to the larger general election audience watching him. Accordingly, there were relatively few mentions of divisive social issues as he returned to the way he has historically presented himself: as an iconoclast willing to challenge his own party. That image was shaken this year as he as appeared to adjust some positions in navigating the primaries.“You know, I’ve been called a maverick, someone who marches to the beat of his own drum,” he said. “ Sometimes it’s meant as a compliment and sometimes it’s not. What it really means is I understand who I work for. I don’t work for a party. I don’t work for a special interest. I don’t work for myself. I work for you.”At a convention in which President Bush was barely mentioned, Mr. McCain paid only the most fleeting tribute to him, not even using his name. “I’m grateful to the president for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on American soil in our history, and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable,” he said at the opening of his speech.Mr. McCain defined bipartisanship as not only working with the opposite party but being prepared to work against his own, even though he is aligned with Mr. Bush on two of the biggest issues facing the country: the war and the economy.That pledge of political independence and bipartisanship could prove especially valuable at a time when is so unpopular.“I fight to restore the pride and principles of our party,” he said. “We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us.”But he also pledged to work across the aisle.“The constant partisan rancor that stops us from solving these problems isn’t a cause, it’s a symptom,” he said. “It’s what happens when people go to Washington to work for themselves and not you. Again and again, I’ve worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed. That’s how I will govern as president.”That approach also permitted him to reprise what has been a central line of attack against Mr. Obama, the Democratic nominee, at a convention whose motto is “country first”: that his opponent has put his political interests ahead of those of the country.“I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again,” Mr. McCain said. “I have that record and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not.”That was one of the few moments in which Mr. McCain directly engaged Mr. Obama. But every time he did — contrasting, say, the two men’s records on trade or taxes — the crowd broke into loud applause, a clear signal of what they were looking for.“I’m not running for president because I think I’m blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need,” he said. “My country saved me. My country saved me, and I cannot forget it. And I will fight for her for as long as I draw breath, so help me God.”The McCain campaign not only tried to seize the “change” mantle from Mr. Obama but the “peace” one as well. Scores of signs saying in capital letters were passed out among the delegates on the floor of the convention — despite the fact that Mr. Obama opposed the Iraq war from the start, while Mr. McCain was an early proponent of it.Mr. McCain pointed to his support for increasing the number of troops in Iraq, which Mr. Obama opposed, as evidence of his judgment. “I fought for the right strategy and more troops in Iraq, when it wasn’t a popular thing to do,” he said. “And when the pundits said my campaign was finished, I said I’d rather lose an election than see my country lose a war.The speech at times seemed low on energy, and the crowd responded less enthusiastically than it did the night before for Ms. Palin. But towards the end Mr. McCain recounted, in detail, his captivity in Vietnam, drawing repeated ovations.“I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else’s,” he said. “I loved it not just for the many comforts of life here. I loved it for its decency; for its faith in the wisdom, justice and goodness of its people. I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again. I wasn’t my own man anymore. I was my country’s.”When it was over, he was greeted by his wife, Cindy, his running mate, Ms. Palin, and their families to the song “Raisin’ McCain,” by John Rich, a country star who is supporting him. Then the theme song of the film — which was the theme song of ’s presidential campaign — and the song in what seemed to be a nod to Ms. Palin’s nickname, “Sarah Barracuda.”Across the hall, delegates drew contrasts between the two speeches they heard to close out the convention.“He doesn’t have the sizzle that Sarah has,” said Rick Lacey, 51, a delegate from , Ill. “That’s probably why he picked her.”But David Kramer, a delegate from , said he was not bothered by that.“Sarah really energized the crowd — energetic, emotional, and really uplifting,” Mr. Kramer said. Her speech was more about the people in this room, the base. His speech was more serious — why is he fit to be commander in chief? What does he want to do for America. Sober stuff.”'"

"'08-09-06,'0','NATIONAL political conventions, critics complain, have devolved into stage-managed infomercials offering little more than cynical sloganeering, phony displays of party unity and dorky delegates bopping to the Beach Boys and Stevie Wonder.This is not entirely true. We’ve learned a lot of critical information in the past two weeks. We now know, for example, that Bill and Hillary Clinton think that sometime in August, Barack Obama acquired the necessary experience to be president, and that Sarah Palin can gut a moose, presumably with her bare hands. We also know that every single delegate, party official and candidate in both the Republican and Democratic Parties is 100 percent committed to change.While the news media were preoccupied with the wind storms in Denver, Minneapolis and New Orleans, here are some stories you may have missed, and will probably be hearing about again:PAY FOR STUDENTS Public middle-school students in the District of Columbia have some of the lowest test scores in the nation. So in a pilot program this fall, about 3,000 of them will be paid for showing up at school, behaving well and getting good grades.The idea of giving students financial incentives is starting to gain traction throughout the nation, with schools in New York City and five states experimenting with cash-for-grades. The district’s schools chancellor, Michelle Rhee, says the rationale is simple: “This is exactly what life is about. You get a paycheck every two weeks. We’re preparing children for life.”INTERNAL G.P.S. First, tracking devices were installed in cars so they could be found if stolen. Then, pet owners began putting chips in their dogs and cats. Now it’s human beings who are being “chipped.” An epidemic of kidnappings has led wealthy and even middle-class Mexicans to pay $4,000 to have tiny transmitters implanted that can pinpoint their location by satellite.'"
"'08-09-06,'0','Now that both candidates for the presidency and the vice presidency have been chosen, may we expect that we will have a civil discourse on issues, with all candidates disavowing any smears coming from those with axes to grind?Wouldn’t that be refreshing, and a good example to the rest of the world!Until this week, I had respect for John McCain, even though he’s not my choice for president. He has lost my respect, and I cannot see that he can regain it.That he could claim that he will end the divisive politics of the last eight years after a convention of uncivil vitriol is as cynical and hypocritical as politics can get. That so many people can support him and his party leaves me nauseous and fearful about the nation we will leave my grandchildren.John McCain’s speech was tired, platitudinous and short on specifics. The exploitation of his P.O.W. experiences for political purposes was embarrassing.Of course, his service to his country was honorable and is appreciated by Americans — that is a given. But his chest-beating on the subject made me think of my brother-in-law, who was a hero in World War II.His aircraft carrier was hit by a kamikaze that killed more than 300 fellow sailors. After the war, he was reticent and hardly ever talked about it. I learned from him that the sincerest form of patriotism is the quiet kind and that the noblest form of heroism is unspoken.Re “The Party in Power, Running as if It Weren’t” (news analysis, front page, Sept. 5): The Republican Party seems unified only in its desire to win the election. In every other way, it’s at war with itself.The party platform is out of sync with its nominee. John McCain himself can’t figure out which position to campaign on — the maverick, down-the-line Bush supporter, right-wing conservative — so he focuses on his compelling “hero” story.He and his vice-presidential running mate agree only that she adds vigor, energy and youth to the ticket (and let’s not forget that she’s a woman).He’s opposed to the special interests and lobbyists that have financed his campaign and the party. He’s against Washington, conveniently forgetting that his party has been in power for the last eight years.All that may be a basis for running, but should they win, it’s a recipe for a gridlocked government.Why can’t we as Democrats be big enough to acknowledge that Sarah Palin hit it out of the proverbial ballpark in her speech to the Republican convention?When Barack Obama delivered a convention address including a mundane nuts-and-bolts middle section drawn straight from the Hillary playbook, commentators applauded, asserting that he had sagely done “exactly what he needed to do” — answer the nagging question of “Where’s the beef?”Ms. Palin also did exactly what she needed to do: show both her own party and a skeptical nation that she is capable of performing (in this case, quite literally) on a national stage.Ms. Palin’s positions on virtually every issue are anathema to me. But let’s give her her due: she gave a terrific speech on Wednesday night.Francis X. Clines gave us a glimpse of the moderate Republicans who are totally left out of the McCain-Palin campaign. I can only hope that they will speak out and try to bring their party back to its senses.My parents were a part of that old Republican Party. If they were here today, they would be horrified at what it has morphed into, with religious fundamentalism leading the way.Everyone should question who will be the puppet master to John McCain and Sarah Palin. I hold the moderate Republicans responsible if they don’t speak out. Randi Reitan'"
"'08-09-06,'0','“When I’m president, the first earmark, pork-barrel bill that comes across my desk — I will veto it!” he announced right off the bat. “You will know their names!”McCain hates, hates, hates earmarking — the Congressional habit of sticking appropriations for special back-home projects in the budget without going through the normal priority-setting process. He talks about it with an enthusiasm that he never manages to summon for the economy, health care or education.Earmarks are indeed a bad thing. If you ever become a U.S. senator, please dedicate yourself to getting rid of them. But for the chief executive of the country, they’re about as critical a problem as the overlong Christmas shopping season.“As governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin said: ‘We don’t need a Bridge to Nowhere, and if we do, we’ll build it ourselves!’ ” McCain enthused.The Bridge to Nowhere was that $230 million federal appropriation to help build a span to an island with only a few dozen residents. For McCainiacs, the fight to kill that bridge was the Battle of New Orleans, the invasion of Normandy and the charge up San Juan Hill all rolled into one.Palin, whose state is more pork-laden than a barbecue stand, actually turned against the bridge project because she thought Washington might make Alaskans build it themselves. If she ever agrees to talk to a reporter, the interviewer should ask Palin whether she thinks a state that is extremely wealthy from oil and gas revenue should not be forswearing federal aid entirely so that less fortunate places can have more.Really, a governor who puts her country first might think about that.“We’re not going to spend $3 million of your tax dollars to study the DNA of bears in Montana,” McCain continued. “I don’t know if that was a paternity issue or a criminal issue, but ...”This is an old line, which he continues to use even though it has been established that the bear project was an extremely useful attempt to figure out how many grizzlies Montana has and whether they need continued protection as an endangered species. But even if it was the biggest waste of $3 million in history — even if it was money to sedate grizzlies so hairdressers could apply attractive red tints to their fur — do we want a candidate for president of the United States obsessing about it?American voters generally don’t like to elect senators to the White House. They’ve done it only twice in modern history. John F. Kennedy was not much affected by time in the Senate. Like Barack Obama, he regarded it as a boring stepping-stone to something better. Warren Harding was so dimwitted he may never have noticed he was there.The problem with the Senate is that the skills you need to thrive there — even if you thrive as a maverick — aren’t the ones you need to be president. If McCain wants to convince us that he can adapt and widen his vision, he can start by vowing never to mention the bridge or the bears again.'"

"'08-09-06,'0','But now, with home prices sinking and the economy struggling, homeowners are defaulting on option ARMs in growing numbers as the loans reset at higher rates. As a result, Downey, which is based in Newport Beach, Calif., has been hobbled by bad loans.Many mortgage lenders face similar problems. But Downey’s troubles demonstrate how the bank, which has been controlled by Mr. McAlister and his family for decades and suffered from manager turnover in recent years, grew out of touch with changing times.While even his critics say that Mr. McAlister was a decent and dedicated executive, he was a strong leader who failed to create a strong management team. After he stepped down as chief executive in 1991, there was series of management turnovers. The longest-lasting chief executive was Mr. McAlister’s former son-in-law, Daniel Rosenthal.Some board members, including Michael Abrahams and Lester Smull, as well as representatives from the Office of Thrift Supervision had pressured Mr. McAlister as much as five years ago to reduce the bank’s exposure to option ARM loans, according to one person familiar with the discussions, but Mr. McAlister was reluctant to do so.A spokeswoman for Downey said it would not comment. Mr. Abrahams declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the thrift regulator. Mr. Smull did not return phone calls seeking comment.The decision to stay the course with option ARM loans was perilous because by the end of 2007, just as the housing market began crumbling, 69 percent of Downey’s residential loans were option loans.To be sure, many bankers got themselves into trouble for big real estate lending, but few find themselves with 15 percent of their assets in nonperforming assets as Downey now does.“At a closely held bank, there is something important that is missing, and it is stock market discipline,” said Bert Ely, an independent consultant in the banking industry.“When a public company gets pounded by the market, on average it leads to change,” Mr. Ely said. “But if the bank has pursued a business strategy, and there is a call for change, there can be a tendency for greater resistance to doing what is necessary because it threatens the controlling shareholder’s ego since he put the plan in place.”“With the benefit of hindsight, there are lots of people who have comments to make,” he said recently in a telephone interview from his home in Bullhead City, Ariz. “I don’t know if anybody would have known that the price of houses would go down 30 percent. Nobody would have known that so everybody did it.”Mr. McAlister apparently had no insight into the looming problems of the real estate markets. Just a year ago, he told The Orange County Business Journal, “We have a little bit of a problem, but not very much.”And he believes today that he had little choice but to run the bank as he did. “When you are in a business, no one company can make the market,” he said. “You play the market, and practically all of Wall Street and all the bankers were playing the same game.” As to why so much of Downey’s business was concentrated in option ARM loans, “We were a savings and loan, and 65 percent of the loans have to be single-family loans.”However, according to the Office of Thrift Supervision, the bank could have diversified somewhat into other consumer loans, from credit cards to auto loans.For sure the lending business had become highly competitive in the last several years, and Downey found itself competing against Golden West, the Countrywide Financial Corporation and Washington Mutual.“But doing what everyone else is doing is a very poor excuse,” Mr. Ely said. “Thrifts have traditionally focused on home lending, but that did not mean Downey had to be so heavily in option ARM loans.”Option ARM loans are particularly risky for lenders because they enable borrowers to defer payments on interest as well as principal. Many banks found a bonanza in these loans, when full interest expense can be counted as interest income by the bank, whether or not the bank received the money. Not only was Downey involved in those loans, they were virtually all in California, a market that has suffered one of the worst real estate reversals in the country. The risk was that when home prices declined and borrowers could not refinance, they would walk away.Mr. McAlister, known as Mac, was clearly behind the drive to move into option ARM loans, recalled Dennis Aigner, the former dean of the graduate school of management at the University of California, Irvine, who served on the Downey board from 1994 to 1998. So active was the bank in that sector that by 2003, option ARM loans accounted for 73 percent of the bank’s single-family lending portfolio, which accounted for the vast bulk of the bank’s loans.Perhaps a tougher management would have pressed for diversification. “It is a textbook example of where good professional management should have been given the latitude to operate and they never were,” Mr. Aigner said. “Mac never used an executive search firm to fill key positions. I came from a business school background, and was of the opinion that when you hired outside management, you do a search,” he said. “But he wanted people whom he could trust. At Downey, they just said, ‘Here is the guy that Mac wants, so O.K.’ ”The only executive who lasted and remained in Mr. McAlister’s favor was his former son-in-law, Mr. Rosenthal, who spent his entire professional career at Downey. “Mac had three daughters and no sons, and Dan became like a son to him,” said one person who requested anonymity because of a close relationship with the family.But few analysts think that Mr. Rosenthal would have risen to the top at a company where he was not a family member. “If there had been an executive search, he would not have made it,” said one analyst who requested anonymity because he deals with the company.Mr. Rosenthal did not return phone calls seeking comment. Mr. McAlister defended his choices saying, “No matter what kind of company it is, you should have smart people, and if they are family people, it does not matter.”By 2006 Downey had started cutting backing on loan originations. That year it cut its loan originations by 48.2 percent, then by 51.7 percent in 2007. But even so, option ARM loans accounted for 69 percent of the bank’s residential loans in 2007, though the figure had been 85 percent just a year earlier.Downey’s embrace of risky lending stands in stark contrast to how the bank handled the first savings and loan crisis. So healthy had the bank been that Downey was appointed to run Butterfield Savings and Loan, one of the banks that collapsed at the time.But in the ensuing years Downey took a more perilous turn. “It is the exception rather than the rule that banks with 15 percent of nonperforming asset survive in their present form,” noted Fred Cannon, who follows Downey for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.In August the Office of Thrift Supervision put a number of limits on actions that Downey could take without its approval, including making dividend payments, among other things. And clearly it has strengths, including a network of 170 branches in California.The bank is also looking to raise capital and said Friday that asset sales and a dividend payment had brought $109 million in new capital. And it may even be considering a sale.'"
"'08-09-06,'0','I think it’s also encouraged potential lenders who are affluent individuals to recognize that they can get 6 to 8 percent by loaning money to their kids rather than 2 to 3 percent in the bank.Q. There are always going to be some who are reluctant to be in debt to their family and friends. How have you been able to overcome that resistance?A. We make people realize that having that awkward conversation can save you thousands of dollars and keep the interest in the family.Q. How do you make money?A. We have a loan setup fee, which starts at $99 for a basic unsecured loan and goes up to $699 for mortgages. We charge $9 per payment to administer the loan — either by quarter, per month or annually, depending on how they repay the loan.Q. How has the increasing popularity of social sites like MySpace, LinkedIn and Facebook influenced your growth?A. We believe we are part of a trend, which we call social finance. It capitalizes on the connectedness of individuals. In the future, we believe this will also translate into social savings. Groups of individuals will help you save toward a goal like buying a home, like starting a business, like saving for your kid’s education. It’s the next-generation 529 plan.Q. There have been reports that lenders have stopped offering federal student loans to some colleges and are making it tougher for less creditworthy borrowers to qualify for private college loans. What was the reason you decided to enter the student loan market?A. We believe there is an enormous opportunity for Virgin Money to help students and their families. For example, parents can borrow money through federal programs like PLUS loans at a lower rate than students can borrow from private lending sources. We can help the family get the best deal and their student can repay parents in a flexible manner after graduation.Q. Recently, Fynanz.com and Greennote.com entered the market to focus exclusively on student lending. Where do you see the student lending market heading?A. It’s a national challenge to find ways to fund the higher and higher costs of education. The returns on education are clear, but they are not distributed across the full spectrum of type of major, geography of student and credit score. The underwriting models in financial services are so focused on just the credit score that it doesn’t translate well to the student loan financing market. You can’t just score the parent and score the student and magically understand the credit worthiness of the applicant. We believe that character-based loans, where people know the student, do make a contribution to helping the proper underwriting of the creditworthiness of a student.A. We have two products in mortgage: a family mortgage and a retirement mortgage, which is a reverse mortgage.A family mortgage enables kids to get a loan from their parents at a lower rate than they could get from the bank. We say you should combine that with a traditional first mortgage so that your blended rate is better than you can get from anybody else. You deduct the interest payments you make to your parents just like you can deduct the interest payments you make to a bank.Q. There has been concern in the mortgage markets about home equity lines of credit. What is the prospect for a reverse mortgage when there is so much uncertainty?A. We introduced a product we call a retirement mortgage. It allows the adult kids and the retired parents to do a deal among themselves and keep the home within the family. It’s at least 50 percent cheaper than a bank reverse mortgage.Q. How do you figure that?A. Bank reverse mortgages start at $10,000 in cost, and our product is a couple thousand dollars plus $9 a month. All and all, it will be less than 50 percent of the cost of a bank reverse mortgage.'"
"'08-09-06,'0','MOSCOW — Russia’s stock market is suffering its worst correction in nearly a decade as sliding oil prices, political attacks on private companies and instability after last month’s war in Georgia spook investors.On a bad day globally for stocks, Russia’s markets took an exceptional fall Friday. The Russian Trading System index lost 7.6 percent and recovered later to close down 4.45 percent after rumors circulated that the government would use state oil money to halt the decline. A Russian central bank official said the bank had sold large amounts of foreign currency a day earlier to shore up the ruble, which has fallen to its lowest level in about a year as oil and share prices decline.Stock analysts saw similarities between the current sell-off in Russian equities and the financial crisis of 1998, when retreating oil prices, a default on sovereign bonds and a devaluation of the ruble caused a 57 percent loss in the RTS market from the third quarter of that year to the next September. By contrast, the RTS index, which hit a record in May, has lost 38 percent over the comparable period.“The markets are now recognizing global growth has slowed significantly enough to effect cyclical commodity prices,” said Kingsmill Bond, the chief strategist at Troika Dialog bank. “It’s a global issue, but it’s being played out with greater ferocity here.”Unlike in 1998, the market drop has come as Russia’s real economy has enjoyed a trade surplus, an earlier surge in foreign direct investment, and $600 billion in gold and hard currency reserves.But Russia is vulnerable on two fronts: About 80 percent of the stocks in the RTS market are companies that produce commodities whose prices have historically been subject to boom-and-bust cycles, like Russia’s natural gas monopoly Gazprom and the steel smelter Severstal. And about half of the so-called free-float, or liquid portion of the stocks on the market, is held by foreign investors who are alert to political risk.'"
"'08-09-06,'0','ROME (Reuters) — Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi lost a defamation suit against the magazine The Economist over a 2001 cover story that accused him of being unfit to lead Italy, the magazine said on Friday.A court in Milan, after rejecting the libel claims of Mr. Berlusconi, one of Italy’s richest men, ordered him to pay the magazine about $35,000 for legal costs.The April 26, 2001, issue of The Economist featured a front-page photo of Mr. Berlusconi with the headline “Why Silvio Berlusconi is unfit to lead Italy.” The accompanying article accused him of conflicts of interest, analyzed his business empire and detailed legal battles in which he was involved. The issue appeared right before parliamentary elections, which Mr. Berlusconi won.The Economist’s article, Judge Angelo Ricciardi wrote in his decision, was completely “within the right to criticize, which is guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution.”The lawyer representing Mr. Berlusconi in the case could not immediately be reached for comment.The ruling is unlikely to diminish the prime minister’s frequent criticism of the news media and Italian judges, who he claims have unfairly singled him out for attack since he entered politics nearly 20 years ago.The Economist has repeatedly launched broadsides against Mr. Berlusconi, whose business empire spans television, publishing, film and the soccer team A.C.

But Apple’s Macintosh operating software — which runs only on Apple machines — is gaining ground, especially in the United States.Microsoft’s stumbles have also given momentum to the shift of software away from the PC and onto the Web. Web-based programs for e-mail, spreadsheets and other tasks can be run in a browser, undermining the value of the underlying operating system. Indeed, Google’s entry into the browser market this week is an implicit declaration that the browser is increasingly supplanting the PC operating system as a strategic computing gateway.Microsoft makes much of its living from Windows, and a very good living it is. In the year ended in June, Microsoft’s Windows group generated revenue of nearly $16.9 billion and operating profits of more than $13 billion, a phenomenal 77 percent margin.To keep that business humming, Microsoft needs to have consumers and corporations upgrade to new versions of Windows — something that has not been so easy with Vista.“What we’re seeing with Vista is that for the first time some significant portion of consumers and business customers have decided it’s not worth upgrading,” said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. “If they don’t, the end of the franchise is at hand.”The main problem with Vista, Microsoft said, was that given the delays, uncertainty and significant changes in the software, the rest of the industry was not ready when Vista finally arrived. There are one billion worldwide users of the various versions of Windows. Hundred of thousands of hardware devices and software applications run on it, and they need connecting programs, called drivers, to work smoothly with it.Vista represented a big shift from its predecessor, XP, so it required a lot of new drivers — and Microsoft did a poor job of communicating how much work was needed. Often, Microsoft said, an older driver still worked with Vista, but it slowed down the PC or made it crash unpredictably. Today, 77,000 hardware devices and components are compatible with Vista, more than twice the number when Vista was introduced.“We are in a very different position with Vista than we were even six months ago,” said Mr. Veghte, senior vice president for Windows strategy and marketing. “And there are a lot of people holding forth with criticism of Windows Vista that have not used Vista, or not recently.”Just after Vista shipped, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, tapped Mr. Veghte, 41, to move to the Windows business. In his 18 years at Microsoft, Mr. Veghte has had a wide-ranging career in sales, marketing and software development (he holds two patents).Vista’s troubles were seen within Microsoft’s management ranks, characteristically, as an opportunity. Mike Nash, who had worked with Mr. Veghte before, signed up to join him. “There was so much we could do better,” said Mr. Nash, who is vice president for Windows product management. “Our task was to shake things around and make the Windows business much more sustainable over the years.”In a meeting in July 2007, Mr. Ballmer signed off on Mr. Veghte’s plan to step up investment in the Windows business. In broad terms, the strategy was to work more closely with PC makers and retailers, and change perceptions of the Windows brand with a multiyear marketing campaign that Mr. Veghte called “a sustained conversation about what Windows is.”The team called its mission FTP 168, short for Free the People 24x7 — meaning the freedom to do all manner of things with Windows on a PC, a cellphone or over the Web, at any time.The campaign is meant to move the Windows brand decisively beyond the PC, so the business can thrive even if the PC becomes less important. Microsoft believes that its broad reach gives it the upper hand against rivals like Apple or Google.“It’s about the PC, phone and the Web, and Microsoft and Windows can connect those for customers in a way no other company or technology can,” Mr. Veghte said.To set more detailed plans, Mr. Veghte plucked 10 other managers from across the company, and the group set up offices away from headquarters in Redmond, Wash., in an office building in nearby Bellevue, which they called “the Bunker.”In their opening meeting, Mr. Veghte, according to team members, began by saying three things: Your personal reputations are on the line. We won’t automatically respect what Microsoft has done in the past. And we’ll try to test things quickly, in rolling pilot projects.In a Seattle warehouse, Microsoft built a “retail experience center” to test ideas about the behavior of shoppers. With retailing now accounting for 40 percent of PC sales worldwide, and growing twice as fast as other sales channels, Microsoft decided it had to get more directly involved instead of just delivering products and promotional subsidies. “We weren’t coming in with the tools and people to help them,” said Bill Brownell, general manager of retail marketing at Microsoft.Microsoft is sharing its research with retailers. It is also paying for a few hundred Windows experts to talk to shoppers in Best Buy, Circuit City and other stores. These Windows gurus technically work for employment agencies, but Microsoft recruits and trains them.Manny Gouveia, 30, is a Windows guru in Orlando, Fla. A college graduate and technology enthusiast, Mr. Gouveia went through a seven-day training program at Microsoft and gets regular online training. He also participates in two conference calls a week to share information and tips with Microsoft and other gurus. He works at a Circuit City, where he demonstrates how to use a Vista PC to edit movies, post family photos online and record television shows.“We’re there to give people a sense of the great experiences they can have with a PC, not just e-mail and Web browsing,” Mr. Gouveia said. “People do come in with the view that Windows Vista is not up to par. But I can turn that perception around in five minutes.”Mr. Gouveia himself needed some convincing at first. “Before this project, I had never used Vista,” he said. “I had not seen a compelling reason to upgrade.” He has since bought two Vista PCs.With PC makers, Microsoft started an initiative called Vista Velocity to improve performance. It includes days of specialized testing, close collaboration with Microsoft engineers and fine-tuning of software programs and hardware drivers. On some models, for example, the start-up time for Vista has been reduced by 60 percent.At Sony, 20 percent of its Vaio consumer models have gone through the Vista Velocity program so far, and the goal is to cover them all, said Mike Abary, senior vice president for marketing in Sony’s Vaio PC business.The result, Mr. Abary said, has been improved performance that should make for a “more compelling why-to-buy proposition.”“There has been hesitation in the marketplace,” he said.'"
"'08-09-06,'0','A substantial number of Republicans in both the House and Senate consider it their duty to secure as much as they can for home state projects. Many, notably Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, strongly resisted Mr. McCain’s push to limit campaign contributions and spending. Mr. McCain also co-authored an immigration overhaul that held out the hope of citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants before it collapsed under Republican opposition. And he intervened just as Senate Republicans were about to deny Democrats the ability to filibuster judicial appointments.When Senator Thad Cochran, a Mississippi Republican, said earlier this year that the thought of Mr. McCain serving in the White House chilled his spine, he was talking about temperament. But other Republicans had a similar reaction for different reasons.“I don’t work for a party,” Mr. McCain said as he accepted his party’s nomination, vowing to veto the first budget-busting bill that crossed his desk and disclose the names of lawmakers — Republican or Democrat — he viewed as raiders of the Treasury.“I will make them famous, and you will know their names,” he declared.In his speech, Mr. McCain also referred to his role in the scandal involving Jack Abramoff, the lobbyist who coincidentally was sentenced to four years in prison on the same day that Mr. McCain was being nominated for election to four years in the White House. His avid pursuit of that scandal created a major problem for House Republicans and fed the Democratic charge that Republicans were cashing in on their clout in Washington, a theme that resonated in the 2006 elections and contributed to the Democratic takeover.“We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us,” Mr. McCain told cheering convention delegates. “We lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption.”Some of the Republicans Mr. McCain was referring to have since left Congress, and the current House leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, is a foe of earmarks. Still, some of the same lawmakers cheering Mr. McCain in the arena were among those who have backed the spending he laments and sided with the lobbyists he criticizes.Given the strong likelihood that Democrats will remain in control of Congress after November, Congressional Republicans have concluded that they would prefer to have a Republican in the White House and retain some leverage in the Washington power struggle even if that president might not have the same ends in mind.Some Democrats privately say that while they obviously prefer Senator Barack Obama, if for Supreme Court appointments alone, they could live with Mr. McCain in the White House. He has shown a willingness to cut deals on major legislation, and sharing power would also allow them to share blame and perhaps pick up seats in the 2010 mid-term elections.That same scenario also worries some Republicans who fear that Mr. McCain, in his desire to get some legislative victories, would make compromises with Democrats that would leave Republicans on the sidelines.Mr. McCain and his allies made no apologies for their repeated assertions that cast a cloud over the Republican governance of recent years. They said that the first step toward correcting the wrongs of Washington was acknowledging that they and their colleagues had been complicit in doing some of the damage.“We are going to challenge this party,” promised Senator Graham.'"
"'08-09-06,'0','“Over the past two days, Boeing, the union and the federal mediator worked hard in pursuing good-faith explorations of options that could lead to an agreement. Unfortunately, the differences were too great to close,” Scott Carson, the president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in the statement.Boeing has a backlog of more than 3,600 orders, valued at $263 billion. The majority of those planes are versions of the Boeing 737, a short-range plane that is the world’s most popular aircraft.The full effect of a walkout by machinists in Washington State, Oregon and Kansas would not be felt until next week. Boeing, which earned a record $4.1 billion in 2007, could easily withstand a short strike. But a long walkout could cause more delays in the development of the Boeing 787, nicknamed the Dreamliner.The long-range jet, for which Boeing has nearly 900 orders worth at least $3.5 billion, is meant to be more fuel efficient than the Boeing 747, which the company has been making since 1970. The Dreamliner has encountered a series of problems, many of them with suppliers, which have pushed back its delivery date by more than a year.Analysts estimate that each day the plan is delayed could cost the company $100 million. Given the uncertain climate surrounding the global aviation market, industry experts say it is important that the Dreamliner stay on schedule.The plane, which Boeing originally hoped to begin delivering this year, is now expected to begin reaching customers in the third quarter of 2009. Boeing hopes to conduct the plane’s first test flight before the end of this year.Northwest Airlines was Boeing’s first American customer, while the Dreamliner has been ordered by several overseas airlines, including Japan Air Lines, Royal Jordanian and Air Canada.A walkout would be Boeing’s second in its last two sets of contract talks. Boeing workers spent a month on strike in 2005.“Despite meeting late into the night and throughout the day, continued contract talks with the Boeing Company did not address our issues,” the union’s district president, Tom Wroblewski, told members in an e-mail message.“If the company wants to talk, they have my number,” he added. “They can reach me on the picket line.”When the union agreed on Wednesday to extend its contract, workers had already voted 87 percent in favor of a strike, and 80 percent against Boeing’s last contract offer.Last week, Boeing posted what it called its best and final offer on its Web site and recessed talks to let workers consider the proposal over the Labor Day weekend.The terms of the three-year contract include an 11 percent raise, up from an earlier offer of 9 percent, for the average machinist, who earns about $27 an hour, or $56,000 a year.Boeing also proposed an increase in pension financing, as well as having workers take on more of their health care expenses.The union has pushed for a 13 percent raise and richer pensions. It wants stronger contract language on job security and is balking at higher medical expenses. The current contract was extended while talks continue.Union leaders were critical of Boeing’s decision to leave the bargaining table and appeal directly to machinists, saying the company should have remained in talks until the deadline expired.'"
"'08-09-06,'0','According to reports from Al Must reaching Miran Shah, 6 to 12 people, including men of Arab descent, were killed, said Ahsan Dawar, a journalist in Miran Shah. Among the dead were two women and three children, Mr. Dawar said.He said three missiles hit the two compounds, which he said belong to two residents of Al Must, Hakeem Khan and Arsala Khan. It is common for families in these areas to rent part of their compound to foreigners, especially Arabs who are involved in planning attacks against NATO forces in Afghanistan, residents said.Mr. Dawar said that on Thursday, a pilotless American aircraft struck a large house in another village, Chaar Kehl, about 16 miles west of Miran Shah. In that attack, about 5 p.m. Thursday, seven Arab men were killed, he said.Al Must is on the Afghan side of the border region called Gurwak, which is considered the demarcation line between Pakistan and Afghanistan and is locally known as Ground Zero, Mr. Dawar said.Another local resident, Mahmood Khan, said that pilotless aircraft were seen over Al Must at 9 a.m. Friday.The strikes on Friday appeared to indicate that the United States was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the escalating numbers of Taliban fighters crossing from Pakistan to attack American and NATO soldiers fighting in Afghanistan.Maj. Gen. Jeffrey J. Schloesser, the commander of American forces in eastern Afghanistan, told reporters at the Pentagon by teleconference on Friday that attacks against allied forces in Afghanistan had increased by 20 to 30 percent in the first eight months of this year, compared with the same period last year.“The people that they’re killing, first and foremost, are innocent civilians, and then Afghan national security forces, predominantly police, Afghan National Army less so, and then the coalition forces even less after that,” General Schloesser said.“They’re going to continue to drive a wedge between our international partners by deliberately causing civilian casualties, as well as attempting to weaken international resolve by targeting our alliance partner nations, their forces here,” he said.The general said attacks on symbols of government authority were up 40 percent over last year, a trend he expected to continue.Top American military commanders have warned Pakistan that they would start attacking Taliban havens in Pakistan’s tribal areas if the increased Taliban infiltration into Afghanistan did not stop.The Pakistani foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, told Parliament on Thursday that the American commando raid into South Waziristan on Wednesday violated national sovereignty and failed to attack militants.No “high value target or known terrorist was among the dead,” he said. “Only innocent civilians, including women and children, have been targeted.”Although the foreign minister used strong language, there was a growing belief that Pakistan was sharing more intelligence with the United States that allowed for more accurate targeting of Arab and other foreign militants who live among civilians in South and North Waziristan.The Pakistani government summoned the American ambassador, Anne W. Patterson, to the foreign office on Thursday and formally complained about the commando raid on Wednesday.The raid by the Special Operations forces, which killed at least 20 people in the Angoor Adda area of South Waziristan on Friday, was broadly criticized in the Pakistani press. “A go-it-alone strategy by the U.S. inside Pakistan will spell nothing but trouble for everyone,” said an editorial in the Friday edition of Dawn, an English-language newspaper.Reuters reported on Friday that health officials were seeing an outbreak of cholera in refugees in northwest Pakistan. An estimated 300,000 people have fled the fighting in the area, the International Committee of the Red Cross said.Pascal Cuttat, an agency official, said Friday at a news briefing: “The most immediate need remains access to clean water and sanitation. No food, health care or shelter is going to be of any good if people get water-borne diseases,” Reuters reported.ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan’s Supreme Court has reinstated three judges ousted by former President Pervez Musharraf.The judges — Tassadiq Hussain Jillani, Shakirullah Jan and Syed Jamshed Ali — were sworn back in at a ceremony on Friday.Mr. Musharraf’s purge of the court last year deepened his unpopularity and helped his political foes win in February elections. Mr. Musharraf resigned the presidency under pressure last month.Political divisions remained over the fact that an ousted Supreme Court justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, had not been reinstated.'"
"'08-09-06,'0','“This market is very, very unstable at the moment,‘ said Philippe Gijsels, senior equity strategist at Fortis Global Markets in Brussels. “The credit crunch is continuing; that’s hitting earnings. It seems logical to retest the lows.”By mid-afternoon Friday, the European markets shifted lower on the jobs news. The DAX index closed down 2.4 percent in Frankfurt, while the broader European DJ Stoxx 600 dropped 2.1 percent. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo closed down 2.75 percent, the Shanghai A-share market dropped 3.3 percent and the Australian market declined 2.1 percent.Also hit in Friday’s trading was the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong, which tumbled 2.2 percent and fell below 20,000 for the first time in 17 months. Goldman Sachs this week announced that it was reducing its forecast for the territory’s economic growth to 4.2 percent this year and 4 percent next year, from previous estimates of 5.2 percent and 5 percent respectively.Asian stock markets have fallen every day this week. Particularly troubling for many investors has been a sharp increase in the volatility of currencies, which has made the returns on cross-border investments even more volatile.The yen has surged even more against the euro than the dollar. The euro has been hit by fears on the outlook in Europe, while the yen climbed as investors unwind so-called carry trades that had previously used yen to buy assets in higher yielding currencies like the Australian dollar, analysts said.“People are wondering what market might be next,” the chief Asia-Pacific equity strategist for HSBC, Garry Evans, said.Earnings per share are barely growing in many Asian stock markets, and were actually down from a year earlier during the second quarter in at least five markets. Many business people and economists worry that Asian exports could slow sharply in the months ahead as Europe appears to have joined the United States in an economic slump.In Europe, fragile confidence has been dented by fears a recession and no hint of lower interest rates from the European Central Bank.In New York on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted on a confluence of poor news about the economy, although investors could not pin the drop on any overriding reason.Reports showed that retail sales were weak last month, just as more Americans filed for unemployment benefits. Anxiety lingered about a global slowdown. Fears of another financial crisis refused to go away.“Boy, it’s hard to say,” Douglas M. Peta, a market strategist at J.& W. Seligman, said when asked about a reason for the decline. “All of us were scratching our heads. Why today?”Speculation ran rampant that some major hedge funds were rapidly selling assets; Atticus Capital, a $14 billion hedge fund based in New York, was forced to issue a statement denying that it was shutting down.S.& P. cut the credit ratings of two prominent regional banks, National City and First Horizon National, on concerns about credit and losses related to subprime mortgages.Bill Gross, the head of Pacific Investment Management, said banks were at risk of a coming “financial tsunami.”The Labor Department reported Thursday that the number of Americans who filed initial claims for unemployment benefits last week rose to 444,000, near a five-year high. And many retailers said that sales were weak in August, as consumers opted to shop at discount stores.Meanwhile, rather than being greeted as a relief for consumers, the decline in oil prices this week is being seen as a sign of weaker demand.In Europe, the decline was led by chip makers and banks. STMicrolectronics, the largest semiconductor maker in the region, lost 3 percent after UBS cut its recommendation. The brokerage also slashed its 2009 revenue-growth forecast for semiconductors worldwide to 4 percent from 8 percent previously.ASML, a manufacturer of semiconductor equipment, lost 1.9 percent. Infineon, another maker of semiconductors, slipped 1.3 percent.Banks were damaged by fears that reluctant investors would have to be asked to raise capital for some time. On Thursday the French bank Natixis said that it would sell new shares at a 61 percent discount to raise 3.7 billion euros to cover write-downs. On Friday, Barclays, the British bank, declined 2.2 percent.And Goldman Sachs predicted that consumption spending in Hong Kong will grow more slowly than previously expected, as residents feel less affluent because of falling share prices and weakening demand for workers.Investment banks have already been laying off workers in some departments, although not on the scale of layoffs in New York or London. Hiring continues in some categories of financial services, notably for employees with expertise in transactions in mainland China.Asian stock market analysts were divided on how much longer share prices might fall.Francis Lun, the general manager of Fulbright Securities in Hong Kong, said that investor confidence was collapsing around the globe in response to slowdowns in the economies of the United States, the European Union and Japan. “We don’t see any light at the end of the tunnel, there is no silver lining in any cloud right now,” Mr. Lun said.Andrew To, the sales and research director for Taifook Securities Company in Hong Kong, was more optimistic, pointing out that Hong Kong’s stock market has already lost two-fifths of its value since reaching a record of 31,958.41 on Oct. 30 last year. “Personally, I see this as a golden buying opportunity,” he said.'"

"'08-09-07,'0','Ms. Palumbo and Mr. Siscoe met in March of last year at a Starbucks in New York to discuss a writing project for a Web channel that they had been hired to work on.Throughout that first meeting with Mr. Siscoe, Ms. Palumbo said, “The more I talked to him the more I thought: ‘This is the kind of guy I should marry. Why can’t I meet a guy like this?’ ”But she did not even think about exploring romantic possibilities because it was a business meeting, and for all she knew, he was already seeing someone.As the writers discussed stories and gag lines for the project, Ms. Palumbo’s ideas revolved around bad dates she had been on, which were also the backbone of her stand-up routine.Hearing them, Mr. Siscoe remembered thinking, “I’d take her out on a great date.”Over the next two months they became fast friends as they wrote and cast the Web project.They said they discovered a shared affection for “The Critic,” the 1990s animated series, and exchanged e-mail messages discussing their general likes, dislikes and their strong affection for a good romantic comedy.“I always knew I really liked him, that he was a really good guy,” Ms. Palumbo said, adding that the other writers on the project (which, unlike the relationship, moved slowly) mentioned that “we seemed like we’d known each other for a long time, and asked, ‘What’s going on with you two?’ So, I called him and said, ‘Hey, incidentally, what’s going on with us?’ He said he’d call me the next day and he did.”He said that when he called he told her that “my feeling for her was more than just flirting, it was something real.” He also recalled telling her: “I can’t stop thinking about you. I just laid it all out.”She said, “After dating for so long and having guys say, ‘Let’s take it slow,’ or ‘I don’t know what I want,’ it was almost overwhelming to have someone say: ‘I like you. I want to date you. I want to be your boyfriend.’ That’s when I knew things were going to be different.”After that call, Ms. Palumbo had no further tales of woe from the New York dating scene.“When we started getting serious I realized I had to change my whole routine” she said. “What’s good for comedy is not good for your personal life.”'"

"'08-09-07,'0','The industries that create energy — coal, wind, nuclear, ethanol, and, of course, oil and gas — all clamored to be heard at the Republican convention. At cocktail receptions and in hundreds of ads, each claimed to welcome the challenge of creating a cleaner, greener energy future.A lot of that was corporate boilerplate. But one advertisement, from Chevron, seemed strikingly on point. “It took us 125 years to use the first trillion barrels of oil,” it said. “We’ll use the next trillion in 30.” This nicely framed a big part of the energy challenge. It was also a reminder of why John McCain is proving, so far, to be such a disappointment on issues he once seemed to understand better than almost anyone else in his party.The world is consuming oil at a ferocious pace because of runaway demand in India and China and because America — the world’s largest consumer — is only beginning to confront its addiction. This cannot go on forever. Even the conservative United States Geological Survey predicts that oil production will peak by midcentury, meaning that future prices will make today’s $3.70 gas look like chump change.Emissions from fossil fuels — not just oil but the coal and natural gas used in power plants — are the main drivers of global warming. Mainstream scientists have warned that unless they are sharply reduced the planet will face rising sea levels, prolonged droughts, widespread famine and other frightening consequences.Global problems obviously require a global response. As the world’s most profligate user of energy, and as one of its most technologically gifted nations, the United States can and should lead the way by developing more efficient vehicles and by expanding carbon-free energy sources like wind and solar power.'"
"'08-09-07,'0','As Barack Obama hones his economic policy (David Leonhardt, Aug. 24), he should include a historian among his advisers to counterbalance advice he receives from free-market economists. Free-market laissez-faire economics is based on the faulty notion that corporate owners, workers and consumers have equal power and influence within the economic sphere. History teaches otherwise. Obama should study America’s Gilded Age, and the difficult times that followed, to see why it is important for government to regulate business and provide necessary support for workers. The titans of industry have disproportionate power that must be held in check by government to make our economic system work for everyone.Nuance and explication are important and welcome in outlets like The Times, but the American people need and deserve a more direct message, something like: “This outrageously expensive war must be ended so that the great sums of money spent daily can be reinvested immediately in the domestic economy: infrastructure like roads and bridges; light rail and solar, to rapidly create real jobs for real people with real benefits; and lower taxes than those under Bush or those proposed by McCain for the bottom 80 percent of the American income ladder.”Obama needs to say it directly, again and again between now and Election Day. Forget discussion of how the service economy has failed to create sustained growth; save the nuance for governing in January. Hit the economy in as few words as possible again and again until it sticks.In his otherwise excellent article, David Leonhardt misses the single most pernicious thing done tax-wise during the Reagan era to favor the rich. The alternative minimum tax was gutted as to its original purpose, which was to protect the common good from unfair tax-sheltering by the rich. This is why the alternative minimum tax now hits more at the middle class than the rich. Any scheme for tax reform needs to address this black-hole-size loophole.Whatever you think of Obama’s plan to shape the economy, there is no doubt that his plan is complicated. If you believe that simplicity is the mark of the master, there is much to dislike in Obamanomics, which reflects his worldview that social change and something approaching equal outcomes must be achieved through the tax code. Such a plan is doomed to failure.'"
"'08-09-07,'0','The crew members aboard the International Space Station are busy, but Greg Chamitoff, the American astronaut currently stationed there, has managed to find time for a few games of chess.Chamitoff boarded the station this spring as part of the mission to install a new Japanese experiment module, a laboratory for conducting research in space.Among the personal items he brought with him was a lightweight chess set. According to an interview conducted via e-mail in the quarterly publication of the Florida Chess Association, Chamitoff said he could not bring magnetic pieces, so he used inexpensive hollow plastic pieces and fitted them with Velcro to anchor them to the board.Mission control became his opponent, with flight controllers in different locations taking turns making moves. The rate of play was roughly one move a day.On NASA’s Web site, Chamitoff was quoted as saying that having the flight controllers work together would help build camaraderie. The site also quoted Heather Rarick, a NASA flight director, as saying: “This competition with the crew has been well received. Part of it may be the competitive nature of our flight controllers. Who wouldn’t want to beat an astronaut, someone with the right stuff?”This is not the first Earth vs. space chess match. In June 1970, the Soviet astronauts Andrian Nikolayev and Vitaly Sevastyanov, who were aboard the Soyuz 9 spacecraft, played a consultation game against the earthbound Viktor Gorbatko, another astronaut, and Nikolai P. Kamanin, a Soviet general who was the head of the astronaut training program. The game, played over the course of a few hours, ended in a draw.'"
"'08-09-07,'0','SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — Jimmy Clausen threw a 38-yard touchdown pass to Golden Tate moments after Notre Dame forced San Diego State to fumble in the end zone, and the Fighting Irish rallied for a 21-13 victory Saturday.San Diego State (0-2), a 21-point underdog that lost to California Polytechnic of the Football Championship Subdivision last week, appeared to be on the verge of an upset early in the fourth quarter.Brandon Sullivan was inches away from a 4-yard touchdown run and a two-score lead for the Aztecs. But safety David Bruton jarred the ball loose and recovered it in the end zone.Clausen was 5 of 5 passing for 76 yards on the ensuing drive to rally the Irish to victory. They avoided losing back-to-back season-openers at home for the first time since 1887-88, their first two seasons. Clausen added a 6-yard touchdown pass to David Grimes with 2 minutes 8 seconds left. Clausen, who threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to Michael Floyd in the first half, was 21 of 34 for 237 yards with two interceptions.'"
"'08-09-07,'0','How long before we learn she never shot a moose?Given the actuarial odds that could make Palin our 45th president, it would be helpful to know who this mystery woman actually is. Meanwhile, two eternal axioms of our politics remain in place. Americans vote for the top of the ticket, not the bottom. And in judging the top of the ticket, voters look first at the candidates’ maiden executive decision, their selection of running mates. Whatever we do and don’t know about Palin’s character at this point, there is no ambiguity in what her ascent tells us about McCain’s character and potential presidency.He wanted to choose the pro- -rights as his vice president. If he were still a true maverick, he would have done so. But instead he chose partisanship and politics over country. “God only made one John McCain, and he is his own man,” said the shafted Lieberman in his own tedious convention speech last week. What a pathetic dupe. McCain is now the man of James Dobson and Tony Perkins. The “no surrender” warrior surrendered to the agents of intolerance not just by dumping his pal for Palin but by moving so far to the right on abortion that even seemed unaware of his radical shift when being interviewed by last week.That ideological sellout, unfortunately, was not the worst leadership trait the last-minute vice presidential pick revealed about McCain. His speed-dating of Palin reaffirmed a more dangerous personality tic that has dogged his entire career. His decision-making process is impetuous and, in its Bush-like preference for gut instinct over facts, potentially reckless.As The reported last Tuesday, Palin was sloppily vetted, at best. McCain operatives and some of their press surrogates responded to this revelation by trying to discredit The Times article. After all, The had cited McCain aides (including his campaign manager, Rick Davis) last weekend to assure us that Palin had a “full vetting process.” She had been subjected to “an background check,” we were told, and “the McCain camp had reviewed everything it could find on her.”The Times had it right. The McCain campaign’s claims of a “full vetting process” for Palin were as much a lie as the biographical details they’ve invented for her. There was no F.B.I. background check. The Times found no evidence that a McCain representative spoke to anyone in the State Legislature or business community. Nor did anyone talk to the fired state public safety commissioner at the center of the Palin ethics investigation. No McCain researcher even bothered to consult the relevant back issues of the Wasilla paper. Apparently when McCain said in June that his vice presidential vetting process was basically “a ,” he wasn’t joking.This is a roll of the dice beyond even ’s imagination. “Often my haste is a mistake,” McCain conceded in his 2002 memoir, “but I live with the consequences without complaint.” Well, maybe it’s fine if he wants to live with the consequences, but what about his country? Should the unexamined Palin prove unfit to serve at the pinnacle of American power, it will be too late for the rest of us to complain.We’ve already seen where such visceral decision-making by McCain can lead. In October 2001, he speculated that might have been behind the attacks in America. That same month he out-Cheneyed Cheney in his repeated public insistence that had a role in 9/11 — even after both American and foreign intelligence services found that unlikely. He was similarly rash in his reading of the supposed evidence of Saddam’s W.M.D. and in his estimate of the number of troops needed to occupy Iraq. (McCain told MSNBC in late 2001 that we could do with fewer than 100,000.) It wasn’t until months after that he called for more American forces to be tossed into the bloodbath. The whole fiasco might have been prevented had he listened to those like Gen. who faulted the Rumsfeld war plan from the start.In other words, McCain’s hasty vetting of Palin was all too reminiscent of his grave dereliction of due diligence on the war. He has been no less hasty in implying that we might somehow ride to the military rescue of (“Today, we are all Georgians”) or in reaffirming as late as December 2007 that the crumbling anti-democratic regime of deserved “the benefit of the doubt” even as it was enabling the resurgence of the and . McCain’s blanket endorsement of Bush administration policy in could have consequences for years to come.“This election is not about issues” so much as the candidates’ images, said the McCain campaign manager, Davis, in one of the season’s most notable pronouncements. Going into the Republican convention, we thought we knew what he meant: the McCain strategy is about tearing down Obama. But last week made clear that the McCain campaign will be equally ruthless about deflecting attention from its own candidate’s deterioration.What was most striking about McCain’s acceptance speech is that it had almost nothing in common with the strident right-wing convention that preceded it. We were pointedly given a rerun of McCain 2000 — cobbled together from scraps of the old Straight Talk repertory. The ensuing tedium was in all likelihood intentional. It’s in the campaign’s interest that we nod off and assume McCain is unchanged in 2008.That’s why the Palin choice was brilliant politics — not because it rallied the G.O.P.’s shrinking religious-right base. America loves nothing more than a new celebrity face, and the talking heads marched in lock step last week to proclaim her a star. Palin is a high-energy distraction from the top of the ticket, even if the provenance of her stardom is in itself a reflection of exactly what’s frightening about the top of the ticket.By hurling charges of sexism and elitism at any easily cowed journalist who raises a question about Palin, McCain operatives are hoping to ensure that whatever happened in Alaska with Sarah Palin stays in Alaska. Given how little vetting McCain himself has received this year — and that only 58 days remain until Nov. 4 — they just might pull it off.'"

"'08-09-07,'0','Here we do wholesale and retail; we know our customers well, and they are all complaining about the costs. One big problem now is that the prices are fluctuating so much. Something might cost me $20, and tomorrow it will cost me $22. A bottle of Dolce & Gabbana that was $36 wholesale just a year ago, I’m now buying it for $56.The dollar keeps falling, and as a retailer we don’t have a lot of flexibility, because most of the perfumes are coming from Europe: Chanel, Drakkar Noir, Joop. We don’t mark it up as much as they do at Macy’s. That’s why people shop here.But in this market, some customers are losing their trust because there are a lot more people selling fakes now, down on Canal Street, or out on the street here. That’s another result of the dollar losing ground. People are getting priced out of the brands, so they are buying fakes instead. Earlier this year, some guys set up tables to sell bootleg perfumes right across the street from Macy’s.We used to have a lot of customers coming from South America, tourists from Brazil or Argentina, but we don’t see many of them anymore. Now maybe because of the better currency exchange they can afford to buy it down there; they don’t need to shop in New York. But most of our clientele is still Spanish-speaking. I speak a little bit of Spanish, a little bit of French. I learned it all working here.Our busiest months are right before Christmas, but this past year was definitely slower. I have six people working with me in the store now. I’m lucky because I haven’t had to lay anybody off, but I couldn’t hire anybody else now either. Still, we all get along. Everybody works hard.Sometimes I get very stressed out. Today I’m O.K., but there are many, many expenses — salaries, electricians, so many different city taxes — and our profit margin isn’t that high. And in this neighborhood the rent goes up 15 or 20 percent every year.This past year they wanted to raise the rent 50 percent over three years. I negotiated something better, but at the end of the day this won’t all add up. If our rents keep going up, and the price of perfume keeps going up, I don’t know how long they’ll be able to call this neighborhood the perfume district.In the future I’ve been thinking of maybe just going into warehousing and shipping. But all of your orders come in by fax or e-mail, and I would miss having a store, talking to customers face to face. We have many regular customers, some of them have their own little stores, and they come in to buy three or four bottles of this or that.These days the most popular perfume for women is Code, by Armani. Also Juicy Couture, that is a big one. The most expensive ones now are Dolce & Gabbana, and the price has gone up and up and up. Many customers don’t understand why. We have to explain that we aren’t raising the price because we want to, but because we have to.My family is happy with my work. I bring my wife perfumes, and she wears whatever I bring home. She likes them all. My father is still in Pakistan; I visit once or twice a year. And yes, of course, when I go to visit, I always bring perfumes.'"
"'08-09-07,'0','HOUSING VS. BUSINESS CAPITAL Wealth invested in your own home has several tax advantages. These include the mortgage interest deduction and the absence of any tax on imputed rent (the value that homeowners earn implicitly by getting a place to live). By taxing business capital highly, the tax laws induce people to invest too much in housing and too little in businesses.NONCORPORATE VS. CORPORATE Because noncorporate businesses like partnerships are taxed only once, they have an advantage over twice-taxed corporations. As a result, too much of the economy’s capital stock ends up in the noncorporate sector.DEBT VS. EQUITY FINANCE Because interest payments on corporate debt are deductible for corporate income tax calculations, this capital income is taxed only once. This asymmetric treatment of debt and equity finance induces companies to issue more debt than they otherwise would, increasing leverage and the economy’s financial fragility.RETAINED EARNINGS VS. DIVIDENDS Companies can avoid the dividend tax by retaining earnings rather than paying dividends. Excessive retained earnings, however, impede the movement of capital from older cash-generating companies to newer ones with better prospects.Policy wonks like me have long hoped for changes in the tax code that would eliminate, or at least mitigate, these problems. In 2003, President Bush proposed that all dividends paid out of income that had already been taxed at the corporate level should be exempt from tax at the personal level. (Disclosure: I became a Bush economic adviser at about the time the reform was proposed and being debated.)Although Congress did not give the president exactly what he sought, it gave him a large chunk of it. The top tax rate for dividends was cut to 15 percent, less than half the top rate for ordinary income. The adverse incentives of the tax code did not disappear, but they became much smaller.At the time, debate over this change was highly partisan. Many Democrats pointed out, correctly, that the most immediate beneficiaries were rich. The poor don’t own much dividend-paying stock. Middle-class families hold more equities, but they often do so in retirement accounts, which are already tax-preferred. Wonkish arguments that a better allocation of resources would improve the overall economy were dismissed as “trickle-down economics.” In the end, a vast majority of Congressional Democrats voted against the bill.The issue also divided the parties during the 2004 presidential campaign. President Bush argued for making his tax cuts, including the cut for dividends, permanent. (They are now scheduled to expire at the end of 2010.) Senator John Kerry, the Democratic candidate, proposed repealing many of the Bush tax cuts and again treating dividends as ordinary income.Four years later, however, Senator Obama enters the picture with, apparently, a different point of view. He has not been coy about wanting to use the tax code to redistribute income more aggressively. He has proposed modest tax cuts (about $1,000) for numerous middle-class Americans, cuts to be financed by much higher taxes on the richest few percent of the population. When all of Senator Obama’s proposed tax increases on the rich are added up, the top marginal rate on wage income would be nearly 50 percent.But for dividend income, Senator Obama has proposed only a modest increase in the top tax rate, to 20 percent from 15 percent. That is, the personal income tax would continue to tax dividends at a far lower rate than ordinary income. This decision must surprise many of his Congressional supporters. But it should be making President Bush smile.In light of Senator Obama’s stand, the politics of dividend taxation may take some surprising twists. Senator John McCain wants to maintain the current tax rate of 15 percent on dividends (while cutting the corporate tax), but it is a good bet that if Senator McCain is elected president, while Congress remains Democratic, Congress won’t give the Republican president what he wants. They would instead let the Bush tax cuts expire, returning the dividend tax for high-income taxpayers to about 40 percent.By contrast, if Mr. Obama is elected, Congressional Democrats will be less likely to balk at his proposed 20 percent dividend tax rate and thus embarrass the new president from their own party.This leads to one of the great ironies of the political season. On the issue of dividend taxation, Barack Obama may be the candidate with the best chance of preserving George Bush’s legacy.'"
"'08-09-07,'0','Workers, some waving American flags, began to walk picket lines as soon as the strike was called, although its impact would not be fully felt until Monday.If the strike goes on for more than two weeks, union members will begin drawing $150 a week in strike pay. The typical pay for a union member is $27 an hour, or about $56,000 a year before overtime and bonuses.The strike was Boeing’s second in its last two sets of contract talks and the seventh since 1948, when workers walked off the job in a historic showdown with both the company and the rival Teamsters Union. Boeing workers spent a month on strike in 2005.The latest walkout came after Boeing and the union failed to reach agreement on a new three-year contract during negotiations in Orlando, Fla., that were supervised by a federal mediator. The talks moved to a hotel outside Walt Disney World, where the union was holding a national conference, from Seattle, the home of Boeing Commercial Airplanes and many of the company’s production sites.The union agreed to extend its contract 48 hours late Wednesday, though workers had voted overwhelmingly against Boeing’s offer and in favor of a strike.The president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Scott E. Carson, said in a statement: “Over the past two days, Boeing, the union and the federal mediator worked hard in pursuing good-faith explorations of options that could lead to an agreement. Unfortunately, the differences were too great to close.”Boeing has a backlog of more than 3,600 orders valued at $263 billion in all. The majority of those aircraft are versions of the Boeing 737, a short-range plane that is the world’s most popular.Boeing, which earned a record $4.1 billion in 2007, could easily withstand a short strike. But a long walkout could cause more delays in the development of the Boeing 787, a long-range jet nicknamed the Dreamliner.The Dreamliner is meant to be significantly more fuel-efficient than the Boeing 747, which the company has been making since 1970. But the Dreamliner has encountered problems, many of them traced to suppliers scattered from Japan to Italy, which have pushed back its delivery date more than a year.Analysts estimate that each day the plane is delayed could cost the company $100 million.The Dreamliner, which Boeing originally hoped to begin delivering this year, is now expected to start reaching customers in the third quarter of 2009. Boeing hopes to conduct the plane’s first test flight before the end of this year.“Despite meeting late into the night and throughout the day, continued contract talks with the Boeing Company did not address our issues,” the union’s district president, Tom Wroblewski, told members in an e-mail message. “If the company wants to talk, they have my number,” he added. “They can reach me on the picket line.”When the union agreed Wednesday to extend its contract, workers had already voted 87 percent in favor of a strike and 80 percent against Boeing’s last contract offer.Last week, Boeing posted what it called its best and final offer on its Web site and recessed talks to let workers consider the proposal over the Labor Day weekend.The terms of the proposed three-year contract include an 11 percent raise, up from an earlier offer of 9 percent, for the average machinist. Boeing also proposed an increase in pension financing, as well as having workers take on more of their health care expenses.The union has pushed for a 13 percent raise and richer pensions. It wants stronger contract language on job security and is balking at higher medical expenses.'"
"'08-09-07,'0','In the past, discovery for its own sake provided academic motivation, but today’s universities function more like corporate research laboratories. Rather than freely sharing techniques and results, researchers increasingly keep new findings under wraps to maintain a competitive edge. What used to be peer-reviewed is now proprietary. “Share and share alike” has devolved into “every laboratory for itself.”In trying to power the innovation economy, we have turned America’s universities into cutthroat business competitors, zealously guarding the very innovations we so desperately want behind a hopelessly tangled web of patents and royalty licenses.Of course, there is precedent for scientific secrecy, notes Daniel S. Greenberg , author of “Science for Sale: The Perils, Rewards and Delusions of Campus Capitalism” (University of Chicago Press, 2007). When James Watson and Francis Crick were homing in on DNA’s double-helix structure in the 1950s, they zealously guarded their work from prying eyes until they could publish their findings, to be certain that they would get the credit for making the discovery.“They didn’t try to patent it,” Mr. Greenberg notes, “but somebody doing the same work today would certainly take a crack at patenting the double helix.”In fact, it was the life sciences — in particular, biotechnology — that started universities down the slippery commercial slope in the first place. Even before the Bayh-Dole Act, pharmaceutical companies were eagerly trolling campuses, looking for projects to finance. After the law was passed, they stepped up their efforts, but now with renewed zeal for keeping potential trade secrets from competitors.While patients have benefited from the growing supply of new medications, the universities have obtained patents not only for the actual substances but also for the processes and methods used to make them, potentially hampering discovery of even more beneficial treatments.“Bayh-Dole tore down the taboos that existed against universities engaging in overtly commercial activity. Universities really thought that they were going to make it rich,” said Jennifer Washburn, author of “University Inc.: The Corporate Corruption of Higher Education” (Basic Books, 2005). “Each school was convinced that if they came up with that one blockbuster invention, they could solve all their financial problems.”Ms. Washburn says that was “extremely wrong-headed.” Initially reacting to the law by slapping patents on every possible innovation, universities quickly discovered that patents were an expensive proposition. The fees and legal costs involved in obtaining a single patent can run upward of $15,000, and that doesn’t count the salaries of administrative staff members. Instead of bringing home the bacon, university tech transfer offices were throwing money into the void with little hope of returns.To date, Ms. Washburn says, data gathered by the Association of University Technology Managers, a trade group, show that fewer than half of the 300 research universities actively seeking patents have managed to break even from technology transfer efforts. Instead, two-thirds of the revenue tracked by the association has gone to only 13 institutions.Part of the problem has been a lingering misunderstanding about where the value lies in innovation. Patenting a new basic science technique, or platform technology, puts it out of the reach of graduate students who might have made tremendous progress using it.Similarly, exclusive licensing of a discovery to a single company thwarts that innovation’s use in any number of other fields. R. Stanley Williams, a nanotechnologist from Hewlett-Packard, testified to Congress in 2002 that much of the academic research to which H.P. has had difficulty gaining access could be licensed to several companies without eroding its intellectual property value.“Severe disagreements have arisen over conflicting interpretations of the Bayh-Dole Act,” he said. “Large U.S.-based corporations have become so disheartened and disgusted with the situation, they are now working with foreign universities, especially the elite institutions in France, Russia and China.”THE issue is further clouded by “reach through” licenses, complex arrangements used by many tech transfer offices. A reach-through lets the patent holder claim a share of any profits that result from using, say, an enabling technology, even if those profits come several steps down the market transfer line. Several universities are already embroiled in messy lawsuits trying to sort out who is entitled to what.Perhaps the most troublesome aspect of campus commercialization is that research decisions are now being based on possible profits, not on the inherent value of knowledge. “Blue sky” research — the kind of basic experimentation that leads to a greater understanding of how the world works — has largely been set aside in favor of projects considered to have more immediate market potential.In academia’s continuing pursuit of profit, the wonder of simple serendipitous discovery has been left on the curb.'"
"'08-09-07,'0','Officials for the United States Tennis Association, in consultation with CBS, made the unprecedented decision to begin the Nadal-Murray match before the conclusion of the first semifinal. But in an effort to give viewers and fans an opportunity to watch at least part of both matches, they opted for different starting times, moving the second match to the smaller Louis Armstrong Stadium at 12:40 p.m., 90 minutes after the start of Federer-Djokovic. The plan backfired when the storm arrived earlier than the U.S.T.A. officials expected.Now, in what could be a competitive advantage for Federer, Nadal and Murray will not resume their match until 4 p.m. Sunday at Arthur Ashe Stadium. The men’s final is scheduled for 5 p.m. Monday.The prime-time women’s final between Serena Williams and Jelena Jankovic, originally scheduled for Saturday night, was postponed to 9 p.m. Sunday.The decision to move up the second semifinal created an unanticipated logistical problem. After Federer lost his serve and split sets with Djokovic, it was announced that the other match would begin in 20 minutes at Armstrong. Many of the fans who then rushed from Ashe, which holds 23,000, soon stood in frustration 10 deep at the backlogged gates of the 10,000-seat Armstrong, which was half-empty.“I don’t know why they didn’t put us on the court at the same time as the other match,” Murray said before he left the tennis center. He was more puzzled than angry. “I had no problem playing in Armstrong.”Murray, a 21-year-old from Scotland who is playing the best tennis of his career, had not stepped onto Ashe court until two rounds ago.On Saturday, he seemed comfortable in the Open’s secondary stadium, blistering service returns that had Nadal off balance from the start.Nadal, meanwhile, had not played or practiced on Armstrong during this year’s tournament before Saturday. He also had been a victim of strange scheduling when his quarterfinal match against Mardy Fish began at 11:30 p.m. Wednesday and lasted until 2:11 a.m. Thursday.Advised of the court switch at 11:30 a.m. Saturday, Nadal expressed no objections.In this tournament, Djokovic learned too late to keep his mouth shut. He was angry that his quarterfinal opponent, Andy Roddick, had sarcastically suggested that Djokovic was faking injuries. After their match Thursday, he lashed out at Roddick and the crowd.On Saturday, Djokovic, the runner-up to Federer here in 2007, seemed subdued by the experience, becoming frustrated with the fans only once, when they cheered his unforced error.Mostly, the crowd roared for Federer on every crucial point, as he executed crisp volleys and passing shots to go with his scorching service games. Maybe they were supporting the new underdog at No. 2 in the world.“I feel a little bit like a New Yorker now,” Federer said.Or perhaps the fans were cheering his march to history. Federer has won 33 straight matches at the Open and is trying to become the first man to win five consecutive titles here along with five consecutive Wimbledons. And then there is Pete Sampras’s record of 14 Grand Slam titles.“If I win, it’s great,” Federer said. “I’m back, sort of, in the race, and things aren’t that bad like everybody’s saying.”Fighting mononucleosis to start 2008, Federer lost to Djokovic in the semifinals of the Australian Open, and Djokovic went on to win his first Grand Slam title. Federer then lost to Nadal in the finals of the French Open and Wimbledon.When asked whom he wanted to play in the final, Federer smiled. “Who do I prefer? I prefer the trophy, that’s what I prefer,” he said. But he eventually acknowledged that he wanted to meet Nadal, who leads their series, 12-6.“What we went through at Wimbledon, and in Paris and all the tough matches we’ve had over the years, it’s always nice to play him,” Federer said.“I won’t be surprised if Andy would beat Rafa, but just I think the meaning would be more to play against Rafa here at the Open. We’ll see what happens.”'"

"'08-09-07,'0','And it could be seen in the ubiquitous slogan “Country First” — as in, Mr. McCain puts it there, Mr. Obama does not.The changes in Mr. McCain’s operation were noted approvingly by Republican leaders, who once despaired at his chances against Mr. Obama. “It’s steadily improving — in terms of performance, organization, offense,” said Fergus Cullen, the party chairman in New Hampshire. “There were definitely early bumps and now things are getting accomplished.”Mr. Rove said Mr. Schmidt’s increased authority — which came about after what amounted to a coup by Mr. Schmidt and other McCain aides with ties to the 2004 campaign, that gave him equal status with the campaign manager, Rick Davis — has been the best thing to have happened to Mr. McCain.“Since the elevation of Schmidt and his new responsibilities, he’s given the campaign a new focus and energy and drive that’s been very impressive,” Mr. Rove said. “They’ve had a much better July and August than April and May.”Still, the new tone has been jarring to some veterans of Mr. McCain’s presidential run in 2000 who worry that the campaign exudes a cynicism that undercuts the senator’s old reputation for “straight talk” and a more elevated style of politicking. On a number of occasions, Mr. McCain’s campaign advertisements have been described by campaign watchdog organizations as false or misleading, particularly those attacking Mr. Obama on tax votes.And the level of aggressiveness and risk-taking advocated by the hard-charging Mr. Schmidt leads to misses as well as hits; it certainly stands in contrast to the more orderly, controlled Obama campaign.“It’s quite different, often strikingly so, sometimes alarmingly so,” Todd Harris, who was an adviser to Mr. McCain’s 2000 campaign, said of the tone now compared with the tone then. “But it’s important to realize that we lost in 2000, so I’m not sure we’re in any position to give lectures about how to effectively win a national election with John McCain.”It was just that sort of thinking that led Mr. McCain to give Mr. Schmidt and his street-brawling style of politics such prominence.Mr. Schmidt is not quite a grand political strategist or tactician like Mr. Rove. His role for Mr. Bush in 2004 was running the war room — orchestrating often savage attacks on opponents, responding instantly to breaking news, digging up damaging information and pushing back on any criticism — and that shoot-first mentality infuses the culture of the retooled McCain campaign.But with a drill sergeant’s hectoring and a football coach’s motivating, Mr. Schmidt, a thick tower of man with a shaved head who can go from jovial to belligerent in an instant, has largely imposed on Mr. McCain’s once loose and feuding campaign the Bush tenets for success: relentless consistency in a combative message honed to disqualify opponents, hammered home by a campaign with clean lines of command.“He brings a single-minded intensity and focus to the campaigns he’s involved in,” said Howard Wolfson, who oversaw the war room of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as an adviser in her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. “He’s the guy who knows the value of waking up every day and knowing what you are going to say at end of the day about your candidate and your opponent.”Mr. Schmidt is considered by members of both parties to have a superior sense of a greatly altered news media environment, caused by the proliferation of political Web sites and blogs, providing all different ways of getting out information. This new environment, he has told friends, is easily manipulated because of round-the-clock thirst for news, increased competition, lowered standards created by the proliferation of outlets and hunger for the outrageous.It was Mr. Schmidt, a fan of both pop culture and Ultimate Fighting, who pressed for the campaign to include Britney Spears and Paris Hilton in advertisements attacking Mr. Obama, aides said. It was Mr. Schmidt, they said, who pushed to drive blogs and other media organizations to present Mr. Obama’s outdoor convention setting as a pretentious temple by circulating photographs of columns and sending out a news release calling it the “Temple of Obama,” which were gobbled up by Web sites and cable television shows.“He can recognize the absurdity of politics, and is an occasional practitioner,” said Brian Jones, who served with Mr. Schmidt on the Bush campaign and, for a time, on the McCain campaign. “He understands how people relate to politics in a real tactile way. Why would this guy build a stage set that looks like a Temple of Zeus?”Mark Salter, a senior McCain adviser, said Mr. Schmidt had brought a new mentality to this campaign. “I had no experience with a national campaign,” Mr. Salter said. “My experience was I worked in the 2000 primary in a contest that died after Super Tuesday. And modern campaigns really changed after 2004.”If some of Mr. McCain’s friends are distressed at the tone and nature of the campaign, Mr. McCain knew what he was getting with Mr. Schmidt, as he gradually drew him from part-time status — his wife and two children live in California, and for a while, Mr. Schmidt was making weekly trips to visit them — into an ever-greater role. Mr. Schmidt had helped oversee the war rooms of the National Republican Congressional Committee during the 2002 races, the 2004 Bush campaign and the White House’s Supreme Court nomination fights on behalf of Samuel A. Alito Jr. and John G. Roberts Jr.Mr. Schmidt traveled with Mr. McCain for the first part of the year. But Mr. McCain sent him back to the headquarters in Northern Virginia after Republican complaints about Mr. McCain’s struggling campaign, epitomized by that Green Wall episode.Mr. Schmidt gave the war room a more central place in Mr. McCain’s campaign, streamlining its decision making so only a few key aides decide what is worthy of response and, more important in Mr. Schmidt’s view, what presents an opportunity to attack Mr. Obama as elite, out of touch and lacking substance. Junior aides work shifts across 24 hours, scouring news outlets for tidbits with the potential to embarrass Mr. Obama through circulation to bloggers, the Drudge Report, cable news and newspapers.“Folks are playing closer attention, there’s more focus, the arguments are more precise, they cut more cleanly,” said Danny Diaz, communications director of the Republican National Committee, adding that Mr. Davis and other staff members deserved credit as part of what several aides called a more cohesive team.At the Democratic convention last month, a team of McCain and Republican Party operatives dispatched by Mr. Schmidt huddled in a Denver war room sprung into action when they found what they considered a gem: a photograph of Mr. Obama’s stage set at Invesco Field that they thought looked like a Roman or Athenian ruin.The room exploded with a whoop of “boo-yah,” and instantly went to work, pressing the perception to receptive reporters and producing heavy coverage throughout the Web, newspapers and cable news.That sort of speed and spirit inevitably leads to some mistakes. Three months after Mr. Schmidt’s “Fun Steve is dead” declaration, there was Mr. McCain giving his acceptance speech at the convention on Thursday night. His backdrop? A shimmering screen of green, until it was switched over to a more dignified blue.'"

"'08-09-07,'0','Then John West makes his entrance as Carmen Ghia, the super-skinny, super-swishy “common-law assistant” to the famous Broadway producer Roger De Bris. Mr. West’s performance must be the finest embodiment of gay elation since Sean Hayes first took on the role of Jack in the sitcom “Will & Grace.” Much of the cast joins in the musical number “Keep It Gay,” which is deliciously life- and sexual-preference-affirming.Karyn McNay as Ulla, the sexy Swedish actress/receptionist/cleaning woman, knocks the audience for a loop too. Her stage presence is enhanced by her seemingly perfect body, and her first exit receives a burst of spontaneous applause. Then in Act II, she proves that she can really sing.The theater’s Web site says, “All performances are directed to all seat locations,” but it didn’t feel that way to me. Sitting at Table 122, on one side of the thrust stage, was a little like watching the show from the wings.At Westchester Broadway’s dinner theater, the dinner and the theater are two very separate propositions. Meal service begins at 6:15 p.m., and many theatergoers arrive as early as 6. But unless you and your friends or family have an awful lot to chat about, 7 p.m. is probably a better idea. Service is fast and friendly.You’ll find the menu on your table, along with a program and fliers for other programs. There are seven entree choices: prime rib, two chicken dishes (saltimbocca and Provençal), two fish dishes (tilapia and fillet of sole), one vegetarian choice (eggplant parmigiana) and boneless roast of pork loin. I chose the pork loin, partly because I had ordered the wine that was recommended to go with it. There are six wine choices, ranging from $6.50 to $9.50 a glass. My main course was good, in a hearty coffee-shop-lunch way.There’s a basket of rolls on each table but no bread plates. The Caesar salad is a little overdressed. Theatergoers can order appetizers for an additional charge (the shrimp cocktail is $9.50). Although dessert is included with the ticket price, so-called luxury desserts are available, for several dollars more. So are specialty drinks in souvenir glasses. These extras are advertised on two lighted signs high on the theater walls, which is something you don’t see at the Walter Kerr or the Winter Garden. Broadway theaters generally don’t have emcees either, but hey, at dinner theater you can have the nice man announce that you or your spouse or your best friend is celebrating a birthday that night.There must be some good, practical reason for the strange salmon-colored tablecloth fabric, which resembles something you would use for cheap automobile seat covers. I can only think of one: You’re paying less than $90 for dinner and a theater ticket.The check arrives at intermission, which is a leisurely half-hour long. The two glasses of white wine come to $16. The notation “Dinner value $35” is confusing at first, but it’s just there to help theatergoers figure the tip. With the combination dinner-theater ticket, drinks and gratuity, the evening, for one person, comes to $114. That’s just $4 more than the cost of most Broadway musical orchestra-seat tickets alone.So what the heck — go for the shrimp cocktail.'"
"'08-09-07,'0','Perhaps it’s a result of photographers looking for flattering shots, but pleasure is almost always written on the customers’ faces. Two girls, one with a ribbon in her hair and an anxious finger in her mouth, sit with anticipation as the Whip is about to hurl them around. A manager of the S. Klein’s department store on Union Square in Manhattan looks pleasantly embarrassed to be spending the day with two dozen of his saleswomen — the Mother’s Club.“These represent family amusement at a time of stress,” said Patricia N. Dohrenwend, director of the archives, as she showed off some photographs. “It took them away from their worries. It evokes a period when people were trying to escape.”There was a prudishness that today can startle. Men were not allowed to bathe topless at the pool and beach — that’s right, men — until a change in fashion overwhelmed even Rye. One photograph shows a sign: “Undressing in Cars Prohibited by Law/$5 Fine.” The reason, said Gray Williams Jr., a Westchester historian, was an official county philosophy that “if you were going to have an amusement park, it was going to be civilized, respectable.”From the vantage of YouTube and of Grand Theft Auto video games, there is a touching innocence to some attractions. The photographs show that visitors could have their handwriting analyzed or their weight guessed, winning a box of candy if the purported maven was off by three pounds or more. Couples could dress up as grooms and brides against a panorama of Niagara Falls, or brave a “jungle” of lifelike animals that promised what a sign called “the realistic thrill of darkest Africa.” By 1935, when the economy was so dire that Playland had to lure customers with gimmicks, they could even win a car.Playland, whose season ends today, now draws more than 850,000 visitors a year.On a recent Tuesday when the skies were flawless, families skipping a workday and teenagers savoring the last days of summer enjoyed some of the same rides that people in the photographs did. Twelve of the original rides, including the carousel, with 66 jeweled steeds and a thrumming calliope, are still in operation.The crowd was varied to a degree that might have surprised the photograph subjects. They could have seen an Orthodox Jewish man with four boys whose ritual fringes were dangling out of their shirts, a Muslim woman in a lime-green robe and headscarf and an Asian woman in a wheelchair with a child perched on her lap.There was a caution characteristic of our time, not the 1930s, in part in recognition of occasional fatal accidents — three since 2004. “This dark ride may be too scary for children to ride alone,” warned a sign in front of a haunted-house ride. “Parents and guardians should use caution and discretion.”Peter Trahanas, an 82-year-old Greek immigrant who has operated a novelty shop on Playland’s midway since 1955, has seen these changes, but also knows that in Playland’s 80 years there have been some constants.“I think it’s important to break the monotony of work and have fun once in a while,” he said. “Life is short.”'"
"'08-09-07,'0','They are not alone. In a national survey of superintendents released in July by the American Association of School Administrators, 99 percent said that rising fuel costs had forced across-the-board cuts.“Everything is on the table,” said William Clark, chief operating officer for New Haven Public Schools, which is paying $1.9 million this year for fuel to transport 20,000 students, $623,571 more than last year.New Haven, Connecticut’s second-largest district, has focused on consolidating bus runs. “You’re finding the furthest point out and picking up as many kids as you can on the way to school,” Mr. Clark said.New Haven is also adjusting “bell times” to better “flow the routes” among its 50-odd schools, he said, and shoehorning field trips into the hours its 268 buses are contracted for.Such efficiencies allowed the system to add a new school this year without adding the six new buses that it would normally have been required to contract for, at a cost of $68,000 per year per bus, said Teddi Barra, New Haven’s transportation director. If costs get worse, field trips may go, Mr. Clark said, along with other expenditures not required by the state, like after-school buses.Field trips have already taken a hit in the Middle Country school district on Long Island, where Roberta A. Gerold, the schools superintendent, faced a 45 percent increase in fuel costs. “Where we have local field trips and can hire coaches” — meaning private buses — “we’ll try to do that,” she said. Students will take more “virtual field trips,” exploring places by computer, she said.In New Jersey, some districts plan to pare “courtesy busing” for students who live closer than the distance required by the state for free busing — two miles for elementary students and two and a half miles for high school. Steven Cea, business manager for West Milford Township schools, is making cuts as he tries to cover an expected transportation shortfall of $78,000. About 3,500 students could be affected in the district, which covers 80 square miles, Mr. Cea said.West Milford is reorganizing bus routes and teaming with districts to transport special-needs students and athletic teams, an approach many districts have taken or are considering.To save on fuel costs, many districts in Connecticut have joined fuel-buying consortiums. Fred Hurley, the Newtown district’s director of public works, locked in diesel at $3.07 a gallon in March with the Capitol Region Purchasing Council.In New York and New Jersey, districts often save money by buying fuel under a state bid. But many private bus companies provide their own fuel and have contracts that allow them to impose surcharges when fuel prices rise. Some districts are hoping to gain control of costs by curtailing such contracts and expanding their own fleets.Ms. Reitano, the transportation supervisor in Monroe, N.J., fuels her 64 in-house buses, eight of which she added this year, with diesel bought under a state contract. About 75 percent of her fleet is district-owned, she said. “We can run our own buses for less money,” she said.The Middle Country district is seeking savings through alternative fuels. It added one compressed-natural-gas-powered bus to its 120-bus fleet this year, and won bond approval last May for 18 more, Ms. Gerold, the superintendent, said.IN Piscataway, N.J., where transportation costs are up about 4.5 percent from last year, the district bought 22 new buses this year to supplement 107 buses run by private companies with fuel-included contracts, said Brian DeLucia, business administrator for the Piscataway Township Schools. The district also signed on to the state’s fuel-purchasing contract. “We’re projecting a solid $200,000 — a nice little chunk of change — in savings this year,” he said.For some districts, particularly those in the middle of multiyear agreements, such arrangements may simply postpone the pain. Brad A. Cohen, vice president of B and B Transportation in Bethany, Conn., said that some of his school contracts last year left him covering diesel increases, even as his costs for tires, parts and repairs increased.In the future, B and B will put fuel clauses in every contract to pass on costs to districts, said Mr. Cohen, whose 75 buses serve three public school districts, Woodbridge, Bethany and Amity, and seven private schools.Some districts are already getting a preview of the higher costs: In Milford, Conn., the price for busing of private school students tutored out-of-district went up 20 to 30 percent, said Phillip Russell, deputy superintendent of operations. And when Yonkers recently put out a bid for vans to be used during the school day, “the bids came back about 80 percent higher than the previous year we’d bid them out,” said Jerrilynne Fierstein, the district’s communications director. “We decided not to get them.”Federal relief may be coming. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York plans to introduce bills this month calling for the Energy Department to award emergency grants to low-income districts and to expand tax credits to make hybrid school buses more affordable. Whether districts will invest in hybrids, which can cost $100,000 more than diesel buses, is far from certain.“I don’t think in this climate you’re going to see districts going out and replacing buses that they don’t immediately need to replace,” said Lisa P. Davis, executive director of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association. “You’re going to find districts looking at ways to improve efficiency within what they’re already doing.”'"
"'08-09-07,'0','Robert Macfarlane’s review of Paul Theroux’s “Ghost Train to the Eastern Star” (Aug. 24) goes to great lengths to describe the author as compulsive, obsessive, immodest, hypertrophied in self-esteem and, most demeaning of all, possessed of a malignant, egotistical narcissism amounting to only dull vanity. As a practicing psychiatrist, I rarely see narcissism accompanied by personal insight — let alone the sort of detailed and fascinating insights into the mental machinations of others that are customary in Theroux. True, the hallmark of his writing has always been the spare, but cutting, characterological autopsies of those he encounters, but he has also effectively skewered himself (“My Other Life”). Laying bare his faults and foibles, he has often waxed on about his own faltering self-­confidence. That so many seem to find Theroux’s later ramblings more tiresome than artful may mean it’s because he goes where few writers have gone before: deep into the psyche’s landscape.I say hats off to a man able to so eloquently examine our world and his own life’s work. Despite our personal and planetary deterioration, Theroux shows the earth still has a lot to offer.'"
"'08-09-07,'0','Naming your brand AAAAAAAAAA is a bit like having a band called !!! Confusing, yet strangely memorable. Daria Dazzan, an Italian-born 24-year-old former student at Antwerp’s Royal Academy of Fine Arts, and her boyfriend, the product designer Matteo Cibic, unveiled their clothing line with the sly moniker at the spring Milan Furniture Fair. (Why they avoided fashion week is a long, unfathomable story.) Having moved most of their production to Vicenza, the headquarters of Italian houses like Bottega Veneta, they wished to design something honoring the classic tailoring traditions of the area, but with a twist. The result is a single trouser style and matching suspenders reproduced in seemingly endless colors and linings. The fabrics, including everything from fine Italian wool to denim, are off cuts from neighboring ateliers; they are used only once, so no two pairs are alike. The cut is slim and low-rise, with a slightly tapered leg, and the suspenders fasten in the back via small buttons of corozo nut. “They’re very elegant trousers to wear to a party,” Cibic says, “or to work as a mechanic.” [?][?][?]JILL SINGER'"

"'08-09-07,'0','IT was a makeover that set Hollywood drooling. In 1998 a movie actress who was most famous for being the wife of Tom Cruise took her first step onto a Broadway stage and was instantly transformed into her own dazzling woman. O.K., maybe it wasn’t that simple. But there’s no question that Nicole Kidman’s professional life was kicked into a new, loftier orbit after she starred in “The Blue Room,” David Hare’s adaptation of “La Ronde.”Before that, her film parts had leaned toward the decorative category of The Girl (including one in a Batman movie). After, she was getting the kind of roles that Meryl Streep regularly landed: tormented characters with foreign accents and Academy Award potential. Within a few years Ms. Kidman had been disencumbered of Mr. Cruise and picked up an Oscar for playing Virginia Woolf, if you please, in “The Hours.”A decade later another Mrs. Tom Cruise (the third, to be exact) is making her Broadway debut. That’s Katie Holmes, whose supporting role in the revival of Arthur Miller’s “All My Sons,” that of a true-blue hometown sweetheart with a conflicted conscience, is modest compared with the five lustful characters embodied by Ms. Kidman in “The Blue Room.” But it seems fair to imagine that Ms. Holmes (another actress who appeared as The Girl in a Batman movie) is hoping that at least some of the career-rejuvenating fairy dust Broadway sprinkled on Ms. Kidman will fall upon her too. (“All My Sons,” also starring John Lithgow, Dianne Wiest and Patrick Wilson, scheduled to open on Oct. 16 at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater.)Broadway, it seems, has eclipsed Playboy as the place to make Hollywood pay attention. There was a time when female movie stars who felt they were being ignored by the industry took off their clothes for Hugh Hefner’s magazine. Now they brush up their Shakespeare — or Schnitzler or Miller — and hit Gotham. Of course if you can manage to be naked while appearing in a production with cultural cachet, as Ms. Kidman did, then you’re really in business.Ms. Holmes, as far as I know, is remaining fully dressed in “All My Sons.” It’s Daniel Radcliffe, the young actor who achieved international celebrity as the title character in the Harry Potter movie franchise, who bids fair to pull a Nicole this season. Mr. Radcliffe will be doing the full monty in the revival of Peter Shaffer’s “Equus” (also starring Richard Griffiths and set to open on Sept. 25 at the Broadhurst Theater), a psychological melodrama with a certain literary heft.The timing is most auspicious for Mr. Radcliffe, whose performance in “Equus” in London garnered admiring reviews. The Potter series, after all, is nearing its end. And while Mr. Radcliffe has yet to leave adolescence, he is probably as tired of being The Boy (especially That Boy) as Ms. Holmes is of being The Girl. They grow up so quickly these days.'"

"'08-09-08,'1','A mysterious midair disaster on an international flight is the starting point of J. J. Abrams’s “Fringe,” a new science-fiction series on Fox.That’s also how Mr. Abrams began his last major television hit, “Lost.” His new venture, to be introduced in an opulent 90-minute pilot on Tuesday night, could just as easily be called “Found.” This plane doesn’t crash; passengers and crew are present and accounted for, only they are all dead, melted actually, by unknown forces that lead investigators to the far edges of technology and hypothetical science.And as pilots go, this one is sensational, an artful, suspenseful mix of horror, science fiction, layered conspiracies and extended car chases. “Fringe” sets out to stretch the boundaries of conventional network series. So did “Lost” when it began in 2004, but that ABC show was unlike any other drama in recent memory: characters stranded on a tropical island seemingly stalked by unknown and perhaps paranormal forces.“Fringe” treads on more familiar territory. It is a lot like “The X-Files,” only this variation pairs a trusting female F.B.I. agent with a scientifically minded and skeptical male sidekick. There is even a hint of the paranoia that fueled another hit Mr. Abrams helped shape, “Alias.” (“Fringe” also pays homage to the 1980 movie “Altered States” with drug-induced hallucinations in an immersion tank and Blair Brown, who here plays a creepy business executive.)The pilot is so packed with showy special effects and spiraling plot twists that it’s hard to tell whether subsequent episodes can live up to its premise. The paranormal can pall, but actually it’s not the fringe science that is hard to swallow — it’s the fringe bureaucracy. Viewers are asked to believe many implausible things, including state-of-the-art technological efficiency at Logan International Airport in Boston. The Department of Homeland Security allows a young F.B.I. agent to investigate a case almost single-handedly that involves weapons of mass destruction. She pursues bizarre leads and cuts through red tape, waving the Patriot Act with almost no supervision or backup.'"

"'08-09-08,'1','New York City’s mass-transit system is deteriorating and desperately underfunded. The politicians know this, but they are still providing far too little in the way of financing. The result is that the system’s users, many of them already suffering from tough economic times, could be stuck with the bill.Neither the city nor the state is paying its fair share, despite what they claim. With the Metropolitan Transportation Authority facing a budget gap of nearly $1 billion next year, direct subsidies from both governments last year totaled about $600 million, not much more than what they were a decade ago, according to the nonpartisan Independent Budget Office. Adjusted for inflation, subsidies have actually declined, saddling riders with an ever-increasing burden.The main problem is that New York’s state legislators have failed to put a dependable source of financing — like congestion pricing — in place. Transit has been forced to rely on fluctuating taxes from real estate and other sources and, increasingly, rising fares.A one-two punch of back-to-back fare hikes and reduced service seems likely if New York’s elected leaders don’t approve significant new subsidies or a solid revenue-generating plan.The M.T.A. has said it needs the city and state together to contribute an additional $300 million next year. State lawmakers say they are awaiting the recommendations of a commission led by Richard Ravitch, expected after the November elections. Mayor Michael Bloomberg insists that the city has already done its part, contributing $1.2 billion last year.But Mr. Bloomberg gets to his $1.2 billion figure by including not only the city’s direct subsidies, which are what really matters, but also an assortment of other kinds of payments that do not directly benefit the M.T.A. They include $344 million in interest payments on money the city borrowed for previous transit aid.'"

"'08-09-08,'1','The second-ranked Jankovic, who was No. 1 for a week last month, might have lost the match but she won over the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd during the award presentation. She started off by thanking everyone and her drivers. While accepting the runner-up trophy, she said: “I lost my No. 1 ranking. It’s not fair.”Then, as Williams was being presented with her $1.5 million check, Jankovic asked, “How much did I get?”The answer, as she would soon find out, was $750,000. “So now I have a lot of money to spend,” she said, laughing, in her news conference. “Tomorrow is my day to go shopping.”The match had tense rallies and dizzying momentum swings. Jankovic had 15 winners and 22 unforced errors. Williams finished with 44 winners, offsetting her 39 unforced errors. Emboldened by her Olympic gold medal in doubles with her older sister Venus, Williams came to the net 22 times in the second set and won 20 of the points.It was little wonder that the match was high on drama. Williams is a card-carrying member of the Screen Actors Guild, and Jankovic, who has battled a host of injuries from head to toe this year, has said she probably would have gone to school and studied theater if she hadn’t become a professional tennis player.“I got the trophy here,” Jankovic said, “and I thought, you know, I should have gotten an Oscar for all this drama throughout the week. Despite, you know, getting a trophy, I should have gotten, you know, a trophy for the acting, for my drama. I think I’ve done a great job.”No woman has gone so long between stints at the top as Williams, who came into the tournament ranked No. 3 and will overtake Ana Ivanovic, who lost in the second round. “I can’t believe I’m No. 1,” she said. “It’s been so long.”Williams did not drop a set in the tournament and lost 40 games. It was a performance reminiscent of 2002, when she did not drop a set and beat Venus in the first women’s prime-time final.As ecstatic as she was after match point, Williams made it clear in her news conference 90 minutes later that nine was not enough. “I’m pushing the doors to double digits, which I obviously want to get to,” she said, adding, “I feel like I can do it.”Williams’s place in the pantheon of American luminaries was secure no matter what happened Sunday. That it had been five years since she held the No. 1 ranking did not preclude the two men behind the recent HBO documentary “The Black List” from including her in their portraits of 22 of the most fascinating and influential black Americans.The 26-year-old Williams joined, among others, the Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison and the former Secretary of State Colin Powell in pulling back the curtain to reveal the challenges and rewards of black life in the United States.“I felt honored that they wanted me to speak on it and to be a part of it,” Williams said. “I was so excited to do it.”Morrison talked about how writing was her only “free place,” an unfiltered outlet for her expression. The tennis court is that place for Williams, an entertainer inexorably drawn to the spotlight. Her flair for drama makes each of her matches an improvisational play in two or three acts.While Morrison and Williams would appear to have much in common, Williams said she found Powell’s interview the most illuminating. “I was really struck by his story,” she said, “and everything he was saying.”That is Williams in a sound bite, running around the obvious answer the way her opponents might a ball hit to their weak sides. In interview rooms, as on the court, Williams is famous for keeping her antagonists off balance.When it comes to tennis, Williams has steadfastly adhered to her own script. Along with Venus, she began playing on public courts in Compton, a Southern California community that never will be confused with a tennis hotbed.She was not a fixture on the junior circuit, and when she and Venus turned professional, as teenagers, they continued to take classes toward fashion degrees, and, in Serena’s case, to pursue acting roles.In 1999, Serena won the Open for the first of 16 Williams family Grand Slam singles titles. From the beginning of 2002 through the end of 2003, Williams won five of the six majors she entered.Then she went from nearly invincible to almost invisible. Between January 2005 and December 2006, she played 44 matches, five fewer than she has in 2008. Williams’s world ranking was inching toward 140 when Chris Evert, winner of 18 Grand Slam singles titles, gently took Williams to task in an open letter in Tennis magazine for tarnishing her legacy by not maximizing her extraordinary tennis abilities.“In the short term you may be happy with the various things going on in your life,” Evert wrote, “but I wonder whether 20 years from now you might reflect on your career and regret not putting 100 percent of yourself into tennis.” Evert, whose singular devotion to tennis stoked her success, added, “I don’t see how acting and designing clothes can compare with the pride of being the best tennis player in the world.”Evert watched the final Sunday in the suite of Arlen Kantarian, the United States Tennis Association’s chief executive officer for professional tennis. Before the match, Evert conceded that in the long term the Williamses had proved her wrong.Noting that the former Nos. 1 Justine Henin, Martina Hingis and Kim Clijsters bowed out of tennis because of burnout while the Williamses have been playing as well as ever, Evert said: “Let’s put it this way. It’s opened my eyes not to be judgmental and to each his own. Whatever makes you happy. By having other interests, maybe you won’t get burned out as quickly.”Williams’s fire once again is burning bright. “I feel like I have a new career, like I feel so young and I feel so energized to play every week and to play every tournament,” she said. “I feel like there’s just so much that I can do in my career yet.”Asked for a one-word description of this year, Williams replied, “Magical,” and explained, “It was everything coming together.”'"
"'08-09-08,'1','David M. Moffett, who was appointed chief executive of Freddie Mac on Sunday, helped transform U.S. Bancorp from a small Ohio bank into the nation’s sixth biggest lender.Mr. Moffett, 56, brings a deep knowledge of the banking industry and strong relationships on Wall Street.“This job is all about interest rate risk and credit risk, and he has been analyzing that all his life,” said a longtime banker, Edward J. Kelly III.Although he is virtually unknown outside banking circles, Mr. Moffett is highly regarded on Wall Street. Alongside Jerry A. Grundhofer, he helped transform the Star Banc Corporation, a small Cincinnati lender, into a Midwestern banking powerhouse through acquisitions in the late 1990s. U.S. Bancorp’s efficient operations and solid results have helped it stand out among many of its peers in the recent credit crisis.Mr. Moffett served as U.S. Bancorp’s finance chief for nearly 14 years, overseeing financial reporting, treasury operations and real estate functions, as well as the asset and wealth management group. He left the bank in 2007 after he was passed over for the top job. He collected more than $29.3 million in salary, bonus and stock compensation from 1998 to 2007, the last period for which data are available.Mr. Moffett had been working since then as a senior adviser to the Carlyle Group, a big private equity firm in Washington. He also serves as a director on several high-profile boards, including those of eBay, E. W. Scripps and MBIA, the troubled bond insurance company. It is unclear if Mr. Moffett’s new job will require him to give up any of those positions.'"
"'08-09-08,'1','“This turmoil would directly and negatively impact household wealth: from family budgets, to home values, to savings for college and retirement,” he said. “A failure would affect the ability of Americans to get home loans, auto loans and other consumer credit and business finance. And a failure would be harmful to economic growth and job creation.”The plan received wide bipartisan support on Sunday, from Congressional lawmakers and both presidential campaigns.As part of the plan, the chief executives of both companies were replaced. , the former chairman of TIAA-CREF, the huge pension fund for teachers that also offers mutual funds, will take over Fannie Mae and succeed Daniel H. Mudd. At Freddie Mac, David M. Moffett, currently a senior adviser at the private equity firm, succeeds Richard F. Syron. Mr. Mudd and Mr. Syron, however, will stay on during a transition period.The plan also commits the government to provide as much as $100 billion to each company to backstop any shortfalls in capital. It enables the Treasury to ultimately buy the companies outright at little cost. It bans them from lobbying the government, putting an end to their ability to use their political machine on Capitol Hill.It also eliminates dividend payments to current shareholders while protecting the principal and interest payments on the debt, now held by foreign central banks, financial institutions, pensions funds and others.The Treasury will force both companies to shrink their portfolios over the long term; they now hold or guarantee about half of the country’s mortgages. In addition, the government plans to buy significant amounts of their mortgage-backed securities on the open market, beginning with the purchase of $5 billion worth this month. This step, never before undertaken by the government, could begin to restore some confidence in the credit markets and lead to lower interest rates for home mortgages.For the companies, the takeover caps an ignominious downfall. Fannie was created during the depths of the Great , and Freddie in 1970, to help make mortgages more affordable for homeowners. The companies buy billions of dollars in mortgages each month from commercial lenders. Some are sold to investors as mortgage-backed securities; others are held by the companies in their own investment portfolios.The plan represents a cease-fire in a decades-long ideological battle over the proper role of the companies. Free-market conservatives see the companies as extensions of “big government,” while Democrats have protected them as the main vehicle to promote affordable housing for middle- and lower-income people., the former Federal Reserve chairman, and , a Treasury secretary under President , along with many other critics, have long maintained that the companies were too powerful politically and financially, and that their huge portfolios posed enormous risks to the financial system.Moreover, these critics have complained, the companies have used their ability to borrow at low interest rates to dominate the mortgage-finance market, usurping the role of other financial institutions, which do not have the same subsidy.Free-market adherents have warned of impending disaster as Fannie and Freddie used an implicit government backing to borrow at will, with only a tiny sliver of capital to protect them from nasty surprises like the recent sharp decline in housing prices and rise in foreclosures.Mr. Paulson has sought to avoid taking sides in the debate, but in recent months came to the conclusion that the companies’ conflicting missions of providing federally backed financing for affordable housing while serving shareholders were untenable.“Market discipline is best served when shareholders bear both the risk and the reward of their investment,” Mr. Paulson said on Sunday. “While conservatorship does not eliminate the common stock, it does place common shareholders last in terms of claims on the assets of the enterprise.”Holders of the companies’ common stock will not fare well. The plan suspends their dividend payments and holds the potential to make their shares virtually worthless if the government chooses to exercise its right to buy the common stock. The stock of both companies, which traded above $60 a share last year, had fallen below $10 a share recently. Their shares will continue to trade and could fall further as a result of the government .Mr. Paulson made clear that the solution put forward on Sunday would only defer the most important decisions about the mission of the companies for the next president and Congress.At a news conference on Sunday, Mr. Paulson said: “There is a consensus today that these enterprises pose a systemic risk and they cannot continue in their current form. Government support needs to be either explicit or nonexistent, and structured to resolve the conflict between public and private purposes.”The plan requires the companies to shrink their portfolios long after the administration leaves, officials acknowledged, adding that they hoped to prod Congress into deciding what the role of the companies should be.Hoping to limit potential taxpayer losses and gain any financial windfall if the companies are restored to profitability, the administration, in exchange for the investment commitment, will receive so-called stock warrants, or purchase rights, for up to 80 percent of the companies’ common shares at less than $1 a share. In after-hours trading on Sunday, Freddie Mac fell $1.06, or nearly 21 percent while Fannie Mae dropped $1.54, or 22 percent.The companies agreed to provide the government with $1 billion of new preferred senior stock, which will pay the Treasury a dividend of at least 10 percent a year, as well as an unspecified quarterly payment to compensate the Treasury for any taxpayer money injected into the companies.The companies will be allowed to “modestly increase” the size of their existing investment portfolios until the end of 2009, which means they can use some of their new taxpayer-supplied capital to buy and hold new mortgages in investment portfolios.But in a strong indication of Mr. Paulson’s wish to wind down the companies’ portfolios, drastically shrink their role and perhaps eliminate their unique status altogether, the plan calls for the companies to start reducing their investment portfolios 10 percent a year, beginning in 2010.In addition, the Treasury Department will create a so-called Secured Lending Credit Facility, a backup source of borrowing for the companies in the event that they cannot borrow enough money on the open market to finance their main business of buying mortgages and reselling them as pools of mortgage-backed securities.While the government takeover seemed to catch some financial experts by surprise, Treasury officials appeared to have little choice, with the credit markets in a tailspin and investors reluctant to buy mortgages with even a hint of risk. Fannie and Freddie now guarantee about 70 percent of all new home loans, said Mr. Lockhart, the chief regulator of the companies.The initial reaction to the plan was mostly positive. Senator , the Republican nominee for president, said on ’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday that he supported the Treasury move, but he also implicitly criticized the Bush administration’s oversight.“It’s an example of cronyism, special interest, lobbyists,” he said, adding that the companies needed “more regulation, more oversight, more transparency, more of everything, and frankly, a dramatic reduction in what they do.”Senator , the Democratic nominee for vice president, said on ’s “Meet the Press” Sunday that he had spoken to Mr. Paulson on Saturday night, and that he thought the plan had a good chance of succeeding. “It’s not an official reorganization. It will be left to the next administration and the Congress to make those judgments,” Mr. Biden said.After being briefed by Mr. Paulson, the billionaire investor said: “Secretary Paulson has made exactly the right decision for the country. He is minimizing the problem of moral hazard and maximizing the benefits for the housing market and for the smooth functioning of financial markets.”Democratic and Republican lawmakers also spoke approvingly of the decision. They said that restoring stability to the financial markets was the top priority. But some longtime critics of the companies complained that their warnings had gone unheeded for too long.“Fannie and Freddie were allowed to grow too quickly and for too long without the strong oversight required of such government chartered firms,” said Senator , Republican of , who is facing a tough campaign for re-election.Asian stock markets rallied at the opening on Monday after the Treasury’s announcement. The market rose 2.8 percent and ’s market jumped 3.2 percent.Futures contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index jumped more than 2 percent in early Asian trading as investors concluded that the decision had strengthened the prospects for American businesses, particularly banks, and for the American economy.The dollar and yen weakened against the euro and the British pound by late Monday morning in as investors began to conclude that European economies might not be in as grave danger as they had seemed last week.Treasury officials emphasized that the companies would open for business as usual on Monday and that, at least for now, almost nothing would change in their normal course of business.'"
"'08-09-08,'1','Murray has won two of the three matches he has played against Federer, and his ranking will rise to a career-high No. 4 on Monday. Once buckling under the national pressure — the last British player to reach an Open final was Greg Rusedski in 1997 — Murray is now flexing his confidence, his improved fitness and his biceps with each match.Even the actor Will Ferrell seemed to feel the power Sunday, when he was shown on the scoreboard imitating Murray’s arm curl.Murray had just scampered to another short Nadal shot in the fourth set, flicking a backhand winner and spinning around to hold his serve. Murray was so relaxed on the changeover, he looked up and laughed at his favorite actor, hamming it up for the crowd.Few people saw Murray put on a show Saturday at Louis Armstrong Stadium, where he and Nadal started 90 minutes after Federer and Novak Djokovic began their semifinal next door at Arthur Ashe Stadium.Nadal and Murray were told of the plan an hour before they were to begin, and suddenly Murray had taken the first two sets from Nadal, the reigning champion at the sport’s last three biggest events: the Olympics, Wimbledon and the French Open.When the rain came at 2:41 p.m. Saturday, Nadal held a 3-2 lead in the third set and was up a break. He said he was thankful to regroup, and was classy after his defeat Sunday when talking about the wrench in scheduling.“It wasn’t the best moment because it was a semifinals of the U.S. Open, but at the same time, never is a good moment, no?” said Nadal, a 22-year-old Spaniard. “I tried my best, I wasn’t very fresh during all the tournament.” He added of Murray, “He beat me because he was better than me.”Standing far behind the baseline, Murray anticipated Nadal’s left-handed kick serves and his topspin-laden ground strokes, then countered with clever change-of-pace shots that kept Nadal off balance. Last November, Murray fired Brad Gilbert as his coach and hired two coaches and two fitness trainers. Murray, who is from Scotland and had trained in Barcelona, Spain, since he was 15, trained with his new team last December at the University of Miami, where he did 400-meter sprint repeats on a track.“The pain that you feel off the court, when you’re running around the track, is much worse than anything you feel on the tennis court,” Murray said. “When you go into matches and you’ve worked hard, you don’t have any excuses when you get on the court. You just think about tennis.”In the past, Murray would become distracted by muscle cramping or by his emotions. But he survived a five-set match in the third round here, coming back from two sets down to another left-hander, Jürgen Melzer of Austria. He needed four hours to beat Juan Martín del Potro in the quarterfinals.Murray said he was not upset by the postponement Saturday night. “I slept absolutely fine, I didn’t feel nervous,” he said.When the players stepped on Ashe Stadium at 4:30 p.m. Sunday, Nadal sprinted and skipped, ready for his comeback. Capitalizing on his break in the third set Saturday, Nadal finished the set and gained momentum early in the fourth.Nadal was serving the second game, and it turned into a dazzling 22-point, 15-minute epic that featured eight deuces and seven unsuccessful break points for Murray. When Nadal held to tie the set at 1-1 and two minutes later broke Murray, it appeared he would surge to the fifth set.“It was almost slipping away slightly,” Murray said.But he was not deflated, only energized. He got the break back in the sixth game. With Nadal serving at 4-5 to keep the match going, Murray got lucky with a net cord in the first point. But he caused his own luck by striking a wicked one-handed slice backhand to set up match point.The only major title Murray has won was the United States Open boys championship in 2004. That was when he first fell in love with New York. “It was the first time I ever stayed in a five-star hotel,” Murray said. “We got to eat in the same restaurant as the pro players here.”Now he is a star here, big enough of a draw to meet Will Ferrell and big enough of a talent to meet Roger Federer in the final.'"
"'08-09-08,'1','Herbert M. Allison Jr., who was named chief executive of Fannie Mae on Sunday, brings to the job nearly three decades of experience on Wall Street, as well as deep ties to Washington.Mr. Allison, 63, worked for Merrill Lynch for almost 30 years, rising to the positions of president and chief operating officer. Later, he ran the finance committee for Senator John McCain’s 2000 presidential campaign and became the chairman and chief executive of TIAA-Cref, the big money management company.Mr. Allison began his career at Merrill Lynch in 1971, after graduating with a degree in philosophy from Yale, serving in the Navy and earning a master’s degree in business administration from Stanford.While at Merrill Lynch, he lived in London, Paris and Tehran, where he met his wife. He returned to the United States and a series of senior jobs at the brokerage. In 1997, he vied to succeed Daniel P. Tully as the head of the firm, but lost out when David H. Komansky was named chief executive.Mr. Allison was named president, but the partnership did not last long. In 1998, after a tumultuous period in the markets, Mr. Allison oversaw large layoffs at Merrill. The next year, he resigned after being told he would not succeed Mr. Komansky, said a person involved in the discussions. He left long before Merrill became mired in the current mortgage crisis.After joining TIAA-Cref, Mr. Allison fired 500 employees, or about 8 percent of the work force, in a round of cutbacks that employees nicknamed Herbicides.'"
"'08-09-08,'1','ATLANTA (AP) — Matt Ryan hopped down the field to celebrate after his first N.F.L. pass, knocking down his center, Todd McClure, along the way.That was about the only stumble as the Atlanta Falcons started a new era.Ryan became the first quarterback in eight years to throw for a touchdown with his first pass, Michael Turner rushed for a team-record 220 yards and the Falcons put Michael Vick in their rearview mirror with a 34-21 victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday.“He didn’t seem like a rookie,” Turner said of Ryan. “He took control of the huddle. He made all the right calls. He was a real drill sergeant out there.”Atlanta scored on its first three possessions to take a 21-0 lead. Ryan, the third overall selection in the draft, appeared worthy of the starting job he won after only three preseason games. He connected with Michael Jenkins on the third snap of the game for a 62-yard touchdown pass.The running game did most of the damage. Turner, Atlanta’s big free-agent signing, broke off a 66-yard touchdown, scored again on a 5-yard run and had another touchdown called back by a penalty. He averaged 10 yards on his carries and broke the team record of 202 yards, which was set by Gerald Riggs in 1984.'"
"'08-09-08,'1','“This is completely outrageous,” said Richard C. Ferlauto, the director of corporate governance and investment for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a large pension fund. “It is really a slap in the face to shareholders and homeowners whose loans are at risk and taxpayers footing the bill for a bailout.”Whether Mr. Mudd and Mr. Syron will collect their severance package is unclear. A spokeswoman for the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the companies’ primary regulator, declined to provide details about their exit packages. F.H.F.A. officials said the compensation of their successors, Herbert M. Allison Jr. and David M. Moffett, both longtime financial industry executives, would be “significantly lower” than that of the departing chief executives.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have enriched their top executives for years. Mr. Mudd’s predecessor at Fannie Mae, Franklin D. Raines, took home more than $52 million while he was chief executive from 1999 to 2004, according to Equilar data.Mr. Raines later agreed to forfeit several million dollars’ worth of stock and options to resolve personal claims over allegations that Fannie Mae had inflated its earnings to raise executive bonuses. Even though Fannie Mae was forced to restate its earnings, Mr. Raines walked away with at least $25 million in pension benefits, as well as stock options he did not cash in — many of which are now worthless.Mr. Syron’s predecessor at Freddie Mac, Leland C. Brendsel, took home more than $28.4 million from 1993 to 2003, the only part of his pay package that was publicly disclosed during his 13-year tenure as chief executive.The shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including many employees, will not be so lucky. The companies’ share prices have plunged about 90 percent this year, wiping out about $70 billion of shareholder value. The shares are likely to be worth little or nothing under the government’s rescue plan.As a result, Wall Street money managers and everyday investors alike stand to lose big. Bill Miller, the star mutual fund manager at Legg Mason, increased his bet on Freddie Mac even as the company’s shares plummeted this year. Last week, when Freddie Mac stock was trading at about $5, Legg Mason disclosed that it had bought an additional 30 million shares. Other value-oriented investors, including Rich Pzena and David Dreman, also placed big bets that the mortgage companies would recover. None of these money managers returned calls for comment.“I am just shocked how they missed this, and why, when it became completely clear that the problem was snowballing, guys like Bill Miller doubled down,” said Douglas A. Kass, head of Seabreeze Partners and an outspoken short-seller.For years, the shares of Fannie Mae, the larger of the two companies, have ranked among the most widely held stocks in America. Many ordinary investors believed that the company’s quasi-governmental status would insulate shareholders from big losses.“People perceived they had government support of some sort,” said Byron Wien, the chief investment strategist at Pequot Capital. “The perception was they were more secure investments than they turned out to be.”Members of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rank-and-file were big shareholders, too. Stock and options could make up a fifth of employees’ total pay.While those who bought the companies’ shares lost, short-sellers who bet against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac won. So-called short interest in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock soared in recent months as the companies’ troubles deepened.Among the most vocal short-sellers betting against the companies is William A. Ackman, who runs a hedge fund called Pershing Square Capital. Mr. Ackman was among the earliest to warn of the credit crisis, and he is believed to have landed a windfall after shorting both companies, according to a person with direct knowledge of a recent investment letter.Wall Street investment banks, meanwhile, are breathing a sigh of relief. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pay hefty fees to big Wall Street debt underwriters, and that is unlikely to change. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s business was worth $1.5 billion in fees in 2007, according to a Sanford C. Bernstein report. Through the first six months of this year, that figure sank to $600 million.Washington lobbyists, however, may be hurting. Over the last decade, Freddie Mac paid more than $94.8 million for lobbying services, in part to fend off attempts to tighten oversight, according to the Center for Responsive Politics; Fannie Mae spent about $79.5 million. The government plan will immediately eliminate that spending.Some commercial banks and insurance companies that hold the companies’ preferred stock could suffer, too. Auditors may force those investors to mark down the value of the holdings. Sovereign Bancorp, a regional lender near Philadelphia, holds about $588 million of the securities, about 13 percent of its tangible capital, according to a research report by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a securities broker.Midwest Banc Holdings, a community bank in Illinois, and Gateway Financial Holdings, which operates in Virginia and North Carolina, each have tens of millions of dollars of the preferred stock, representing more than one-third of their tangible capital, the report said. And federal banking regulators said in a joint statement that a “limited number” of smaller banks could need new financing.The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., urged those institutions to contact their regulator, which said it was “prepared to work with those institutions to develop capital-restoration plans” and other corrective actions.'"
"'08-09-08,'1','The second is to get the Russians to agree to a European Union monitoring group, as the cease-fire agreement called for, and establish its area of responsibility.The roughly 200 monitors, ideally with a United Nations mandate, would replace Russian peacekeepers in the security zone outside the two enclaves and in other disputed areas, so that Russian troops would pull back, as Russia had agreed, to positions they held before the crisis started on Aug. 7.The Europeans want Russia to accept the appointment of a high representative to run the “international mechanism” overseeing the monitors, but Russia is likely to insist on involving the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in which it has a strong voice.Then, under the cease-fire plan, talks are to start on the status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, though details remain vague and must be negotiated.The meeting’s participants had no ready answer to the Russians’ violation of Georgian territorial integrity, which the European Union has condemned as unacceptable, and no expectation that Russia would readily relent.The phrase “Georgia proper” was frequently heard this weekend to describe Georgia without the enclaves. “I agree it’s a dangerous phrase,” the Polish foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, said. “But the facts on the ground have been imposed.”Mr. Sikorski was said to be the strongest voice inside the closed meetings for a hard line with Russia and a strong statement of support for Ukraine, which meets with the European Union on Tuesday.On the sidelines, Mr. Sikorski said he favored giving Ukraine associate status in the European Union while “maintaining a European perspective” backing it for future membership in the bloc “even though it will take many years to fulfill the necessary criteria.”The British foreign secretary, David Miliband, expressed concern as to whether Moscow would regard the boundaries of the two ethnic enclaves as “hard or soft,” specifically whether foreign monitors could work inside South Ossetia and Abkhazia to investigate reports of ethnic cleansing and violence against civilians.The German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, proposed an international inquiry into the outbreak of the war, an undertaking that Russia welcomes, having accused Georgia of aggression.In response, Mr. Miliband said that he was more interested in how the war was conducted, and that “any allegation in respect of human rights abuse” should be investigated, a perspective that Georgia welcomes.But the French, who currently hold the European Union presidency, left no doubt that they were annoyed with Russia for not abiding by the cease-fire. At a news conference on Saturday, the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said of Mr. Medvedev: “Let him first respect his own signature. Of the six points, only two — or let’s say two and a half, perhaps three — have been implemented.”While Poland, Britain, Sweden and the Baltic countries pressed for a hard line toward Russia, officials said that specific sanctions were not discussed. Mr. Kouchner also refused to discuss how the 27-nation group would respond if Russia continued to delay compliance.“It depends on the Russian answer,” he said. There is no point, he said, in imposing “unuseful sanctions,” steps Russia could ignore.“Sanctions are not our word,” he said. “We must find an understanding to solve this conflict.”On Saturday, as Vice President Dick Cheney, at a conference in Italy, was speaking harshly of Russia and strongly in favor of admitting Georgia and Ukraine to NATO, and as Mr. Medvedev, in Moscow, boasted that Russia was now “a nation to be reckoned with” in what “became a different world after Aug. 8,” the Europeans were struggling to find the right message to send to Russia, which Mr. Kouchner described as a European partner and neighbor.“We all have to calm this down to get the Russians to agree to anything,” one senior European official said. “The Russians won the war, and the problem won’t be solved without the Russians. They have the territory.”'"
"'08-09-08,'1','If you are thinking of buying a home or refinancing a mortgage, the emerging consensus is that the government takeover will help stabilize rates. They might even fall a quarter of a percentage point or so, now that the government has stepped in to make its backing of Fannie and Freddie more explicit, said Kevin Iverson, who has been in the mortgage business for 30 years and is president of Reed Mortgage Corporation, a loan brokerage firm in Denver.John A. Courson, chief operating officer of the Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group, also pointed with relief to the statement by the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., on Sunday morning that Fannie and Freddie would examine the fees they charge banks for loan securitization services, “with an eye toward mortgage affordability.”Any reduction in those fees, Mr. Courson said, could help bring mortgage rates down a bit if the banks pass on the lower costs to consumers.HOME PRICES Rates certainly matter in persuading people on the sidelines to step in and start shopping for a home, so any stabilization there can only help.The overall mood in the market is also a factor, but the front-page headlines noting the government’s move may not resonate with home buyers. “I would love it if people thought that way, but they don’t connect the dots like that,” said Steve Heideman, president of United Mortgage Financial Group, a mortgage brokerage firm in Tempe, Ariz.The biggest factor weighing on home prices, aside from the overall jobs picture and the state of the economy, may now be the sheer number of homes for sale, as people try to get out from under bad mortgages or their lenders put homes on the market, having already foreclosed on them.NEW DEALS ON OLD LOANS “The government doesn’t have a great deal of interest in foreclosing on a ton of homes,” said Kurt Eggert, a law professor at Chapman University in Orange, Calif., and a former member of the Federal Reserve Board’s Consumer Advisory Council. As an example, he pointed to IndyMac, which was seized in July. Soon after, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation began offering troubled borrowers the opportunity to move into cheaper fixed-rate loans.Could a similar move happen here? Well, both Fannie and Freddie have already provided additional financial incentives to the companies that service the loans to modify some of the troubled ones. It remains to be seen how much further they can or will go to bail out homeowners, or what sort of political pressure may be put on them to do so.NEW RULES ON NEW LOANS The interest rate you pay for a mortgage depends in part on the rules that Fannie and Freddie set for the kinds of loans they will buy. Now that they have new bosses in the federal government, the rules could change.“How much authority will they have to make changes?” asked Mr. Iverson, the Denver mortgage broker. “Must they go to Congress? It’s a huge unknown for consumers.”Mr. Courson, of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said that in theory at least, credit score requirements, loan-size-to-home-value ratios and down payment requirements could come up for review.We may not know if the loan rules will change for a few months, given the potential desire to push off some of the tough decisions until after the November elections.INVESTORS While it is not yet clear whether stockholders in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be wiped out entirely, Mr. Paulson did say on Sunday that the entities “will no longer be managed with a strategy to maximize common shareholder returns.”The drop in their share prices thus far offers another lesson in the importance of diversification. If you invest in mutual funds, those funds may have lost a bit of money on Fannie and Freddie. But that is the whole point; it was just a bit, because most funds hold many securities.It is now clearer than ever that there is no such thing as a truly safe single investment — not a big savings account at IndyMac, not the auction-rate securities that have caused so many problems for scores of investors and not supposed blue-chip stocks like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac that you might buy on your own, outside of a mutual fund.Any big, focused bets are better left for hedge funds, not for you and me.'"

"'08-09-09,'0','As an act of crisis management, the government takeover of and , the mortgage-finance giants, was a reasonable and reassuring move. It ensures the flow of mortgage credit and is likely to reduce mortgage rates, which are important steps toward the eventual recovery of the ailing housing market.And it does so while putting taxpayers first for future dividends or money that may be earned when the firms are reprivatized, holding out hope that the bailout costs may someday be recouped. Beyond the immediate crisis, however, the takeover raises disturbing issues that may get lost in the tumult of the moment.¶ The need for an explicit bailout underlines the economic vulnerabilities of the United States. In July, Congress gave Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson unlimited authority to pay the debts of Fannie and Freddie and to shore up their capital, if need be. Yet investors the world over continued to doubt the companies’ viability, shunning their securities or demanding unusually high interest rates on loans. In effect, investors deemed the government’s commitment to Fannie and Freddie as either insufficient or not credible — an extraordinary vote of no confidence that, in the end, led to the bailout.¶ There is no single reason for the lack of confidence. But investors have good cause to be concerned about the deep indebtedness of the United States, about the nation’s apparent political unwillingness to restore its fiscal health and about the ability of the government to responsibly make good on its commitments. A pledge of the full faith and credit of the United States still means something. That’s why the markets responded favorably to the takeover. But investors’ refusal to accept a promise to act is another sign of the need to reverse the fiscal mismanagement of the Bush years.¶ The United States must acknowledge that its deep indebtedness is especially dangerous in times of economic crisis. The level and stability of American interest rates and of the dollar are now dependent on the willingness of foreign central banks and other overseas investors to continue lending to the United States. The bailout became inevitable when central banks in and began to curtail their purchases of the companies’ debt, pushing up mortgage rates and deepening the economic downturn.¶ The bailout is new evidence of the need for better regulation of the American financial system. As the housing bubble inflated, the Bush administration often claimed that America’s unfettered markets were the envy of the world. But, in fact, they have sowed mistrust.¶ The cost of the bailout needs to be carefully monitored. Fannie and Freddie own or back nearly $800 billion of generally junky mortgages, and some of those will inevitably go bad. So it is reasonable to assume that the cost could easily near $100 billion. There may be ways to make back some of that money later, but for a long time, the bailout will divert resources from other needs.'"
"'08-09-09,'0','GREEN BAY — For the first time since Sept. 27, 1992, someone other than Brett Favre started at quarterback in a meaningful game for the Green Bay Packers. Once Aaron Rodgers jogged onto the field five seconds into Monday night’s season opener against the Minnesota Vikings, it marked the end of a six-month stretch in which Favre retired, changed his mind, created a news-media circus at training camp without ever taking the field, and forced the Packers to trade him.Although Rodgers tried to maintain his cool, he said he felt excited as he left the tunnel and ran onto the field to the roar of a regular-season record crowd of 71,004 at Lambeau Field. Then Rodgers did a passably and ultimately successful impression of a young, swashbuckling Favre. Completing passes short and deep, and using his legs to elude trouble, Rodgers helped the Packers overcome a rash of penalties to beat the Vikings, 24-19.He finished 18 of 22 for 178 yards with a touchdown. He also had a second apparent touchdown called back because of a penalty, one of the Packers’ 12 penalties for 118 yards.“Knowing I would get the first snap was pretty special,” said Rodgers, who ran for his first professional touchdown, a 1-yard sneak with 6 minutes 3 seconds left that put the Packers ahead, 24-12. He celebrated with his first Lambeau Leap, the traditional jump into the end zone stands.“I’ve been dreaming about this for four years, to be honest,” Rodgers said. “I was hoping my first leap would be a little more flashy, a 10-yard or 15-yard run or something. But at that point in the game, I just said, what the heck, I’m going to go for it.”'"
"'08-09-09,'0','But Google’s efforts have met with only moderate success. In particular, the company has struggled to gain access to advertising time, known as inventory.Google is selling a small amount of advertising time on Dish Network, a satellite TV provider with a national reach, as well as on a small cable provider in Northern California.The deal with NBC will help the company broaden its reach.“NBC Universal is a big win for us in terms of distribution growth,” said Michael Steib, director of Google TV Ads.Google will have access to a small slice of the advertising inventory that brings in almost $6 billion a year for NBC Universal. Advertisers will be able to buy time on Sci Fi, which reaches 1.4 million viewers in prime time, as well as lower-rated cable channels.The amount of inventory to be made available to Google is “fairly small by NBC Universal standards,” said Ed Swindler, executive vice president and chief operating officer for advertising sales at NBC Universal.Most of the advertising time on NBC’s cable channels was sold during an unusually strong upfront sales period last spring. Some of the remaining time — which the industry calls scatter advertising — will be made available to Google.Mr. Swindler said the amount of inventory may be adjusted “to make sure this test is successful.” He said the deal was significant regardless of scope.“Any deal that allows us to change the model in favor of the advertiser to drive return on investment is a great deal,” he said.As it seeks to expand its reach into television, Google will face increasing competition. This year, the nation’s largest cable providers, including Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Cox, teamed up to develop their own system to place targeted ads on television. The effort is called Canoe Ventures.Analysts said that while the partnership with NBC Universal represents a victory for Google, to effectively direct its ads the company needs to gain access to data from television set-top boxes. That data is collected and controlled by cable and satellite television providers.“The only way that Google is going to take any share on TV is if they can take advantage of data to provide targeted advertising that is not available today,” said Ross Sandler, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “You need to work with an intermediary like a cable or satellite provider to target the data.”Mr. Steib said Google would use data it collected through its partnership with Dish and project it onto the larger audience of the cable networks.Mr. Sandler said this was a good first step, but added that Dish had access to only 12 percent of households in the United States, far less than Canoe Ventures.NBC intends to work with Google to adapt the advertising platform for the 10 local television stations it owns. National advertising time on NBC will not be included initially.'"
"'08-09-09,'0','The government’s takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may lead to one of the largest ever payments in the credit default swap market, analysts said on Monday.Losses to protection sellers, however, are expected to be minimal because of the high trading levels of the $1.6 trillion of outstanding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt.Credit default swaps are used to hedge against the risk of borrowers defaulting on their debt, or to speculate on a company’s credit quality. They trade in the private market, so the actual amount of protection written on Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s debt is hard to estimate.Terms in the credit default swaps contracts specify that the payments are initiated by the government’s intervention, analysts said, meaning that protection sellers must pay buyers the full amount insured.It is the first time a company in the benchmark investment-grade credit derivative index has had a credit event, a JPMorgan analyst, Eric Beinstein, said in a report on Monday.'"
"'08-09-09,'0','LONDON — The London Stock Exchange suffered its worst breakdown in eight years Monday as a computer problem prevented traders from participating in a worldwide market rally after the American government’s takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Traders arrived at their desks Monday morning expecting large volumes to change hands. Stocks had surged in Asia after the Treasury Department’s announcement of the takeover, with investors betting that the decision could herald a turning point in the credit crisis.About one hour after the market opened, some traders began to complain that they were unable to see prices or buy and sell shares because they could not connect to the exchange’s platform. Overall activity resumed seven hours later, just half an hour before the market closed for the day at 4:30 p.m.“We basically haven’t been able to trade all day,” said Jane Coffey, a senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management.The failure came at an awkward time for the London exchange’s chief executive, Clara Furse, who has come under increased criticism for failing to keep up with competitors like NYSE Euronext. New rival trading platforms — like Turquoise, an alternative cash equities trading platform started this year by a handful of powerful investment banks — are also giving the exchange a run for its money.'"
"'08-09-09,'0','TORONTO — Fox Searchlight Pictures put some heat into an otherwise cool film market this week by beating out competitors for distribution rights to “The Wrestler.”The film, which is directed by Darren Aronofsky (“The Fountain”) and stars Mickey Rourke as a retired wrestler looking to make a comeback, was picked up after a Sunday night screening at the Toronto International Film Festival.Variety, an industry trade paper, reported the acquisition price as $4 million, but a person briefed on the sale said the price was somewhat lower. The bid was nonetheless a strong one, given the surplus of films and scarcity of buyers.Fox Searchlight announced the acquisition Monday in a news release. Executives did not respond to queries about the price. Several companies became interested in the film, widely viewed as an Oscar contender, after it won the Golden Lion award a few days ago at the Venice film festival.In less heated bidding, IFC Films won the rights to “Everlasting Moments” at the festival. A family drama set at the turn of the 20th century, the film is directed by Jan Troell, who is perhaps best known for his 1971 film “The Emigrants.”The president of IFC, Jonathan Sehring, said he was hoping “Everlasting Moments” would be named Sweden’s official entry in the Oscar race.

"'08-09-09,'0','The older a man is, the more likely he is to father children who develop bipolar disorder as adults, a large Swedish study reports.Previous studies have found an association between paternal age and both autism and schizophrenia, but this is the first time a connection with bipolar illness has been suggested. The study appears in the September issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry.The researchers examined highly accurate Swedish government health records of more than seven million people with known biological parents to find 13,428 with bipolar disorder diagnosed at two or more separate hospital admissions. They matched each case with five controls, people of the same age and sex but without bipolar illness. They divided the fathers into five-year age categories beginning at 20.After statistically adjusting for the age of the mother, family history of psychotic disorders, education level and other factors, they found consistently increasing risk as fathers aged. The highest risk was in fathers 55 and older. For mothers, after adjusting for the father’s age, they found a statistically significant increase in only the 35 to 39 age group.“It’s a strong study from a methodological standpoint,” said Dr. Alan Brown, an associate professor of psychiatry at Columbia who was not involved in the study. “National registries are very important because you’re less likely to get bias and you can generalize findings across a whole country.”David Glahn, an associate professor of psychiatry at Yale, also uninvolved in the work, agreed. “The methodology is very strong,” he said. “The statistics done here are all first-rate.”'"
"'08-09-09,'0','Smoking, high cholesterol, hypertension and obesity are among the known risk factors for carotid artery stenosis, the narrowing of the arteries that supply the brain with blood, and whose blockage can lead to stroke. Now researchers may have found a new risk: heavy snoring.An Australian study had 110 volunteers, men and women 45 to 80 years old, spend the night in a sleep laboratory. Researchers timed their snoring, and used ultrasound to measure the extent of plaque in their arteries.After controlling for sex, body mass index, smoking, hypertension and other factors, they calculated that the risk for carotid artery narrowing among the heaviest snorers was 10 times the risk among those who snored the least.The mechanism for the connection is not clear, but the authors write that the vibrations of snoring may cause damage to the epithelium, the cells that line the inside of the artery, leading to inflammation and plaque buildup.The researchers, writing in the September issue of the journal Sleep, acknowledge that results in this self-selected group cannot be generalized to the entire population, and that establishing a causal relationship between snoring and artery blockage would require a much larger sample.Still, said John R. Wheatley, the lead author and an associate professor of medicine at the University of Sydney, “Heavy snoring may increase the risk for stroke, and heavy snorers should have an assessment to see if they have any other vascular risk factors.”'"
"'08-09-09,'0','The New York Times Company will shut down in January a subsidiary that distributes newspapers and magazines in the metropolitan area, the company announced Monday.The move will eliminate the equivalent of 550 full-time jobs and affect the distribution of some 200 publications.The operation, City and Suburban Delivery Systems, distributes to retail outlets like newsstands, bookstores and coffee shops in New York City, New Jersey, Westchester County and Long Island in New York, and Fairfield County in Connecticut. The move does not affect delivery to subscribers, or distribution in other parts of the country.In its place, The New York Times newspaper will increase its reliance on independent distributors, which are generally nonunion and pay drivers less than City and Suburban drivers. The employees who are laid off will receive severance, to be negotiated with their union, the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union of New York and Vicinity, the company said. The union declined to comment.The newspaper will also do some distribution with its own employees and trucks, and for that work, some of the people laid off from City and Suburban could be absorbed back into the company, a spokeswoman for the company, Catherine J. Mathis, said. “At this point,” she said, “we don’t know how that will break down” between outside contractors and distribution by The Times.'"
"'08-09-09,'0','Some doubts have already begun to emerge over whether the takeover would quickly resolve fundamental problems in the American credit and housing markets. “This wasn’t a magic wand,” said James P. Dunigan, chief investment officer for PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia. “We will probably still see some additional bank failures.”Several of the nation’s largest financial institutions are in a predicament similar to homeowners who owe more than their houses are worth. Despite the broad rally in financial stocks Monday, Lehman Brothers, the troubled investment bank, fell 12.65 percent to $14.15. The company has been trying to shore up its financial health and is considering selling a money management division and spinning off some of its distressed assets into a new company.Shares in Washington Mutual, the nation’s largest savings bank by assets, ended off 3.51 percent, to $4.12 after the bank confirmed it had replaced its chief executive and had signed an agreement with its regulators that required it to improve its risk management.Shares of smaller banks and regional financial institutions that owned many preferred shares in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also fell sharply after the government announced that it would stop paying dividends on those securities as part of the overall bailout.Federal banking regulators on Sunday told banks to write down the value of those shares, which lost most of their value on Monday, as did the common shares of the two companies.“This is a step that the Treasury had to take,” Maxwell E. Bublitz, a strategist at SCM Advisors, an investment firm in San Francisco, said of the takeover of Fannie and Freddie. “But it is really only a step in a journey that has a lot longer to go.”Still, the decision to place the two companies into conservatorship immediately lowered mortgage rates Monday by helping to drive up the price of bonds they issue. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to about 6.04 percent from 6.34 percent last week, according to HSH Associates, a publisher of mortgage industry data. That is down about 0.65 of a point from July.Interest rates were slightly lower on Monday. The 10-year Treasury note rose 8/32, to 102 22/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.67 percent, from 3.7 percent Friday.But an important financial indicator showed that investors remain worried. The premium investors demand to hold mortgage securities, rather than Treasury notes and bonds, remains higher than what some analysts had expected after the government gave its own backing to those bonds. Those premiums should come down slowly, analysts say.The Treasury Department said Sunday it would start buying the companies’ bonds, which should also lift prices, said Donald Brownstein, chief of Structured Portfolio Management, a hedge fund firm in Stamford, Conn.Policy makers believe that by investing in mortgages and backing Fannie and Freddie they will ease the decline in housing prices, which are down 18 percent from their 2006 peak. Mr. Brownstein said that lower rates would help, but would not be sufficient because many would-be homeowners and people looking to refinance cannot qualify for loans, regardless of how low interest rates go.“To the extent that mortgages are lower, new home buyers will find it easier to buy homes,” he said. But “if you bought a house and the price of it is down by 20 percent, this is not likely to be that significant.”Another investor, Douglas A. Dachille, said the market would soon start focusing on the future of Fannie and Freddie. The Treasury and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates the companies, signaled on Sunday that the two companies under government control would roll back recent policies that had made mortgages more expensive. Policy makers have released few details on their plans.Whatever changes are made now will likely be reconsidered in January when a new administration takes office. Both presidential candidates have said that Fannie and Freddie cannot remain in their current form.“It’s creating euphoria,” Mr. Dachille, chief of First Principles Capital, said of the plan. “But in two weeks or three weeks the question will be: Great, you put these guys into conservatorship, but what are you going to do differently than the management of these companies?”Following are the result of yesterday’s auctions of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:'"

"'08-09-10,'1','Modeled on noir and executed on acid, “Able Danger” is a paranoid fantasy of geek superheroics that lunges desperately for political relevance. And while that objective is not entirely baseless, it might have been simpler to achieve had the movie’s retro style and hammy acting not skewed more toward the past than the present.At the center of the movie’s jittery high jinks is Thomas Flynn (Adam Nee), a Brooklyn coffee shop owner and conspiracy freak who would like to “change the world, one latte at a time.” So when an overcooked femme fatale (Elina Lowensohn) requests his help in obtaining proof of C.I.A. involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks, Thomas can resist neither her mission nor her hotness. Before you can say “Sam Spade” he’s chasing an encrypted hard drive while fending off religious fanatics, German psychos and more corny accents than an “Austin Powers” marathon.Taking its title from a secret Pentagon program, “Able Danger” toggles between murky digital video and even murkier fake surveillance film. And though like-minded theorists may ascend from their basements to rally round its muddled premise, this debut feature from the writer and director Paul Krik (who also goes by the name Dave Herman) is a classic example of too much foot-in-mouth and not nearly enough tongue-in-cheek.Written, directed and edited by Paul Krik; director of photography, Charles Libin; music by Michael Montes, John Roome, Alexander Schiebel and Moby; art directors, Martina Nevermann, Josie Barth-Torres, Willa Armbruster and Noah Ross; produced by Mr. Krik, Katharina Lang and Ari Krepostman; released by Flatbush Athletics. At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village. Running time: 1 hour 26 minutes. This film is not rated.'"

"'08-09-10,'1','On the heels of Washington’s rescues of Bear Stearns and now Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the auto industry’s pleas for government loan guarantees of up to $50 billion, Mr. Cloutier asked, “Why aren’t we giving emergency credit to one of the nation’s economic pillars — the millions of businesses that employ 160 million people and create 60 percent of jobs?”In a study conducted for American Management Services by Suffolk University and released in July, 63 percent of small-business owners said the federal government was “doing nothing” to help them, and 80 percent said they did not know what programs Senators John McCain or Barack Obama had in mind for them.Even so, the study showed Mr. McCain ahead by 38 percent to 21 percent, with the rest undecided or preferring somebody else. A study conducted last week by the online payroll service SurePayroll of 900 of its clients showed Mr. McCain leading by 64 percent to 36 percent.But if small-business owners seem to be leaning Republican, they are not exactly greeting Mr. McCain with open arms.Michael Alter, the president of SurePayroll and an independent, said the No. 1 issue for small businesses in the presidential election was “the economy — by leaps and bounds.”About a third of respondents in SurePayroll’s questions listed the economy, a broad category that included taxes, the national debt, the budget deficit and the credit squeeze, as their main concern, he said. And the reason small-business owners prefer the Republican Party, he said, is simple. “They think it will do more to allow them to grow, by lowering taxes and creating tax incentives.”Even so, he said, there was growing unhappiness in their ranks at the vagueness of the presidential candidates’ plans. “Neither has spelled out exactly what he’ll do,” Mr. Alter said. These are among his suggestions: Make detailed pledges for keeping taxes low, create new tax incentives for capital investments and worker training and make all health insurance premiums tax-deductible.While SurePayroll’s study placed health care reform as No. 5 in small-business owners’ concerns, other groups say it is the biggest issue. The federation of independent business says health care costs, which it says have increased 129 percent in the last eight years, are the No. 1 issue for its members. Similarly, on Monday, the National Association for the Self-Employed, a lobbying group, said it found strong support for health care reform among its members.Yet the association also voiced frustration at the lack of detail in the proposals set forward by Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama. “Neither candidate has developed a comprehensive small-business policy to address issues such as health care, taxes and retirement affecting this important demographic,” Kristie Darien, the group’s executive director, said.Mr. Cloutier of American Management Services agreed. “Neither one is making any meaningful proposals about anything,” he said.In response, Crystal Benton, a spokeswoman for Mr. McCain said, “John McCain will help grow small businesses and create jobs by keeping taxes low, opening global markets to American businesses, and reforming the health care system to reduce costs.”Nick Shapiro, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said Mr. Obama had “a specific plan to help small businesses create good jobs here in the U.S. by eliminating their capital gains taxes, providing a new tax credit for small firms that offer health care to their employees and helping small businesses access capital and compete for government contracts.""Officials of the small-business groups agreed that their constituency was too diverse and too disorganized at the national level to catch politicians’ attention.“Despite the fact that small business generates half of America’s G.D.P., the overall strength of this population is often overlooked by politicians, pundits and the news media,” the National Federation of Independent Business said in a recent report.John Zogby, the founder of Zogby International and a Democrat, described small-business owners as “a forgotten constituency.”And that, in his view, gives Mr. Obama a shot at winning the support of some undecided small-business owners.But John Langdon, the managing partner and part owner of Langdon Ford Financial in Parsippany, N.J., and a Republican, disagreed. “I don’t see how there could be any weakening of small-business support, given the laundry list of promises being made by Democrats that are going to cost a lot of money,” Mr. Langdon said.Small-business owners are most upset, he said, about Mr. Obama’s plans for increasing payroll and capital gains taxes. His prescription for a winning platform would be promises to cut spending, hold down taxes, simplify the tax code and provide greater choice in health care.“The party of small government didn’t do its job over the past eight years,” Mr. Langdon said. “McCain is going to do a better job.”'"

"'08-09-10,'1','Making those choices as a team is one of the most important ways to preserve your marital assets, and your union, experts say. But it’s that much easier when you already share similar outlooks on money matters — or when you can, at the very least, find some middle ground.The economies achieved by pairing up are fairly obvious. However, the costs of divorce can be financially devastating, especially when children are involved. And, not surprisingly, money manages to force a wide wedge between many couples.“Most people think people break up over sex issues and children issues — and those are issues — but money is a huge factor in breaking up marriages,” said Susan Reach Winters, a divorce lawyer in Short Hills, N.J.Not everyone is married to a financial twin, and that’s not necessarily a problem. There are several ways that you and your significant other can become more compatible, and ultimately more prosperous, when it comes to money.These guidelines are compiled from the successfully married and from experts on psychology, divorce and finance:TALK AND SHARE GOALS Before walking down the aisle, couples should have a talk about their financial health and goals. They should ask each other tough questions: Do we want children? When? Who will care for them? Will they go to public or private school? What kind of life do we want? When will we retire?“In my ideal plan for couples, they would have a meeting every week on their finances,” said Karen Altfest, a financial planner who runs the New York firm L. J. Altfest & Company, with her husband, Lewis. “That way, they are in sync with each other’s goals.”Set those goals together. Jerry Ballard, 58, a former insurance executive in Houston, said that he and his wife of 36 years, Susan, also 58, managed to avoid money clashes because they share a savings philosophy. “The cardinal rule was that we don’t interrupt our savings,” he said, adding that they saved between 10 and 20 percent of their salaries each year. As long as they did that, they were less likely to disagree about spending.Eric Gundlach, 53, of Owings Mills, Md., who has been married for 29 years, said he and his wife, Ann-Michele, “made our expectations explicit.” These included sending their son to private school and having big experiences, like traveling, in lieu of purchasing things.RUN A HOME LIKE A BUSINESS Make a budget and keep track of earnings, expenses and debts. And structure your business as a partnership; when it comes to making big financial decisions and setting goals, do it together. “When they are making the decisions together, they really have ownership of those decisions and any results of those decisions,” said Mary Ann Sisco, national wealth adviser at JPMorgan’s private wealth management division. “Even if you have negative results, you tend to weather the storm better.”Share responsibilities, too. Though one partner tends to control the finances, advisers recommend rotating tasks. One person should handle investments for a certain period, while the other pays the bills; rotate and repeat.BE SUPPORTIVE OF CAREERS Having a supportive partner helps you professionally, which should trickle down to your mutual bottom line. “Marrying the right person helps you succeed in your career through encouragement and support, the only kind of support that comes through a supportive, intimate relationship,” said Mr. Gundlach, whose wife backed his decision to start a management consulting practice after 22 years as a human resources executive.ENJOY, BUT WITHIN REASON Create a cash cushion, and live a lifestyle you can sustain. Many people who were working at hedge funds that went bust or financial firms like Bear Stearns are learning these lessons now. Ms. Sisco, of JPMorgan, said that because her younger clients haven’t experienced a downturn, they assumed the money would keep pouring in.She said she is working with one couple in their early 30s who have two young children. Right before the husband lost his job on Wall Street, the couple had ordered $35,000 drapes. They had to move to a smaller apartment in Manhattan and had to sell their vacation home.USE A MEDIATOR Perhaps both of you have strong yet divergent opinions about how to invest. Or maybe you are a saver while your spouse prefers to hand over a big piece of earnings to Bavarian Motor Works. An independent third party, whether a financial planner or a therapist, can help you find a middle ground.Marc B. Schindler, a financial planner at Pivot Point Advisors in Bellaire, Tex., recently did this for a client who complained that his wife spent a thousand dollars a month on her wardrobe. Mr. Schindler then contacted the wife, who said her husband spent just as much on dinner with his buddies. So the husband asked Mr. Schindler to show how much they would save if they invested the $12,000 she spent each year. Mr. Schindler — careful to title the report “Clothing, Dinner or Invested?” — ran an analysis and found that the couple would have $1.6 million after 28 years, assuming a 9 percent rate of return. “They are going to try and compromise,” he said.MAINTAIN SOME INDEPENDENCE Pooling resources is important, but so is maintaining a degree of financial independence. Carve out some money for both partners to spend on things that make them happy. And when paring back, it’s essential that each person make sacrifices.INVEST IN YOUR MARRIAGE Spend it — time and money — together. Go on dates. “What that does is enliven the marital foundation,” said Gary S. Shunk, a Chicago therapist who specializes in wealth issues. “It’s a kind of investment into the heart and soul of the relationship.”Think of it as dollar-cost averaging your marriage, where you make small investments over time. If you wait until retirement, it could be too late.Melanie Schnoll-Begun, a managing director in the Citigroup Family Office, worked with a couple that waited too long. The husband had amassed great wealth for the family, and his wife kept a beautiful home. But once the husband retired, “they found out that over the years they grew so far apart that they didn’t have enough in common,” she said.“They had this magnificent wealth, and it was the building of this wealth that ultimately led to their divorce.”'"

"'08-09-10,'1','For that reason, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires anyone who participates in alternative investments — including angel investing — to be a “qualified investor.” This means they have to demonstrate that they have had a six-figure income for at least the past two years or a net worth of at least $1 million. Experts say that the income requirement is more difficult to meet than the net worth threshold.“In reality, if you only have $1 million, you should not be messing around with this stuff, because it is very risky,” said David S. Rose, chairman of the New York Angels, an investor group in Manhattan. Like many angels, he recommended $5 million as a realistic floor.Seasoned angel investors say they expect roughly half of the companies they finance to evaporate into thin air, and many others will limp along for years before generating a modest profit. Even veteran angel investors say that, at best, one of 10 of the startups they finance generates most of their profits from angel investing. Neophytes who dabble in angel investing are likely to lose their shirts, these veterans say.Despite the risk, successful angels tend to be among the most optimistic of investors. A year into the credit crunch, many say the credit markets have no bearing on their investment decisions. The companies they finance are so young — frequently they do not yet have sales, much less profits — they would never qualify for small business loans in any credit environment.Many long-time angels also say they do not fret about broader economic conditions, because they expect to wait 5 to 10 years before realizing a profit on the businesses they invest in today, and they cannot predict, or worry about, what the economy will look like then.But economic concerns may weigh on them in another way. Unlike venture capitalists, who pool capital, primarily from institutional investors, angel investors are playing with their own cash.“What we are hearing from our members is that they continue to see excellent deal flow, in both quality and quantity, and most of them continue to make similar investments in terms of the total amount,” said Marianne Hudson, the executive director of the Angel Capital Association, a trade group for angel investors. “But we do have some who are concerned about their own wealth and concerned that it could become harder for them to write checks.”Angel investors appear to be spreading their risk around more, said Jeffrey Sohl, a business school professor and director of the Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire. He said that last year, more angels, on average, participated in each deal, while investing a smaller sum per deal. Such investors generally limit angel activities to 5 to 10 percent of their net worth, Professor Sohl said, and given the steep declines in stocks and real estate, they might have less to allocate.Most angels are former entrepreneurs who cashed out of their companies either in an initial public offering, or, as is much more likely today, through a private sale to a larger company. Retired corporate executives can also make good angel investors, so long as they understand that startups are very different from large companies, Professor Sohl said. On the other hand, he advised many well-to-do investors without any business background to steer clear of angel investing.Many states offer tax incentives for investing in small businesses in their own state. For a list, go to angelcapitalassociation.org, click on “Resources” and look for “state policy issues.”Indeed, supporting local economic development is one reason that angels often cite for their interest in this type of investing. “When you are a venture capitalist, and you are investing other people’s money, return on investment had better be your only motivation,” said Bill Payne, a founding member of angel investor groups in Montana and Nevada. “But angel investors are often motivated by other considerations, such as mentoring young entrepreneurs and giving back to the community.”Mr. Payne has been an angel investor since the early 1980s, when he sold his company, Solid State Dielectrics, to DuPont. His interest in fostering local economic development led him to start the Frontier Angel Fund three years ago in Kalispell, Mont. The fund’s 33 members each put in $50,000, and they vote on each proposed investment.Many of the 300 or so angel investor groups in the United States function almost like social clubs. If enough members decide to invest in a particular company, they often form a limited liability corporation and appoint one member to become the principal contact with the entrepreneur. If only a few members are interested in a deal, they are free to invest on their own.Some angels prefer to go it alone. Stuart Coulson sold Gradient Solutions, a travel software company that he founded in his native Ireland, to Sabre Holdings, a software company near Dallas, in 2000. Mr. Coulson and his family recently moved to Palo Alto, Calif., where he hopes to do some angel investing on his own. He is mentoring some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, although he has yet to invest in their companies. He said he preferred this approach to joining a group, “but obviously the downside is that it is harder to find deal flow.”But after two years on his own, Mr. Connor, the entrepreneur, joined Sand Hill Angels, a group in Silicon Valley. “Now if anyone comes to me, I tell them, ‘Please go to the organization that I belong to,’ ” he said. “It really has given me back control of my time.”'"
"'08-09-10,'1','The memo, supposedly written by Lt. Gen. Tahir Jalil Habbush, the intelligence chief at the end of Saddam Hussein’s reign, was quickly discredited as a fake.So who created a document — or the tale of a document — that turned the deaths of 3,000 innocent people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania into mere props?The Daily Telegraph reported that it had learned of the memo’s existence from Ayad Allawi, who held power in Iraq’s transitional government with support from the Central Intelligence Agency.In “The Way of the World” (Harper 2008), Ron Suskind draws a narrative map tracing the fake memo story from Mr. Allawi back to the White House — a trail, it should be said, that is disavowed by the two C.I.A. officials who Mr. Suskind says were intermediaries, and who are cited in the book as sources.The C.I.A. officials said that the agency had actually resisted pressure from the White House, especially from the office of Vice President Dick Cheney, to show a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda, and insisted that they would not have created a document that would have undercut the agency. Moreover, they said no one had ordered them to do so.Someone invented the document, or perhaps simply planted a story about it, in an attempt to frame Iraq for the 9/11 attacks, and somehow justify the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqis and 4,000 Americans in the United States military. John Conyers, a Democrat who is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, announced an inquiry one month ago, but has made little progress.A book by Michael Daly, a columnist for The Daily News, rescues the life of the Rev. Mychal F. Judge, the Franciscan friar and Fire Department chaplain, from 9/11’s mythic piety.In “The Book of Mychal” (Thomas Dunne Books 2008), Mr. Daly works backward from his death that day and finds a life of epic richness. Father Judge was born Robert Emmett Judge in Brooklyn, the son of Irish immigrants; his mother could not stand Catholic clergy and hoped he would shake off his teenage vocation.Instead, he embraced his priesthood as a marriage, serving in the Church of St. Francis Assisi on West 31st Street — a place so popular with Catholic commuters who wanted to unburden themselves of sin far from home that it was “the criminal court of the Catholic Church,” Mr. Daly writes. A soup kitchen there has fed generations of the poor. For Father Judge, like many foot soldiers, the high command could seem only distantly connected to his actual life. The pope “was a great show for the deaf,” Father Judge is quoted saying, but Mr. Daly also records the friar’s deft maneuvering past security checkpoints to get a paralyzed police officer backstage at a papal visit.Along with the love of people, there was love of a person. In the last years of his life, Father Judge developed a romantic relationship with a Filipino nurse 30 years his junior, a man named Al Alvarado. Drawing on Father Judge’s diaries and journals, the book records his feelings for Mr. Alvarado, their dinners out and a trip to a bed and breakfast in Vermont. Yet months would go by when they could not see each other, simply because the priest was always on call for fires. Once, Mr. Alvarado decided he could not stand it any more, and took a job in Kuwait. Not long after their farewell, Mr. Alvarado called Father Judge. He had canceled the trip, he said, because leaving was worse than staying.On the day of Father Judge’s funeral, Mr. Alvarado could not get into the church because none of the people minding the doors realized who he was. (Later, the only friar who knew of their relationship made sure that Mr. Alvarado had a ride with the Franciscans to the cemetery.) “No one, absolutely no one, lives two fuller separate lives than I do,” Father Judge wrote, and in Mr. Daly’s eloquent telling, the power of one only amplified the other.'"

"'08-09-10,'1','Congress is considering a reckless piece of legislation that would eviscerate gun controls in the District of Columbia, ignoring the democratic rights of the residents of the nation’s capital and making it harder for the police to protect streets traveled by ordinary people, lawmakers, judges, diplomats and dignitaries.The bill, which seems headed toward passage in the House, is advertised by its supporters as a necessary response to the Supreme Court ruling in June that struck down the district’s 32-year-old ban on possessing handguns in the home. It is nothing of the sort. The City Council has already passed temporary changes to comply with the ruling and is working on permanent revisions.This extreme bill goes way beyond what the high court required. Among other things, it would repeal a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons and eliminate firearm registration requirements, even for such things as sniper rifles and small, easily concealed semiautomatic handguns. Under the lunatic logic of this bill, made to order for the gun lobby, such rifles could be toted around on the street fully loaded.The bill is a gross trampling on the right of the district to govern itself, but it is far more than that. At a hearing on Monday, Representative Henry Waxman, chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said the bill would make it harder to protect government officials and the thousands of foreign dignitaries who spend time in Washington each year.The district’s police chief, Cathy Lanier, and the chief of the Capitol Police, Philip Morse, expressed similar concerns. Chief Lanier testified about the difficulty of safeguarding official motorcades and government institutions and personnel should the measure go into effect. (The Bush administration would not permit officials of the Secret Service and the U.S. Marshals Service to testify.)The bill currently has the support of about 50 Democrats and most Republicans, so it will be hard to stop approval in the House. Many members, running for re-election in communities that are heavily opposed to gun control, simply will not challenge the National Rifle Association.'"
"'08-09-10,'1','PARIS — Airbus insisted Tuesday that it would not cut jobs in Europe, even as it made plans to find additional savings by shifting more production outside of the Continent.Since aircraft are priced in dollars, Airbus is eager to reduce its exposure to the euro.Under a plan announced in July by its parent company, European Aeronautic Defense and Space, Airbus wants to reduce its costs by an additional 650 million euros, or $914 million, in 2011 and 2012. The plan, dubbed Power8 Plus, is intended to save a total of a billion euros throughout EADS during those two years.On Tuesday, Airbus executives met with worker representatives to outline the saving plans. The executives ruled out more layoffs on top of the 10,000 jobs set to disappear under a broad overhaul already under way.“It is not planned to have any job losses; it is more externalization and internationalization,” said a union official present at the talks, which lasted most of Tuesday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the talks.Instead of cutting more jobs, savings this time will derive from greater direct purchases of airplane components from outside the euro zone.'"
"'08-09-10,'1','In comparison to Senator Barack Obama’s education plan, Senator John McCain’s is downright terse.Among his short list of initiatives, Mr. McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, includes bonus pay for teachers who raise student achievement or who take jobs in hard-to-staff schools, an expansion of after-school tutoring, and new federal support for online schools and for the voucher program in Washington, D.C.The brevity of Mr. McCain’s plan reflects his view that the federal government should play a limited role in public education, and his commitment to holding the line on education spending, said Lisa Graham Keegan, a McCain adviser and former Arizona education commissioner.“Education is obviously not the issue Senator McCain spends the most time on,” Ms. Keegan said, adding that his plan’s limited scope should not be interpreted as a lack of commitment to education and school reform. “He’s been a quiet and consistent supporter of parents and educators who he thinks are making a difference.”Mr. McCain would make it easier for students in failing schools to get taxpayer-financed after-school tutoring by private companies. Under President Bush’s No Child Left Behind law, students at schools that have repeatedly missed testing goals are eligible, but few parents nationwide have taken advantage of those services. That is because, in Mr. McCain’s view, local school districts often set up a cumbersome process for certifying the tutors and do a poor job of getting the word out to parents.'"
"'08-09-10,'1','Boeing, for all its rich backlog of business, is wary of promising to expand the ranks of its workers. For one thing, airlines are collectively losing billions of dollars because of record prices for jet fuel. That means some orders on its books could evaporate.For another, Boeing is facing stiff competition from its main rival, Airbus, while aviation industries in Canada, Brazil, China and elsewhere pose a threat. Boeing, which streamlined its manufacturing processes in the 1990s and this decade, must keep improving its productivity, said Tim Healy, a company spokesman.It also needs to preserve its right to assign work to nonunion companies, as well as overseas suppliers, a major irritant to the I.A.M. “We can’t stand still,” Mr. Healy said. “We’ve got strong competition, we’ve got emerging competition.”Boeing saw the Dreamliner, a technologically advanced aircraft meant to be much more fuel-efficient than current planes, as a way to stay ahead. But Mr. Healy said the strike could push the Dreamliner, already more than a year late, behind schedule again.The company is concerned that the plane will not make its maiden test flight, scheduled for late this year, Mr. Healy said. “Obviously, it depends on how long this lasts,” he added. “We’ve got engineers to work on it, but we need the whole team working to fly in the fourth quarter.”The strike would have to drag on for three months or more, with serious disruption to Boeing’s production, for there to be any effect on competition for customers, said Doug McVitie, a managing director at Arran Aerospace, a consulting firm in Dinan, France.“No one’s going to change their fleets from Boeing to Airbus over something that’s going to be resolved within a few months,” Mr. McVitie said.Even so, the Irish airline Ryanair said Tuesday it had to delay starting new routes from Edinburgh by six weeks because it is not getting the Boeing jets it expected.On picket lines outside Seattle, workers sounded determined. “Everybody’s just angry,” said Greg Mercille, 55, a coordinator for a training program in Tukwila, Wash., operated jointly by Boeing and the machinists’ union.Ronald Coen, 50, who makes overhead railings for the Boeing 777 at the company’s Auburn, Wash., plant, said he has enough cash reserves to withstand a 90-day strike. “The longer we’re out, the more they’re going to need us when we get back,” he said.Boeing, which employed roughly 50,000 machinists at the beginning of the decade, cut their ranks to less than 19,000 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when it lost half its orders.Its machinists payroll has since grown to 27,000, but Mr. Buffenbarger says Boeing requires another 5,000 to 6,000 more workers, and that it should replace nonunion workers, like those who deliver parts to its assembly lines, with Machinist members.The average Boeing machinist earns about $56,000 a year, and receives an additional $10,200 a year in overtime, according to the company. When the value of health care and benefits are included, Boeing’s annual compensation per machinist is about $91,500, said Mr. Healy, the Boeing spokesman.“They’ve got five or six years of backlogged orders,” Mr. Buffenbarger said. “It takes people to crank those out. There’s an anger factor and a fatigue factor. Our people are tired.”Mr. Healy contends Boeing is interested in “job stability” for its workforce, but says it cannot promise that stability unless workers are productive.And analysts say it could be dangerous for Boeing to add jobs with the airline industry on shaky ground. “You don’t want to lock yourself into a contract where you’re paying out a lot of money in a slowdown,” said Richard Tortoriello, an equity analyst with Standard & Poor’s.Compared with airlines and automakers, “Boeing is a much more competitive company, but I don’t think it wants to give away the keys to the city,” he said.Neither do the machinists plan to give ground. “This is the wrong union to mess with,” said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. He said Boeing made a mistake two weeks ago by directly asking workers to consider its final contract offer, rather than continuing talks with union leaders.Instead, workers voted 80 percent against the final offer and 87 percent in favor of a strike, which shows no sign of ending soon. No new talks are scheduled, though both sides say they are willing to meet.Absent a deal, Donna Swenson, 47, who has worked at Boeing for 13 years, said she was ready to go on public assistance a month from now, if the strike lasts that long. (Workers will receive $150 a week in strike pay when the walkout enters its third week.)Ms. Swenson said many workers were not eager to walk picket lines, but added. “We’ve made them record profits, and now they want to sell us out like we’re nothing?”'"
"'08-09-10,'1','The writer is the editor of The Journal of Post Keynesian Economics.The most significant lesson to be learned from the bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is that it disproves the idea that free markets can in and of themselves function efficiently without sensible regulations and effective enforcement.We have lost our way because we have allowed a political system to take root where money and the passion for power have been allowed to compromise the need for honest government and an efficient economic system to meet the ideals that bind us all together.Re “Few Stand to Gain on This Bailout, and Many Lose” (Business Day, Sept. 8):Millions of American homeowners bought their homes judiciously and pay their mortgages responsibly. With the mortgage meltdown, many of these owners have seen the value of their homes, their primary investment, drop considerably, as house after house in neighborhood after neighborhood has been abandoned to foreclosure.Now these same people, as taxpayers, will assume the mortgage debt of these unlucky homes as our government assumes control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.That the leaders of the financial institutions that caused this mess have collected, and will collect, millions of dollars in compensation, stock options, bonuses and severance pay is obscene.That no one has been held accountable for the rampant greed and unscrupulous investment is inexcusable.According to “As Crisis Grew, a Few Options Shrank to One” (front page, Sept. 8), the government acted because “if Freddie’s and Fannie’s problems worsened, a crisis of confidence could spread through the worldwide financial system, deepening the difficulties in the housing market and further weakening the economy — in the midst of a hard-fought election campaign.”Notwithstanding the panicked improvisations of the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve in recent months, the domestic and global economies are already in precisely such a crisis, brought on by irresponsible “creative” financing, securitization of questionable debt, and the passing of risk through financial instruments and obligations that are not even understood by the people who own them.In the final analysis, this crisis has been fueled by the same combination of greed, dishonesty, willful blindness and wishful thinking that has generated every disaster of capitalism from the Dutch tulip collapse through the Great Depression, the Enron and WorldCom scandals, and the dot-com bust.Re “Mortgage Giants Taken Over by U.S.: A Costly Bailout” (front page, Sept. 8):To limit the cost to taxpayers, the government should form an entity similar to the Resolution Trust Corporation, which liquidated the assets of the failed S.&L.’s during the 1990s. This government-owned agency would hold the assets of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae until they could be valued based on the quality of the underlying mortgages.Unless this happens, the sell-off will be premature, and vulture-fund speculators will buy the undervalued assets.Because of market illiquidity and the inability to price the portfolios, the assets of the government-sponsored entities should be held until the mortgage-backed securities market returns to some semblance of normality. That will minimize the cost to taxpayers.Housing is a basic need for all Americans, and now the United States government has rescued the financiers behind the housing industry.Adequate medical care is also a basic need for all Americans.Perhaps now there can be a real discussion of how the federal government can assure that everyone will have access to good medical care without invoking the bogyman of socialism.With the bailout of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the Reagan revolution has at last realized the robber barons’ dream: privatize the profits and socialize the debt. Nicely done, fellas.'"
"'08-09-10,'1','A deal with Allianz would not be easy to sell publicly, like Citigroup’s with the Mets. The possibility of an Allianz Stadium will make some people cringe, especially in a market that is home to many Jewish people, and in which the Tisch family, which owns half of the Giants, has supported many Jewish causes.“There must be sensitivity to the psychological impact this would have,” said Elan Steinberg, a vice president of the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors and Their Descendants. “Survivors are still alive. It would not be appropriate to affix the Allianz name to a stadium name in an area where a lot of survivors still living.”A serious burden will be on the Giants and the Jets to persuade fans and others of the propriety of naming a stadium for Allianz, even if its terrible era is more than 60 years past. The teams have hired a crisis management firm to vet all naming rights candidates, but it is certain that most of its time has been spent on Allianz.Even the best arguments in Allianz’s favor are imperfect. The teams can say that Allianz has done much to atone for its role before and during the war, but no amount of apologies or restitution to victims and survivors can make full amends for its past.The teams can say Allianz participated in two major efforts that began in the 1990s to compensate slave and forced laborers as well as insurance policy holders — but only after pressure from the American government, state insurance regulators and Jewish groups, and class-action suits filed in federal court.The teams refused to speak about Allianz, which has United States subsidiaries like Fireman’s Fund Insurance and Oppenheimer Capital, because a deal is not done. And Allianz refused to discuss the naming-rights negotiations.But Peter Lefkin, a senior vice president of Allianz of America, said, “Over the years, Allianz has done everything possible to redress all the wrongs perpetuated by the Third Reich.”Stuart Eizenstat, who was President Clinton’s special representative on Holocaust-era issues, said that Allianz cooperated on compensation, but only after it demanded legal protection from being sued, which he felt was appropriate.“Allianz paid all its claims under I.C.H.E.I.C.,” he said, referring to the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, which has distributed more than $300 million to 48,000 claimants. “It paid its dues, participated in a good-faith process, and has continued to pay claims even after I.C.H.E.I.C. closed it doors last year.”Critics insist that Allianz and other companies have not paid nearly enough under a very flawed process. Sidney Zabludoff, an economist who specializes in restitution finances, said Allianz acted “reasonably,” but operated under “German rules” that kept its payments at a lower rate than those paid by insurers in other European countries.In all, he said, Allianz has paid claimants about $12 million through International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims.The Jets and the Giants will now determine if Allianz will be able to use their stadium to extend its global brand to the United States by paying them $20 million or $30 million a year.Michael J. Bazyler, a professor at the Chapman University School of Law and the author of “Holocaust Justice,” said accepting the concept of Allianz Stadium might be as individual a choice as buying a German car, which he would not.“If it was Allianz Stadium, would I not go to the game?” Bazyler said, the son of Holocaust survivors. “I’d feel uncomfortable. But when people think of a German company that cooperated with the Nazis, Allianz doesn’t pop up.”'"
"'08-09-10,'1','BAGHDAD — Iraqi lawmakers returned to Parliament on Tuesday after a month’s recess facing a host of unresolved issues, including the passage of a crucial provincial election law.The election law, which was stalled by bitter disputes in the last session, is seen as a vital step toward reintegrating Iraqi groups that had been underrepresented in the political process, primarily because they boycotted the vote in 2005. Officials from the United Nations, the United States and Britain have all pressed Iraqi politicians to arrive at a solution soon to take advantage of Iraq’s improved security situation.Lawmakers had envisioned holding elections this fall, but the date has been steadily pushed back. At this point, many legislators say, the earliest elections would be early next year.When Parliament adjourned last month, Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, the speaker, suggested the formation of a committee to explore solutions to the impasse during the recess and raised the possibility of a special session to pass a new election law. None of this happened.The main sticking point is the status of Kirkuk, a city populated by Kurds, Arabs and Turkmens. Kurdish officials insist that Kirkuk rightfully belongs to Kurdistan; Sunni Arab and Turkmen lawmakers have proposed a power-sharing agreement to govern the city.'"
"'08-09-10,'1','SAN FRANCISCO — The iPhone may be Apple’s most talked-about product, but on Tuesday Apple focused attention on its most dominant franchise: the iPod and the iTunes music and video store.At an event here called “Let’s Rock,” Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, announced an array of incremental changes to the iPod product line and iTunes, setting the company up for the holiday shopping season. Mr. Jobs unveiled new features and a svelte design for the iPod Nano, a cheaper, upgraded iPod Touch, and a new version of iTunes that can recommend music to buy based on the songs in a person’s music collection.Mr. Jobs also announced that NBC, a division of General Electric, was bringing its television lineup back to iTunes, 10 months after the two parties clashed over how much flexibility NBC would have on the pricing of new NBC programs. Both sides now say they got what they wanted. Television shows from NBC and other networks will all cost $1.99 for standard video quality, and $2.99 for high-definition video quality. Older shows like “Kojak” will sell for 99 cents.Jean-Briac Perrette, who runs digital distribution for NBC Universal, said that NBC would have liked even more options, but that Apple had given the network most of what it asked for.“We are pretty comfortable that most of what we are doing will work within those three tiers,” Mr. Perrette said.Mr. Jobs said in an interview that the resolution came through personal discussions with Jeff Zucker, the chief executive of NBC Universal. “We both knew we wanted to get this together, and our mutual customers wanted us to get this together,” he said. “They let us know, we worked it out, and everyone is happy.”'"
"'08-09-10,'1','“It’s expensive out there,” said Jamil Cruz, 38, a maintenance worker in Manhattan who was thumbing recently through a rack of shorts at a Salvation Army store in Midtown Manhattan. “You’ve got to have two jobs to make it.”Jerry Balara, general supervisor of the Salvation Army’s adult rehabilitation center in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., where sales were up 12 percent this year, said that some consumers had told him: “I just can’t afford even Wal-Mart or Kmart or discount stores right now.”Many thrift stores, however, may soon be in need of fresh donations.“At this rate we’re probably going to run out of product before Christmas gets here,” said James Brickson, corps administrator and pastor for the Salvation Army’s rehabilitation center in Albert Lea, Minn., where sales this year were up about 6 percent and the number of first-time users of the Salvation Army’s social services was up 12 percent. Donations, on the other hand, were down about 50 percent from last year.George Hood, national community relations and development secretary for the Salvation Army, said the weak economy is “forcing people to re-evaluate” what they are willing to donate. “Young women are looking in their closet and saying, ‘You know, I’m going to wear that a little longer instead of giving it away,’ ” he said.That means the Salvation Army is competing with other groups for a shrinking pool of quality castoffs.“We’re all kind of scrambling for the same shirt and the same pair of pants,” said Timothy Best, administrator for the Salvation Army adult rehabilitation center in South Bend, Ind., where sales this year were up 12 percent and donations were down 8 to 15 percent.To make matters worse, gas prices have drastically increased the stores’ operating costs. Some thrift shops have had to cut back on trips to pick up clothing donations.“Even if they had 20 bags,” said Mr. Balara, who oversees seven thrift stores in Pennsylvania, “we just can’t afford to go get them right now.”David Wilson, the administrator of the Salvation Army’s adult rehabilitation center in Manhattan and Queens, said his trucks used to drive to donors’ homes to pick up three or four bags of clothing, but that these days “we try to get over 10 bags of clothing to go to a house to make it worth it.” He has also had to increase the fee for delivering furniture to customer’s homes by $10, to $50 in Manhattan and $60 in Queens.Aldo Accinelli, business administrator for the Salvation Army’s Anaheim adult rehabilitation center in Orange County, Calif., said that sales in the 12 thrift stores he oversees were up about 10 percent, but that expenses were up 20 percent.“Diesel alone is up two times as much as last year,” he said. For the last couple of years it has cost Mr. Accinelli about $14,000 a month to operate his 22-truck fleet. Now it costs $28,000 to $30,000 a month.In response to the slowdown in donations and the growing need for social services, the Salvation Army is introducing the sort of national advertising and marketing campaign usually ordered up by department stores and specialty retailers.Salvation Army officials believe that if more Americans were reminded that the money generated by thrift stores goes toward drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs, they would be more likely to make donations. The campaign will include fliers, signs, new logos on trucks and even some radio and television advertisements.“We’re going to be more aggressive about marketing,” Mr. Hood said. “Instead of operating like a charity, we now know we have to operate like a real retailer.”The Salvation Army said its average thrift-store shopper had traditionally been upper or middle class. Many came to hunt for designer clothing at rock-bottom prices.“I found once a pair of Chanel black leather shoes,” said Shannon Gallagher, a marketing manager for Simon & Schuster, as she shopped for maternity clothes at a Salvation Army thrift store in Midtown. “They were like $12.”But thrift store operators say the demographics are changing.People who once shopped daily or multiple times a week for vintage treasures are making fewer trips. For some, thrift-store shopping is no longer a hobby but a necessity. Then there are those who have stopped buying entirely or are buying only when there are promotions, leading a few thrift stores to experience a dip in sales this year.Mr. Brickson, of Minnesota, said a longtime donor to his store had recently showed up in tears.“She had given so much to the Salvation Army over the years,” he said. “She never thought she was going to be a recipient of the services.”'"

"'08-09-10,'1','But that changed this summer, when brokers began leading tours through 120 Park Avenue, where 440,000 square feet of office space is available for rent. Altria and Philip Morris International have leased back the fifth through eighth floors, around 100,000 square feet altogether. The lower four floors hold the lobby and public spaces.Most floors from the ninth up are exactly as Altria left them, including the ceiling fans to accommodate smokers in the days before strict antismoking laws.“We bought a private building,” said Michael Alter, president of 120 Park Avenue Associates, a unit of Global Holdings, which is part of the family interests of Eyal Ofer, an Israeli-born, London-based global real estate investor. “This building did not belong to the office inventory in New York City, so we need to introduce it to the market.”Altria sold the building for $525 million in March, and the closing was timed to coincide with its corporate restructuring that month, according to an Altria spokesman, David Sutton. The company reported a pretax gain of $404 million from the sale of the building.Mr. Alter said the potential tenants were expected to be primarily financial and law firms. He said he was confident that the building would command the rents being sought.Brokers say the asking annual rents are $110 to $120 a square foot for space up to the 21st floor and $130 to $150 a square foot for the former Altria executive suites on the 22nd to the 26th floors. Professionals say such rates are above average for Park Avenue office rents south of Grand Central Terminal.But 120 Park Avenue is an unusual building. Philip Morris executives enjoyed some perks that brokers say could appeal to hedge fund managers, corporate executives and law firm partners.For example, there is an executive parking garage four levels below ground with 15 private spaces. If a single large company rented all of the available floors in 120 Park Avenue, it would be given the use of this garage. If the building were split up among several tenants, each of them might get one or more spaces, said Paul N. Glickman, the vice chairman of Cushman & Wakefield, who is the leasing agent for this building.Three other levels below ground have more than 70,000 square feet combined. Altria used these floors for its company cafeteria, mailroom, copy center and other back-office functions. Mr. Glickman said new tenants might get to use some of this space for similar purposes, depending on how much space they leased.At the other extreme of the building, each of the executive offices on the 22nd floor has sliding glass doors to balconies wrapping around three sides of the building, which have sweeping views of the Chrysler building and south across Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.Mr. Glickman said another appealing feature was the potential branding opportunity, which includes the possibility of adding a facade sign on the Park Avenue side of the building and a flag at the 41st Street entrance. The owners also plan to renovate the lobby, which is entered from 41st Street.The 42nd Street entrance leads to an open space, which must be reserved for public use, in accordance with zoning variances issued when 120 Park Avenue was built. Until recently, the Whitney Museum, of which Altria was a major supporter, had a gallery here. Mr. Glickman said a major corporate tenant might use this public space for a similar charitable purpose.Given the building’s prime location and its unusual features, real estate experts say that the $525 million price seems like a bargain. When the deal was struck, it was difficult to estimate the yield — or the capitalization rate, which is the measure of a building’s net operating income divided by the purchase price — because there were no tenants. But if the owner succeeds in leasing the 540,000 square feet, including the space already taken by the previous owners, at an average rent of $100 a square foot annually, the deal would yield around 8 percent, experts say. When Global Holdings signed the contract late last year, towers in New York were selling with yields around 5 percent.But price was not the only consideration for Altria. Bill Shanahan, the vice chairman at CB Richard Ellis, the real estate brokerage company that represented Altria in the sale of the building, said the company had a very narrow window of time to close the deal to coincide with its restructuring plan.“We picked the buyer who we knew was going to be able to close even if conditions changed,” Mr. Shanahan said.'"
"'08-09-10,'1','Ali Al-Naimi, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, which has been pumping more than its quota in recent months, left the meeting without any comment. With crude oil heading down toward $100 a barrel, Saudi Arabia and other producers meeting here on Tuesday had suggested that OPEC would keep pumping at full tilt, even as some members of the cartel expressed concerns about rapidly declining prices.Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries account for 40 percent of the world’s oil exports. They had scheduled the late-night session to consider how to respond to a 30 percent drop in oil prices since July. Crude oil fell more than $3 a barrel on Tuesday.Ahead of the meeting, the cartel’s members appeared deeply split, with one camp, led by Iran and Venezuela, advocating reductions in output to stem further price declines, and another, led by Saudi Arabia, wishing to allow prices to fall further.As the group’s representatives arrived in Vienna, Mr. Khelil, who is also Algeria’s oil minister, said the cartel would probably keep production unchanged. At a news conference held after the meeting, Mr. Khelil said the group was merely responding to oversupply in the market.“My hunch is that prices will be going down despite the decision,” Mr. Khelil said. “There is an oversupply; everybody agrees about this.”The decision represents a rare case of OPEC’s going against the position of its biggest member, Saudi Arabia. The Saudi oil minister had said when he arrived in Vienna early Tuesday that the market was “fairly well balanced.”“We have worked very hard since June to bring prices to where they are now,” Mr. Naimi told reporters Tuesday morning. “We have been very successful.”Mr. Naimi was referring to a pledge Saudi Arabia made in June at a meeting of producers and consumers in Jeddah to keep pumping at full throttle to bring prices down. The kingdom is producing about 9.5 million barrels a day, 600,000 barrels a day more than its official OPEC quota.Oil prices peaked at $145.29 a barrel on July 3 but have been falling lately because of slowing global demand. On Tuesday, prices fell $3.08 to $103.26 a barrel in New York, their lowest level since April.The drop partly reflected the feeling that Hurricane Ike, which killed at least four people in Cuba and forced more than a million to evacuate, will miss the oil-production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. About 80 percent of the gulf’s offshore oil production remains shut in after the passage of an earlier storm, Hurricane Gustav.Slowing economies and falling oil demand in major developing countries have led to a slowdown in the growth of oil consumption. As a result, many analysts agree there is more than enough oil on the market. Also, refiners typically need less oil in the third quarter, when they shut down for maintenance.Behind their sometimes opaque language, OPEC’s leaders are forced to perform a delicate balancing act. Leaving production unchanged at a time when demand growth is slowing could precipitate a price collapse, as happened in the late 1990s when prices fell below $10 a barrel. But cutting production at today’s high levels could incur the wrath of consumers, who are already unhappy with the elevated prices. Oil has been above $100 a barrel since March.In the days leading to the meeting, some countries, like Iran, Libya and Venezuela, had signaled that they wanted the cartel to cut production. OPEC’s own analysis suggested that the group was producing far more oil than is needed. According to Lehman Brothers, OPEC is pumping 2.18 million barrels a day more than it did last year.Saudi Arabia is in a particularly sensitive position. The kingdom is the only country with any significant spare capacity and is in a position to impose its will on other OPEC countries. The Saudis recently brought a new field online, called Khursaniyah, which has a production capacity of 500,000 barrels a day.But the Saudis are also keenly aware of the state of the market. Oil consumption in the United States, the world’s biggest market, is about a million barrels a day lower than last year and consuming nations have pleaded for producers not to reduce their production. Some OPEC members are also worried about a potential slowdown in demand in Europe and Asia.Still, there was perceptible anxiety among producers at the speed of the decline in prices.“We need to be careful that there won’t be a price collapse but that is something that does not look probable,” Venezuela’s energy minister, Rafael Ramírez, told reporters. “Looking at speculation, the dollar and other factors that have been affecting the market, maybe we are going to come to an equilibrium at around $100 a barrel, perhaps this is the level of the market.”OPEC’s next meeting is scheduled for mid-December.'"
"'08-09-10,'1','The Liberal Democrats need all the help they can get, going up against a newly powerful Democratic Party in national lower house elections while Japan’s $4.7 trillion economy appears to be stalling. The party must reassure voters about its ability to steward the nation after the short governments of Mr. Fukuda and his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, who each resigned after less than a year in office.While the governing party enjoys a comfortable margin in the 480-seat lower house, many analysts say it could lose enough seats to relinquish its majority in the chamber. With the opposition Democrats already in control of the upper house, such an upset could help turn the Liberal Democratic Party into a minority party for the first time since its creation in 1955.There has been speculation that the party may try to ride the current wave of public excitement to victory, dissolving Parliament and calling a national election immediately after selecting a new prime minister. That could mean an election as soon as November, political analysts say.Afraid of “disappearing from the people’s sight,” as a party official, Yukio Hatoyama, put it last week, the opposition Democrats have huddled to brainstorm about media strategies, with few obvious results. The party is desperate to avoid a repeat of the last lower house elections three years ago, when it suffered big losses after voter attention focused on a bitter rift in the Liberal Democratic Party over a postal privatization plan by the prime minister at the time, Junichiro Koizumi.Mr. Aso has been visiting rural prefectures, where his message of increased government spending to help the economy has found strong support. According to an informal newspaper survey by The Yomiuri, he has locked up the backing of most of the party’s prefectural chapters, who hold 141 of the 528 votes to be cast in the party election. The rest are held by Liberal Democratic lawmakers, who get one vote each.Besides Mr. Aso, who is 67 and was an Olympic shooting competitor, most attention has gone to Yuriko Koike, 56, a former television anchor and former national security adviser, who is seeking to become Japan’s first female prime minister. Ms. Koike, who formally announced her candidacy on Monday, said she faced an uphill battle, comparing her political ambitions to Hillary Rodham Clinton’s failed bid for the United States presidency.“Hillary used the term ‘glass ceiling,’ ” Ms. Koike told TV Asahi on Sunday. “But in Japan, it’s usually an iron plate.”Ms. Koike is handicapped because she switched parties three times before joining the Liberal Democrats six years ago. Until Monday, she struggled to find the 20 party supporters required under the party’s nominating rules.Most of the other entrants — Shigeru Ishiba, a Washington-leaning former defense minister; Nobuteru Ishihara, the son of Tokyo’s governor; and Kaoru Yosano, the economic policy minister, who favors tax increases to fight Japan’s ballooning national deficit — lack the experience or breadth of party support to be serious contenders, lawmakers and analysts said.In a speech, Mr. Yosano, 70, suggested Monday that he challenged Mr. Aso to bring more competition to a Liberal Democratic vote that many here had begun criticizing as boring and predictable.“If things continue like this,” Mr. Yosano warned, “won’t Japanese politics lose appeal, and the L.D.P. fade into obscurity?”'"
"'08-09-10,'1','Lehman, which has about 24,700 employees around the world, is expected to announce a big quarterly loss on Wednesday morning, and the bank is expected to discuss its plans at that time.Lehman has survived for 157 years, through wars, the Depression and the vagaries of the markets, but got into trouble by buying and financing commercial and residential real estate, including subprime mortgages.On Wall Street, there is a growing sense that Lehman may have to solve its problems on its own, without drastic help from the government, which in March brokered the rescue of another Wall Street bank, Bear Stearns.“Some may worry that Treasury has taken on so much taxpayer burden they don’t have any remaining capacity more to take on the burdens of Lehman,” said David Trone, an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton.Authorities helped arrange and finance the sale of Bear because they feared that the collapse of that firm might cascade through the financial system.But unlike Bear Stearns, which seemed to crater overnight, Lehman’s fortunes have been dimming for months. Since February 2007, its stock price has plunged 91 percent, wiping out $40 billion in shareholder value.On Monday, as other financial shares surged after the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Lehman’s shares sank. Adding to that sell-off was concern that an investment in Lehman by a government-owned bank in Korea would fall through after Korean regulators threw cold water on the idea.Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, warned on Tuesday that it might cut one of Lehman’s primary credit ratings, citing concern about the firm’s ability to raise capital.Even as Lehman’s stock price plunged anew on Tuesday, however, some questioned whether the government could let a global financial institution like Lehman fail.Vincent R. Reinhart, a top former Fed official who has repeatedly criticized the shotgun takeover of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase, said it would be very difficult for the Federal Reserve to let Lehman collapse.“The plain fact about financial crises is that policy makers are unwilling to test the resilience of markets,” said Mr. Reinhart, now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.Financial institutions have been closely measuring their exposure to Lehman. On Tuesday, commercial and investment banks said they continued to do business with Lehman, and hedge funds did not appear to be pulling their accounts with the firm, events that helped precipitate the fall of Bear Stearns.Since March, Lehman has been in a fight for its life, as some investors, including prominent short-sellers betting against the bank’s stock, questioned how the firm was valuing some of its assets. Lehman lost $2.8 billion in the second quarter and was forced to raise $6 billion in new capital. But investors were not placated, and the firm was compelled to explore more extreme measures.For months, it has tried to raise capital, sell its asset management division and examined spinning off of its commercial mortgage assets into a new company.Richard S. Fuld Jr., Lehman’s hard-charging chief executive, has replaced virtually every major division head, including the firm’s president and chief financial officer.During that time he has replaced the global head of fixed income — the division from which most of Lehman’s problems have arisen — twice.But with every measure taken, Lehman’s stock price has fallen further.“Clearly the company does not believe that it has a serious balance sheet problem, and it simply refuses to take what it believes are fire sale prices for its key assets,” said Richard X. Bove, an analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann.While the bank has talked to many prospective investors, its most serious discussions appeared to be with Korea Development Bank, a state-run institution that is moving toward privatization. But on Monday, K.D.B.’s top regulator cast further doubt on prospects of an investment in Lehman.“It should take a cautious approach toward taking over Lehman, at a time when its privatization is not accomplished, and given the current conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets,” said Jun Kwang Woo, chairman of the Financial Services Commission.“The focus now should be on stabilizing the Korean markets,” Jun told lawmakers.He said it would be “inappropriate for a state-owned company to pursue such an acquisition at this time.”To some observers, Mr. Fuld has waited too long to take the major steps needed to shore up Lehman. A market veteran with almost four decades of experience, he seemed more optimistic than many of his peers that the market had gone too far and would come back, a strong case against selling. Bids for the company’s investment management division are due on Friday.“It is certainly the case that had Lehman seen this problem evolving as it has, then they could have and should have done something many, many months ago,” said Joseph A. Grundfest, professor of law and businesses at Stanford.Waiting has proved to be a dangerous gamble. Sovereign wealth funds, once eager to invest in troubled financial companies, have been burned by losses. American investors who bought shares of Lehman in June when it raised $6 billion have also lost billions.“He is dealing as if he has a whole deck of cards, when he has none,” said one banker who has had recent dealings with Lehman, representing a potential foreign buyer.Unlike Bear Stearns, which effectively collapsed when customers fled for the exits and the firm could not finance itself, Lehman Brothers has more sources of long-term financing and like other broker-dealers, access to emergency financing from the Federal Reserve. Mr. Fuld said that the existence of that lending facility should take any question of Lehman facing a liquidity crisis “off the table.”But with the stock price in free fall and the cost of buying protection against Lehman defaulting on its bonds skyrocketing, far surpassing the levels reached when Bear went under, it is clear Lehman is not immune to the kind of panic that can put a financial institution, which depends on confidence, at risk.“No bank or broker can withstand a strong panic by customers, clients or counterparties,” said Mr. Trone. “Even the best liquidity profile gets you only so far,” though he said that the existence of the emergency lending facility means that Lehman will have more flexibility and time than Bear did.Turmoil at the firm has led some to question whether Mr. Fuld should remain at the helm.“He’s been getting a lot of extra credit and good will based on his reputation and disposition as an honorable leader and as a smart, likable guy, but that’s not enough right now,” said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, associate dean of the Yale School of Management.'"
"'08-09-10,'1','North Korea is one of the world’s most isolated and unpredictable states, and a messy transfer of power would focus new attention on the security of its nuclear weapons arsenal.Mr. Kim had not missed the 10 past military parades staged for major anniversaries, during which columns of armored vehicles and rocket launchers rumbled through Pyongyang’s main plaza and legions of goose-stepping soldiers saluted him.But on Tuesday, there was only a parade by militia groups in charge of civil defense, and Mr. Kim did not attend.An American intelligence official, who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity because assessments about Mr. Kim’s health are classified, said Tuesday that it did not appear that Mr. Kim’s death was imminent. The official said there were no clear indications the North was stepping up preparations for a transfer of authority. The official would not say whether American intelligence agencies expected Mr. Kim to fully recover.The topic of Mr. Kim’s health came up in discussions between the chief American negotiator on North Korean nuclear issues, Christopher R. Hill, and Chinese officials during a recent trip by Mr. Hill to China, said a Bush administration official. But despite the closer contacts between China and North Korea, the official said, Mr. Hill did not come away with a clear sense of Mr. Kim’s condition, or what would happen in the event of his death.Earlier this year, the North had agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs in return for economic and political rewards from the United States and its allies, a major diplomatic victory for the Bush administration.But late last month the North Korean government reversed course. Angry that Washington had not removed it from a terrorism list, it said it had stopped disabling its main nuclear complex.It is now unclear whether Mr. Kim ordered the reversal or whether other North Korean officials were making decisions while he was incapacitated.Since the founding of North Korea in 1948 under Soviet guardianship, it has had only two leaders: Kim Il-sung and, after his death in 1994, his son, Kim Jong-il. Unlike his father, Mr. Kim has not publicly groomed any of his three sons to eventually take power, said Nicholas Eberstadt, a North Korea expert at the American Enterprise Institute. There are doubts about the abilities of all three sons, and American officials tend to gravitate toward theories that a military committee might take over the country.Underlying that guesswork are questions about who within the military hierarchy would control the country’s small arsenal of nuclear weapons.“There are a lot of people who will give you a series of assumptions about what happens to nuclear control if there is a leadership change,” one senior administration official with access to intelligence on North Korea said Tuesday. “To put it charitably, they are guessing.”South Korea’s largest newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, reported Tuesday that Mr. Kim collapsed Aug. 22, citing an unidentified South Korean diplomat in Beijing.The North’s state-run media have not reported any public appearance by Mr. Kim since mid-August, and speculation was already swirling that he might be in poor health. According to South Korea’s intelligence service, Mr. Kim has chronic heart disease and diabetes. He is believed to be in his mid-60s.Among scholars who examine every broadcast and speech from North Korea the way Kremlinologists once examined the Soviet Union, there has been particular focus on the talk given on Monday by Kim Yong-nam, considered the second-ranking official in the country.According to officials in Washington who read a translation of the speech, Mr. Kim appeared at times to refer to the country’s leader in the past tense, saying at one point, “Comrade Kim Jong-il’s seasoned leadership served as a decisive function that brought about the morning light of a powerful Socialist state and unfolded an era of new prosperity of military-first Korea.”But Kim Jong-il was also referred to in the present tense, including one tribute that said he “is a truly peerless patriot.”North Korea experts in Seoul cautioned that Mr. Kim had often disappeared from public view for extended periods.“The nuclear talks are in a stalemate,” said Kim Keun-sik, a North Korea expert at Kyungnam University in South Korea. “Tensions with the United States are deepening. Kim knew that the world was watching whether he would show up today. For him, this may be a perfect chance to bring world attention to him.”'"
"'08-09-10,'1','Mr. Samak made no immediate comment, but he has said he would abide by the court’s ruling. Parliament is scheduled to choose a new prime minister on Friday, with all parties eligible to put forward candidates.“Samak was ousted by the court, but there is no guarantee he will not return in the next few days,” said Surhyiyasai Katsila, a spokesman for the People’s Alliance for Democracy, which is leading the protests.The protesters accuse Mr. Samak of corruption and incompetence and say he is a stand-in for former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a coup two years ago.Mr. Thaksin is in London, where he is seeking political asylum in an attempt to evade corruption charges. He says the charges are politically motivated.Mr. Samak’s government is made up primarily of supporters of Mr. Thaksin, and Mr. Samak has advertised himself publicly as a stand-in for Mr. Thaksin, who remains hugely popular among Thailand’s majority of poor and rural voters.Until a new prime minister is seated, an interim government will be led by a brother-in-law of Mr. Thaksin, Deputy Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat, who is also minister of education.The head of the nine-judge Constitutional Court panel, Chat Chonlaworn, read out the unanimous verdict on Tuesday, saying Mr. Samak had violated a constitutional ban on private employment while in office. “His position as prime minister has ended,” he said.Judge Chat said that Mr. Samak had given conflicting testimony on Monday as to whether he had been paid a salary or expenses and that there had been an attempt to fabricate evidence and “to hide his actions.”Mr. Samak had defended himself in court, saying he had not been an employee of the television station and had not earned a salary. “I did it because I liked doing it,” he said.He was paid $2,350 for four shows on a program called “Tasting and Complaining,” according to testimony by the managing director of the company producing the show. Mr. Samak had been host of the show for seven years but gave it up in April, more than two months after being sworn in as prime minister.Even if he is reinstated, Mr. Samak’s legal troubles will not be over. He faces three charges of corruption that have not yet reached the courts and he is appealing a two-year prison sentence for defamation for accusing Bangkok’s deputy governor of corruption. Conviction in any of these cases could also force him to step down.The appeal in the defamation case is scheduled to be heard on Sept. 25, when Mr. Samak plans to address the United Nations in New York. The court said he would face an arrest warrant if he did not appear. Mr. Samak has said he is confident that he will not be ousted while he is away.In addition to these court cases, the independent Election Commission ruled last week that Mr. Samak’s party had committed electoral fraud last December and should be dissolved. The Constitutional Court is set to decide that case soon.'"

Let’s call it: “Where’s the Senate race?”Defying state law, they have decided to hide a hard-fought race for the at the bottom of the ballot, where they clearly are hoping some voters will overlook it. Their proposed design is not only illegal. It shows a deep contempt for Mississippi’s voters.Republicans have long had a lock on the state’s two Senate seats. But this year, former Gov. , a Democrat, has been running close to Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican, in the polls. Mr. Wicker was appointed to the seat by Governor Barbour in late December after stepped down.Mississippi election law clearly states that federal elections must go at the top of ballots. And the secretary of state, Delbert Hosemann, plans to list the state’s other Senate race — incumbent is running far ahead of his Democratic challenger, Erik Fleming — where it belongs, right below the presidential contest.But Mr. Hosemann argues that because the Wicker-Musgrove race is a special election to fill the remainder of Mr. Lott’s term, he is free to place it at the bottom, below state and county races.'"
"'08-09-11,'1','Still, going into the meeting, Saudi Arabia was expected to prevail in its stated goal of keeping enough oil on the market to drive prices below $100 a barrel. The Saudi view is that lowering prices moderately now will shore up the world economy and prevent a recession that would cause oil prices to collapse. The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, described the markets as being “well balanced” when he arrived in Vienna.But after a six-hour private meeting, OPEC ministers decided to pare their production by complying strictly with targets that had been set up last year but were largely ignored. According to Mr. Khelil, who is also Algeria’s oil minister, OPEC’s actual production would have to be lowered by about 500,000 barrels a day within the next 40 days.“We are oversupplying the market, and we are cutting that oversupply,” said Abdalla Salem el-Badri, the group’s secretary general. “We don’t want to see these prices decline dramatically.”It remained unclear Wednesday exactly how the Saudis lost the argument behind closed doors. And despite the OPEC communiqué, it is far from clear that OPEC members will actually reduce their output. After a short night, Saudi officials were quick to reassure markets.“Saudi Arabia will meet the market’s demand,” a senior OPEC delegate said. “We will see what the market requires and we will not leave a customer without oil. The policy has not changed.”The Saudi message is to wait and see where demand is headed before eventually paring supplies. The Saudis made their strategy clear Wednesday in informal talks and briefings with some oil industry analysts and reporters, but as is their custom, they would not speak for attribution because they did not want to appear to undermine a collective OPEC decision.In June, King Abdullah pledged that his country would pump at full tilt to bring prices down. In August, the kingdom increased its production to 9.7 million barrels a day, the highest in three decades. Saudi Arabia is now producing around 9.5 million barrels a day, 600,000 barrels a day more than its quota.“This seems to set Saudi Arabia up as the unilateral decision-maker on output for the fall,” said Greg Priddy, an energy analyst at Eurasia Group, in a research note. “Clearly, other OPEC members are not going to trim their own production without Saudi Arabia returning to its quota. Saudi Arabia also seems to be eager to avoid headlines about it cutting production in advance of the U.S. elections.”Adding to the confusion, OPEC said that two new members, Angola and Ecuador, were given new production quotas while Indonesia, a member since 1962 that has become a net importer of oil in recent years, was suspending its membership in the organization by the end of the year. OPEC officials had trouble explaining precisely how much production would need to be cut. Mr. Badri also declined to provide new targets for each member state.OPEC’s discordant message is a reflection of the competing policies at play within the group, which includes countries like Kuwait, Nigeria, and its newest and smallest member, Ecuador. Some countries are carefully managing their oil windfall, while others are spending freely with the expectation that prices will remain high.Moderate and pro-Western states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are aware that high energy costs are hurting demand and might push consumers to seek alternatives to oil. These countries want to see prices fall below $100 a barrel to ease political enmity against the cartel.Another group, composed of OPEC’s traditional price hawks, increasingly needs high prices to finance a wide range of social and military policies. Analysts say they believe that Iran and Venezuela, for example, cannot afford prices below $100 a barrel as they seek to project power in their respective regions.As OPEC worked to push up prices from lows reached in the late 1990s, members of the cartel all shared the same interests and were willing to leave their differences aside. But now that demand is weakening and prices are falling, some analysts say they believe that tensions within the group are resurfacing. In past years, OPEC has been notoriously bad at maintaining discipline in its ranks when prices fall.The perception that OPEC was unwilling to do its part to bring down prices brought sharp criticism Wednesday from Western officials. “We’d like to see more oil on the market, not less,” the White House press secretary, Dana M. Perino, said at a briefing.The decision represents a rare case of the cartel going against the position of its biggest member. As he walked from his hotel to the OPEC headquarters on Tuesday evening, Mr. Naimi, the Saudi minister, seemed particularly proud of his country’s efforts to pump as much oil as needed to push down prices.“It was hard work,” Mr. Naimi said, strolling along the city’s cobbled streets. “The market is in a very healthy position.”Six hours later, Mr. Naimi left the meeting without a word of public comment.'"
"'08-09-11,'1','With Ms. Palin back in Alaska for a few days — she headed home on her own plane after her appearance with Mr. McCain in Fairfax, Va. — the McCain campaign will now be left to sort out the shifting politics of the pick. At the least, Ms. Palin has stopped Mr. McCain from criticizing Mr. Obama as this year’s political celebrity and has led him to focus more on character issues and women.Tellingly, the campaign has announced no large rallies with Mr. McCain alone, and a senior McCain aide said Wednesday that the campaign was considering keeping Ms. Palin and Mr. McCain together for appearances more often than is usual for running mates — perhaps more so than any ticket in recent times.On Thursday, Mr. McCain will appear with Mr. Obama in New York at ground zero and at a forum at Columbia University on the seventh anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. On Friday he will tape appearances on “The View” on ABC and on Rachael Ray’s cooking show. He is to have no public appearances on Saturday.On Wednesday in Fairfax, Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin stuck to their stump speeches and then worked the crowd, Mr. McCain in a dark suit and tie, Ms. Palin in a black suit with ruby red heels at least three inches high. New words were mostly provided by former Senator Fred D. Thompson, one of Mr. McCain’s rivals for the Republican nomination, who introduced Ms. Palin.“Sarah Palin is the most remarkable success story in the history of American politics,” Mr. Thompson declared.He then criticized the news media, a theme and tactic of the McCain campaign in recent weeks, for heading to Alaska to “turn over every rock” to look into Ms. Palin’s past. “They are now parachuting in dozens of lawyers and investors and scandal mongers and representatives of cable news,” Mr. Thompson said, as the crowd booed the media. Mr. Thompson added, “I hope they brought their own brie and Chablis with them.”David Ray Hudson, the senior enlisted leader of the National Guard bureau at the Pentagon and a member of the Alaska National Guard, happened to be in the crowd, listening closely.“We’ve got brie and Chablis in Alaska,” he said.In Virginia, Ms. Palin continued to press her case that she had been opposed to the so-called bridge to nowhere between the Alaskan city of Ketchikan and the sparsely populated island of Gravina despite widespread reporting that she had initially embraced the project.“I told Congress, Thanks but no thanks for that bridge to nowhere,” Ms. Palin said.'"

"'08-09-11,'1','Here is the alternative. Getting the software for a smartphone is fairly easy. People with smartphones featuring Windows Mobile software, like the AT&T Tilt, the T-Mobile MDA Vario III, the XV6800 from Verizon or the Mogul from Sprint, can go to WMWiFiRouter.com, where the application costs about $30. Those with smartphones featuring Symbian software, like the Nokia E71 and the Samsung Omnia, can visit Joiku.com, where the software costs about $21.Both sites include a full list of compatible devices, as does a similar service, walkinghotspot.com, which had its debut this week. That service costs $7 a month, and works on recent Nokia and HTC phones that have either Symbian or Windows Mobile Professional software, like the Palm Treo 800w. (No one has yet created such software for the BlackBerry from Research in Motion, so its users will watch this trend unfolding from the sidelines.)Once the service is working, you will create what is actually a mobile hot spot. You will want to protect your service with a password to keep the connection safe from hackers and fraudsters. Even if no bad guys find you, the more users who are on your line, the slower your Web connection and the faster your battery will drain.If you have a new smartphone, you are likely to have an unlimited data plan already. But if you do not, and you use these new applications for a few hours of video chatting, have the defibrillator handy before opening next month’s bill.The hot spot software will work wherever you get a data signal, but it will work well only if you have a 3G connection. Check the carrier’s coverage maps for that; otherwise Web surfing will be excruciatingly slow.IPhone users are out of luck. Netshare, software similar to JoikuSpot and WMWiFiRouter, was withdrawn last month from the iPhone application store days after it appeared. Netshare’s parent company would not respond to e-mail messages seeking comment, AT&T referred inquiries to Apple and Apple would not comment.Penny-pinchers who can get high-speed cell service at home may be tempted to scrap their Internet providers and use their phones as wireless modems. Nic Covey, an analyst with Nielsen Mobile, said: “If you’re on a 3G network, it becomes an interesting possibility.”The networks certainly like the fact that more people connect to the Web with their cellphones. Mr. Covey said that 43 percent of those with mobile data cards use them most often at home, and 59 percent of them might ditch their home Internet providers as a result.Carriers seem to have no problem with customers’ use of the new software to make end-runs around the company’s paid services, perhaps because they generally have no way of knowing when subscribers are using such software. But an AT&T spokesman, Fletcher Cook, suggested customers might find more reliable or faster connections with AT&T’s PC cards — a claim the sellers of hot spot software dispute.Wireless networks are watching the rise of JoikuSpot and WMWiFiRouter with understandable interest. The carriers make money from people with unlimited data plans — like those who use JoikuSpot and WMWiFiRouter — but they make more money from those who add laptop data card services to their monthly subscriptions, and even more from a monthly Internet service bill.As more people buy fancier smartphones and inexpensive hot spot software, though, data card services will have a tougher time competing.¶Internet browsers are good at remembering the passwords for various sites. Now you can get a similar service for your phone. Ilium Software (IliumSoft.com) recently introduced eWallet, an application that saves personal information in an encrypted file so you can retrieve it when you visit password-protected sites. The software costs $20 for Windows Mobile and Palm phones, and $10 for iPhones.¶Can’t wait to share that new video or slide show with friends? Moblyng (moblyng.com) takes multimedia files you have uploaded onto MySpace, YouTube and other sites and sends them to a cellphone.

"'08-09-11,'1','The world needs more video games like Ratchet & Clank Future: Quest for Booty.Not because it represents the latest frontier in serious interactive storytelling, which it certainly does not. And not because it deeply engages the mind in a new way, which it also does not.Instead the world needs more diversions like Booty simply because many people don’t want to invest a lot of money and a week or more of their leisure hours every time they want to play a game with well-known characters, hilarious voice acting, engaging puzzles and fabulous graphics, all of which Booty has in abundance.You see, if you want to experience the best console games these days, you usually have to spend somewhere between 15 and 50 hours getting through all the basic content on the disc. And for that you’re likely to spend $59.99 (or $65.01, if you include New York State sales tax).Out in the real world $65 is still a fair chunk of change for most people — perhaps what they would spend on a reasonably fancy dinner for two. (We’re not talking about Manhattan, where you’re lucky if $65 gets you and a lunch date some tilapia that came frozen in a box and a glass of wine that may also have come in a box.) More broadly, the high cost and deep time investment required for most top-end games has generally prevented them from competing with cinema as a casual, “Hey, what are we doing tonight?” activity.Booty, by contrast, is a welcome gaming equivalent of a night at the movies. It costs only $15, is over in three or four hours and provides an enjoyably light entertainment experience. You don’t even have to go to the store because Booty is available only as a PlayStation Network download for the PlayStation 3.Of course there are plenty ofdownloadable games out there, both for the PS3 and the Xbox 360 (not to mention PCs, but that is a different sort of market). The difference is that most downloadable console titles are like quarter-devouring arcade games: there are a slew of repetitive levels and a numerical score that serves to distract you from the fact that in the end you invariably lose.'"
"'08-09-11,'1','OUTFITTING a nursery used to be a snap: pink for girls, blue for boys, yellow for babies whose parents were a bit more progressive. Put a crib here and a bassinet there, mount an animal mobile that plays “Farmer in the Dell,” and the work was done.Today, there is a wider variety of well-designed products that are sophisticated and eco-friendly. Traditional pastels are giving way to other palettes, like black and white with bold accents.When Christiane Lemieux shopped for a nursery for her son, William, now 11 months old, it was a mild case of the cobbler’s children having no shoes. She and her husband, Joshua Young, own Dwell Studio, a home furnishings company that will add a new line of children’s furniture, rugs and bedding in October. Preparing the new line kept her busy. “I’m still scrambling to catch up,” said Ms. Lemieux, who also has a 2 ½-year-old, Isabelle. “I’ve had to re-educate myself from one child to the next.”With no time to lose, she headed out on a spree in Brooklyn and Manhattan, and found a world of color and ingenuity. At Olá Baby on Court Street in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, mothers, nannies and strollers were out in force by 10 a.m. “I’ve already got a crib, so I bought this one,” Ms. Lemieux said of a white model by Oeuf made partly of reclaimed wood and with nontoxic finish, that can be converted into a toddler bed by replacing its high bars with low-profile rails.At Modern Tots in Dumbo, Brooklyn, Ms. Lemieux found a high chair that can tilt back to become a bassinet. She dismissed a velvet rocker (“For those who have a household staff,” she said). But she praised a changing table that looked like a dresser. Ms. Lemieux chose a three-section model with a blond wood base and plain white doors, simple and elegant enough to be used later as a sideboard after its tray top is removed.John Derian Dry Goods in the East Village carries leather poufs (“Talk about convertible,” Ms. Lemieux said) that can act as seating or a child’s table; French costumes to hang as decorations until a future Halloween; and bold (and costly) ink drawings by Hugo Guinness. In the meatpacking district she found more poufs (in silver lamé) and a polar bear rocker at two branches of Yoya. “The whole animal thing is kind of done for adults,” she said, “but it’s still great for kids.”The list of products needed to raise a child can seem endless, but Ms. Lemieux takes it in stride. “Parenting is scary; there’s no manual,” she said. “The right stuff makes you feel better, or at least sleep better at night.”'"
"'08-09-11,'1','“This can only go on for so long,” said Christopher Whalen, a managing partner at Institutional Risk Analytics. “If this goes on until the end of the year, the bank is either going to have to be sold or recapitalized by the government. Those are the only choices.”Inside Washington Mutual, executives were perplexed by what they saw as paranoia driving down the stock, according to people briefed on the situation.The decision to hire Mr. Fishman, a veteran banker, had been seen as a way to clean up the mess left by Mr. Killinger after a series of deals that built Washington Mutual into a large but poorly managed lender. The bank had also reached an agreement with the government that effectively put it on probation. But Washington Mutual announced that its plans would not require it to raise capital or improve liquidity.Even so, investors remain nervous about its financial health and believe the job may be too big for Mr. Fishman. Washington Mutual is in a precarious position because it has roughly $180 billion of mortgage-related loans, which could result in $9 billion to $14 billion in losses this year, said Jaime Peters, a Morningstar analyst. Losses in its big subprime credit card portfolio have ballooned.“If loss rates continue to rise, WaMu could see charge-offs of 4 or 5 percent by the end of the year,” Mr. Whalen said. “Their entire capital could be wiped out.”It has been 15 years since any bank larger than $10 billion in assets collapsed. The largest bank failure on record occurred in 1984 when Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust in Chicago ran into trouble, presaging the savings and loan crisis. Should Washington Mutual, with assets of $310 billion, find itself in a similar predicament, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would take a crushing blow to its insurance fund.In early March, JPMorgan Chase sent a letter to Washington Mutual, urging it to consider a deal quickly because the environment was becoming worse. Washington Mutual balked, preferring to remain independent. A month later, Mr. Killinger turned to TPG and several other private equity investors after it became clear that the bank needed capital. The deal allowed Mr. Killinger to keep his job, but many analysts said the bank would need another infusion.Since then, the picture has only become more bleak. In the second quarter, Washington Mutual posted its biggest loss ever, which sent shares plummeting. Its stock price fell to just over $3 in mid-July, roughly 65 percent less than the $8.75-a-share price that TPG paid in its transaction.The company also had its credit outlook cut by Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, this week because of its position in the housing market. The cost to insure the company’s debt rose to a record high Wednesday, another sign that investors are increasingly nervous about the company’s ability to pay back its loans. Washington Mutual has $44 billion of debt that falls due this year and $43 billion due between 2009 and 2014, Ms. Peters said.If Washington Mutual needs to raise capital quickly, it will very likely find itself between a rock and a hard place, because credit markets have all but closed their doors to troubled banks.TPG, the big private equity firm, agreed to pump in $7 billion in June and might be a logical choice to invest more. But with Washington Mutual’s stock trading at less than $3 a share, that investment has not turned out well so far. TPG has a track record of being patient. Still, it is unclear whether it would choose to double down on its bet or cut its losses.Another possible plan would be for Washington Mutual to pursue a suitor. But there are few banks healthy enough, or willing, to strike such a big deal. JPMorgan Chase has long had its eye on Washington Mutual for its big retail branch network, which would give it a foothold on the California coast and add to its heft in the New York and Chicago markets. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.Even so, a change in the accounting rules, effective in December, make that extremely difficult. In the past, an acquiring bank would be able to record the value of the assets of the institution it bought as a portion of the value that it paid for them. Under the new rules, a bank must immediately mark them to where they could be sold, causing any acquirer to absorb a big hit to its capital. That would most likely force the buyer to raise fresh capital.“The way that you do that normally is by making it up through earnings, but here you don’t have that luxury,” said Robert Willens, an independent accounting consultant.As a result, some in the industry have started to wonder whether the government might have to step in. One option, similar to the approach taken with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, might be for the government to agree to buy shares issued by Washington Mutual. Some analysts said that would provide the capital to allow the bank to get through the current problems.Another might be for the government to provide assistance with a sale, similar to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s approach in the JPMorgan-Bear Stearns merger. Such a move would help reduce the blow to the acquiring bank’s capital caused by a sale, and allow it to start benefiting from such a deal.“If you can get through this initial capital defect, you are going to be buying guaranteed earnings for as long as the eye can see,” Mr. Willens said.'"

A Graco spokeswoman, Stacy Becker, confirmed that the company alerted the commission on that date that some Graco bassinets made until 2004 were identical to some of the models in the alert. About 200,000 of the bassinets recalled last month might have carried the Graco name. But that information does not appear to have been added to the recall.

"'08-09-12,'0','Psychologists have shown that we are organized by our attachments. Sociologists have shown the power of social networks to affect individual behavior.What emerges is not a picture of self-creating individuals gloriously free from one another, but of autonomous creatures deeply interconnected with one another. Recent doctrine has emphasized the power of the individual, but underestimates the importance of connections, relationships, institutions and social filaments that organize personal choices and make individuals what they are.This may seem like an airy-fairy thing. But it is the main impediment to Republican modernization. Over the past few weeks, Republicans have talked a lot about change, modernization and reform. Despite the talk, many of the old policy pillars are the same. We’re living in an age of fast-changing economic, information and social networks, but Republicans are still impeded by Goldwater’s mental guard-rails.If there’s a thread running through the gravest current concerns, it is that people lack a secure environment in which they can lead their lives. Wild swings in global capital and energy markets buffet family budgets. Nobody is sure the health care system will be there when they need it. National productivity gains don’t seem to alleviate economic . Inequality strains national cohesion. In many communities, social norms do not encourage academic achievement, decent values or family stability. These problems straining the social fabric aren’t directly addressed by maximizing individual freedom.And yet locked in the old framework, the Republican Party’s knee-jerk response to many problems is: “Throw a voucher at it.” Schools are bad. Throw a voucher. Health care system’s a mess. Replace it with federally funded individual choice. Economic anxiety? Lower some tax rate.The latest example of the mismatch between ideology and reality is the housing crisis. The party’s individualist model cannot explain the social contagion that caused hundreds of thousands of individuals to make bad decisions in the same direction at the same time. A Republican administration intervened gigantically in the market to handle the , Freddie and Fannie debacles. But it has no conservative rationale to explain its action, no language about the importance of social equilibrium it might use to justify itself.The irony, of course, is that, in pre-Goldwater days, conservatives were incredibly sophisticated about the value of networks, institutions and invisible social bonds. You don’t have to go back to Edmund Burke and Adam Smith (though it helps) to find conservatives who understood that people are socially embedded creatures and that government has a role (though not a dominant one) in nurturing the institutions in which they are embedded.That language of community, institutions and social fabric has been lost, and now we hear only distant echoes — when social conservatives talk about family bonds or when talks at a forum about national service.If Republicans are going to fully modernize, they’re probably going to have to follow the route the British Conservatives have already trod and project a conservatism that emphasizes society as well as individuals, security as well as freedom, a social revival and not just an economic one and the community as opposed to the state.'"
"'08-09-12,'0','The most disheartening aspect of a scurrilous Republican ad falsely accusing Barack Obama of promoting sex education for kindergarten children is its closing line: “I’m John McCain, and I approved this message.”This from that straight-talker of yore, who fervidly denounced the 2004 Bush campaign’s Swift Boat character attacks on John Kerry’s military record.What a difference four years makes, especially after Mr. McCain secured the nomination by hiring some of the same low-blow artists from the Bush campaign.The kindergarten ad flat-out lies: telling voters that Mr. Obama’s “one accomplishment” in education was to favor “comprehensive” sex education for 5-year-olds. “Learning about sex before learning to read?” intones the voice-over, as a blur of respected sources are cited — none of them accurately, as they have proclaimed.The truth is that as an Illinois legislator, Mr. Obama favored a sensible bill supported by many mainline organizations — including the Illinois Parent Teacher Association, the Illinois State Medical Society and the Illinois Public Health Association — to provide an “age and developmentally appropriate” sex education curriculum for older students. At most, kindergarteners were to be taught the dangers of sexual predators. And parents of children of all ages had the right to withdraw their children from the classes.Surely, Senator McCain knows that all that change he’s promising for the tooth-and-claw Washington culture must start on the hustings. Yet, the kindergarten ad that he’s blessed signals that his goal is shamefully more of the same.The way these ads work, this one is already playing over and over on the Web as a free-media “ghost,” in professional parlance — too late for any cynical expression of regret by Mr. McCain. And no regret has been offered.'"
"'08-09-12,'0','“There’s going to be a swarm of lawyers descending on the courthouse,” said Terence L. Kindlon, who represents a Florida doctor who pleaded guilty in the case but has not yet been sentenced. “It’s going to look like locusts.”A spokeswoman for Mr. Soares, Heather Orth, disagreed, saying that the judge’s decision would not affect the 17 cases in which defendants had agreed to guilty pleas, including one announced just hours after Judge Herrick’s ruling. In a statement, Mr. Soares said his office would continue its investigation into the alleged steroid ring and would appeal Judge Herrick’s decision.“As a result of the hard work by all agencies involved, we have been able to disrupt a multimillion-dollar criminal enterprise trafficking illegal steroids to thousands of people across the country,” Mr. Soares said. “This office, our partners in law enforcement and those who have been harmed from the use of these illegal narcotics wholeheartedly believe in the strength of this case, and we will be appealing today’s decision in the very near future.”In courtrooms and in presentations to the news media, Mr. Soares had depicted Signature as the heart of a nationwide ring of fly-by-night Web sites and crooked doctors who had conspired to make buying steroids and other controlled substances as easy as clicking a mouse button.Prosecutors charged that the Web sites connected customers — athletes in search of better performances, retirees lured by the promised anti-aging benefit of substances like human growth hormone — with doctors, who gave prescriptions to people they had never met or diagnosed. Signature filled the prescriptions, prosecutors contended.But in a bitingly worded decision, Judge Herrick described the case against Signature as “complex and unwieldy,” noting that prosecutors had presented four succeeding indictments to two grand juries over 15 months, often changing the specific counts charged against the Signature owners and employees and bringing new facts to bear against them.The most serious charge against the defendants — enterprise corruption, a Class B felony — had until now survived the ebbs and flows of the case.But during the presentation of the fourth and final indictment, the judge wrote, a prosecutor had misled the grand jury by failing to inform them that he had previously dismissed several of the counts being presented. Nor did the prosecutor offer sufficient instruction to the jury, Judge Herrick wrote.“The grand jury was not advised as to which counts charged which particular crimes and, apparently were left to sift through the voluminous amount of materials and exhibits introduced, along with the new version of the indictment to figure it out for themselves,” he wrote.Ultimately, Judge Herrick found, “the amorphous quality of the evolving indictments,” coupled with “cursory and inadequate instructions,” demanded that he dismiss the charges against the five defendants.Referring to the prosecution’s actions, Mr. LaMarche, the defense lawyer, said: “Why they did the things they did, I don’t know.”'"
"'08-09-12,'0','Can things get worse for Washington Mutual, the nation’s largest savings and loan?Trying to weather a rout in its stock, the bank provided an early update on its performance Thursday after markets closed, trying to convince its investors and customers that its capital was sound and that conditions were stabilizing.Moments later, the Moody’s rating service cut the bank’s investment rating to junk, warning its access to debt and equity markets remained limited at a time when many analysts say it needs to raise capital.The troubled savings and loan has contended it has adequate funding to support its daily operations, and disputed the decision to cut its rating.In Thursday’s update on its third-quarter performance, Washington Mutual said that expected charge-off rates would climb in the quarter — albeit at a slower pace than in prior periods. The bank also marked down its Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock holdings by 90 percent, to $282 million, but did not provide write-off estimates. It raised the possibility that a good-will impairment might lower third-quarter earnings but not affect its financial condition.Washington Mutual plans to report its earnings on Oct. 22.JPMorgan Chase executives have been studying the company in recent weeks as they considered another bid, after approaching Washington Mutual in March. James Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, has long had his sights set on Washington Mutual for its big California branch network and its New York and Chicago operations.

But JPMorgan executives are not prepared to make an offer unless government officials request one, according to people briefed on the situation.'"

On Aug. 14, Insee released an initial estimate of 12,200 jobs lost in the quarter. “The economic slowdown has hit employment faster than usual,” said Dominique Barbet, an economist at BNP Paribas in Paris. “Employment declines will weigh on income and confidence and prevent a significant economic recovery.”'"
"'08-09-12,'0','Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, is arguing that Senator John McCain’s plan to end the tax bias against those who buy insurance individually, and to replace it with health care tax credits for all, would increase costs for many consumers and leave others underinsured.Mr. McCain, the Republican nominee, is charging that Mr. Obama’s proposal, which would allow the privately insured to maintain their coverage while creating a heavily subsidized government plan for the uninsured, would “force families into a government-run health care system.”Advocacy groups, meanwhile, are spending tens of millions of dollars on advertising to keep the issue at the forefront of the 2009 Congressional agenda. And working groups, both inside and outside Congress, are meeting to search for points of bipartisan agreement that might produce at least incremental change.Polls show not that concern about health care has faded significantly, only that the foreboding about energy and the economy has blitzed past it. Some analysts of health care politics argue that because Democrats are more associated with the issue, any de-emphasis may help Republicans. They warn, however, that candidates ignore health care at their own peril.“It’s generally more helpful to Democrats than to Republicans, so when health care is subsumed into the economy it may not have as much of an edge,” said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, one of the advocacy groups behind the new “Harry and Louise” television commercials about the plight of the uninsured. “But in terms of what people want to hear candidates talk about, they certainly want to hear something about health care.”That message is not lost on Mr. Price, one of 13 medical doctors in Congress. An orthopedic surgeon, the son and grandson of physicians, he speaks regularly about health care on the stump, saying it is “broken beyond repair by nibbling at the sides.” He has polled voters on the issue and mailed out fliers explaining his positions.As a Republican and a physician, Mr. Price says, it distresses him that his party has allowed health care to be defined as a Democratic issue. (In an August poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 58 percent of those questioned said Mr. Obama was the presidential candidate more likely to make health care a priority, compared with 20 percent for Mr. McCain.)“People believe Republicans don’t have a health care gene because many Republicans don’t talk about it with any frequency,” said Mr. Price, who is heavily favored to defeat his Democratic opponent, Bill Jones. “I think, however, that it is a Republican issue, because the solution embraces our conservative principles, the imperative of individuals and their families being able to make decisions. Nobody truly believes the government can solve this, save Democrat politicians.”To prompt debate, Mr. Price has introduced legislation to allow individuals to buy insurance with pretax dollars, as is currently the case for those who purchase employer-sponsored plans. (Mr. McCain would achieve the same equity in the opposite way, by ending the exclusion from income taxes for employer plans.)To promote universal coverage, the Price plan would also provide tax deductions and credits to all who cannot afford insurance, a proposition whose price tag to the government is unknown but certain to be expensive. And he would allow individuals to select from an array of plans rather than permitting employers to limit their choices.The McCain plan, Mr. Price said, “is a step in the right direction.” But he said Mr. McCain’s proposed tax credits of $2,500 an individual and $5,000 a family would not be enough to make insurance affordable for everyone who needs help.If Mr. Price seems proactive on health care, it is at least partly because he, like other Republicans, starts from a defensive stance. His opponent, Mr. Jones, plans to make a major issue of Mr. Price’s votes last year against a Democratic proposal to expand vastly the eligibility for the Children’s Health Insurance Program. President Bush twice vetoed the expansion, and Mr. Price and other Republicans helped him sustain the vetoes.The congressman has worked to explain those votes. “People in my district,” he said, “understand that the last thing we need to be doing is moving folks from private health insurance to public health insurance, which is exactly what that bill did.”But Mr. Jones, a former commercial pilot and Air Force veteran, said his indignation over those votes had driven him to challenge Mr. Price. “He wraps himself in his white coat while arguing why we can’t expand our health care system,” Mr. Jones said.When provided openings, other Democrats have attacked what they see as a Republican soft spot. In the open race in Illinois’s 11th District, for instance, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has distributed two mailings calling attention to the claim by the Republican candidate, Marty Ozinga, that health care is available to all Americans. “I don’t care who you are, if you’re sick or you get hurt, you go to the hospital and you get taken care of,” Mr. Ozinga was quoted as saying on a local cable television program.Representative Chris Van Hollen, the Maryland Democrat who heads the campaign committee, said Mr. Ozinga’s opponent, State Senator Debbie Halvorson, “is going to zero in on this like a laser beam.”All Democratic candidates, Mr. Van Hollen said, will try to invigorate the debate over health care by emphasizing its part in the country’s economic travails.“While there continues to be a moral issue of ensuring that our people have access to basic health care,” he said, “it’s also a family budget issue and an economic issue in an era of global competition.”'"
"'08-09-12,'0','“That certainly doesn’t mesh with the story Mr. Masters is telling,” said Prof. Dwight R. Sanders, an agricultural economist at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, who has studied both reports.The dollar value of those fund positions did rise, to $51 billion from about $39 billion, according to the new study. But the increase reflects only the impact of rising oil prices — not the flow of new money into the market, the report found.When counted in terms of separate futures contracts, the funds’ stake fell 11 percent during that period, to 363,000 contracts from 408,000 contracts, according to the study.The study also showed that index funds have a much smaller share of the market than previously estimated — 17 percent of all futures and options involving domestically traded commodities, as of June 30. Their net stake in oil markets was just 13 percent, not the 70 percent or more cited in previous estimates.Mr. Masters, a hedge fund manager who has frequently testified before Congress, said in an e-mail message Thursday that he was “delving into the numbers” in the new C.F.T.C. report “to understand what they do and do not encompass.” He hoped to have more to say when he testified on Tuesday before a Senate energy subcommittee, he added.The commission has come under withering criticism this summer, accused of failing to curtail excessive speculation in commodity markets. But so far, legislation aimed at limiting institutional commodity investments has stalled.The report does offer some support for the agency’s critics. The agency found that on about three dozen occasions, none involving illegal trading, the total stake of 18 commercial traders exceeded regulatory limits or guidelines when their over-the-counter swaps positions were added to their stake on public exchanges.And the commission acknowledged that it needed better tools for measuring market activity, especially in the swaps market.It is recommending several changes, including new disclosure rules for swaps dealers and the creation of a new office of data collection. It also called for a substantial increase in agency staff and resources to handle these expanded data-gathering duties.'"
"'08-09-12,'0','WASHINGTON — Four Democratic senators urged the Bush administration on Thursday to stop the nation’s two giant mortgage finance companies, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, from foreclosing on any homes for at least 90 days and to help troubled borrowers switch into more affordable mortgages.On Sunday, the government seized control of both government-sponsored mortgage finance companies. The Treasury Department pledged to supply up to $100 billion in fresh capital for each company and prevent them from defaulting on the trillions of dollars in mortgage-backed securities that they either own or have guaranteed.The four senators — Charles E. Schumer of New York, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Robert Menendez of New Jersey — said the administration should follow the example of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which took over IndyMac Bank in Pasadena, Calif., and imposed a temporary freeze on foreclosures while it tried to modify as many delinquent loans as possible.The senators described their goal as a temporary “time-out” that would give federal regulators and the newly appointed chiefs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac a chance to help defaulting borrowers negotiate new loan terms or refinance into a different mortgage.“In many instances, these homeowners could remain in their homes and their loans could once again become performing assets through a loan modification,” the senators wrote in a letter to James B. Lockhart, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the regulator now in charge of both companies.'"
"'08-09-12,'0','When David Brooks says that Barack Obama needs “to attack the snobs who are savaging Sarah Palin’s faith and family,” he does not account for what anyone in an organization responsible for hiring new employees knows: the applicant’s background must show a good fit with the requirements of the job.It is not snobbish to recognize that the job of vice president of the United States at this point in history requires a broad understanding of our diverse, globalized world and ways to strengthen the weakened position in it that this country has suffered over the last eight years.It is not snobbish to require practical answers to the fundamental issues of economic instability and insecurity on both the national and personal level, global energy and food shortages and imbalances, and the effects of natural resource depletion.It is not snobbish to require effective solutions to domestic problems of health care, education, infrastructure deterioration and retirement insecurity for the huge baby boom generation.Nothing we have been told about Sarah Palin’s background or thought processes indicates that she meets any of these requirements.

"'08-09-12,'0','A prolonged downturn might prompt some investors to rethink these investments or demand lower fees from managers, who typically collect annual management fees of 2 percent and then take a 20 percent cut of any profits. Trouble at hedge funds also might draw government scrutiny, given the amount of pension money sitting within these unregulated firms.“Everyone is looking for a panacea, everyone is looking for a quick way to make money fast, and everyone is pinning their dreams on the backs of these hedge funds,” said Dan McAllister, the treasurer and tax collector of San Diego County, whose pension fund lost money when a hedge fund called Amaranth collapsed two years ago. “But maybe it’s time to be a little cautious, and it’s time to look at things with a more discreet eye.”While big hedge funds have blown up in the past, and many small ones fail every year, the current problems are more far-reaching than in the past.Fund after fund is warning investors that the markets have become increasingly difficult to predict. They are having a tougher time making money now that Wall Street banks like Lehman Brothers, which is in an all-out fight for survival, have reduced the amount of money they are willing to lend to the funds in order to safeguard themselves.It is now 5 to 10 percent more expensive for hedge funds to borrow from banks than it was a year ago, and banks are increasingly hesitant to lend to hedge funds for long periods.In recent weeks, several funds have closed, most notably a fund run by Ospraie Management. Rumors about troubled hedge funds like Atticus Capital have unsettled the broader markets.""I think we’re seeing what these hedge fund managers really, truly are,” said Robert Discolo, head of hedge fund strategies for A.I.G. Investments, an asset manager within the insurance giant A.I.G. “And some of them really can’t make money in a difficult environment.""Already, hedge funds are planning for harder times ahead. Fund managers are planning to slash employee bonuses in December, according to study to be released this week by Glocap, a hedge fund recruiting firm.“This is probably one of the worst years for performance of hedge funds — it’s been a bloodbath,” said Adam Zoia, chief executive of Glocap, which began tracking hedge fund compensation in 2001 and has never recorded a down year until now.The worst hit are funds that bet on events like mergers, companies’ stock prices, bonds and those that missed the turn in the price of oil. Only a few strategies are up, like macroeconomic funds and funds that short — or bet against — stocks, according to Hedge Fund Research.Granted, hedge fund managers are still making a lot of money compared with average Americans. People who have worked at hedge funds for two to four years are expected to receive bonuses of $174,583, Glocap’s study found. Employees with a few more years of experience are likely to receive $393,333.Those figures are down 16 percent and 19 percent, respectively, from last year.Things could get worse. Some recruiters are keeping watch lists of troubled hedge funds. Heidrick & Struggle, a recruiting firm, has 100 hedge funds on its watch list and expects 50 to 80 to fail in the coming months, said Tim Holt, the partner who oversees the firm’s Wall Street recruiting.The longer the industry as a whole stumbles, the more investors are questioning some of its rules of the road. The term “hedge funds” is really a catch-all for investment firms that employ a wide variety of strategies with varying levels of experience and risk management.Most large pension funds and institutional investors have put the brakes on their hedge fund investments this year. New money invested in hedge funds in the first half of this year was just under $30 billion, a far cry from the $118 billion raised in the first half of 2007, according to Hedge Fund Research.Some of the young people who flocked to the hedge fund industry have begun to doubt its future.Jonathan Weiss quit his job at Glenview Capital, a large hedge fund in New York, in January, despite earning a large bonus last year. He said he did not like the way the industry was moving away from its entrepreneurial roots.His friends called him crazy. “They called me up wondering why was I walking away from this supposed golden ticket,” Mr. Weiss, 28, said. “It’s because I knew it wasn’t a golden ticket.”'"
"'08-09-12,'0','It was after reading an article about reasonably priced waterfront real estate in the Northwest that Mr. Bolton suggested that he and his wife fly to Spokane, Wash., and drive east into the Idaho Panhandle to Hayden Lake. The trip from airport to lake took 45 minutes. The lake, at the foothills of the Selkirk Mountains and just eight miles from Coeur d’Alene, was both beautifully rustic and invitingly accessible. The town of Hayden Lake is a residential community with 27 miles of shoreline, towering pine trees, a small public beach and a decidedly low-key marina. Dating back to the early 1900s, it has a country club with grounds and a golf course designed by John C. Olmsted.So far, so good, but by then the Boltons added another requirement. “We knew we wanted water and an airport, but then we realized that we also wanted to be with people,” Mrs. Bolton said. “So, we went to look at the country club. I saw two girls in a boat come flying across the lake, pull up at the dock and step out with their tennis rackets. I said, ‘Now that looks civilized. And fun.’ ”Hayden Lake had passed all their tests. Now their 3,000-square-foot house, built at lakeside according to their own floor plan and filled with all the trappings of their taste and their family life, is lively with their offspring and grandchildren most weekends and holidays and throughout a summer vacation season that now seems to stretch from June to the middle of October. A vintage floating boathouse, a tidy 1920s wooden building with a peaked tin roof, houses their Chaparral deck boat, a fiberglass runabout perfect for fishing expeditions, water-skiing and generally scooting around the 4,000-acre spring-fed lake. Along the shallow shoreline, a pair of kayaks, a rubber raft and a brightly colored plastic bucket and spade have run aground; the sliver of beach was composed entirely with store-bought sand.When the Boltons married 28 years ago, they created a blended family with five children and Portia, a standard poodle specifically acquired to please the resident dog-lovers and appease the allergy sufferers. “We had five children under the age of 12!” exclaimed Mrs. Bolton.THEIR first place on Hayden Lake was an 875-square-foot house overlooking a sheltered cove. They had direct access to the water and one of the lake’s original boathouses, dating from the beginning of the Hayden Lake community in the early 1900s. It worked well for commuting. “In the summer, Jim would spend long weekends here,” said Mrs. Bolton. “He could leave at 6 a.m. and be in his office in Pasadena by 9:30.”But there were only two bedrooms and one bathroom for the family of seven. They added two bedrooms, another bathroom and a deck. “We needed more room, and we kept trying to fix a house that wasn’t going to work,” Mr. Bolton said. When a nearby waterfront lot came up for sale about five years ago, they bought it the same day.Mrs. Bolton likes to insist that she doesn’t “have a creative bone in her body” and points out that in her earlier life as Joan Salisbury, she was an insurance account executive, not an artist or architect. After the formation of the Bolton bunch, however, she collaborated with her husband to draw up a successful floor plan for a main family home in San Marino, Calif. And when they bought their lakefront lot, she almost immediately roughed out a design for the new lake house: an open plan with a great room incorporating the kitchen, dining area and living room; vaulted ceilings; and large windows providing expansive views across the lake. In 2004, the house was built, and it is much as she envisioned it.“I wanted panoramic views of the lake from the master bedroom, the living room and the kitchen sink,” she said. “I do a lot of dishes.”The sink with a view is set in a large, freestanding kitchen counter that’s handsomely topped with pale pink granite. The bowed kitchen window has a deep window seat; fitted with plump striped pillows, it also provides luxurious banquette seating at the kitchen table. “We have eight grandchildren now,” said Mrs. Bolton. The far-flung adult children and their own expanding families — from Washington State, California and Arizona — return happily to the lake throughout the year.In the main living area, where the ceilings are 32 feet high, the overstuffed furniture — armchairs, two sofas and ottomans — is appropriately massive, a Paul Bunyan rendition of domesticity. Mrs. Bolton had planned to use her grandmother’s Hepplewhite table in the dining area, but its gentle lines were overpowered by the overscaled contemporary furniture. “When I couldn’t find a table for the kitchen, Jim suggested we use it there,” she said. “At first I thought we shouldn’t. A kitchen table gets more abuse. But I figure, it’s lasted more than 150 years — we should use it.” Now, the table looks at home.Throughout the house, family heirlooms mix comfortably with no-frills pieces picked up at design shops and warehouse stores. An antique drop-leaf table made from a single plank of walnut is nestled behind one of the mighty living room couches. Two similar samovar lamps were given rubbed bronze finishes and matching shades and emerged as a handsome pair. The wide-planked dining table was newly made and artfully distressed. A newly constructed wet bar, with a polished concrete top, was sided with rusted corrugated tin reclaimed from an Idaho barn.All of the custom cabinetry and doors were made from native larch and alder, grown and milled locally. In the living room, the faux-stone fireplace — inspired by the original hearth at the Bozanta Tavern, a Hayden Lake landmark that is now the country club building — is a map of Idaho, a tall rectangle tapering into a panhandle; the wooden mantelpiece is carved with a frieze of indigenous animals. Above the living room, the open mezzanine area is an office with a window seat for reading. “We designed the railing after one by Greene & Greene,” said Mrs. Bolton, opening a book to a photograph of a 1905 house in Pasadena designed by the architect brothers Charles and Henry Greene. “The guys who made it for us said that they had never milled a piece of wood that long.”At the back of the house, on the second floor, a huge screen porch appears to float above the lake and between the trees. On summer nights, it serves as a breezeway dining room with a large wooden table inherited from a ranch that was owned by Mrs. Bolton’s grandfather. “I’ve slept out here with my granddaughters,” she said. “The sun came up at 4 o’clock, and we were surrounded by all the trees.”“Trees were something else that we wanted,” observed Mr. Bolton. “And trees — we’ve got a lot of them here.”'"
"'08-09-12,'0','The union push is coming at a time when global corporations are already facing rising labor and commodity costs in China, which is struggling to contain inflation.Hundreds of big corporations, like Wal-Mart, McDonald’s and Yum Brands, which operates KFC and Pizza Hut, have agreed to set up unions in their Chinese operations.But union officials say that some nonmanufacturing companies are resisting. Microsoft’s China operation did not respond this week to questions about the union drive. The consulting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers said that its workers were not unionized but that it was studying the matter.Union officials say they are focusing on global companies, but Chinese companies make up the bulk of the manufacturing work force and they are also expected to face audits and pressure to unionize.For years, Western labor activists have taken aim at China’s manufacturing industry, exposing hundreds of exploitive factories that employ child labor, force workers to toil as many as 100 hours a week without overtime pay or benefits, and violate labor and safety rules.And some of the world’s biggest brand names, like Wal-Mart, Disney and Adidas, have been singled out for using contractors that violate China’s labor laws. The companies have, in many cases, investigated the claims and fired contractors.The new government pressure seems to be part of a sweeping effort aimed at addressing some of the ugly consequences of China’s dynamic economic growth, like rampant pollution, a growing income gap and widespread labor abuse.Up until now, though, the state-controlled union has done little to agitate on behalf of workers, legal experts say, and has often done more to control workers than to benefit them. The union’s reputation for allowing abuses to exists has led some to doubt whether it can properly represent workers.But the union, which says it already has 200 million members, is promising to truly represent workers, and is gaining standing with Communist Party leaders.In 2004, the National People’s Congress, the state legislative body, carried out inspections of companies operating in China to ensure that they were following labor laws and had dues-paying union members. Union officials, using increasingly bold tactics, have zeroed in on the China operations of the 500 biggest global corporations, which would mean millions of new union members. The union says it intends to combat worker exploitation.“Some foreign companies in China haven’t behaved well in dealing with their workers’ interests and rights,” Wang Ying, an official at the All China Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing, said in a telephone interview this week. “As the economy and society develops, China needs to improve workers’ legal rights and interests, which is a demand of a civilized society.”Forming unions could be costly, lawyers and labor experts say, because a union could fight for higher wages and benefits and because companies are required to pay 2 percent payroll dues. The dues could amount to millions of dollars in additional costs for big companies. Yum Brands, for instance, has about 160,000 employees in China.Manufacturers are already coping with soaring labor costs, which have jumped by 30 to 40 percent in some coastal manufacturing zones over the last four years. Also, a new contract labor law and stricter enforcement of older labor rules means some companies can no longer avoid paying overtime costs, which can be substantial because many factories insist that some employees work six days a week.But whether unions can really protect workers and bargain collectively on their behalf is still in question.“It all depends on how they are set up,” said Anita Chan, an authority on labor issues in China who is a visiting research fellow at the Australian National University in Canberra. “After you set up a union, these groups have to know how to become representatives of the workers, and really collectively bargain.”Mr. Lauffs, the labor law expert, said it was too early to tell what impact new unions would have on companies here. But union members would need to be consulted on all employee-related and operational matters.“Employees may have a say in major operational matters,” he said. “And employees may have the right to strike.”Many big corporations in China that have recently allowed unions to form under pressure have declined to comment on the union drive. Some company spokesmen have admitted privately that they do not want to raise the ire of the state-controlled union or anger China’s political leaders, who are backing the effort.But several big companies said they were working well with the union. Wal-Mart, which for years has fought against unions in the United States and elsewhere, now has unions operating in nearly all of its 108 stores in China.“We have a good relationship working with the union,” said Jonathan Dong, a Wal-Mart spokesman in China. “The union provides a complement to what we do.”The top executive in China at PricewaterhouseCoopers, Frank Lyn, said accounting and professional services firms like his could not be equated with manufacturers.“We’ll continue to monitor the situation,” Mr. Lyn said. “At this juncture we don’t see a pressing need for a union.”Ms. Wang, the official at the All China Federation of Trade Unions, said that by the end of September about 80 percent of the top 500 global corporations operating in China would have unions here. “We are making great progress,” she said.'"
"'08-09-12,'0','Mr. Sobell also concurred in what has become a consensus among historians: that , who was executed with her husband, was aware of Julius’s espionage, but did not actively participate. “She knew what he was doing,” he said, “but what was she guilty of? Of being Julius’s wife.”Mr. Sobell made his revelations on Thursday as the , in response to a lawsuit from the nonprofit National Security Archive, historians and journalists, released most of the grand jury testimony in the espionage conspiracy case against him and the Rosenbergs.Coupled with some of that grand jury testimony, Mr. Sobell’s admission bolsters what has become a widely held view among scholars: that Mr. Rosenberg was, indeed, guilty of spying, but that his wife was at most a bit player in the conspiracy and may have been framed by complicit prosecutors.The revelations on Thursday “teach us what people will do to get a conviction,” said Bruce Craig, a historian and the former director of the National Coalition for History, a nonprofit educational organization. “They took somebody who they basically felt was guilty and by hook or crook they were going to get a jury to find him guilty.”The Rosenbergs’ younger son, Robert Meeropol, described Mr. Sobell’s confession Thursday as “powerful,” but said he wanted to hear it firsthand. “I’ve always said that was a possibility,” Mr. Meeropol said, referring to the question of his father’s guilt. “This is certainly evidence that would corroborate that possibility as a reality.”In the interview, Mr. Sobell drew a distinction between atomic espionage and the details of radar and artillery devices that he said he stole for the Russians. “What I did was simply defensive, an aircraft gun,” he said. “This was defensive. You cannot plead that what you did was only defensive stuff, but there’s a big difference between giving that and stuff that could be used to attack our country.”Echoing a consensus among scientists, Mr. Sobell also maintained that the sketches and other atomic bomb details that the government said were passed along to Julius Rosenberg by Ethel’s brother, David Greenglass, were of little value to the Soviets, except to corroborate what they had already gleaned from other moles. Mr. Greenglass was an Army machinist at Los Alamos, N.M., where the weapon was being built.“What he gave them was junk,” Mr. Sobell said of Julius Rosenberg, his classmate at in the 1930s.The charge was conspiracy, though, which meant that the government had to prove only that the Rosenbergs were intent on delivering military secrets to a foreign power. “His intentions might have been to be a spy,” Mr. Sobell added.After David Greenglass was arrested, Mr. Sobell fled to and lived under false names until he was captured — kidnapped, he maintained — and returned to the United States in August 1950. He said he was innocent, but his lawyer advised him not to testify at his trial. He was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment and was released in 1969. The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair at Sing Sing in 1953 after President turned down an appeal for clemency.In an interview for a 2001 book by this reporter, Mr. Greenglass acknowledged that he had lied when he testified that his sister had typed his notes about the bomb — the single most incriminating evidence against her. His allegation emerged months after Mr. Greenglass and his wife testified before the grand jury and only weeks before the 1951 trial.Government prosecutors later acknowledged that they had hoped that a conviction and the possibility of a death sentence against Ethel Rosenberg would persuade her husband to confess and implicate others, including some agents known to investigators through secretly intercepted Soviet cables.That strategy failed, said William P. Rogers, who was the deputy attorney general at the time. “She called our bluff,” he said in “The Brother.”The grand jury testimony released on Thursday by the National Archives appeared to poke even more holes in the case against Ethel Rosenberg, who was 34 and the mother of two young sons when she appeared before the grand jury and was arrested on the courthouse steps after her testimony.Bowing to David Greenglass’s objections, a federal judge declined to release his testimony. But the transcripts released on Thursday reveal that his wife, Ruth, in her grand jury appearance, never mentioned typing by Ethel Rosenberg, said she transcribed Mr. Greenglass’s notes in longhand on at least one occasion herself and placed Ethel Rosenberg out of earshot during several important conversations.“It means the grand jury testimony by Ruth Greenglass directly contradicts the charge against Ethel Rosenberg that put her in the electric chair,” said Thomas S. Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, a nonprofit group based at that challenges government secrecy., a scholar of the case and a plaintiff in the suit to release the grand jury minutes, said the testimony “confirms what we always suspected, that they manufactured the typing story at the last minute.”Still, the grand jury transcripts indicate that Mrs. Rosenberg was aware of the conspiracy. Spying was broached the first time by her husband in 1944 at the Rosenbergs’ Knickerbocker Village apartment in Lower , Mrs. Greenglass testified. “I was horrified,” she said, but added that Mrs. Rosenberg “urged me to talk to David. She felt that even if I was against it, I should at least discuss it with him and hear what he had to say.”Mrs. Greenglass, who died earlier this year, said her sister-in-law also was in the kitchen when Julius bisected the side of a Jell-O box that a courier would use as a signal to retrieve atomic secrets from David Greenglass.But David C. Vladeck, the lawyer who argued for the grand jury transcripts to be released, said they had inconsistencies with the trial testimony that might have been used to undermine prosecution witnesses.“Imagine if the Rosenbergs had a good lawyer,” he said.Among other things, Harry Gold, a confessed courier for the spy ring, told the grand jury that “everything I have done for the past 15 years, practically all of my adult life, was based on lies and deceptions.” He said he had met Julius Rosenberg, which contradicted his other accounts. And he does not invoke before the grand jury the damning password, “I come from Julius,” that he mentioned during the trial.The nearly 1,000 pages of grand jury transcripts are peppered with aggressive, sometimes belligerent jousting by prosecutors with witnesses, insights into how they defended themselves, and factoids that aficionados of the case are likely to parse for years.James Kilsheimer, the only surviving prosecutor of the Rosenberg-Sobell case, said on Thursday, “We always thought Sobell was guilty, and we knew that Julius was.” He said that the trial testimony about Ethel’s typing was not inconsistent with what Ruth Greenglass told the grand jury but was developed by him “during the pretrial process.”Mr. Sobell, who was never implicated in atomic espionage, has been ailing, but says his long-term memory is sound. He was interviewed a number of times over the summer by Walter and Miriam Schneir, who wrote a damning indictment of the Rosenberg prosecution years ago, but who, on the basis of decoded Soviet cables and other information, have since reconsidered their verdict that Julius was completely innocent. In those interviews, Mr. Sobell has implicated himself in espionage.“Do I believe Morty? Yes,” Mr. Schneir, who is writing a magazine article about Mr. Sobell, said on Thursday. “The details that he’s given us so far we’ve been able to check the peripheral parts, and they check out.”Most of the protagonists in the case, Mr. Sobell included, were committed Communists at the time they spied for the Soviets. “Now, I know it was an illusion,” Mr. Sobell said. “I was taken in.”Robert Meeropol, the Rosenbergs’ son, said that even if he were to accept Mr. Sobell’s verdict, “It’s not the end of what happened to my mother and it’s not the end of understanding what happened to due process.”'"
"'08-09-12,'0','Exports have been a critical pillar of the United States economy this year. As Americans reduced their spending and put off major purchases, an increasing amount of the revenue for domestic businesses have come from overseas. A weak dollar made American goods more attractive, although the currency has strengthened against the euro, the yen and the British pound in recent weeks.Economists and investors will be eager to see how export sales are affected in August, after oil prices began their two-month decline. The price of crude oil is down more than 25 percent since the middle of July.A report from the Labor Department on Thursday offered something of a preview of those numbers. Prices of imports fell 3.7 percent in August, the first drop since the end of the last year and the biggest monthly decline since the government started keeping records on the subject in 1988.For the most part, the decline was the result of lower oil prices. Outside of petroleum products, import prices dipped 0.3 percent. That is a small decrease, but it suggests that inflation may have slowed or paused in August. More detailed reports on last month’s inflation data are due out Friday and next week.Export prices fell 1.7 percent in August, the first decline since October 2006, as the dollar weakened during the same period. Lower prices for exported corn, soybeans and wheat led the declines.The price of exports was still 8.2 percent higher last month than in August 2007. And import prices were up 16 percent in the last year.In a separate report, the Labor Department said that new applications for jobless benefits fell by 6,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted level of 445,000, above what economists had expected.The number of Americans who have remained on unemployment rolls rose, up 122,000 to 3.53 million, near the highest level in five years.The economy lost 84,000 jobs in August, according to the Labor Department, and the unemployment rate jumped to 6.1 percent.'"

"'08-09-13,'0','This 30-second advertisement for Senator Barack Obama was introduced Friday and is to run on national cable networks and on television stations in some swing states.THE SCRIPT An announcer says: “1982. John McCain goes to Washington. Things have changed in the last 26 years, but McCain hasn’t. He admits he still doesn’t know how to use a computer, can’t send an e-mail. Still doesn’t understand the economy. And favors 200 billion in new tax cuts for corporations, but almost nothing for the middle class. After one president who was out of touch, we just can’t afford more of the same.”ON SCREEN The commercial opens with an image of a disco ball and 1982 flashes on the screen. A younger Mr. McCain, a new congressman, is shown at a hearing. His hair, longer than it is today, is rumpled and his large glasses offer a retro look. An old cellphone, a record player, an early-model computer and a Rubik’s Cube flash on the screen. Fast-forward to present day, a Macintosh computer is shown. A video clip shows Mr. McCain stepping from a golf cart with former President George Bush, with the words “Doesn’t understand the economy.” Champagne flutes clink and a family shopping at a supermarket appears as the message turns to tax cuts. The advertisement closes with Mr. McCain grinning as he stands by the current President Bush.ACCURACY Mr. McCain has told reporters that he does not regularly use a computer and was trying to learn how to send e-mail messages. A quotation from last year about Mr. McCain not understanding the economy can be misleading because it omits statements he has since made. The tax argument accurately states that Mr. McCain favors reducing the corporate income tax rate. The bulk of his tax-cutting proposals would benefit those with higher incomes, while Mr. Obama says he wants much larger tax breaks for low- and middle-income Americans.SCORECARD The overriding message of this advertisement is that Mr. McCain — who is 72, though the commercial never mentions that — is out of touch and out of date. The Obama campaign says the intention is to show how long Mr. McCain has served in Washington, but it also suggests that he may not be equipped to handle today’s fast-moving problems. By linking him to two Bush presidents, the advertisement tries to deflate the message that McCain would be a candidate of change. But will Mr. Obama attract older voters with this message?

"'08-09-13,'0','Although the complaint against Mr. Seminerio, 73, who was arrested on Wednesday, does not reveal the name of the hospital or the two executives recorded talking to him, several hospital industry officials said that the hospital described in the complaint fit the profile of Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens. The identities of “Hospital Executive 1 and 2”, remained unclear on Friday.Mr. Seminerio, who was released on $500,000 bond, declined to comment. The hospital’s top executives, David P. Rosen, the chief executive, and Bruce J. Flanz, the executive vice president and chief operating officer, did not return calls seeking comment, and a hospital spokesman, Ole Pedersen, had no comment.The world of Queens hospitals is by and large far removed from that of their more prestigious brethren in Manhattan. Jamaica Hospital is part of MediSys Health Network, which includes Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn and Flushing Hospital Medical Center in Queens. They serve mostly poor and immigrant populations and depend heavily on Medicaid reimbursements, which are partly controlled by the state. Their finances are always precarious.Industry officials said on Friday that the federal complaint was most striking in the banality of the events it described. They said that hospital officials were merely doing their jobs by seeking a local lawmaker’s help in fighting cuts to what is known in Albany as “the trend factor” — an inflation adjustment to Medicaid reimbursements.Hospitals are perennially trying to stave off cuts to the trend factor, which can cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars in aid. Lawmakers, in turn, routinely bring such concerns to legislative leaders and the governor’s office.The problem, according to the complaint, was that Mr. Seminerio was being paid for his services. While the complaint accused Mr. Seminerio of breaking a federal fraud law, it pointed out that state law, too, made it a crime for Assembly members “to receive payments of any kind for taking official action.”Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a major lobbying group, said on Friday that he was mystified about why any hospital might feel the need to pay a lawmaker to tackle something like Medicaid reimbursement when the hospital association hired economists and lobbyists to deal with such matters.“Hospitals, at least to my knowledge, do not use any outside consultants to augment what the association does to any significant degree” Mr. Raske said. “Whether they have individual issues is another matter.”The complaint does describe what might be considered one individual issue. It transcribes a call in which Hospital Executive 2 expresses interest in acquiring other hospitals, which could require state financing.In another taped conversation, on Aug. 11, Mr. Seminerio boasts to Executive 2 that he “screamed” at an Assembly leader over proposed hospital budget cuts. Mr. Seminerio proudly recites his argument, and concludes, “What good is it if I’m the most educated bastard in the world and I can’t get health treatment?”To which Executive 2 eventually replies, “There you go.”Federal prosecutors say that for such feats of consulting, the hospital and affiliated entities paid Mr. Seminerio $310,000 through a shell organization, Marc Consultants, between April 2000 and September 2008. During the same period, a Medicaid managed health care plan affiliated with the hospital paid the assemblyman $80,000, according to the complaint. MediSys is affiliated with a plan called Neighborhood Health Providers.Top executives of Jamaica Hospital have made campaign contributions to Mr. Seminerio. Mr. Rosen has given $10,000 since 1999 and Mr. Flanz, $6,500, according to state records.A spokeswoman for the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan declined on Friday to say whether the actions of any of the hospital executives were being scrutinized. But in announcing Mr. Seminerio’s arrest on Wednesday, the United States Attorney, Michael J. Garcia, said the investigation was continuing.'"
"'08-09-13,'0','Lehman Brothers alone could be the source of as much as $100 million in annual income tax in the city, estimated Marcia Van Wagner, a deputy city comptroller.The rivalry became more heated after 2005, when companies making their first sale of stock raised more money in London than in New York. Although that shift may have been only temporary, it spurred American officials to call for regulatory changes to make Wall Street more attractive to foreign companies seeking to raise money.Mayor Bloomberg and Senator Schumer used a study conducted at their direction by McKinsey & Company, a consulting firm, to argue that “if we do nothing within 10 years, while we will remain a leading regional financial center, we will no longer be the financial capital of the world.”In a report issued this week, the World Economic Forum also ranked the United States just barely ahead of Britain in an assessment of global financial development. The report ranked the United States first for the size and efficiency of its banks but second to Britain when it came to investment banks, brokerage firms and other financial companies.Nouriel Roubini, a professor of economics at New York University who was one of the study’s authors, said the two countries were quite similar in their strengths and weaknesses. Both, he said, are suffering in the current crisis and may deserve even lower marks for financial stability when it is over.“This is a very severe economic and financial crisis where hundreds of banks are going to go bust,” Mr. Roubini said, adding that the damage would not be confined to the United States. “Swiss banks like UBS have lost as much as Citigroup,” he said.Facing its biggest quarterly loss ever, Lehman, one of the six largest firms on Wall Street, said on Wednesday that it would unload many of its assets and shrink significantly. The firm, which employed more than 28,000 people at the start of this year, has lost about 95 percent of its stock-market value in less than two years.Lehman’s throes, coming just half a year after Bear Stearns collapsed suddenly, rattled city officials who already were concerned about the depth and breadth of the damage on Wall Street. This year, banks and brokerage firms have announced 83,000 job cuts worldwide, and most of those were in New York.“There’s going to be a lot of realignment of the financial sector, and this is just the beginning of it,” Ms. Van Wagner said. “We certainly seem to be going in the direction of fewer firms. It could be a smaller industry.”But how much of New York’s loss will be London’s gain — or Hong Kong’s or Dubai’s — is a sensitive topic with the city’s officials and business leaders these days.Foreign investors may shy away from investing in American companies and American markets, said Kathryn S. Wylde, the chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, an association of large employers. She was quick to add that global financial markets were linked and that the big Wall Street firms were also some of the biggest in other countries.“It’s important to remember that Lehman is a London firm as well,” Ms. Wylde said. “This stuff hurts London just like it hurts New York.”It is true that like the United States, Britain is suffering through a housing slump that has hurt its market for mortgages and other forms of debt, but New York firms pioneered and dominated the sales and trading of bundles of risky mortgages. The report Mayor Bloomberg and Senator Schumer released last year cited Wall Street’s dominance of the market for subprime loans as one that European banks could cut into by adopting “U.S.-style” lending practices.Now, that subprime market is often called the sickest segment of the American financial market, and is a major cause of the current crisis.London, on the other hand, has become a much bigger magnet for the sales and trading of various types of derivatives, securities that companies buy or sell to hedge against certain risks, such as fluctuations of interest rates or currencies. Some of those lines of business have remained profitable through the recent bond-market crisis.And that has potentially strengthened London’s hand in its rivalry with New York: Indeed, the biggest Wall Street firms have moved entire derivatives-trading operations to London in the last several years.Still, some city officials were loath to accept that Wall Street’s influence might be diminished by the disappearance or drastic downsizing of some of its most prominent firms, like Lehman.Seth W. Pinsky, the president of the city’s Economic Development Corporation, said that city officials would do what they could to help Lehman but that the firm was grappling with some issues that were “outside of the scope and authority of the city government.”He said he was unaware of any discussions between Lehman executives and city or state officials about what might be done to prevent a complete collapse of the firm. (On Friday, Lehman was courting buyers as its stock continued to fall.)Mr. Pinsky said he would not speculate about Lehman’s prospects but added that after past periods of upheaval on Wall Street, new firms had emerged to replace those that did not survive. “New York remains the world’s financial capital, and we think the financial institutions in the city are sufficiently broad and deep that once we emerge from the current environment that New York will still be in the same position,” he said.'"
"'08-09-13,'0','In an interview Friday on the NY1 cable news channel, a McCain supporter, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, called “ridiculous” the implication that Mr. Obama’s “lipstick on a pig” comment was a reference to Ms. Palin, whom he also defended as coming under unfair attack.“The last month, for sure,” said Don Sipple, a Republican advertising strategist, “I think the predominance of liberty taken with truth and the facts has been more McCain than Obama.”Indeed, in recent days, Mr. McCain has been increasingly called out by news organizations, editorial boards and independent analysts like FactCheck.org. The group, which does not judge whether one candidate is more misleading than another, has cried foul on Mr. McCain more than twice as often since the start of the political conventions as it has on Mr. Obama.A McCain spokesman, Brian Rogers, said the campaign had evidence for all its claims. “We stand fully by everything that’s in our ads,” Mr. Rogers said, “and everything that we’ve been saying we provide detailed backup for — everything. And if you and the Obama campaign want to disagree, that’s your call.”Mr. McCain came into the race promoting himself as a truth teller and has long publicly deplored the kinds of negative tactics that helped sink his candidacy in the Republican primaries in 2000. But his strategy now reflects a calculation advisers made this summer — over the strenuous objections of some longtime hands who helped him build his “Straight Talk” image — to shift the campaign more toward disqualifying Mr. Obama in the eyes of voters.“I think the McCain folks realize if they can get this thing down in the mud, drag Obama into the mud, that’s where they have the best advantage to win,” said Matthew Dowd, who worked with many top McCain campaign advisers when he was President Bush’s chief strategist in the 2004 campaign, but who has since had a falling out with the White House. “If they stay up at 10,000 feet, they don’t.”For all the criticism, the offensive seems to be having an impact. It has been widely credited by strategists in both parties with rejuvenating Mr. McCain’s campaign and putting Mr. Obama on the defensive since it began early this summer.Some who have criticized Mr. McCain have accused him of blatant untruths and of failing to correct himself when errors were pointed out.On Friday on “The View,” generally friendly territory for politicians, one co-host, Joy Behar, criticized his new advertisements. “We know that those two ads are untrue,” Ms. Behar said. “They are lies. And yet you, at the end of it, say, ‘I approve these messages.’ Do you really approve them?”“Actually they are not lies,” Mr. McCain said crisply, “and have you seen some of the ads that are running against me?”Mr. Obama’s hands have not always been clean in this regard. He was called out earlier for saying, incorrectly, that Mr. McCain supported a “hundred-year war” in Iraq after Mr. McCain said in January that he would be fine with a hypothetical 100-year American presence in Iraq, as long as Americans were not being injured or killed there.More recently, Mr. Obama has been criticized for advertisements that have distorted Mr. McCain’s record on schools financing and incorrectly accused him of not supporting loan guarantees for the auto industry — a hot topic in Michigan. He has also taken Mr. McCain’s repeated comments that American economy is “fundamentally sound” out of context, leaving out the fact that Mr. McCain almost always adds at the same time that he understands that times are tough and “people are hurting.”But sensing an opening in the mounting criticism of Mr. McCain, the Obama campaign released a withering statement after Mr. McCain’s appearance on “The View.”“In running the sleaziest campaign since South Carolina in 2000 and standing by completely debunked lies on national television, it’s clear that John McCain would rather lose his integrity than lose an election,” Hari Sevugan, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said in a statement.At an event in Dover, N.H., a voter asked Mr. Obama when he would start “fighting back.” Mr. Obama, who began his own confrontational advertising campaign Friday, said, “Our ads have been pretty tough, but I just have a different philosophy that I’m going to respond with the truth.”“I’m not going to start making up lies about John McCain,” Mr. Obama said.The McCain advertisements are devised to draw the interest of bloggers and cable news producers — but not necessarily always intended for wide, actual use on television stations — to shift the terms of the debate by questioning Mr. Obama’s character and qualifications.Mr. Sipple, the Republican strategist, voiced concern that Mr. McCain’s approach could backfire. “Any campaign that is taking liberty with the truth and does it in a serial manner will end up paying for it in the end,” he said. “But it’s very unbecoming to a political figure like John McCain whose flag was planted long ago in ground that was about ‘straight talk’ and integrity.”The campaign has also been selective in its portrayal of Mr. McCain’s running mate, Ms. Palin. The campaign’s efforts to portray her as the bane of federal earmark spending was complicated by evidence that she had sought a great deal of federal money both as governor of Alaska and as mayor of Wasilla.Ms. Palin has often told audiences about pulling the plug on the so-called Bridge to Nowhere, an expensive federal project to build a bridge to a sparsely populated Alaskan island that became a symbol of wasteful federal spending. “I told Congress, ‘Thanks but no thanks’ for that Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska,” she said this week in Virginia.But her position was more like “please” before it became “no thanks.” Ms. Palin supported the bridge project while running for governor, and abandoned it after it became a national scandal and Congress said the state could keep the money for other projects. As a mayor and governor, she hired lobbyists to request millions in federal spending for Alaska. In an ABC News interview on Friday with Charles Gibson, Ms. Palin largely stuck to her version of the events.Disputed characterizations are not uncommon on the trail. At a campaign stop this week in Missouri, Mr. McCain said that Mr. Obama’s plan would “force small businesses to cut jobs and reduce wages and force families into a government-run health care system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor.”Jonathan B. Oberlander, who teaches health policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said that Mr. Obama’s plan would not force families into a government-run system. “I would say this is an inaccurate and false characterization of the Obama plan,” he said. “I don’t use those words lightly.”'"

"'08-09-13,'0','While his surroundings on “The View” appeared comfortable, with Mr. McCain sitting on a sofa, he faced sharp questioning over the tone and substance of the presidential campaign. Asked whether he had changed as a candidate, he said, “I’m the same person as I always was.”A day after the two men suspended their divisive campaign to commemorate the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mr. Obama amplified his criticism of Mr. McCain through new television advertisements that portrayed his 72-year-old rival as an entrenched Washington politician who is out of touch.The advertisements — among the most pointed attacks to be put out by Mr. Obama — depicted Mr. McCain as he looked when he was first elected to Congress in 1982 and mocked his declaration that he does not use a computer or send his own e-mail messages, attempting to undermine the new argument from Mr. McCain that he is the candidate of change.“The good news is that in 53 days, the name George W. Bush won’t be on the ballot,” Mr. Obama told voters in Dover. “But make no mistake, George W. Bush’s policies will be on the ballot.”Mr. Obama mentioned Mr. McCain and President Bush in the same sentence again and again. He seized on a comment made by Mr. McCain at a forum in New York City on Thursday night when, trying to praise Ms. Palin, he said Washington politicians can be “divorced from the day-to-day challenges people have.”“From where he and George Bush sit, maybe they just can’t see,” Mr. Obama said. “Maybe they are just that out of touch, but you know the truth and so do I.”At a town meeting, one man told Mr. Obama that he was concerned the Democratic ticket would suffer the same fate as the party’s last two candidates, Senator John Kerry and Vice President Al Gore, because of “attack ads and the smear campaign.”Mr. Obama said he preferred the high road, adding, “I’m not going to start making up lies about John McCain.”Mr. McCain, who did not appear at any campaign events on Friday, faced stiff questioning about his advertisements on “The View,” a show that has become a must-stop for candidates and their spouses. Joy Behar, one of the hosts, criticized him for a pair of recent advertisements — one that accuses Mr. Obama of favoring “comprehensive sex education” for kindergarten pupils and one that suggests his “lipstick on a pig” comment was a sexist slight directed at Ms. Palin.“We know that those two ads are untrue,” Ms. Behar said. “They are lies.”Mr. McCain said they “are not lies” and defended them.When reminded that he, too, had made the comment about putting “lipstick on a pig” when referring to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. McCain offered a distinction and said he was talking about health care.“He chooses his words very carefully,” Mr. McCain said. “He shouldn’t have said it.”Ms. Palin was a subject of conversation everywhere on Friday, it seemed, except at Mr. Obama’s rallies in New Hampshire, where he strived to steer the conversation back to the men at the top of the ticket.“I’m glad that the debate now is all about change, and we are going to spend a lot of time talking about who can actually deliver change in Washington,” Mr. Obama said. “I think it’s Obama-Biden and not McCain.”'"

"'08-09-13,'0','In the summer of 2006, however, Google pulled the rug out from under him. Suddenly and without warning, Google raised Sourcetool’s minimum bid requirement from 5 or 6 cents to $1, and in some cases to as much as $5 or $10. Mr. Savage discovered this was happening only after he saw that Sourcetool’s traffic had dwindled drastically and began looking into the reasons. Because the new Google-mandated minimum bid was so much higher than the maximum he allowed for (usually around 10 cents), Sourcetool’s ads had disappeared from the Google search results page. That’s why his traffic had dropped off.When Mr. Savage asked Google executives what the problem was, he was told that Sourcetool’s “landing page quality” was low. Google had recently changed the algorithm for choosing advertisements for prominent positions on Google search pages, and Mr. Savage’s site had been identified as one that didn’t meet the algorithm’s new standards. (As Google defines it, landing page quality includes a series of attributes — loading speed, user friendliness, relevancy, originality and dozens of other characteristics — that it deems appropriately “googly.”)Although the company never told Mr. Savage what, precisely, was wrong with his landing page quality, it offered some suggestions for improvement, including running fewer AdSense ads and manually typing in the addresses and phone numbers of the 600,000 companies in his directory, even though their Web sites were just a click away. At a cost of several hundred thousand dollars, he made some of the changes Google suggested. No improvement.When he pressed Google to explain why the changes hadn’t helped, he said, the company gave him the brushoff.“Your landing pages will continue to require higher bids in order to display your ads, resulting in a very low return on your investment,” a Google executive named Nathan Anderson wrote on Jan. 2, 2007. “Therefore AdWords may not be the online advertising program for you.”Two days later, in another e-mail message, Mr. Anderson told Mr. Savage to “please refrain from repeatedly contacting our team.”As he stewed about his predicament, Mr. Savage came to believe that there was something more nefarious going on than a subpar landing page. Google, he believed, didn’t like his Web directory because it was a search engine itself — though much more narrowly focused than Google’s search engine — and Google found it a competitive threat.What’s more, Sourcetool competed directly with business.com, which was one of Google’s “content network partners,” meaning it gets additional advertising revenue because Google directs AdWords ads to the site as well as AdSense ads. (The New York Times is also a Google content network partner.)As Mr. Savage saw it, Google’s near monopoly in search ads (its market share is approaching 70 percent) put it in a position to decide which business models it would tolerate and which ones it wouldn’t. “Google can use AdWords to pick winners in every category,” he told me.Mr. Savage is hardly in a position to sue Google for antitrust violations, of course. But he did feel there was one thing he could do: tell his story to the Justice Department, in the hope that it might help stop the Google-Yahoo advertising deal that was announced in June. Hence the letter. “Google’s conduct is plainly consistent with acts of monopolization and attempted monopolization,” Mr. Savage’s lawyer wrote in his letter to the Justice Department. He added that “Google has achieved and maintained its market share through anticompetitive exclusionary conduct.”In the three months since the Google-Yahoo deal was announced, there is very little doubt that the Justice Department is seriously examining whether to block it. As you may recall, the deal was not a merger, but rather a cooperation agreement. Still, it would give the two companies a staggering 90 percent of the search advertising market, a market share figure so high that even the notoriously lax Bush antitrust department can’t look the other way.Earlier this week, the department hired a widely known antitrust lawyer, Sanford M. Litvack, to help it decide whether to oppose the deal.And gadflies like Mr. Savage aren’t the only ones pressing Justice to oppose it. The Association of National Advertisers, which includes Procter & Gamble and General Motors, is also on record calling for the deal to be blocked. “We think advertising prices will be higher as a result of the deal,” said the association’s president, Robert D. Liodice. “Concentration of power becomes an issue.”I have no idea whether the Justice Department will try to block the deal, or even whether it should. As I learned a decade ago covering the Microsoft trial, there are few areas of the law more complicated or more ambiguous than antitrust law.Google’s opponents may fear its monopoly power, but the company insists that everything it does is aimed at “enhancing the customer experience” — a claim that harks back to Microsoft’s claims once upon a time. And like Microsoft, Google built its near monopoly in rather exemplary fashion: by building a better mousetrap.Still, the more I dug into Mr. Savage’s complaint, the more I came to think that it offers a nearly perfect example of why antitrust issues are so difficult to sort out. Listening to Google executives explain how the company’s algorithm works, I came away largely convinced that Google was operating in good faith.“Our quality score system is an impartial algorithmic score that is designed to enhance the experience of the user, and the vast majority of advertisers benefit from it also,” said Nicholas Fox, Google’s product manager for ad quality. In addition to rewarding sites that have the qualities Google and its users like, it also tries to weed out, and punish, bad apples.For instance, it doesn’t want companies that buy search terms and then play some form of bait and switch. The imposition of high minimum bids is Google’s way of weeding out the bad guys.But it is also true that people like Mr. Savage, who are demonstrably not bad guys, find themselves in Google’s doghouse and then can’t even get the company to respond to them. Is it any wonder that they feel treated unfairly by a ruthless monopolist? What makes it worse is that Google simply refuses to acknowledge that its algorithms could ever be wrong. Could Google really treat its own customers so shabbily if it faced true competition?So what is Google’s problem with Sourcetool? One likely possibility is that Google views Sourcetool as an example of a practice called ad arbitrage, which it frowns upon. Those are sites that bid on search terms not to provide a service, but simply to con people into clicking through the ads on its site. Though nobody at Google would say so directly, I got the distinct impression that Google thought Mr. Savage was practicing a form of ad arbitrage with his site. He did, after all, bid on search terms and make his money on advertisements on his site.But Mr. Savage is clearly offering a real service: his directory. Indeed, in many ways, the look and feel of his site resembles that of Google’s partner business.com. The ways Sourcetool differs from business.com are what Mr. Savage views as his competitive advantages. They include the way he ranks companies, and a directory page that gives information about each company.When I pressed Mr. Fox about Sourcetool, he refused to tell me why the algorithm had problems with the site. When I asked him why the business.com site was in the algorithm’s good graces but Sourcetool’s wasn’t, he wouldn’t tell me that, either. All I got were platitudes about the user experience. It wasn’t long before I was almost as exasperated as Mr. Savage. How can you adapt your business model to Google’s specs if Google won’t tell you what the specs are?Google also told me that it never made judgments of what was “good” and “bad” because it was all in the hands of the algorithm. But that turns out not to be completely true. Mr. Savage shared with me an e-mail message from a Google account executive to someone at another company who had run into the same kind of landing page problem as Sourcetool. The Google account executive wrote back to say that she had looked at the site and found that “there seems to be a wealth of valuable information on the site.” Consequently, her team overruled the algorithm.The problem with monopolists, of course, is that they just can’t help acting like monopolists, even supposedly benign monopolists like Google and even when they are not consciously trying to rub out the competition. They are always right and everybody else is wrong. They have disdain for their own customers, knowing those customers have nowhere else to turn. They tell small fry like Mr. Savage to stop bugging them.That is how Microsoft acted a decade ago, and that, increasingly, is how Google is acting. Half the time, the company doesn’t even realize how egregious its behavior has become, which is why it feels so misunderstood when it is criticized.Maybe Mr. Savage’s experience proves that Google has become a company that abuses its monopoly power, and maybe it doesn’t. He is just one small example, and as Google likes to point out, thousands of advertisers are thriving using AdWords and AdSense.But his story gave me pause, and nothing Google said in its defense defused my alarm. As Mr. Litvack reviews the Google-Yahoo deal, I hope it gives him pause as well.It could be déjà vu all over again.'"
"'08-09-13,'0','Stocks finished another volatile session narrowly mixed Friday, as gains in the energy, utilities and materials sectors offset some of Wall Street’s angst over the fate of Lehman Brothers Holdings.The three major indexes all managed to end the week higher.The troubles of the financial sector dominated trading, as investors tried to glean insights into Lehman’s race to sell itself or otherwise regain Wall Street’s confidence. The company’s shares have spiraled lower this week, heaping pressure on executives at the company to line up a buyer or source of fresh cash.Lehman’s shares, which tumbled 42 percent Thursday and are down more than 94 percent for the year, fell another 74 cents, or 16.8 percent, to $3.65 on Friday.The market is anticipating that Lehman will arrive at a deal over the weekend, said Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management. Lehman, the government and other banks have been declining to comment officially on the issue, but bankers and industry executives have been saying that Lehman is working feverishly to find a buyer.Closure on the issue would help, but the market is likely to remain turbulent, Mr. Larson said.“Once this deal gets done, you’ll see sentiment shift to: Who’s next?” he said.'"
"'08-09-13,'0','“I think we need a leadership election,” she told the BBC. “I think anybody who wants to stand should stand, and we should have a discussion about what direction should the party be going in.”The call came at a crucial time, a little more than a week before the Labor Party gathers for the its annual conference in Manchester. Mr. Brown’s leadership could come under fire during the event.Ms. McDonagh and several other Labor legislators asked for papers that are needed to start a leadership contest, a Labor Party official said.That suggests that the prime minister could face a challenge to his leadership at the Labor conference, although the support of about 70 Labor lawmakers is required as the first step to setting off a contest.Ms. McDonagh said that she had nobody in mind as a possible alternative leader to Mr. Brown, but that there was a need to “clear the air.”While not openly criticizing Mr. Brown, she implied dissatisfaction with his leadership.“I think Gordon Brown is a really good man who has the best of intentions,” Ms. McDonagh said. “I just think that being prime minister is a shockingly hard job.”In 11 years in Parliament, Ms. McDonagh said, she had never voted against the government. Nonetheless, she said she thought a “huge number” of Labor legislators wanted a leadership election.A year ago, Mr. Brown led in public opinion surveys, but as Britain’s economic woes have mounted, the Labor Party has slumped. It now trails the opposition Conservative Party by about 20 points in many polls. Mr. Brown does not have to call a general election until mid-2010.The Conservatives urged an early general election on Friday, saying that Ms. McDonagh’s call for a leadership election showed that the Labor Party was degenerating into deeply divided factions.“At a time when Britain faces massive economic challenges, it is profoundly damaging to have a government in such disarray,” said a Conservative politician, Chris Grayling.'"
"'08-09-13,'0','MOSCOW — Rattled by falling oil prices and the war in Georgia, Russia’s stock market has slumped so severely that it now threatens the country’s oil-fueled boom of recent years, economists say.The benchmark RTS index has lost 46 percent of its value since its peak in May, representing a paper loss of about $700 billion for Russian companies. Much of that decline has come since the war in Georgia and the subsequent war of words with the United States and Europe that unsettled foreign investors, who began withdrawing capital.On Friday the RTS, which peaked in May at 2,487, rebounded slightly, rising 3.36 percent to close at 1,342. The country’s other main stock exchange, the MICEX, was rose 6 percent on Friday, after weeks of heavy losses.While initially seen as a problem confined to the Russian stock market, which is volatile in the best of times, the drop in share prices is now spilling over to the real economy. Companies that had pledged shares as collateral for loans, for example, are now facing margin calls, bankers in Moscow say.“It’s a classic squeeze,” said Roland Nash, chief strategist for Renaissance Capital in Moscow.'"

The European Food Safety Authority reaffirmed in July the safety of bisphenol-A in common consumer products such as baby bottles, water bottles and food containers.In response to recent controversy, an E.F.S.A. expert scientific panel reviewed new scientific data and concluded that its previously established safe limit for bisphenol-A provides a sufficient margin of safety for the protection of the consumer, including fetuses and newborns.Today, parents need not fear the safety of essential products designed to make baby bottles shatter-resistant and help preserve canned food, when they have been affirmed by so many organizations charged with protecting public health.'"
"'08-09-13,'0','Industry estimates and medical studies indicate that defibrillators have saved the lives of 10 percent of the more than 600,000 people in this country who have received them, at most. While survivors would no doubt take those odds, 9 of 10 people who get defibrillators receive no medical benefit. One big long-term medical study indicated the odds of a defibrillator saving a patient’s life might be even slimmer — about 1 in 14, over the five-year period studied.The problem that defibrillators pose is in some ways singular among medical technologies. For devices like artificial knees, which improve lives but do not save them, few people would settle for only a 1 in 10 chance of success. For a potentially life-saving cancer drug, a patient might grasp at even much slimmer odds. Where defibrillators differ is that they are only a powerful standby — ready to intervene if necessary, but unlikely ever to be called into service.If defibrillators were simply $50,000 life insurance policies, the relatively low rate of payoff might not matter much. But the long-shot statistics are significant to people who must weigh the risks of infection and malfunction after they have an electronic device anchored inside their hearts and its wires threaded through their arteries.The slim odds also have large implications for the United States health care bill, adding billions of dollars annually to Medicare spending and to insurance payments. Dr. Larry A. Chinitz, director of the Heart Rhythm Center at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, said, “The answer isn’t just to keep implanting everybody” who fits the current guidelines.More doctors are now thinking twice. From a peak of 160,000 new patients in 2005, the number has fallen to less than 140,000 last year, according to Lawrence H. Biegelsen, an analyst at Wachovia Capital Markets. He predicts this year’s total will end up even lower.For the manufacturers, the numbers translate to a decline in defibrillator sales to $3.94 billion in this country last year, down from $4.29 billion in 2005, Mr. Biegelsen said.Only overseas, where defibrillators have been slower to catch on, has the number of new implants continued to rise, hitting a new sales high of $1.93 billion last year.Many patients, of course, are grateful for their defibrillators. “It’s saved me at least four times, including two when I passed out completely,” Matthew M. Murray, a 55-year-old former engineer in Riverbank, Calif., said of his implant.And some experts worry that the pendulum may have swung too far away from defibrillators — putting countless lives at risk among people with the heart abnormalities and ailments most likely to cause cardiac arrest. At least several hundred thousand people in this country have such conditions, and some estimates place the figure at more than a million.Medtronic, the leading maker of defibrillators, contends that each day 500 deaths are caused by sudden cardiac arrests among people who meet the current medical guidelines for the devices but do not have them.Dr. Eric N. Prystowsky, a nationally renowned heart rhythm specialist in Indianapolis, said every doctor in his field was haunted by individual cases, like that of a Purdue University graduate student who was referred to Dr. Prystowsky for a defibrillator. The student had an abnormally thick heart muscle, a known risk for sudden cardiac arrest.“He kept putting it off,” Dr. Prystowsky said of the decision to get a defibrillator. “Six weeks later, his fiancée called to say he had been found dead in bed.”Cases like that may be inevitable as long as doctors cannot give patients more certainty about whether a defibrillator will actually help them.Better clues could be submerged in the medical records of the people who have gotten defibrillators over the decades. Three years ago, Medicare ordered the creation of a nationwide registry, or database, for implanted defibrillators. Overseen by two leading professional groups, the American College of Cardiology and the Heart Rhythm Society, the registry has amassed about 270,000 records from 1,500 hospitals.But the data mining has only recently begun, and results are not expected before 2010 at the earliest.There is no guarantee that the information will lead to more effective use of defibrillators. Unlike drugs, many medical devices evolve so quickly that long-term data on their performance can be obsolete by the time it is available.There are also efforts to find genetic markers and to develop new diagnostic tests that might more precisely identify patients who are predisposed to the type of sudden cardiac arrest a defibrillator could prevent. So far, though, the only federally approved screening test identifies some patients who are unlikely to need a defibrillator in the next year — not those most likely to require one.The defibrillator decline began after highly publicized reports of a small number of deadly malfunctions. The biggest blow came in June 2005, when the Guidant Corporation — later acquired by Boston Scientific — recalled 29,000 implanted defibrillators because of flaws that might have caused them to short-circuit instead of delivering critical shocks. At the time, at least two deaths had been linked to the failure.Medtronic, the market leader, and St. Jude Medical, the third major player, subsequently announced product recalls, although neither was prompted by known deaths.Heading into 2007, as those headlines faded, many analysts predicted a rebound in defibrillator sales. But last fall Medtronic recalled its newest version of the main wire that connects a defibrillator to the heart. A small percentage of the more than 200,000 Fidelis-brand leads that had been implanted were developing fractures suspected of either preventing some defibrillators from delivering shocks when needed or causing them to deliver unnecessary shocks.Even with properly functioning devices, patients risk unnecessary shocks — jolts recipients often describe as a painful and frightening kick in the chest. “Almost as many get shocked unnecessarily as benefit,” Dr. Paul J. Hauptman, a professor of medicine at St. Louis University, said.And even problem-free patients need surgery to replace their unit’s batteries when they run low. Most of today’s batteries are expected to last five to seven years. Manufacturers say patients generally get better software and longer battery life with each replacement. But the repeat procedures also raise costs and risks.Meanwhile, there are signs that improved treatment of cardiac disease with drugs, diet and behavioral changes could be reducing the need for defibrillators. At a meeting of heart rhythm specialists in May in San Francisco, Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, an Indiana University medical professor, cited data suggesting a decline in the percentage of heart patients who suffered the kinds of heart stoppages that defibrillators were intended to address.Hoping to stay relevant, the makers of defibrillators have been developing higher-priced devices with new features, including software to limit unnecessary shocks. Most are built to communicate wirelessly, allowing doctors to remotely monitor their performance. Many can perform other rhythm-regulating functions, like synchronizing contractions in different chambers of the heart.“Adding additional therapy will get at more of the market,” said Daniel J. Starks, chief executive of St. Jude Medical, citing plans to add sensors that could warn of impending heart failure. But adding complexity could also make it even more difficult to calculate the costs and benefits of implanting the devices in the first place.That bothers patients like one 50-year-old business consultant in the San Francisco Bay Area. The man, who declined to be identified for fear of alarming his clients, ignored recommendations from three doctors to get a defibrillator. Online research suggested his risk of sudden cardiac arrest would be 3 percent a year without a defibrillator — and about 1 percent with one.Doctors thinking about thousands of patients might see that as a significant difference, he said. But for him, he said, it did not seem a fair tradeoff for becoming “part of the medical-industrial complex for the rest of your life.”'"
"'08-09-13,'0','“We gained a real understanding of the depth of the issues in the community,” he said.Lamping and Sabia Schwarzer, an Allianz spokeswoman, stressed that there had never been a final deal for Allianz to pay $25 million a year for the naming rights.In fact, Schwarzer said, Allianz’s board decided Tuesday that it was “too early to decide on such a big financial commitment, that it was too large and it wanted more time to consider it.”She said she had been told that the board’s tentative judgment, after more than a month of talks, was conveyed Wednesday to the Tisch family. She did not say which of the Tisches, who own half of the Giants, received the call. Lamping said he had not been told of Allianz’s decision.Schwarzer played down the impact of the criticism of the potential deal, saying the criticism had not yet begun when the Allianz board expressed its need to spend more time evaluating the financial commitment.She said that the company and the teams expected some of the anti-Allianz reaction, if not the volume, which included a cartoon in The Daily News that depicted a football stadium with a swastika on it.“The families had done a thorough due diligence,” she said, referring to the teams’ owners. “We knew it was a concern for them, knowing what Allianz had done in the past. The families said, ‘You’re a German company, so let’s talk about World War II.’ It’s not like we didn’t have a clue. But it’s regrettable that it happened this way.”Schwarzer’s version of events differs from that of an executive working for the teams who was briefed on conversations between an Allianz board member and the teams’ owners. That executive, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the conversations, said that on Wednesday the board member, Joachim Faber, called Steve Tisch, the chairman of the Giants; John Mara, the Giants’ president and co-owner; and Woody Johnson, the Jets’ owner, to convey his optimism that a deal would be completed.So if Allianz’s enthusiasm — if not a signed deal — was known to the teams, was the public reaction to its connections to the Nazis the final blow to the discussions?“We didn’t isolate it that way,” Lamping said. “We looked at the collection of all the factors, including assessing where we were in the negotiations.”There is no deadline for signing a naming-rights deal for the stadium, which is scheduled to open in 2010.The reaction to Allianz’s talks with the teams reflects the continuing debate about whether the German government and German companies have given victims of the Holocaust and their families adequate apologies and restitution.“Allianz has gone a long way to atone, and one can forgive, but one cannot forget,” said Abraham H. Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League. He said the teams’ decision to end the talks with Allianz “indicates they are listening to their neighborhood, to their families, to the families of World War II survivors.”Foxman added that he found it difficult to understand that “somebody didn’t realize this wasn’t business as usual” when the Giants and the Jets began to negotiate with Allianz.The Anti-Defamation League has successfully lobbied on behalf of Allianz and other German insurers to reduce the impact of Congressional legislation that would have reopened the process of paying restitution to Jewish policy holders and their families.Leo Rechter, a Holocaust survivor from Vienna who lives in Jamaica, Queens, said he was relieved that Allianz’s name would not adorn the stadium. He said the activities of the German insurers during the Third Reich were still preventing Jews and their survivors from fully collecting on valid policies — or from finding them at all.“Allianz only paid out $12 million,” he said, referring to restitution provided over the past decade by the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims. “That’s peanuts.

(Because the rand fluctuated during those years, the cost was estimated to have been in the $3 billion to $5 billion range.)“Only a commission of inquiry can properly rid our land of this cancer that is devouring the body politic and the reputation for integrity built so assiduously after the fall of apartheid,” Judge Nicholson said.The judge emphasized that his ruling determined nothing about Mr. Zuma’s involvement in corruption, only that he had been entitled to give his side of the story to government investigators before the prosecution was revived.That fine point was lost on most of the jubilant crowd, many of them brought here aboard rented A.N.C. buses and bedecked with Zuma jackets and T-shirts that shielded them against the chill and drizzle.“We all knew he was innocent, and if the government took him to trial, we were going to wage war against the judges,” said Musa Nene, 22, one of the celebrants, using threatening language that has become common lately.In his ruling, the judge also referred to “dark mutterings emanating” from Mr. Zuma that “if he goes down” in the arms scandal, “others will follow.”The judge wrote, “Like a blinded Samson he threatens to make sure the temple collapses with him,” adding that “the impression created is that” Mr. Zuma “has knowledge he will disclose if he is faced with conviction and sentence.”But those barbs did little to dampen Mr. Zuma’s exuberant proclamations of victory. Dressed in a dark pinstriped suit, he broke into a Zulu war song as he greeted the crowd after leaving the courthouse. “It is a victory for the judiciary; it is a victory for our democracy; it is a victory for our justice system,” he exclaimed.He allowed that the triumph might be short-lived. “Not that I’m saying it’s all over now,” he said parenthetically.Indeed, the National Prosecuting Authority could again resurrect the case. Many who presume Mr. Zuma to be guilty will undoubtedly insist on it.“We are still no closer to knowing whether Zuma is innocent or guilty of the corruption charges brought against him,” said Helen Zille, leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance.But the political fallout for further pursuing the case could be extreme. Mr. Zuma’s supporters have claimed that the prosecution was not only politically vindictive but also selectively aimed at their champion. In recent weeks, the boldest among them have said they are willing to kill and die for Mr. Zuma. Unveiled threats were made against the judiciary.Parliament is already pushing through legislation to scrap the prosecuting authority’s elite investigating unit, the Scorpions, in response to A.N.C. anger over what many of its members regard as the unit’s persecution of Mr. Zuma.Tlali Tlali, a spokesman for the prosecuting authority, said after Friday’s ruling, “We’ll have to go back to the office and study the decision of the court today and consider the options available to us.”President Mbeki’s office, stinging from the judge’s rebuke, issued its own brief statement: “It is worth recalling that neither the president nor the presidency was party to these proceedings and, accordingly, did not have an opportunity to make representations to the honorable judge.“The presidency is certainly not aware of any fact that may have led to the conclusion that there was executive interference with the work of the National Prosecuting Authority in this matter.”Polls show that neither Mr. Mbeki nor Mr. Zuma is very popular with the South African people, who, 14 years after the end of apartheid, remain buffeted by joblessness, poor housing and deplorable schools. Most politicians are viewed with wariness, if not outright disdain.But this discontent is not expected to stop the A.N.C. — the liberation party that brought the nation democracy — from holding on to the presidency by a huge margin.Mr. Mbeki, a cerebral and aloof man, has served two terms as president. Not permitted a third term by constitutional limits, he tried to maintain control over the A.N.C. by running again for its leadership last year. His rivalry with the charismatic Mr. Zuma badly split the party. The criminal case worsened things.“In the African context, liberation movements have been very successful at bringing an end to colonialism, but their record in instituting a democratic political order and protecting and consolidating democracy has been abysmal,” said Achille Mbembe, a political scientist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. “South Africa has found itself in a state of uncertainty — radical uncertainty and extreme volatility.”The Zuma case has been the lighted fuse.Mr. Zuma’s suspicious financial dealings fell under the hot light of public scrutiny during the investigation of his financial adviser Schabir Shaik, who was accused of routinely bribing the politically connected Mr. Zuma for various favors from 1995 to 2002.When the prosecuting authority first brought charges against Mr. Shaik, its chief announced that while he also had prima facie evidence against Mr. Zuma, who was then the nation’s deputy president, he did not consider that case to be “winnable,” an odd declaration that for a time freed Mr. Zuma from prosecution and yet tarred him with guilt.Mr. Shaik was convicted in 2005 of acting as a middleman between Mr. Zuma and the French arms company Thomson-CSF, which, according to trial testimony, agreed to pay Mr. Zuma about $150,000 while it sought a $69 million contract to supply ships to the South African Navy. Both Thomson and Mr. Shaik’s company, Nkobi Holdings Proprietary Ltd., were shareholders in a group that won the contract.After Mr. Shaik was sentenced to 15 years in prison, President Mbeki fired Mr. Zuma as deputy president. Mr. Zuma was charged with corruption soon after. The case was dismissed on a technicality in 2006.In December 2007, Mr. Zuma was charged again as he celebrated his victory over Mr. Mbeki for the A.N.C. helm. The latest indictment outlined 16 counts of racketeering, corruption, money laundering and fraud, with many of the charges relating to the arms deal.The on-again-off-again prosecution struck Judge Nicholson as “being part of some great political contest or game” that had the “ring of the works of Kafka,” with Mr. Zuma always under the threat of prosecution but never actually brought to trial.But that may not even begin to describe Mr. Zuma’s legal woes. In 2006, he was found not guilty in a rape case that also transfixed the nation — and enraged his ardent following.“There have been so many cases against Zuma, and he’s the key to our freedom,” said Jamela Vuma, 24, one of those awaiting the ruling near the courthouse. “I blame it all on white people. Black people like Mbeki may be in front, but white people are still running the country.”Still, many professed optimism. Things were soon to change, they said. Mr. Zuma’s time was at hand. South Africa’s liberation would finally lead its people to prosperity.To usher in better times, several people placed a Thabo Mbeki T-shirt on the moist ground and surrounded it with lighted candles. “We don’t need him anymore,” the people chanted. “This is his funeral.”The shirt had the lame-duck president’s image printed on its front. People laughed as they covered the folded material with dirt and dead grass.Then some of them stomped on Mr. Mbeki’s face.'"

"'08-09-14,'0','THIS is the Hamptons, where a dog can hit the beach early in the morning, grab a snack of organic, cage-free duck breast or maybe a coconut sorbet, stop at the spa for a facial, dash off to yoga class, hurry back to the beach for a quick dip and still make it to Yappy Hour.Not every Hamptons pooch is social, of course, and some, like Winston, a Portuguese water dog, prefer to make craters in the sand at Ocean Road Beach, one of the few beaches in the Town of Southampton that allow dogs. “Winston is famous at the beach and puts on a show for everyone,” said his owner, John Chapple, of Sag Harbor.Winston’s friend Lola, a West Highland white terrier belonging to Frank Baker, of Bridgehampton, spends her time zigzagging through the sand and barking. “She’s very social,” Mr. Baker said. “There are sometimes as many as 75 dogs here at a time. It can be a real zoo.”Dogs are allowed only at some Southampton Town beaches, including Ocean Road Beach. Dogs are permitted at East Hampton beaches if they are leashed and kept at least 300 feet from the lifeguard stand and sunbathers.Wendy Chamberlin, of Bridgehampton, goes to Town Line Beach with her chocolate Labrador retrievers, Lally, Luke and Kiwi. “I bring them water, and they lie under the umbrella with me,” she said.'"
"'08-09-14,'0','“This has been a problem,” said José Augusto Tenorio, Peru’s consul general in New York. “Immigration authorities at a port of entry can deny entrance if they have any suspicion of the voyage, even if all their paperwork is in order.”Some consulate officials said that the interviewing process at the airports was unfair to visitors who were the victims of paperwork problems. Others may get sent back because they had, years ago, overstayed their visa, even by a few days.“We were hearing all kinds of stories about mistreatment, but we heard these stories after the fact, after they were whisked away back to their home country,” said Rubén Beltrán, Mexico’s consul general in New York, who organized the Coalition of Latin American Consuls in New York, or C.L.A.C.N.Y. Officials of the 14 consulates that make up the coalition — Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, the Dominican Republic, Uruguay and Venezuela — met with United States Customs and Border Protection officials twice this summer to discuss their concerns about the process used at the airports to screen visitors.One result was that the group has created a poster with hot line phone numbers for the 14 consulates.Customs officials agreed that starting sometime this month, they would allow the posters to be hung in the three interview rooms at the detention area of the Newark airport.Mr. Beltrán said that he and the other consuls general have devised protocols to advise immigrants held at Newark International how to reach their consulate.“We want to make sure they’re kept in the loop,” Mr. Beltrán said. “If there is a possibility that they can apply for asylum, we want to help them with that. Or if it’s a minor, we want to make sure we contact their family members back home.”It is the first time phone numbers will be visible to detainees there. Adele J. Fasano, the New York-Newark area director for Customs and Border Protection, said she would welcome other consulates to do the same. She said that under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, federal authorities must allow foreign nationals to contact their consulates or embassies before deportation.“I haven’t heard of something like this before,” Alison Parker, a deputy director of Human Rights Watch, a private group based in New York, said of the poster with the phone numbers. “For a large number of people who come into ports of entry, this is a great idea.”Ms. Parker said that detainees were not always told of their right to contact their consulate and that there have been cases of people who were denied that right. She said they should also be given access to telephones. In the case of asylum seekers, she said, they should instead be given phone numbers of lawyers who do pro bono work.The arrangement to allow C.L.A.C.N.Y. to post hot line phone numbers of its member consulates at the Newark airport was a result of a happenstance meeting between Mr. Beltrán and Ms. Fasano when President Felipe Calderón of Mexico arrived in Newark in February.The subject of detentions at the airport came up and Mr. Beltrán told her that C.L.A.C.N.Y. was just beginning to form. Mr. Beltrán said Ms. Fasano was receptive and even offered consul representatives a tour of the detention area, which they took earlier this summer.Mr. Beltrán said C.L.A.C.N.Y. would seek to have the posters placed at the detention center at J.F.K., which gets more international flights than Newark. He said he hoped that as more people called their consulates, they would alert them to other problems that arose and that C.L.A.C.N.Y. would address them with Ms. Fasano and other customs officials.Since 2002, federal spending for United States Customs and Border Protection, part of the Department of Homeland Security, has nearly doubled, to $9.3 billion from $5 billion. During the same period, the budget of its sister agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has gone to $5 billion from $2.4 billion.“This all comes down to better enforcement,” Ms. Fasano said. “We are using a layered approach, and we’re also better staffed.”While Customs and Border Protection officers apprehend people from all over the world, the largest number of violators are found coming off flights from India, China, Peru, Brazil and the Dominican Republic, customs officials said. Because so many flights arrive in Newark from Latin America, a majority of those detained are Latino, the officials said.So far this fiscal year, 540 people from Latin America have been detained, up from 460 the year before, Ms. Fasano said.Usually, foreign nationals lacking the proper paperwork are sent home within 24 hours. If they can’t get on a flight, or they are wanted for committing a crime on American soil, they are brought to a detention center in Elizabeth, said Lucille Cirillo, a public affairs officer for Customs and Border Protection.On a recent tour of the detention center at the Newark airport, Ms. Fasano stood in her blue uniform, her regulation .40-caliber Smith & Wesson pistol at her side, watching an agent question a traveler who was stopped before he boarded a flight to his native Costa Rica. The man had been removed from the baggage security screening line by agents after an X-ray revealed brass knuckles in his bag.Customs agents questioned him and searched his luggage, sifting through piles of clothes, books and CDs. They learned that he had entered the country last year on an H-2 visa to work as a laborer but had overstayed by about 18 months.The Port Authority police gave the man a court appearance ticket for carrying brass knuckles, but federal agents decided that he should leave the country.“The appearance ticket is a moot point because he will be barred at least five years from getting another visa into the U.S.,” Ms. Cirillo, the customs spokeswoman, said. “The chances of him getting a visa after five years are pretty slim.”After the man was searched, two agents handcuffed him — standard protocol for violators, agents said — and whisked him away through a back door to the gate.They wanted to make sure he got on the plane he had been planning to get on in the first place: homebound for Costa Rica.“The handcuffs are for security so he doesn’t try to run,” Ms. Fasano said.'"

"'08-09-14,'0','“I didn’t really want to do this,” she said, battling back tears. “It’s my first big audition. My mom made me come.”Had Ms. Garza known the long odds she was up against, her early dismissal from the running might not have stung as acutely. There are only 28 roles in the show, ranging from cheerleader to math whiz. And prior to the Millburn auditions Mr. Hoebee and his crew had already auditioned 750 actors over four days of open calls in Manhattan.For a lot of the actors, who ranged in age from 16 to 23, the prestige associated with being in a Paper Mill production warranted the long wait to be seen and heard.“Just getting Paper Mill on my résumé is the main goal for me,” said Tenin Babandanani, a 21-year-old drama student at Kean University in Union who was No. 127 in the audition line. She arrived at 8 a.m. and hoped to have her moment in front of the screeners before the 4 p.m. cutoff. (She did, as did everyone else who lined up, though she didn’t get a golden ticket.)The open call, atypical for Paper Mill, was held for two reasons, Mr. Hoebee said.“One, we like the idea of having a connection to the community. Sometimes you have to go looking for talent, and we don’t want to miss it in our own back yard,” he said. “Also, I think the success of the show lies in its innocence and finding new young performers. Sometimes the sincerity can get lost if the acting is too mature.”Sincerity — sincere elation, anyway — was palpable among the small batch of auditioners who emerged from the first round clutching golden tickets.“I messed up in there,” said Adrian Arrieta, a 16-year-old junior at Summit High who gripped his golden ticket along with his head shot after emerging from the main stage. “I’m really thankful they had a piano accompanist, because even when I messed up she followed me. I just called my mom — she’s thrilled,” he said.So, in the end, was Mr. Hoebee, who said he would most likely make his final casting decisions by Sept. 14. “We saw a lot of talent in Millburn,” he said. He said he hoped the unlucky majority left feeling that they at least had had a chance to show their talent in front of a respectful panel. “It’s never a good feeling when you don’t make the cut — turning some of these kids away was really hard,” he said. “We tried to be gentle.”'"
"'08-09-14,'0','The openings that tournament players choose can reflect their personality and taste.Players who like to mix it up often opt for the Sicilian Defense. Those who are more conservative by nature may favor the Petroff or the Ruy Lopez.Top players must be prepared for just about anything, but even they have their preferences. For years, Vladimir Kramnik of Russia has played the Catalan Defense, which many players consider dull. But because the opening suits his style, he has used it to rack up important victories.Of course, if players become predictable, it is easier for opponents to prepare for them. So a rule of thumb, especially for elite players, is to vary their openings, if for no other reason than to keep opponents guessing.Lately, Magnus Carlsen of Norway, a 17-year-old prodigy, and Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan, who is 21, have not been following that way of thinking. Both, when playing Black against 1 e4, have become enamored of the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defense, a tricky opening.Carlsen and Radjabov have, in general, had excellent results with the Dragon, but not at the Grand Slam Final Masters tournament in Bilbao, Spain, which ended Saturday. The event brought together the top players of the year.Radjabov used the Dragon against Carlsen in Round 4 and lost. Carlsen used it twice: In Round 2, against Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine, where he escaped with a draw, and in Round 8 against Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria, where he lost.'"
"'08-09-14,'0','The posting followed the confession last week of Morton Sobell, one of the principals in the case, to spying. In an interview, Mr. Sobell also implicated Julius Rosenberg in non-atomic military espionage. Also last week, the government released transcripts confirming that trial testimony of several witnesses appeared to conflict with what they had told the grand jury.Critics of the prosecution say that some witnesses who were implicated in the case and still under the threat of harsh sentences were pressured into embellishing their testimony.Earlier concerns about those inconsistencies were raised in a book, “The Rosenberg File,” by Ronald Radosh and Joyce Milton in 1983. Mr. Gannon quotes Nixon as saying shortly after the book was published that “the case they made for cooking the evidence is pretty weak.”But he then recalls the prosecution of Dr. Daniel J. Ellsberg, a former national security aide who gave a copy of the Pentagon Papers, a classified history of the Vietnam War, to The New York Times.“Daniel Ellsberg was guilty of illegally taking top-secret papers from the Pentagon and turning them over to be published in a newspaper,” Nixon is quoted as saying. “And yet, because the evidence was tainted, he’s scot-free, making a lot of money on the lecture circuit, particularly at the elite Ivy League colleges. So as far as Mrs. Rosenberg was concerned, she was entitled to get off on that basis, too.”Nixon said he was in the room when Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. and his deputy, William P. Rogers, made the final case against clemency to Eisenhower.Prosecutors later said they hoped that convicting Ethel Rosenberg and imposing the death sentence would persuade her husband to confess and implicate others.That strategy failed; Mrs. Rosenberg did not talk. Mr. Rogers said years later, “She called our bluff.”In an interview with The Times on Thursday, Mr. Sobell implicated Julius Rosenberg in military and industrial espionage.The Rosenbergs were formally accused of espionage conspiracy, but the prosecutor and judge argued they were guilty of giving the Soviets atomic bomb secrets. Mrs. Rosenberg’s brother, David Greenglass, was an army machinist at Los Alamos where the bomb was made.Nixon sought to put the case in historical context. Look at the times then, and at the fact that the Soviet Union acquired the atomic bomb before we thought they could, he is quoted as saying. “You can see why overzealous prosecutors, and those that are assisting prosecutors, like J. Edgar Hoover, would certainly tilt their prosecution and their investigation in a way toward guilt, rather than toward innocence,” he said.'"

The charges were dismissed in June, shortly after the California Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage, which allowed them to exchange vows on the 14th anniversary of their meeting.'"
"'08-09-14,'0','“You’re talking about incredible numbers of people out there who now may have had their right to vote restored and don’t even know it,” said Reggie Mitchell, a former voter-registration worker for People for the American Way. In Florida, “we’re talking tens of thousands of people,” he said. “And in the 2000 election, in the state of Florida, 300 people made the difference.”A loose-knit group of national organizations working to restore voting rights includes the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or Acorn (Ms. Bell’s employer); the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; and the Brennan Center for Justice.Two other groups, the Sentencing Project and the Virginia and Florida chapters of American Civil Liberties Union, said they had given briefings to officials for Senator Barack Obama’s presidential campaign about how to register former felons. But the Obama campaign has been reluctant to acknowledge any concerted effort.An Obama spokesman, Bill Burton, said via e-mail, “We are trying to register voters across the country and follow the state laws wherever we are.”Charles J. Ogletree Jr., a Harvard law professor and senior adviser to the Obama campaign on criminal justice issues, said he had briefed campaign officials about felony disenfranchisement issues and the various and often-confusing state requirements to restore voting rights to former convicts.Campaign volunteers get briefed on specific state laws governing voting rights restoration in case they come across former felons during general voter registration drives, Mr. Ogletree said, “but it’s not as if the Obama campaign said, ‘Here’s a plan for felony disenfranchisement.’ ”None of the felony voter registration organizations contacted for this article could recall hearing from Senator John McCain’s campaign. And a campaign spokesman said there had been no effort to reach out to former prisoners specifically.Last month, Obama campaign workers took down a sign at their headquarters in Pottstown, Pa., that said “Felons can vote,” because it might have sent the wrong message.“The fear is that it might cost them more votes to be portrayed as the candidate of the felons than it could gain them,” said Anthony C. Thompson, a New York University law professor and Obama campaign adviser. “This is a mistaken belief, in my view, when there are tens of millions of citizens with criminal records.”In fact, felony voter restoration efforts have received bipartisan support in many states including Alabama, Florida, Indiana and Maryland. Still, surveys have shown that about 70 percent of former convicts lean Democratic, according to Christopher Uggen, a University of Minnesota criminologist who said that had led some to believe that Democrats benefited from felony voter restoration more than did Republicans.“That’s because of the high rate of incarceration among African-Americans, who have strong Democratic preferences,” Mr. Uggen said, “and because many people who have committed felonies are working class, relatively young, unmarried and in particular individuals with less than a high school education. These are all demographics that traditionally align themselves with the Democrats.”Muslima Lewis, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union in Florida, said: “Really, you’re not having a full participatory democracy if you disenfranchise so many people. It weakens the whole system and, in particular, communities of color.”All of Us or None, a prisoner-advocacy organization in San Francisco, held a rally last month about restoration of voting rights in California. Also last month, the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition successfully lobbied the Denver County jail system to begin registering felons upon their release.The A.C.L.U. is also advising lawyers’ groups planning to deploy to polling places in November to enforce the rights of former convicts who have restored their voting privileges.According to the A.C.L.U. only two states, Maine and Vermont, allow prisoners, parolees and probationers to vote. Thirteen states allow parolees and probationers to vote, eight states reinstate probationer voting rights, and 20 states restore voting rights to people who have completed their sentences, although each state has different processes, exceptions and limits on eligibility requirements. Kentucky and Virginia permanently disenfranchise nearly all felons.Florida’s felony voter registration law divides applicants into three categories based on the seriousness of their crimes: nonviolent criminals, the biggest group, need not apply for restoration of voting rights and just need to re-register. Violent criminals, but not murderers or rapists, must apply to the clemency board. The board either grants those rights immediately or investigates on a case-by-case basis. The most violent criminals are subjected to a more rigorous investigation and must attend a hearing of the clemency board, which meets only four times a year, before their rights can be reinstated.Despite the state’s liberalization of felony voter procedures, only 9,000 out of a potential 112,000 former convicts in Florida registered to vote in the last year, according to a report last month in The Orlando Sentinel. Part of the reason is that thousands of notifications sent by the state went to the wrong addresses because of poor data and former prisoners’ high mobility.Fred Schuknecht, the director of administration for the Florida Clemency Board, acknowledged in an interview that there was a backlog of 60,000 former felons who could potentially have their rights restored, but must first be reviewed by the agency. Despite the fact that 3,500 newly released prisoners are added to the caseload every month, the Legislature cut 20 percent of the staff devoted to felony voter restoration cases, Mr. Schuknecht said.Further, Ms. Bell said that many former convicts shun attention, even if that means abdicating their voting rights.“You might want them to fill out the registration form, but they have an outstanding warrant,” she said. “And in order to help them, I need to ask what their crimes are, but they might not want to say.”Cheria Murray, 24, of Orlando, regained voting rights this year, after serving a two-day jail sentence with two years’ probation for grand theft in 2003. Ms. Murray lives in a housing project where, she said, many people had been stripped of their rights because of their records.Her companion, Duane Miller, 28, recently returned from serving a sentence for illegal firearm possession, and has not applied to reinstate his voting rights.Ms. Murray said she thought about restoring her voting rights only recently, inspired by the presidential campaign.“When I saw Barack Obama, that’s when I got excited to get my rights back,” she said. “I wanted to vote for history.”'"
"'08-09-14,'0','It is not that anyone is more sanguine about the possibility of a terror group acquiring enough nuclear material to set off an atomic bomb in an American city. That is still the No. 1 worry. But the way the problem is analyzed is beginning to shift.“You know,” one senior intelligence official who would not speak on the record because he monitors the Pakistani arsenal said, “we used to have this great distinction between ‘states with nukes’ that we could deter the old-fashioned way, and ‘groups with nukes’ that we couldn’t deter.” But today, he said, “our biggest problem may be groups within states” that could take advantage of political chaos to seize what they need, either to sell it or to win a struggle for leadership of the country.Oh, for the simple days of President Bush’s formulation of “with us or against us.” Before he came up with alternative rationales for the Iraq war, President Bush often said that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks had changed his view of tolerable risk, and he insisted that the possibility, no matter how slim, that Saddam Hussein would obtain or sell a weapon was unacceptable. Yet to experts in his own administration, what’s happening today in countries like North Korea and Pakistan poses a far higher statistical risk of letting loose nukes out the door than Iraq ever did. (For one thing, there is no question that they have the nuclear material.)The president himself has been silent about this problem, but his spokesmen and the Pentagon’s have a stock answer to questions about it. It boils down to this: There is little reason to worry as long as the military remains in charge. Their reason: While North Korea and Pakistan have little else in common, they both have strong militaries with a well-honed sensibility about survival.“It is very difficult for me to imagine someone arriving at a North Korean facility with guns blazing and emerging with a nuclear weapon,” said Matthew Bunn, who teaches at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and is the author of an annual survey titled “Securing the Bomb.” “And the military understands that there is a big chance of retaliation if they ever sold anything to a terrorist — retaliation that would remove them and everyone they ever met from power.”That is why the American bomb-watching community has a grudging fondness for Mr. Kim, the “pygmy dictator.” The Americans’ biggest fear about North Korea is a collapse of the state, in which a starving, broke nation simply implodes. That could send everyone on a mad scramble for the country’s arsenal — the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Russians, the Americans. “The bad news about North Korea,” said Jonathan Pollack, a North Korea expert at the Naval War College, “is that we don’t know much about their nuclear control system. Or even if they have much of one.”The good news is that the arsenal is small. In recent negotiations with the United States, before Mr. Kim fell ill, the country said it possessed about 82 pounds of bomb-grade plutonium. If they are not lying (a significant “if’”) that’s about enough to make six weapons. Some in the C.I.A. think the North Koreans could have 12 or more weapons. It’s nothing to sneeze at, but compared to Pakistan’s arsenal, it’s a manageable number.Pakistan has a sophisticated Nuclear Command Authority, with layers upon layers of protections, some of them installed with the help of a covert American program that has already spent more than $100 million. Its leaders are acolytes of Mr. Musharraf, but they are thought to be military professionals first, and therefore responsible.But unified leadership at the top still counts. The problem is that Pakistan has a great deal of nuclear material, and is making more at a quick pace. Its facilities are spread out, so that India could not easily attack them all. The intelligence service, the I.S.I., has deeply divided sympathies, with many supporting the Taliban and extremist causes. And the bulk of the military isn’t much better.“So when a Pakistani facility gets attacked,” asks Mr. Bunn, “what do the guards do? Do they fight? Do they help? Do they run away?”Recent history is not especially reassuring about either Pakistan or North Korea, considering how much technology has already leaked from them to other states. Pakistan’s laboratories were where Abdul Qadeer Khan started his nuclear proliferation ring and flourished during political upheaval in the 1990s. Dr. Khan has been under house arrest, but in recent months he has been allowed to move around much more freely.And when the Israelis bombed a nuclear reactor in Syria a year ago, it soon came out that they had a lot of design and building help — from the North Koreans. That was when Mr. Kim had his full faculties. The nightmare is how much worse the leakage could get if it is unclear who is in charge.'"
"'08-09-14,'0','HOUSTON — Gasoline prices rose Saturday by an average of five cents a gallon across the country as the oil industry anticipated disruptions at several refineries along the Texas coast because of Hurricane Ike.It will take days for refiners to estimate the damages from the storm, and it will take at least a week before the cluster of refineries around Houston can resume operations. About half of the state’s 26 refineries either closed or curtailed production in the days before the hurricane struck land on Saturday, and 15 percent or more of the nation’s refining capacity has been knocked out.Flooding, blocked roads and major power shortages are bound to cause problems for the refiners. At the same time, most of the oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico have been out of commission for two weeks, starting as Hurricane Gustav made its way into the Gulf in late August.Gasoline became scarce around the Gulf in recent days as drivers filled up so they could evacuate their homes around the coast. Long lines were reported at stations across the region, and many stations closed because they had run out of fuel. The result was soaring prices on the regional wholesale market and at the retail pump.On Thursday, wholesale prices on the Gulf Coast had their biggest one-day jump since 1973, said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Alaron Trading, a futures trading firm. That is increasing prices across the country, especially in the South and much of the Midwest, which relies on Gulf refineries for supplies.'"
"'08-09-14,'0','Until the worst turmoil on Wall Street ends, the economy will struggle, said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at California State University, Channel Islands, who studies financial markets.“Until and unless we have financial markets stabilize, I don’t think we will see a meaningful recovery in housing, and therefore in the economy,” Dr. Sohn said. He said he expected economic growth to remain close to zero through the middle of 2009 before finally beginning to accelerate.Steven Wieting, the United States economist for Citigroup, said: “We’re describing the U.S. economy as recessionary.”Unfortunately, Mr. Wieting — and other economists — say that the Federal Reserve and the government have few good options left to ease the pressure on financial firms or the economy. The Fed has already cut short-term interest rates to 2 percent, below the rate of inflation, and the government has offered consumers and businesses $150 billion in tax rebates and cuts this year.The Fed has also taken several measures to buoy the financial industry, such as allowing more banks access to low-interest, short-term loans. Yet Wall Street continues to struggle through the aftereffects of the biggest speculative bubble in history.Financial services companies have cut more than 100,000 jobs this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an executive placement firm, and deeper layoffs may come this fall.Yet the picture may not be entirely bleak. When the chaos finally ends, Wall Street will almost certainly be smaller and more risk-averse. That change could eventually put the economy on firmer footing.This year’s crisis appears to mark the end of a bubble in the financial markets that has lasted nearly two decades. The speculation began in technology stocks in the 1990s and turned to real estate, commodities and private equity buyouts this decade. Along the way it powered the New York City economy and helped drive income inequality nationally.While the stock market has not been as frenzied this decade as it was at the end of the 1990s, rampant speculation took over many other financial markets, Mr. Wieting said. “In the last couple of years, financial activity became less related than we’ve seen before to real economic developments,” he said.Now Wall Street is reeling, as a significant fraction of the speculative real estate loans that banks made during the boom years are underwater. Because banks have limited capital to absorb losses, investors worry that those losses will overwhelm them.The problem has been worsened by the financial instruments that banks and hedge funds and insurance companies have created to swap loans and risk with each other. In theory, those products can help investors and companies diversify risk, but they are nearly impossible to value.“Investors just don’t know what these assets are worth,” said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. “There’s no transparency. It’s totally up to management to decide what these assets are worth and tell their accountants.”For example, Lehman said last week that it had $20 billion in tangible equity— money that would theoretically be available to its shareholders if Lehman had to be liquidated. But those same shareholders valued Lehman at only $2 billion as of Friday, proof that they do not have confidence in the way Lehman has calculated its assets.Now investors are demanding that banks like Lehman and Washington Mutual raise capital or sell their assets to raise cash and prove that they are solvent. But when banks are under pressure, they cannot easily find new investors or purchasers for their assets. It is as if a family were told to sell their home overnight, for cash, or lose it. They would surely receive a far lower price than the property would generate in a more orderly sale.So, one by one, the banks that took on the most risk are facing the real possibility of going under. Those with stronger balance sheets, such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are suffering much less.For Wall Street, the lesson has been sobering — and unlikely to be forgotten for several years, said Dr. Sohn, the California State economist.“The restraint in the credit markets will last quite some time,” Dr. Sohn said. In the mortgage business, which saw the worst excesses, loan practices may remain stricter for at least a decade, he said. The results will be both positive and negative, he said.The speculation that has produced wide swings in commodities prices and vacant subdivisions across California and Florida may become less prominent. But people who want to buy homes may continue to struggle to get mortgages, even if they have excellent credit. Companies who need loans to expand, or just to survive rough economic patches, will also have a harder time finding financing.“We went overboard,” Dr. Sohn said. “As a result, the financial market is imposing some discipline on our behavior, and it’s painful. But that’s how the system works.”Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Washington, said that, in a best-case scenario, greater risk aversion in the financial markets might eventually encourage the United States to rely less on bubbles and speculative lending to drive economic growth.Instead, the government could pursue policies designed to drive wages higher for middle- and lower-class Americans, he said, allowing them to buy homes and cars without taking on ruinous debt.“We have to find a new way — or maybe it’s an old way — to stimulate enough demand for the economy to do what it’s supposed to do without speculative excess,” Mr. Bernstein said. “A recovery that’s driven by more broadly shared prosperity, where consumption is fairly evenly shared through the economy, that kind of growth is more sustainable.”Even so, Mr. Bernstein said he was not cheering Wall Street’s deep struggles. “The financials are the heart of the credit system, and credit is the lifeblood of our economy,” he said. “There’s no question that we will pay a cost in terms of much diminished growth if this continues.”'"
"'08-09-14,'0','People like to quip that all Barack Obama has done is write two memoirs. But the act of memoir writing, at its most rigorous and profound, is the act of ferreting out truth from often grossly conflicting facts. At this juncture in history, what better preparation could there be for the White House?Fact: as a child, I watched my mother set fire to all my toys then menace me with a butcher knife. Fact: my mother adored me and even in our backwater town imbued me with the sensibility and curiosity to become an artist. Recreating both those facts in Technicolor strains the bounds of reason. It demands that I dig deep into my own experience, yet simultaneously view it from other angles entirely. But to demonize my mother or to deny my childhood torments would have made a shallow, dishonest memoir.In recent years, most political rhetoric has taken on a fervent, reductive quality — good for TV sound bites, bad for political complexities. But a president, like a memoirist, must be able to hold in his mind highly incendiary paradoxes and communicate those contradictions to a broad and overheated audience. Think of Lincoln during the Civil War.Fact: I recently threw out 501 finished pages of a new memoir because its “truth” was off — not the facts or actual events, but their synthesis, their cant. The sentences were O.K. The “facts” were there, but to publish it precipitously would’ve perpetuated lies I couldn’t bear about people I loved too dearly. It would be like hastily invading a country. Or leaving one before it is time. Changing position to incorporate incongruities isn’t dreaded “flip-flopping”; it’s what our next president needs to do.— MARY KARR, the author of “The Liars’ Club” and the forthcoming “Lit”'"
"'08-09-14,'0','Re “On Dividend Taxes, It’s a Post-Partisan Race” (Economic View, Sept. 7), in which N. Gregory Mankiw cited the argument that dividends should be taxed at a much lower rate than ordinary income to avoid double taxation of dividends.The problem is that this results in taxing money earned by people at a much higher rate than money earned by money. Someone who works hard for $75,000 in wages must pay much more in taxes than someone who inherits a tidy sum of money, never does a lick of work, and is paid $75,000 in dividends.A far better way to avoid double taxation is to allow corporations to deduct the amount they pay out in dividends when computing their net taxable income, then tax all dividends as ordinary income. This also would encourage companies to pay dividends.'"
"'08-09-14,'0','On Friday, less than a week after the government took control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the White House announced that there is no reason at this time to account for the companies in the federal budget.That is great news for officials who prefer to hide the cost of the bailout since it is due, in large part, to their failure to adequately regulate the financial markets and steward the economy. But it is an insult to taxpayers, whose money is at risk, and it is a reckless gambit.The Congressional Budget Office reported on Tuesday that the government’s finances are deteriorating rapidly: the budget deficit for this year is expected to reach $407 billion, more than double last year’s shortfall, and to exceed $500 billion in 2009. The takeover of Fannie and Freddie, necessary though it is, will add to the deterioration. Airbrushing that away will only open the door to uninformed — or negligent — decisions on spending and tax cuts.The White House says that the extent of the government’s control of Fannie and Freddie does not warrant including the companies’ operations in the budget. That is absurd. The government has seized the companies, firing their executives and installing new ones, offering to invest up to $200 billion in the companies if necessary, and most significant, making an ironclad promise to pay their trillions of dollars in obligations, if need be.The White House also claims that the risk to taxpayers is not yet serious enough to require that the costs be shown in the budget. But there is a very real cost to guaranteeing the obligations of Fannie and Freddie, even if the government never has to cough up a penny. The taxpayer is on the hook while the guarantee is outstanding — and the Treasury says that will last past Dec. 31, 2009, when its bailout authority officially ends.The Congressional Budget Office has said that it will calculate the cost of taxpayers’ risk and include it in its version of the budget, which is separate from the White House version of the budget.'"
"'08-09-14,'0','Cincinnati receiver Chad Ocho Cinco said Finnegan did not get the credit he deserves and was looking forward to playing against him Sunday. He had a piece of advice for Finnegan to gain recognition: talk at least once.“Just say, ‘I’m going to shut down whoever,’ ” Ocho Cinco said. “Out of a 16-week schedule, he can probably lock down everybody he plays. Seriously. I’m going off of what I see on film, and he’s above average as a corner.”Finnegan came into the N.F.L. with a couple of things going against him even though he was timed at 4.33 seconds in the 40-yard dash at the scouting combine in 2006. He is 5 feet 10 inches and played at Samford, a university in the Football Championship Subdivision — formerly Division I-AA — that had not had a player drafted since 1969.The Titans made him the 215th pick over all, then made him their fifth defensive back. He had a couple starts as a rookie.It was his second start, at Philadelphia, that seemed to impress Schwartz, especially as he watched film of that game in the off-season. Finnegan handled the Eagles, who tested him continually.With Jones suspended for 2007, Finnegan won the job. He started all 16 games, and the Titans traded Jones to Dallas in April, sticking with a player described as a complete package of speed, smarts and toughness, and the ability to play man-to-man and zone coverage.Finnegan, who has a photograph of Jordan taped inside his locker, did not stand pat. He spent his off-season working hard, and the Titans rewarded him in August with a contract extension through 2011. His big purchases included a new house for himself; one for his mother, a 20-year Air Force veteran who raised him; and help for his sisters. But coming from a small-college background, Finnegan said he would not become complacent.“We’ll take it one month, one year at a time,” he said.That may be why Finnegan can make opponents mad. Like the rest of the Tennessee defense, he goes hard from the snap to the whistle. Houston receiver Andre Johnson called Finnegan one of the most nagging players he faces.“He’s always trying to strip the ball from you or something like that,” Johnson said. “I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I think for him it’s good, because at times he can irritate you. Other than that, I think he’s a good player. I think he plays real hard.“The crazy thing about it is he doesn’t really talk. He just goes out and plays and he’s not going to say much, he’s just out there playing and he’s playing hard.”That describes the whole Tennessee defense.This unit was the fifth stingiest in 2007, and the Titans started off strong this season by holding the Jaguars to 33 yards rushing in their 17-10 victory, and also had seven sacks. They hit Garrard so much that he could not remember ever being that sore.Cincinnati Coach Marvin Lewis coordinated the Baltimore defense in 2000 that set an N.F.L. record for fewest points allowed. He said he saw similarities between these Titans and that unit.“They’re trying to make a name for themselves, and they got off to a great start. I think the thing is when you can limit an opponent’s rushing and limit their scoring, you have a chance to be very, very physical,” he said.But for all of the hits on Garrard and the repeated stuffing of Fred Taylor and Maurice Jones-Drew, the biggest plays came from Finnegan.He outleapt Troy Williamson and grabbed an interception at the Titans’ 14 in the third quarter. After watching the Jaguars complete some short passes on his side, Finnegan broke on a ball to the 6-4 Matt Jones and got the pick midway through the fourth.Typically, Finnegan credited the defensive line for both of his interceptions. No glory-grabbing for himself.'"
"'08-09-14,'0','The tunnel beneath the Channel consists of two tubes that ordinarily carry passenger trains and freight in opposite directions, and a third tube used for maintenance and evacuations. The fire broke out on a freight shuttle train traveling in the tube heading toward France. Eurostar said Saturday that it had begun running a limited service in the tube that was not affected by the fire.Eurotunnel said some services resumed soon after midnight French time on Saturday morning beginning with freight trains and followed by truck shuttles. Eurostar, the passenger train service, said Saturday that it had begun running a limited service between London, Paris and Brussels.Eurostar said ticket holders should turn up at the normal time for their scheduled service and that Eurostar would seek to accommodate them on the first available train, although it warned that waiting times and journey times would be longer than normal.French officials said the fire was likely to have been accidental, appearing to rule out terrorism. The exact cause, possibly from a truck carried on one of the shuttle trains, is under investigation.Eurostar canceled all its trains in both directions Friday. Gareth Headon, a spokesman for Eurostar, said those customers could either seek refunds or reschedule their trips for other dates. On Saturday, Eurostar said there would be further alterations to the limited timetable, without being more specific.One reason Eurotunnel officials may be reluctant to commit to a new timetable could be the difficulty of determining how many trains will be able to run following the incident. Experts said that trains are usually are able to cross over at certain points in the tunnel, which runs 50 kilometers, or 31 miles, to ensure the system runs as efficiently as possible.The closure of the tunnel was the longest since 1996, when a fire shut down freight and passenger services for two weeks and kept the tunnel partly closed for months.That blaze resulted from a fire on a truck, as did another incident in 2006, according to safety officials.""There are a lot of questions to be asked, particularly about whether the truck tipped over in some way, or whether it was carrying flammable chemicals,"" Christian Wolmar, a journalist and leading commentator on transport issues, said of most recent fire.But he said there might be little more that the British and French authorities could do to ensure safety on the undersea system without hampering cross-Channel trade and transport.""There is a trade-off between safety and cost,"" Mr. Wolmar said. ""I can't imagine there are easy-to-do measures that would enhance safety further without disproportionate cost.""Wolmar saw the tunnel after the 1996 fire and was shocked.""It was the most extraordinary sight,"" he said. ""There was never any concern about the water from the Channel pouring in, but the lining had burst off, leaving a very pockmarked surface that stretched away for quite some distance.""The French land transport accident investigation bureau, known by its French acronym, BEA-TT, was taking the lead in the investigation into the incident, according to a spokesman for the British Secretariat to the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority.The safety spokesman, who spoke on condition of customary anonymity, said the investigation would be carried out in conjunction with a British agency, the Rail Accident Investigation Branch.""I can make no comment on the circumstances as it's far too early to know what happened,"" the spokesman said. ""What I can tell you is that international rules and regulations on dangerous substances and safety apply to the Channel Tunnel. Eurotunnel is in compliance with those, and has even more stringent requirements.""The spokesman said one example of a banned substance was liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG.In coming weeks, trains will probably run in both directions using a single tunnel known as the south tunnel, Ms. Chabrier said.""We will work in single line, and we are used to doing this,"" she said. ""Of course we will have less fluidity,"" adding that it was too early to say whether passengers or truckers would suffer delays.Thorough security checks are under way, she said, noting that the temperature inside the north tunnel remained high on Friday afternoon. Eurotunnel said 32 passengers on the train, most of them truckers, escaped after being evacuated into the maintenance tunnel.The train was nearly 11 kilometers from Coquelles, where the tunnel ends close to the French port of Calais, when the fire broke out.""Eurotunnel's security systems, on board the shuttle and in the tunnel, immediately detected the problem,"" the company said in a statement. ""The fire service based close to the French portal was quickly able to assess the situation and take the necessary action to get the fire under control.""'"
"'08-09-14,'0','It was the place to be. With its air of new-generation chic, the gallery was one of the few where young artists dodging the shadow of Abstract Expressionism and poets doing strange things with language could meet as collaborators and friends.The ’50s, of course, were the great New York moment of painter-poet convergence. Tibor de Nagy, which both exhibited art and published poetry, helped shape it. Mr. Ashbery’s first slender volume, “Turandot and Other Poems,” appeared under the gallery’s imprint in 1953.To Mr. Ashbery the intermingling of artist and writer always made sense, because he was both, though his primary ambition while growing up in rural upstate New York was to be a painter. And not just any kind of painter, but a Surrealist.That he was a childhood film freak helped form a Surrealist sensibility, though there were also more specific influences. In 1936 he saw a Life magazine spread on a big show called “Fantastic Art, Dada, and Surrealism” at the Museum of Modern Art, and that was the convincer: He was 11. Max Ernst, of the book-long collages, became his lodestar.Mr. Ashbery’s artistic ambitions stayed high until 1945 when he got to Harvard, where, for practical reasons, they died down. “There was no place to paint, so I stopped,” he says. But by then he was already writing a lot of poetry and starting to do collage. In addition to being the perfect dorm-room art, collage is the ideal writer’s art, not just because it can incorporate words, but because it can be done on a desk. You lay out your paper, glue and scissors, push aside the computer — or the typewriter, which Mr. Ashbery still uses for poetry — and you’re set to go.The two earliest collages are student pieces. In one, based on an illustration from a German children’s book, Mr. Ashbery transforms schoolboys into Ernstian birds. The second is a horror-film affair with a screaming woman, a cruising shark and an upside-down chandelier.As is often true in Mr. Ashbery’s poetry, there is a hint of a narrative, though what the story might be is hard to say. And the artist, famously tight-lipped about meaning in his poems, doesn’t offer explications.“I never had any kind of program or anything. I did the collages for amusement, without thinking anyone else would see them or be interested.”Around the time he discovered collage at Harvard, he also discovered poets, live ones. Two of them, Kenneth Koch and Frank O’Hara, were fellow students. They read French Surrealist poets in French; they quoted Marianne Moore and Gertrude Stein; they knew their way around new music and art. New York City was their goal. It became Mr. Ashbery’s too.His life in the city, and in Paris during the decade he spent there from 1955 to 1965, was itself a collage, a crazy quilt of activities, disparate in pace and character but intermeshed. He continued to write and publish poetry; at the same time he embarked on a high-profile career as an art critic, first at ARTnews, then at New York magazine, finally at Newsweek.For him the journalistic experience was, from the start, “pretty hairy.”“I’m not the sort of person who jumps on a plane, comes back the next day and turns in a story,” he says. “I still have nightmares about this.”But whatever grief reviewing caused him, the results were wonderful. A collection of his criticism, “Reported Sightings: Art Chronicles 1957-1987,” is a fixture in art critics’ libraries. And the necessity of producing for magazine deadlines had an effect on his other work. If he could turn out a high volume of prose on demand, why not do the same with poetry?This led him to refine a speeded-up compositional method that he was already experimenting with. It involved picking up found phrases and images, putting them next to different phrases and images, inviting both brilliant accident and bruising confusion. (Mr. Ashbery’s fans and detractors are defined by which they find more of in his poetry.) Later came the hand-editing — splicing, trimming and smoothing — to shape final results.He was, in other words, making language-collages based on principles learned from paper collages, which were in his hands, based on techniques learned from films.The bulk of the work in the Tibor show is from the 1970s, when Mr. Ashbery spent parts of summers visiting the artist Joe Brainard (1942-1995) in Vermont. “After dinner we got in the habit of sitting around and cutting up old magazines and making collages,” Mr. Ashbery recalls.His were straightforward in format. Most have three elements: a postcard (found, vintage, often redolent of the past); one or two cut-and-paste images; and a clever title.The insouciant Pop-ish sensibility in some pieces owes a debt to Mr. Brainard’s brilliant collage work, as in Mr. Ashbery’s “Diffusion of Knowledge,” with its pair of all-American comic-strip superheroes mounting a spirited defense of the Smithsonian Institution castle in Washington. Other collages are just clever visual word-plays: the image of a big nose in profile looming over a Norwegian fjiord is “Norge.” And a few are minor jokes on art history: In “Notre Dame des Neiges,” a pale-skinned Raphael beauty presides, Madonna-like, over a snowy alpine resort.“Poisson d’Avril” goes for camp. Here a Little Lord Fauntleroy figure, gender uncertain, laden down with a basket of flowers, appears against a starburst of pleated pink tulle that could be an aura or a splayed-out tutu. The tableau, set against a postcard view of a sequoia forest, is like a unisex version of Hansel and Gretel choreographed by Les Ballets Trockadero.Some of the elements in recent collages he didn’t find himself, though they are part of his history. “Joe used to send me envelopes filled with old postcards and cutout things he thought I could use,” Mr. Ashbery says. Now that material has found its way into a homage to Brainard completed this year.That piece is done on a photocopy of an antique gridded game board used for playing Chutes and Ladders, which was popular in Britain but originated in India, where it had metaphysical implications. With each toss of the dice, you either climbed upward toward spiritual bliss or slid down.The particular game board that Mr. Ashbery used is printed with images of snowy hills with children on sleds. The collage he placed on top of it is a vision of heaven as a kind of school playground at recess time, one filled with surly cartoon monsters and hugging boys, raspberries and pansies, devils and babies, and a big serving of dessert on the side. Innocence and experience, sex and nonsense coexist, overlapping, intertwined.Mr. Ashbery wrote beautifully about Mr. Brainard in a catalog for a 1997 retrospective at Tibor de Nagy. And as a critic he has often been at his best about artists who are collagist in essence, if not in fact. Joseph Cornell was one. Mr. Ashbery prefaced his review of the 1967 Cornell Guggenheim show with a Rimbaud quotation that applies as much to his own collage-driven poetry as to Cornell’s assemblages:“I loved stupid paintings, decorated transoms, stage sets, carnival booths, signs, popular engravings; old-fashioned literature, church Latin, erotic books with nonexistent spelling, the novels of our grandmothers, fairy tales, children’s books, old operas, silly refrains, naïve rhythms.”And he gets at the extremely personal meaning collage can carry in a 1970 article about the New York collagist Anne Ryan (1889-1954), a self-taught, self-supporting artist who began, at around the age of 50, to make abstract collages of great expressive range from fabric and cloth. The way Mr. Ashbery begins the piece takes us right back to his own creative beginnings: “When I was a small child there was a box in the attic containing neatly trimmed scraps of material that had once belonged to dresses, aprons, blouses, dish towels, and which were apparently intended for a quilt that never got made. I was fascinated by them and used to pour over them with the zeal of an Egyptologist. There was a language there.”Language as collage. Collage as language. As is usually the case, Mr. Ashbery can present a heavyish idea without sounding heavy. One thing he obviously values in collage is its implied anyone-can-do-it modesty, its lack of high-artiness, its resistance to monumentality. His own collages have this character. They’re light and slight. They feel more like keepsakes than like art objects, souvenirs of a life and career that gain interest primarily — some might say entirely — within the context of that life and career.Interestingly, they are being brought to light at a time when Mr. Ashbery and his poetry are being officially declared national monuments. Next month the Library of America will publish “John Ashbery: Collected Poems 1956-1987,” a 1,050-page volume encompassing roughly half of his output. He is the first living poet to be included in this canon-constructing literary series.But for the moment Mr. Ashbery has this opening to think about. Some brand-new collages are spread out on a coffee table. This one isn’t quite done. This one might have made the list, but too late now. On the wall behind him an Anne Ryan hangs: a tiny construction of fabric blocks and a red just left of center, like a beating heart.After talking about the past and worrying about the present, Mr. Ashbery says, as if slightly surprising himself, that making collages “sort of stimulates my writing — there’s no fear of having my energy drained away.”A visitor ventures the idea that maybe, in some way, not directly, or definitively, the collages, and his critical writing, and his poetry, are all interrelated, and that the show ties a little knot? Mr. Ashbery considers this. Yes, he says, “I can see how this completes the circle.”'"
"'08-09-14,'0','Stark, merciless electronic beats and noises ricochet like gunshots around Terry Lynn on her debut album, “Kingstonlogic 2.0” (Last Gang). Her vision of her hometown, Kingston, Jamaica, has little in common with the raunch and swagger of typical dancehall, and her sound is even more skeletal: chants, buzzes, thuds and zaps, only occasionally making way for a chord or a shard of melody.She sees murder everywhere, with people caught between gangsters marking territory and equally trigger-happy policemen enforcing curfew. “Chop it bash it smash it scrape it,” she rhymes in “Kingstonlogic.” “Try you may but can’t escape it.” She also sees larger forces at work, and by the end of the album she’s praying, but she is most riveting at street level. There’s a sampler at kingstonlogic.com.Calexico, from Tucson, arrives as multiple bands on its new album, “Carried to Dust” (Quarterstick), a collection of enigmatic songs about wanderings and disappearances. Sometimes Calexico is a Southwestern Dire Straits, with Joey Burns whispering over loping, subdued guitar vamps as John Convertino plays his drums with brushes. Or it’s a band looking toward Mexico, with mariachi horns and impassioned singing (by guests) in Spanish. Or it’s a spaghetti-western soundtrack orchestra with guitar reverb and, on one song, whistling. At its best, in songs like “Victor Jara’s Hands,” it’s all of them at once, eerie and poetic as it straddles more than one border.The horror-movie-masked nine-man Iowa metal band Slipknot used to just thrash away on its drums, guitars and junk percussion while Corey Taylor barked the grim tidings of its lyrics, a spew of apocalypse, self-loathing, apostasy and personal and political fury. Slipknot’s fourth album, “All Hope Is Gone” (Roadrunner), still does some of that. But in his other band, Stone Sour, and now with Slipknot, Mr. Taylor has revealed that he can carry a tune. On “All Hope Is Gone,” Slipknot stops pummeling every now and then for a few lines of melodic chorus, a full-length dirge, even a power ballad that’s a sort of spurned love song. The more melody, the more derivative the songs become; that dirge, “Gehenna,” might as well be a Nine Inch Nails outtake. But this is how a thrash band moves from a cult following to a radio audience. Just ask Metallica.Is L L Cool J, who released his first 12-inch single back in 1984, “a relic from some long-forgotten game”? That question obsesses him on “Exit 13,” his last album for the Def Jam label. Between movie and television gigs, L L Cool J, 40, has treated his rhyming career as a comeback at least since 1990. And the more besieged he feels, the better his rhymes get. When he’s on, he can still rival that upstart Jay-Z for enunciation, rhythmic change-ups and stringing together simile after simile. He adapts easily to the younger generation’s production styles, from bombastic to robotic, as he juggles old-school reminiscences and newer mannerisms.'"
"'08-09-14,'0','Sometimes my normally obedient dog, Ornette, escapes our fenced yard and will not return on command. We open the car door and tell her excitedly that we will take her for a walk, her favorite activity, to entice her into the car. Then we put on the leash and take her home, no walk. Although dogs don’t really understand language in the way that humans do, I’m worried about the ethical propriety of our misleading ploy. Should I be? — DAVID SCHADE, VICTORIA, BRITISH COLUMBIAI share your skepticism that your dog understands the precise meaning of “walk” (an assertion some animal lovers will repudiate — but, please, no e-mail about how much your dog enjoys “Pride and Prejudice”). For all you know, when you excitedly say, “Walk,” your dog hears, “I like you!” or “Let’s drive home and watch ‘Lassie.’ ” Yet clearly it is possible to deceive a dog (by pretending to throw the ball, for example) and in your case, fortunately so.What’s the alternative? You can’t offer even the most linguistically gifted dog a cogent argument for returning to the yard. You could bribe her, if you carried meat in your glove compartment, but bribery, too, raises moral questions. Happily, what you are doing is innocuous; it is not akin to telling your kids they’re going to Disneyland and then taking them to the dentist. (Or telling me I’m going to my dentist, a skilled and eloquent fellow, but instead subjecting me to the nausea and fear of an amusement park.) But if you remain determined not to fool her, then give her a firm command — into the car! — and make sure she’s trained to obey it, for the benefit of you both.Alternatively, if you become convinced of your dog’s verbal ability, give her bus fare and tell her to return home when she likes. Be sure to mention the stop where she gets off so she doesn’t get lost.Maybe write it down for her.My wife parked in a public garage and lost her parking ticket. Had we gone to the cashier without it, we would have paid $24 instead of $12 for the four hours we parked. I found another ticket on the garage floor.There was no way to identify its owner. By using it we would pay $4 for an hour’s parking. I suppose the ethical thing would have been to pay the $24. We didn’t. Are we bad people? — JOHN TRAVAGLINI, SEATTLEYou’re no worse than any other petty cheat. You used a ticket-fiddle to avoid paying what the rules said you owed. I understand your reluctance to pay $24 when, had you been billed for your actual parking, you’d have owed only $12, but I’m an understanding person. (I can even understand why someone might finagle his taxes, what with money being so useful for buying things — attractive things, tasty things. I have a gift for empathy.) One way to avoid what you see as the excessive charge and still walk in the sun: work your little found-ticket scheme and hand $4 to the cashier, then, when you get home, mail the garage the additional $8 you owe.'"
"'08-09-14,'0','The baby-sitter arrived, a 27-year-old preschool teacher whom Mary hired to come in a few hours each week and help maintain harmony when both her children were home. It wasn’t easy. There was a basic rhythmic pattern to the afternoon: James reached out, craving attention and engagement, then stormed away in roaring frustration only to return, penitent and eager to connect, cuddling and hanging on to his mother in a way unusual for a boy his age.At one point Claire appeared in the next room, and James hurled a ball at her, missing. Claire shrieked as if she’d been hit, screaming, “What did you do that for?”“Wow, I’m scared,” James said. “I’m scared, right, Claire?” He threw the ball at her again, then asked, “Want to have family time?”“No,” Claire hollered. “I want James to get away from me. Get away!”James made a series of loud, taunting sounds, which induced more hysterical cries from Claire. “James, you’re provoking,” Mary said evenly. “Claire, you’re overreacting.”Claire rode out of the room in her wagon. James sat with his stockinged feet in his mother’s lap and played his Nintendo DS, though it rarely held his attention for more than a few minutes.“The therapist says that Claire is in crisis,” Mary told me, referring to a social worker the family sees twice each week. “James is feeling better, James is feeling happier, so Claire, who has always been easy, is letting it all out now.”James has never been easy. Like many children whose emotional problems are being diagnosed as bipolar disorder, his main symptoms are aggression and explosive rage (known in clinical parlance as “irritability”), and those traits have been visible in James from the time he was a toddler. Fifteen years ago his condition would probably not have been called bipolar disorder, and some doctors might hesitate to diagnose it in him even now, preferring other labels that more directly address James’s rage and aggression: Oppositional Defiant Disorder (O.D.D.) or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (A.D.H.D.) — both of which have been applied to James as well. But since the mid-1990s, a revolution has occurred in the field of child psychiatry, and a mental illness characterized by episodes of mania and depression (bipolar disorder used to be called “manic depression”), which once was believed not to exist before late adolescence, is now being ascribed rather freely to children with mood problems, sometimes at very young ages.The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the current edition is referred to as D.S.M.-IV) describes bipolar disorder as a condition whose average age of onset is 20, but virtually all the leaders in the field now say they believe it exists in children too. What they don’t agree on is what, exactly, characterizes the disease in kids, or how prevalent it is; some call it rare, while others say it is common. Many clinicians say the illness looks significantly different in children than in adults, but the question of how it differs, or what diagnostic terms like “grandiosity,” “elevated mood” or “flight of ideas” (all potential symptoms of adult bipolar disorder) even mean when you’re talking about kids, leaves room for interpretation. For example, it’s normal for children to pretend that they are superheroes, or believe that they can run faster than cars, whereas in an adult, these convictions would be signs of grandiosity. Equally unclear is whether a child who is identified as having a bipolar disorder will grow up to be a bipolar adult. Work on the D.S.M.-V is under way, and discussions have begun on how to address the issue of bipolar children.As Ellen Leibenluft, who runs the pediatric bipolar-research program at the National Institute of Mental Health, told me, “There definitely will be — and needs to be — more description of what bipolar disorder looks like in children, how one diagnoses it and some of the challenges.”According to Mary, James was excessively cranky and active from babyhood (except where otherwise noted, the names of patients and their families used in this story are middle names). “By 7:30 every morning, I’d be in the playground with him,” she said. “If it was over 20 degrees I was out the door, because if he was inside, he would rage.” Still, James seemed at first to thrive in preschool. “I said: ‘O.K., this is my problem, not his problem. This is my parenting skills, my lack of discipline, my lack of structure.’ However, when I would pick him up from school he would scream and cry and rant and rage, sometimes remove his clothes, it would take me half an hour to get him out of the vestibule. I’d have to literally tie him in the stroller. He was 3. People were absolutely horrified.”When James was 4 and Claire was a newborn, his pre-school contacted Mary in the fall and told her that her son seemed hyperactive and aggressive. After three days of testing, a developmental pediatrician diagnosed his condition as Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and prescribed Zoloft, an antidepressant. “We refused to give a 4 1/2-year-old Zoloft,” Mary said. They limped through the rest of the year, but in order for James to remain at the school for another year, they had to promise to hire a “shadow” — someone to be with James full time in the classroom — at a cost of $20,000 a year. Mary and her husband are affluent enough to afford this (her husband, Frank, has his own business; Mary hasn’t worked since James was born); otherwise, James would have had to leave the school.Meanwhile, life at home was devolving into a nightmare. “James used to wake up every morning violently angry,” Mary said. “I used to wake up at 4:30 and heat his milk in his sippy cup so that when he woke up at 5:00 it would be exactly the right temperature. If it was too hot or too cold, he would take one sip from the cup, hurl it across the room and rage so loudly that it would wake Claire up, so that at three minutes after 5:00, I would be crying, Claire would be crying and my husband would be crying.”She and her husband took James to a pediatric psychopharmacologist, who prescribed Risperdal, one of a new generation of antipsychotic drugs that have become popular for treating children with rage and aggression because it can blunt their anger and calm them down. These so-called atypical antipsychotics are less likely to cause abnormal movements and muscle stiffness than the earlier antipsychotics, but they can still prompt enormous weight gain and put children at risk for diabetes. Since James was underweight and oblivious to food, Mary and her husband were willing to take the risk.“So we give him the Risperdal drops before bed, and he wakes up the next morning and he says: ‘Good morning, Mommy. I’m hungry. Could I have something to eat?’ I wake my husband and I say: ‘James is different. The medication is working.’ That day at noon, the Risperdal wore off, and he became angry, miserable, mean, frightening — everything he was before.”But even with Risperdal and a shadow, James struggled in his second year of pre-K; with his anger under control, his attention problems became more visible. “He could not stay on tasks,” Mary said. “He couldn’t stick with anything. He’d go to the drawing table and make one scribble. . . . He was hopping around.” James’s condition was diagnosed as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a problem that is said to afflict between 3 and 7 percent of American schoolchildren. Normally A.D.H.D. is treated with stimulants like Ritalin, which can temporarily improve focus, but the two stimulants his doctor tried made James nasty and angrier, and he couldn’t stay on them. In first grade he moved to a school for children with special learning needs, but by second grade he was having trouble even there. “He would cry every morning, and cry and cry and cry,” Mary said. “I now realize that that was depression.”Home life was almost unbearable. “I couldn’t bring them to a playground together, because if he got behind Claire on the slide, he would push her down. If she walked by, he put out his leg to trip her. If they were watching TV and he became overstimulated, he would kick and punch her. . . . There’s never been a dinner hour; he’d push her plate. He didn’t like the way she was chewing. He’d rage. We never had any family meals. No family trips. Ever.”As often happens with children on psychotropic drugs, James’s behavior began to “break through” the medication, requiring more and eventually different combinations of drugs to contain it. Along with the Risperdal, he eventually went on Depakote, one of several antiseizure drugs that are also used as mood stabilizers. Depakote was ultimately replaced with Lamictal, another antiseizure drug, and the Risperdal gave way to Abilify, another antipsychotic.In spring of third grade, Mary was walking James and Claire home from James’s school when he demanded a lottery ticket. She refused to buy him one. “He started to scream and yell and rant and rave on a busy corner. We were crossing the street and the light was changing. Coming down 75th Street I saw this big white Hummer. James said to me as we were crossing the street, ‘If you won’t buy me a lottery ticket, I don’t want to live.’ He stood in the middle of the street and he faced the Hummer down. And the Hummer pulls over and the guy gets out and starts screaming.” At the psychiatrist’s office the next day, “James is speaking really fast and he’s mounting my leg like he’s in sexual overdrive,” Mary recalled. Pressured speech and hypersexuality are symptoms of mania. Shortly thereafter, when James was 8, his condition was diagnosed as bipolar disorder.Later on the April afternoon I spent in their apartment, Claire was on the family computer visiting her favorite Web site, JibJab, when James came over and stood beside her. “Can I start it over, please?” he said.“That’s nice asking, James,” Mary said. Claire replayed the video, and the children laughed, watching it together. A few minutes later, Claire came to her mother on the couch and put her arms around Mary’s neck. James followed, draping himself across his mother’s legs. Mary mentioned that she was concerned about some of the language she’d just heard on the video and mused aloud over whether to adjust the Internet filter to block JibJab out. “Mommy, please keep that one,” Claire implored. “That’s the only one James and I watch.” When Mary relented, the children cheered, seizing each other’s hands in a rare show of unity. A moment later, Claire, still giggling, said, “Ow.” James had pushed or hurt her somehow. “Ow, ow!” she cried, in real pain now.The children began to roar at each other. Mary took charge: “Don’t hit. Let’s separate our bodies.” Then, almost with surprise, she said, “We were having a nice moment.”Last fall, James started fifth grade at a school designed to accommodate emotional as well as learning issues. It has a contract with the New York City Department of Education, which means that city children attend free as long as the D.O.E. deems them in need of its services. The first parent conference, last fall, was sobering for Mary and her husband; the combination of A.D.H.D. and anger was making it hard for James to function even in this new school. “He can’t start, he can’t stop,” she paraphrased. “He can’t sit in his seat. He can’t stop interrupting. He’s constantly provoking his classmates. He’s basically barely teachable. . . . It was like someone punched me in the side of the jaw.” Mary went to James’s psychiatrist for help. “I thought I was finally going to walk away with Ritalin,” she said. “Instead, we walked out of that office with lithium.”Lithium is one of the oldest and most reliable mood stabilizers, but it’s a serious and potentially toxic drug, requiring regular blood draws to make sure that it isn’t becoming too concentrated. It can have unpleasant side effects: tremors, weight gain, acne and thyroid problems in the short term; kidney damage in the long run. But Mary and her husband felt they had little choice. And the lithium, which James took along with his other medication, helped. James settled down in his new school and began to learn, and even to make friends. He was happier. At which point Claire, perhaps in a delayed reaction to trauma dating back to when she was small, became hysterically intolerant of her brother. “The latest edict from the therapist is that Claire’s allowed to take her food and go in the TV room and eat by herself,” Mary said. “And now she’s eating three meals a day in there.”James’s psychiatrist was planning to raise his lithium dose until he was fully stable, and then to try adding a stimulant to help with his A.D.H.D., so he could concentrate better in school. Mary’s hopes were riding heavily on this plan; lately, James’s psychiatrist had been floating the idea of a residential school for James as a possible solution to his learning issues and conflicts with Claire. Mary and her husband badly wanted to keep him at home.“I used to cry five times a day, and now maybe I only cry once or twice,” she told me, her usual upbeat practicality briefly giving way to emotion. “So it’s better, you know? It’s better now that I don’t pick him up at school, and he doesn’t rage at me in front of all the other parents. He can rage when he bursts in the door, so no one sees how awful it is. It’s like a dirty little secret. It’s like having a husband who beats you, only it’s a kid. It’s your own.”A study last fall measured a fortyfold increase in the number of doctor visits between 1994 and 2003 by children and adolescents said to have bipolar disorder, and the number has likely risen further. Most doctors I spoke with found the “fortyfold increase” misleading, since the number of bipolar kids at the beginning of the study was virtually zero and by the end of the study amounted to fewer than 7 percent of all mental-health disorders identified in children. Many also said that because bipolar children are often severely ill, they can proportionately account for more doctors’ visits than children with other psychiatric complaints, like A.D.H.D. or Anxiety Disorder. Still, nearly every clinician I spoke to said that bipolar illness is being overdiagnosed in kids. In Leibenluft’s studies at the National Institute of Mental Health, only 20 percent of children identified with bipolar disorder are found to meet the strict criteria for the disease. Breck Borcherding, a pediatric psychiatrist in private practice in the Washington area, said: “Every time one of my kids goes into the hospital, they come out with a bipolar diagnosis. It’s very frustrating.”There are many possible reasons for the sudden frenzy of pediatric bipolar diagnoses. First, a critical shortage of child psychiatrists, especially in rural areas, means that many children are being seen by adult psychiatrists or — more often — by family doctors, who may lack expertise in child psychiatry. Managed care usually pays for a single, brief psychiatric evaluation (and it strictly limits the number of therapy appointments a year) — not nearly enough time, many say, to accurately diagnose a condition in a mentally ill child.Then there is “The Bipolar Child,” a successful book published by the psychiatrist Demitri Papolos and his wife, Janice, in 1999, and referred to by more than one parent I spoke to as a “bible.” The Papoloses’ description of pediatric bipolar disorder was amassed partly by using responses to an online questionnaire filled out by hundreds of parents on an electronic mailing list, who said they believed their children were bipolar (and who often had strong family histories of the disease). The Papoloses’ diagnostic criteria include some idiosyncratic items — a severe craving for carbohydrates, for example — that are found nowhere in D.S.M.-IV. Nevertheless, many parents walk into doctors’ offices having already read “The Bipolar Child” and concluded that their children are bipolar. Because doctors rely heavily on parental reports when diagnosing disorders in children, these “prediagnoses” may have an impact on the outcome.And of course, there are pressures and blandishments from the pharmaceutical industry, which stands to profit mightily from the expensive drugs — often used in combination — that are prescribed for bipolar illness, despite the fact that very few of these drugs have been approved for use in children.For all the possible overdiagnosing of pediatric bipolar disorder, however, many in the field also say that a lot of truly bipolar children who could benefit from therapy are falling through the cracks. This is a critical issue; studies clearly show that the longer bipolar disorder goes untreated, the worse a person’s long-term prognosis. Between 10 and 15 percent of those suffering from bipolar disorder end up committing suicide.Some studies suggest that bipolar disorder may actually be on the rise among young people. One intriguing hypothesis involves a genetic phenomenon known as “anticipation,” in which genes become more concentrated over generations, bringing a stronger form and earlier onset of an illness with each successive generation. Another theory is “assortative mating,” in which a more mobile and fluid society, like ours, enables the coupling of people whose mutual attraction might be partly due to a shared genetic disposition to something like bipolar disorder, thus concentrating the genetic load in their offspring.Given these uncertainties, how does a doctor go about diagnosing bipolar disorder in a child? To understand that process, I spent several days at the Child and Adolescent Bipolar Services Clinic at the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the largest clinic in America devoted specifically to treating and studying children with bipolar disorder. It has about 260 active patients, most of them from Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and West Virginia, and it evaluates between one and five new cases each week. It accepts managed care, meaning it operates at a loss, which is absorbed by the medical center. (Many child psychiatrists in private practice, who charge as much as $400 an hour in New York, accept no insurance; families who can afford to lay out these sums must collect what they can from their insurers after the fact.)The three evaluations I watched consisted of what are called semistructured interviews of parents and children, separately and together, by an experienced nurse or social worker, to collect the child’s psychiatric history and determine which symptoms of mania or depression are present (parents are prescreened by phone to rule out cases that are clearly not bipolar, a process that eliminates roughly 50 percent of callers). Parents and child then have a lengthy meeting with either Boris Birmaher, who founded the clinic 10 years ago, David Axelson, its current director, or one of two other psychiatrists.The first two evaluations I saw were of teenagers, a boy and a girl; the doctors felt they seemed depressed, not bipolar, and directed them to a clinic in the same building that caters to depressed teenagers. The third evaluation was of a 7-year-old boy named Joe (his first name): a burly, sweet-faced kid with long eyelashes and dark curls. He appeared quite depressed, leaning his head on the armrest of his chair and answering yes or no in a mournful monotone. His mother and grandmother described a child who sounded a lot like James — restless and overactive from birth, impulsive, requiring constant attention, but above all, wildly, explosively angry. His mother recalled tantrums lasting hours; a recent one, which took place in Wal-Mart when she refused to buy him a video game, resulted in her having to sit on Joe in an aisle until store employees could help her wrestle him into the car. Like James’s, Joe’s condition was diagnosed as O.D.D. and A.D.H.D. and he had taken various medications since age 4, including stimulants and antipsychotics, none of which really helped. A recent rampage at school concluded with a 20-minute physical fight with a police officer; Joe was suspended, and if his mother hadn’t been able to get there and calm him down, he probably would have landed in a psychiatric hospital.His mother, who had Joe at 19 and is single, working the overnight shift at a group home for the mentally disabled, spoke through a frequent rattling cough. “He tells me he hates me every day,” she said. “He says he hates himself, and he wants to die. I don’t enjoy being around him. When I’m restraining him, he kicks me, punches me and spits in my face, bites me. Sometimes I don’t ride in the car with him, because I just don’t know what he’s going to do: if he’s gonna open the door, if he’s gonna reach around and punch me, grab the wheel.”After several hours of interviews, Axelson told Joe’s mother and grandmother: “What is clear is that Joe is having mood difficulties. Whether that’s related to a depressive disorder or a bipolar disorder is hard to tell. I know that’s frustrating.”What Axelson wasn’t seeing in Joe was clear evidence of mania, defined in D.S.M.-IV as a distinct period of an abnormally elevated (meaning euphoric) or irritable mood, accompanied by at least three out of seven other symptoms (four symptoms, if the mood is irritable rather than elevated). Those seven symptoms are captured with the mnemonic Digfast: distractibility, indiscretion (“excessive involvement in pleasurable activities” in D.S.M.), grandiosity, flight of ideas, activity increase, sleep deficit (“decreased need for sleep”) and talkativeness (“pressured speech”).“I’m not seeing clear patterns of distinct periods of being accelerated and talking and moving and thinking with an intensity of mood that just overflows and then goes back to his usual state,” Axelson said. “The intense anger outbursts can happen in kids with bipolar disorder, but they can happen with other mood disorders, or with A.D.H.D. and severe oppositional behavior. He’s only 7 years old. This could be the very early signs of bipolar, and it may not be until two, three, four, five years from now that we’d have a clear idea. That doesn’t mean that he doesn’t need intensive treatment — he really does.” (Joe is currently in treatment at the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, but the right medication has proved elusive.)It’s possible that a different doctor might have identified Joe as bipolar. In an influential 1995 paper that began the paradigm shift toward bipolar disorder within child psychiatry, Janet Wozniak — the director of the pediatric bipolar-disorder program at Massachusetts General Hospital and co-author of “Is Your Child Bipolar?” — working with the chief of pediatric psychopharmacology, Joseph Biederman, revealed that 16 percent of the children who came to the clinic met the D.S.M. criteria for mania. This was shocking news; it was widely believed until then that mania in children was extremely rare. Wozniak reported that the children’s mania most often took the form of an irritable mood rather than an elevated one, and that the mood was often chronic: the norm, rather than the exception. All but one of the manic children in the study also suffered from A.D.H.D.Wozniak told me that the discovery of mania in so many of the kids she was treating came as a shock to her too. “It was like I opened up my eyes: Oh, my goodness, these children have bipolar disorder,” she said. “And I realized that what I’d been treating them for hadn’t been working well. I was often treating them for bad A.D.H.D., using different stimulant medicines or higher doses. I was often treating them for their depression and not getting anywhere. In those days, the teaching was that we had a group of medicines that could be used for ‘aggression’ in children. What’s interesting is that these were the anti-manic agents; they were lithium and antiseizure medicines.” In other words, many of the children in Wozniak’s clinic went unrecognized as bipolar, but they were inadvertently being treated for bipolar.The tricky part, diagnostically, is that out of those seven symptoms, three — distractibility, activity increase and talkativeness — are also symptoms of A.D.H.D. Which means that a severely irritable child who has A.D.H.D. could be, theoretically, only one symptom away from a bipolar diagnosis.Does it even matter whether or not we call Joe or James bipolar, since the drugs used to treat irritable, aggressive children are often the same as those used for bipolar disorder? Critics of the more widespread use of a pediatric bipolar diagnosis say it does. For one thing, being bipolar makes certain medications extremely risky to use; stimulants can intensify a manic episode, and antidepressants like Zoloft or Prozac can make bipolar patients not just manic but psychotic, even suicidal. In fact, some clinicians say that a number of young patients who become suicidal while on antidepressants — occasioning the “black box” warning currently mandated for drugs like Prozac — in fact suffer from undiagnosed bipolar disorder.Gabrielle Carlson, the director of child and adolescent psychiatry at the Stony Brook University School of Medicine, has studied childhood mania for many years and says bipolar disorder is uncommon in children under 10, revealing itself in the same discrete episodes of mania and depression that we see in bipolar adults — not in chronic irritability. According to Carlson, a large group of aggressive and explosive children, who in fact are “diagnostically homeless,” are being relabeled as bipolar, which is a development she says is unhelpful both to the children and the field. “Diagnostically it ends up being a very important consideration of what the kid really has,” she told me. “If he really has A.D.H.D. and it’s not mania, then you give him medication for his A.D.H.D. You also give him behavior modification.” One patient she saw that day, who was thought to have bipolar disorder, actually had autism, she said. “If you say, ‘Hey, his problem is bipolar disorder,’ then you’re not going to treat his language disorder, you’re not going to give the social-skills treatment he needs,” she said. Problematic conditions in a child’s home life are also less likely to be addressed if the child’s behavioral issues are attributed to bipolar disorder, Carlson said. “Many people, when they hear bipolar disorder, their brain slams shut.”Afternoons at the Pittsburgh bipolar clinic are the time when ongoing patients come in for shorter appointments to assess the impact of their medication regimes on their mood and check for side effects. On my visit in March, Axelson’s last appointment of the day was with a pair of bipolar siblings: Phia, 9, and Lucas, 6, both of whom he had been treating for the last year and a half. They were a dynamic and appealing pair, if slightly overcharged; there was constant climbing and prowling in the small office. Phia, who wore a pink sweater, black cords and red wool-lined Crocs, had begun taking lithium just a few weeks before, after two different antipsychotic drugs produced an uncomfortable muscular sensation in her legs called akathesia. Now that she was on lithium and a lower dose of one of the antipsychotics, the akathesia had stopped, and both Phia (a family nickname) and her mother, Marie, agreed she was doing well. On the other hand, Lucas, a vigorous, bullet-headed boy who that day wore camouflage pants, was behaving oddly, Marie said. “Throughout the course of a day, there’s a shift from a whole lot of bravado to limp,” she told Axelson.“Tell me what Lucas is like at the bravado times,” he said.“We went to church, and what he had strong feelings about wearing was a glittery lamé vest on top of a striped shirt and a top hat.”Axelson leaned toward Lucas in amazement. “A top hat!” he said. “Do you normally wear a top hat to church?”The nurse found a pretext to take the children out of the room so that Axelson could question Marie further. “Is he talking differently when he’s in the top-hat kind of mood?”“There’s no inhibition,” she said. “He’ll just run up to people on the street or in stores, go right up and start talking to them. He’ll say, ‘Hi,’ and tell them something that went on in his life in the morning; it could be his breakfast, it could be his Webkin. They may not even be paying attention to him, but he’ll persist.”“Is he physically moving around more when he’s in that kind of mood?” Axelson asked.“Yes, like touching the stove top, touching everything. But in a reckless way, where things are getting pushed off the counter and dropping and breaking. He thinks that he doesn’t need to wear a shirt outside. You obviously tell him, ‘You have to wear a coat, it’s 32 degrees,’ and he’ll have a fit. I end up carrying him upstairs to try to get him in a timeout to calm him, and I’ll hold him. And after that, it’s like the bottom drops. He gets limp. He’ll say: ‘I’m sad. It’s the kind of sad that isn’t for a reason.’ Or he’ll say, ‘Things aren’t right.’ ”Axelson decided to increase Lucas’s Abilify dose but warned Marie that he wouldn’t be able to go much higher. If the manic symptoms persisted, they might need to consider lithium — not ideal for a child so young and something both Axelson and Marie said they hoped to avoid.Later I asked Axelson what struck him as manic about the behavior Marie described in Lucas. “What would mania look like in a 6-year-old?” he asked. “They can’t have sex with strangers, max out their credit card or start new business ventures. But he can dress outlandishly, talk to strangers.” Lucas’s behavior also harked back to some of his premedication symptoms, which included grabbing strangers’ cellphones out of their pockets and trying to touch the guns of police officers. He’d slathered shaving cream on the furniture and drawn all over the walls. Then there were days when Marie couldn’t get him off the couch. He had difficulty connecting to other children; after two years of preschool he had never been invited on a play date.Axelson’s diagnoses of Lucas’s and Phia’s disorders were abetted by the fact that Marie and her husband are both bipolar, too. There is clear evidence that the disorder runs in families; a recent study shows that children with even one bipolar parent are 13 times as likely to develop the disease. Marie, an artist, learned she was bipolar only recently, having been treated for many years for depression. Once her children were successfully in treatment, she told me, she was able to perceive how mentally uncomfortable she herself was. A psychiatrist, looking carefully at her history, determined that in her 20s, which Marie had thought were simply “awash in bad judgment,” she actually suffered from bouts of mania. The new diagnosis had prompted different medications, which she said had helped her enormously.Marie’s history illustrates a trend toward a more inclusive definition of adult bipolar illness; little noted in the study that reported on the fortyfold increase in child and adolescent bipolar doctor visits was the fact that the number of adult visits had roughly doubled during the same period. This increase jibes with a recent population survey estimating the prevalence of bipolar disorder among American adults, long thought to be around 1 percent, at slightly more than 2 percent. The survey also projected that another 2.4 percent of Americans have a “subthreshold” form of bipolar disorder — less severe but still impairing. The author of the study, Kathleen Merikangas, a senior investigator at the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, says that she does not feel that the number of bipolar adults is rising but that greater public awareness and diagnostic inclusiveness account for the jump. Still, that comes to nearly 10 million American adults with some form of bipolar disorder, only a small percentage of whom, the study found, were receiving appropriate treatment.It was Phia whom Axelson first identified with bipolar disorder, and he described her case as “pretty clear cut.” Like James, Phia was overstimulated almost from birth. Marie couldn’t take her for a walk without Phia becoming hysterical in response to the sights and sounds they encountered. Marie couldn’t wear colored shirts; Phia couldn’t attend a play group. At times Phia seemed bizarrely overconfident for a toddler, pursuing men and flirting with them, showing no sign of fear or remorse when her grandfather, an imposing man, yelled at her. Marie began taking her daughter to a psychologist when she was 4. “I felt like I was doing something wrong,” she told me. Despite troubles with reading and an anxious habit of rubbing the soles of her feet against the bottoms of her shoes until blisters formed, Phia was able to function in public school. But from the moment she stepped off the school bus at the end of the day, it was bedlam.“Everything set her off,” Marie recalled. “That wasn’t the snack that she wanted. She doesn’t want a snack. She’d want to be pushed on the swing, and it would be too high, or not enough, so I would push her a little bit more. There would be this screaming fit, kicking her legs, flailing on the swing. ‘I hate this, that’s not what I wanted!’ I’d be like, That’s it. We’re done on the swings. Then that would precipitate a fit.” It was impossible to keep Phia in a timeout; she would burst from her room laughing. Marie attached a lock to the outside of her door and cleared the room of things that might hurt her daughter as she raged.Phia also had “silly” moods that quickly spiraled out of control, resulting in injuries: she broke her collarbone while diving over her bed in a silly fit; flailing, she would smack her arms inadvertently against the wall; she fell down the stairs repeatedly; she cracked her teeth on the edge of a swimming pool. Play dates were impossible; once, upset that a friend was about to leave, Phia told the girl that her father was beating her. She tormented Lucas; screaming at him, pushing and kicking him, once whipping him with a wand so hard that she raised welts through his shirt. And Phia herself was in agony. “She was asking for medicine for at least a year or so,” Marie said. “ ‘Isn’t there anything they can give me to help me calm down?’ ”Much of Phia’s extreme behavior has eased with medication. When I visited the family at their two-story suburban home on the last day of March, a couple of weeks after their appointment with Axelson, there was an atmosphere of renewal: Marie was painting the kitchen cupboards; her husband (an engineer who works long hours; we never met) had replastered some damaged walls. Nowadays Phia has a best friend and goes to birthday parties. With her mind calmer, she told me, she loves to read and is fond of the American Girl mystery series. She and Lucas are lucky in that they seem not to have any other disorders, or “comorbidities,” like A.D.H.D., on top of their bipolar disorder. Both are doing well in public school.I sat with Marie and Phia at a round outdoor table facing the backyard. Lucas was using a remote control to send an electric car roaring over the grass. Marie, a calm, gentle woman who chooses her words with care, told me that Lucas had improved on his higher Abilify dose. But Phia — surprisingly — had struggled since the appointment I was present for. After a blood draw, Axelson increased her lithium dose.“My feelings weren’t really going that well,” Phia told me when I asked her about the previous weekend. “It was like all of a sudden, horribleish. Unexplainable mad, sad horrible feelings inside.” She blamed the several days of standardized tests she recently took at school, saying they made her anxious.When Phia went inside, Marie told me she offered, the previous week, to take her daughter to the hospital. “She becomes fitful,” she said. “You have to physically hold her down, and that’s getting harder and harder to do. She’ll bang her head against the wall, she’ll bite herself. I brought up the hospital because she said: ‘I can’t take it anymore. I don’t want to be me. I don’t want to feel anymore. Why aren’t you doing anything about this?’ ”As he played with his car, Lucas kept looking up, waiting for a little boy who lives around the block to appear on the other side of the wire fence that separates his yard from Lucas’s. Marie had repeatedly invited this boy over to play, but his parents always declined — she wondered if the mayhem they’d heard coming from her house before her children were medicated might be the reason. Toy cars and trucks were positioned along the fence from the boys’ prior meetings there. Sure enough, the neighbor soon appeared, calling Lucas’s name, and Lucas greeted him joyfully. Lucas hauled a supply of pirate weapons over to the fence and the boys divvied them up and began to play through the wire. Phia joined them, but when Lucas came over to ask his mother for another sword, his sister chased him down, upset; apparently, the neighbor boy asked who I was, and Lucas made some mention of meeting me at his doctor’s office.“Don’t!” Phia implored her brother. “That’s our privacy. We don’t want them to know that we’re bipolar, that’s not their beeswax. That’s our secret thing, O.K.? That’s our family secret.” Only her good friends know that Phia takes medicine. “They don’t know what it’s about,” she told me. “They have no clue I’m bipolar.” She worries that if they knew, they would feel differently about her.Lucas was reluctant to leave his friend for dinner; he waved and bellowed to him through the open window as he wolfed down his ravioli and salad. For dessert, Marie had placed small portions of leftover Easter candy inside Ziploc snack bags: one for each child. She was concerned about their weight, which had increased since they began taking medications — Phia’s especially. She wasn’t overweight, but her body had changed from slender to average, and her clothing size had increased from a 6X to a 12/14. “With all the emphasis on childhood obesity, it’s a daily worry,” Marie said. She dreaded comments about her children’s sizes from family members at a coming reunion; Marie says her parents and siblings don’t believe that her children are bipolar and disapprove of the medication. The school also has doubts. All these things make Marie question the diagnosis and medication.“Their diagnoses are largely based on the history as I see it,” she told me. “And that feels like an incredible responsibility — how accurate am I?”Eventually the children prepared to go upstairs for baths and bed. On the kitchen counter were four sectional pill containers, one for each member of the family. Marie put each child’s pills into a spoon and squirted a dollop of whipped cream on top to help them go down. Like any kid, Phia grabbed the whipped-cream canister before Marie could catch her and sprayed some into her mouth.The next time I visited James and his family, a rainy day in May, things had taken a turn for the worse. The stimulant, which James’s psychiatrist had been planning to add for months when his lithium level was high enough, had made James manic — sleepless, talking incessantly, banging on radiators — and the school had immediately called and asked Mary to take him off it. This was a huge blow; both school and parents were counting on the stimulant to help James concentrate. Each year he has trouble in May (“Manic May,” Mary had dubbed it), and his hostility had reached new extremes; he wouldn’t shower or brush his teeth or do his homework without a fight.One morning, when Mary’s husband was out of town, James stood on his bed and threatened her with a huge stick. “He said, ‘You’d better back down or I’m going to smash your face in,’ ” she said. “He was really beside himself. I looked at the base of the stick, and I thought, These are things you read about: he’s going to break my nose. And I knew I couldn’t show how petrified I was. So I stared him down, and he put the stick down, eventually.”Another morning, James told Mary, in front of Claire: “I’m going to kill you. I’m going to slice you open with a knife.” Later, he apologized, distraught. But, for his mother, something shifted when she heard those words. “I always wondered what my breaking point would be,” she told me. “I thought maybe it would be if he accidentally hurt Claire, but the look on his face when he told me he was going to kill me, that was it.”James’s dose of Abilify had been increased, which was helping somewhat. But Mary had also put in applications to three therapeutic boarding schools, where James might start sixth grade in the fall. The classes would be even smaller, and she said she hoped living at the school would help James with his behavioral issues. All three schools were out of state, and the family would initially have to pay room, board and tuition out of pocket — the prices ranged from $93,000 to $125,000 a year — and sue for reimbursement from New York City. Such costs would of course be prohibitive for most families, creating a terrible bind for those who can’t receive approval for in-state residential schooling yet are unable to handle their children at home. In some cases, these children end up becoming wards of the state.James hadn’t yet returned from school when I arrived, but Frank, his father, was at home; he is a courtly man with reddish curly hair whose posture sagged visibly as we discussed the possibility of his son going away. Two of the schools had already expressed interest, and the third called while I was there; it, too, had a possible spot for James. This last was Mary’s favorite, based on its Web site: rural, all-boy; James could ride horses. She made an appointment to visit the school with Frank the following Thursday.“Next Thursday!” he said, taken aback. “Oh, it’s moving fast.”His biggest fear was that James would perceive boarding school as a punishment for behavior he can’t control. “He’s 10 years old, almost 11, and he still holds my hand when we walk on the sidewalk together,” Frank said. “So when he comes out with guns blazing and eyes popping out of his head, I know that this poor kid has a demon that’s just blasting its way out of him. I think what it’s like when I wake up on the wrong side of the bed and I feel angry for no particular reason, and I realize that this is James’s life moment to moment, every day.”Shortly after James arrived home, cheerful and wearing a silky black track suit, Frank lay down for a nap. Mary asked her son to take his 4 p.m. Abilify pill; he refused. He politely asked to borrow my microphone and used his iPod to record himself singing. Then the sound of Claire laughing in the next room set him off. “Be quiet,” he suddenly shouted.“Don’t talk to your sister that way,” Mary said.“Be quiet!” he yelled at her.“Hey,” she said, “you need to walk away. Now, it’s after 4 o’clock — ”“Then you can go into your room — ”James covered his ears and began to chant: “Sorry, sorry, nope can’t hear you, can’t hear you, sorry, can’t hear you.”“It’s time for you to take your pill.”“I’ll smack your face,” he said, brandishing his iPod earphones.“Don’t threaten me with that or you’ll never see it again. Take your pill.”James took the pill. Then he closed the door to block out the sound of his sister. “You open this door, Claire, I’ll pull out something really sharp on you,” he said.“Calm down,” his mother said. “And no more talk about sharp things.”He tried to play his iPod recording for us, but the speakers wouldn’t work. He became enraged and crashed out of the room, emitting animal yells that Mary had to translate for me: “I hate it! Never again! Never again!” A moment later he was back, whimpering, “I want Daddy.”“Sweetheart, Daddy’s sleeping. Do you want him to help you with the machinery?”“No! I want him! How stupid are you?”“James, you’re being so rude. Are you hungry?”“No, I’m not!” he howled, apoplectic. “I just ate raspberries. Why am I [expletive] hungry — frigging hungry?”He threw himself onto a chair and began to play his Nintendo DS. A few minutes later, he curled, all 105 pounds of him, in his mother’s lap, his arms around her neck, head on her shoulder.Later, when James was out of the room, Frank, now awake, spoke wistfully of a sense that he was growing apart from his son. They used to go to a diner together on Sunday mornings, just the two of them, but James rarely wanted to anymore. “He’s restless, but he doesn’t know what to do,” Frank said. “And anything you suggest is of no real interest to him.”James came into the room and draped himself across his mother’s knees. “Sweetie pie, are you hungry?” Mary asked James. “Would you like Daddy to take you out for something to eat?”James raised his arm, his head still buried in his mother’s lap. “Is that the thumbs up?” Mary asked.Frank looked startled, pleased. “O.K., I’m going to strike while the iron’s hot,” he said, rising from his chair. “Come, my little man.”I felt an agonizing quiver of dread as father and son gathered jackets and wallet and shoes. Would James become angry? Would he change his mind? Would they actually get out the door without an explosion? When they did, it seemed miraculous.In the abruptly quiet apartment, Mary and I talked about her son’s future. “It’s not that we even dream that James goes to college,” she told me. “We just want him to graduate from high school and be a functioning, contributing-to-society individual. Maybe he’ll meet a nice girl from Cape Cod and become a carpenter there. My biggest fear is that he’s going to become a loose cannon when he’s 18.” James’s psychiatrist reassured Mary that he would settle down after adolescence. “But she’s also the person who told me these were early-childhood issues and he’d be off Risperdal by the time he was 7 or 8,” Mary said. There was a long pause.“It just keeps opening up like an inverted triangle,” she said finally. “The scope of his difficulties just gets broader and broader the older he gets.”The most basic question about bipolar kids remains a mystery: Will they grow up to be bipolar adults? Because diagnosing the condition in children is still relatively new, no studies have yet followed a large number of them fully into adulthood. One fact is suggestive: bipolar kids are predominantly male, while the adult bipolar population skews slightly toward the female. The likelihood is that many of these kids will grow up to have mental-health issues of some kind, but which issues, and how chronic or severe they will be, no one really knows. A long-term study in Pittsburgh overseen by Axelson and Birmaher suggests that as children grow, the severity of their disorders can change; bipolar II, the less severe form of the disease, can convert to bipolar I, the more severe form. Nearly a third of subthreshold bipolar cases (BP-N.O.S., or Not Otherwise Specified, in D.S.M.) convert to the more serious forms.Intriguingly, though, some of the bipolar children in the study appear to have gotten well. Roy Boorady, the director of psychopharmacology services at the New York University Child Study Center, told me: “Now that I’ve worked with kids long enough, you see some that had this mood instability or irregularity and were diagnosed as bipolar. But then you see them as they’re older, and they’re off in college and not having these labile mood swings anymore. You really wonder, What was it?”Most clinicians say they believe that there will eventually be clear “biological markers” of bipolar disorder: ways to see and measure the disease as we can seizures, cancer or hypertension. Scientists are working to identify the genes (there appear to be many) involved in creating a predisposition for bipolar disorder. Brain imaging, still in its infancy, can already detect broad differences of size, shape and function among different brains. The hope is to know early on who is at risk so their condition can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Mental illness wreaks brutal damage on a life, crippling decision-making, competence and self-esteem to the point where digging out from under years of it can be next to impossible. And there is also a biological theory for why going untreated might worsen a bipolar person’s long-term prognosis. Epilepsy researchers have found that by electrically triggering seizures in the brains of animals, they can prompt spontaneous seizures, a phenomenon known as “kindling.” Simply having seizures — even artificially generated ones — seems to alter the brain in such a way that it develops an organic seizure disorder. Some scientists say that a kindling process may happen with mania, too — that simply experiencing a manic episode could make it more likely that a particular brain will continue to do so. They say this explains why, once a person has had a manic episode, there is a 90 percent chance that he will have another.Kiki Chang, director of the pediatric bipolar-disorders program at Stanford, has embraced the kindling theory. “We are interested in looking at medication not just to treat and prevent future episodes, but also to get in early and — this is the controversial part — to prevent the manic episode,” he told me. “Once you’ve had a manic episode, you’ve already crossed the threshold, you’ve jumped off the bridge: it’s done. The chances that you’re going to have another episode are extremely high.”Along with medication, Chang is exploring family therapy and other forms of stress reduction that might help fortify a child against a genetic proclivity for bipolar disorder. “If we wait too long, they will probably need chronic medication treatment,” he told me. “But if we can get in early enough, they may not need to stay on medication. So we’re hoping to get in and get out, and not subject them to the long-term side effects.” (As for short-term side effects, Chang says medications like lithium may actually be “neuroprotective” — i.e., might actually help a developing brain.) And while it is wildly unclear whether this picture of prevention will ever become a reality, Chang says he is a believer, and his hope is infectious.Whatever the case, a synthesis is likely to emerge in the coming years. “There’s contention about lots of major scientific issues,” Leibenluft of the National Institute of Mental Health said. “People do the research and gradually, the data speak.”Shortly after my last visit with James (who has begun boarding school and is doing well), I went back to Pittsburgh to meet Phia and Lucas at an appointment with Axelson. It was a beautiful day at the end of May, and the children were noticeably calmer than during my last visit to their doctor; Lucas sat quietly, making sketches of scenes from “Speed Racer” and “Star Wars” with a marker. Phia also made a sketch: two wavy lines, a pink one labeled “Am Now” and a purple line entitled “Should Be.” It was a mood chart. The lines were nearly superimposed.Lucas, Phia and Marie all agreed that the two children were doing wonderfully. Phia had kept her cool even when she forgot to bring the music for a violin concert she was performing in. Lucas described a school project involving spring trees and talked fondly about his friend across the fence. Marie looked different; in the two months since I’d seen her, she had braces put on her teeth, updated her eyeglass prescription and had her first haircut in three years.“We haven’t been to this spot before,” Marie said. “I have a hopefulness that there will be more to come.”She and her husband bought a small grill, she told me, something they had never been able to do because the kids were too impulsive. And they hired an evening baby-sitter — another first — to go out on their anniversary.“This is the goal, where we’d like to be,” Axelson said, shaking everyone’s hands as they left the office. “Hopefully we’ll be able to stay with this.”Three months later, in mid-August, I heard from Marie that after more symptoms of mania in Lucas (which included opening the car door while it was moving), and increases in his Abilify, Axelson had finally recommended a move to lithium. Lucas had begun with a small dose — less than half what Phia was taking — but Marie had a feeling it would be gradually raised, as Phia’s had been since that first appointment I was present for in March.She wrote to me in an e-mail message: “I re-experience some mourning or grieving for the kids with each medicine change. The unknowns are so daunting and somehow I feel so guilty for taking such risks. Putting them to bed at night seems to be the worst time for these feelings. I suppose because at that time they seem to be their youngest and most trusting and vulnerable. I pray for them under my breath.”'"
"'08-09-14,'0','That phase of his career, he admits, went on longer than planned: “It was hard to get off the treadmill.”Course-correcting yet again, Mr. Wang now returns to his first principles, even as he tries out some new tricks, with two of his most intimate films, “A Thousand Years of Good Prayers” and “The Princess of Nebraska,” both based on stories by the Chinese-born author Yiyun Li (like Mr. Wang, a Bay Area resident).“I felt I should go back to something smaller, more personal, something about the Chinese-American community,” he said. “Walking around Chinatown now, you feel how the community has changed, which has to do with the new immigrants and how China has changed.”In “A Thousand Years,” opening Friday, a Chinese widower arrives in an American suburb for an extended stay with his divorced daughter, who has lived in the States since college and who resents her father’s intrusions into her private affairs. “The Princess of Nebraska,” which is being distributed free on the Web starting Oct. 17 (youtube.com/ytscreeningroom), concerns a newer arrival, a young woman from Beijing attending a university in Omaha who has traveled to San Francisco to get an abortion.Both films are subtle updates of the immigrant story, revealing the complexities beyond the customary themes of alienation and assimilation. Mr. Wang’s own biography is hardly typical. Born in Hong Kong — and named after his father’s favorite movie star, John Wayne — he moved to California in the late ’60s for school. His parents, who were Christians, arranged for him to stay with a Quaker family, who turned out to be prominent radicals. “There were crazy meetings with Black Panthers and anti-draft protesters, and Jerry Garcia and his people were there all the time,” Mr. Wang said. “My eyes were completely opened.”The initial plan, medical school, was soon abandoned in favor of the arts, a decision that did not please his father, a garment manufacturer. The relationship came under strain again in the ’80s when Mr. Wang married Cora Miao, an actress, without telling his parents. (“We didn’t want a banquet,” he said.) But because Ms. Miao was a celebrity in Hong Kong, they soon found out via the gossip columns.The standoff in “A Thousand Years” between traditional parents and Westernized offspring, negotiating each other’s expectations and boundaries, holds personal resonance for Mr. Wang. He recalled a visit from his father shortly after the wedding: “One night he said to us, ‘How did you think you could get married with only $3,000 in your bank account?’ Clearly he’d been going through our things.”Parent-child relationships figure prominently in Mr. Wang’s work. “Dim Sum,” “Joy Luck Club” and “Anywhere but Here” (1999) revolve around mother-daughter bonds; “Smoke” is about the search for a surrogate father. The rote psychological explanation would be that Mr. Wang is working through his relationship with his father, who died a few years ago. But it could also be, he suggested, because he and his wife do not have children.“I don’t think I idealize parent-child relationships,” he said, “but maybe I’m interested in that conflict because I don’t have my own conflicts.” Besides returning him to familiar themes “A Thousand Years” was an opportunity to indulge in a more contemplative pace, a luxury he forfeited on his Hollywood films. “The Princess of Nebraska,” on the other hand, was an outlet for his experimental side, responsible for films like “Life Is Cheap ... but Toilet Paper Is Expensive” (1989), a rambunctious Hong Kong-set shaggy-dog thriller.By habit Mr. Wang works efficiently, to the point of turning projects into two-for-one deals. With time to spare after wrapping “Smoke,” he dashed off “Blue in the Face,” a freewheeling companion piece. “Princess of Nebraska” came about when he finished under budget on “A Thousand Years” and convinced his producers that he could fill out a double bill.With “Princess” he was keen to capture the particularities of younger Chinese immigrants, whom he jokingly called an “alien” species. (He is prone to goofy jokes, and his laugh, an infectious, high-pitched guffaw, is perhaps his most distinctive trait.) “They’re Westernized but also ethnocentric,” he said. “Princess” also serves as a bridge between two generations of Chinese-American filmmakers. In search of a younger collaborator for this micro-budgeted film, Mr. Wang approached the Center for Asian American Media in San Francisco and was introduced to Richard Wong, who had just directed a well-reviewed first feature, “Colma: The Musical.”Mr. Wong, 31, was the cinematographer on “Princess,” which was shot on consumer-grade digital video, and is credited as co-director. “It must have been liberating for Wayne to do something so guerrilla, where you could make every decision on the fly,” Mr. Wong said.Mr. Wang sees a younger version of himself in Mr. Wong. “There’s a rebellious creativity there,” he said, “and he brought that out of me.”At his age Mr. Wang admits that he is increasingly wary of the traps of fogeyism. “In some ways I’m getting more conservative, but it’s also part of my makeup to take risks, and I hope I never lose that,” he said. “I never wanted to get old and become one of those 50-year-old guys who are comfortable doing whatever they’re doing.”'"

With a gung-ho supporting cast and nutty songs wittily staged by Stuart Ross, all you can do is wonder, How did this thing fail so badly the first time around?Don’t blame George S. Irving, who played several roles in the original (which was called “So Long, 174th Street” and closed after 16 performances) and reprises them here in his mid-80s. At a preview performance last week his rendition of the ludicrously ribald “Butler’s Song” nearly stopped the show.But several other numbers had the audience howling as well, among them a duet by Mr. Grisetti and Allison Spratt danced, as it were, on rolling office chairs and a mock-sultry tune called “The Man I Can Love” lasciviously sung by Janine LaManna.Ms. Spratt and Ms. LaManna play two of the women inexplicably attracted to Mr. Grisetti’s geeky character, David Kolowitz, who is as inexperienced in sex as he is in acting. Mr. Grisetti’s comic timing is exquisite as he reacts to the ladies’ attentions and to the tirades of his frustrated acting teacher (Mr. Irving).It’s not just Mr. Grisetti; everyone’s comic timing here is spot-on. The show’s book, based on a Carl Reiner novel, is adapted by Joseph Stein from his own straight play (which did not flop on Broadway, running for a year in the 1960s). The songs, by Stan Daniels, don’t have much more on their mind than laughs, and they get them.The cast plays it all with a fearless glee, which is why it works so well. Old story? Old-style jokes?

"'08-09-15,'0','A nation more polarized than I’ve ever seen in my career. And a culture in Washington where the very few wealthy and powerful have a seat at the table and everybody else is on the menu.Eight years later, we have another Republican nominee who’s telling us the exact same thing:This time it will be different, it really will. This time he’s going to put country before party, to change the tone, reach across the aisle, change the Republican Party, change the way Washington works.We’ve seen this movie before, folks. But as everyone knows, the sequel is always worse than the original.If we forget this history, we’re going to be doomed to repeat it -- with four more just like the last eight, or worse. If you’re ready for four more years of George Bush, John McCain is your guy.Just as George Herbert Walker Bush was nicknamed “Bush 41” and his son is nicknamed as “Bush 43,” John McCain could easily become known as “Bush 44.”The campaign a person runs says everything about the way they’ll govern. The McCain-Palin campaign decided to bet the house -- decided to bet the house -- on the politics perfected by Karl Rove. Those tactics may be good at squeaking by in an election, but they are bad if you want to lead one nation, indivisible.Ladies and gentlemen, I count John McCain as a personal friend. I’ve known him since before he was a Senator. If he needed my personal help, I’d go. He served our country bravely, nobly. But folks, America needs more than a great solider, they need a wise leader.Take a hard look at the positions John McCain has taken for the past 26 years, on the economy, on health care, on foreign policy, and you’ll see why I say that John McCain is just four more years of George Bush. On the issues that you talk about around the kitchen table, Mary’s college tuition, the cost of the MRI for mom, heating our home this winter -- John McCain is profoundly out of touch.Senator McCain has confessed, quote, “It’s easy for me to go to Washington and frankly, be somewhat divorced from the day-to-day challenges people have.” And he’s right, if all you do is walk the halls of power, all you hear are the wants of the powerful.I believe that’s why Senator McCain could say with a straight face, as recently as this morning, and I quote “the fundamentals of our economy are strong.” That, “We’ve made great progress economically” during the Bush years. But friends, I could walk from here to Lansing, and I wouldn’t run into a single person who thought our economy was doing well, unless I ran into John McCain.John McCain just doesn’t seem to understand what middle class people are going through today. I don’t doubt that he cares. He just doesn’t think that we have any responsibility to help people who are hurting.My dad used to have an expression: “Don’t tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I’ll tell you what you value.”By that measure, John McCain doesn’t stand with the middle class. He stands with George Bush firmly in the corner of the wealthy and well-connected. He stands with the CEO of Exxon-Mobil, who, while testifying before my Senate judiciary committee swore to me under oath that Exxon-Mobil didn’t need the tax breaks they’d been given to explore for oil.John McCain is so firmly in their corner he thinks the Exxon-Mobils of the world should get an additional $4 billion dollars a year in tax cuts.He stands in the corner of the wealthiest Americans by extending tax cuts for people making over a quarter million dollars a year, and then adding more than $300 billion on top of that for corporations and the wealthy.There is simply no daylight – at least none I can see -- between John McCain and George Bush.On every major challenge we face, from the economy, to health care, to education and Iraq, you can barely tell them apart.Don’t take my word for it, look at the record. Ninety percent of the time, John McCain votes with George Bush.When George Bush called for Social Security to be privatized, John McCain stood with him – he even campaigned for that roundly rejected plan.When George Bush says that the government has no obligation to re-train or provide extended unemployment benefits for people who have lost their jobs due to trade agreements,John McCain echoes that view, and has said that Bush is “Right on trade… absolutely.”When George Bush said we shouldn’t investigate why the government’s response to Hurricane Katrina was so incompetent, John McCain stood with him.When George Bush initially opposed a new GI Bill that would send a new generation of veterans to college, John McCain stood with him, calling Senator Webb’s effort too generous.When George Bush blocked our efforts to provide health care to another 3.8 million children, John McCain stood with him.And when, in early 2007, George Bush suggested that the health care benefits you get through your employer should be taxed as income, John McCain stood with him. And now, ladies and gentlemen, John McCain has resurrected that idea, and made it an essential part of his health care plan.Issue after issue, vote after vote, the story is the same.In the last 16 years, he’s voted 23 times against the renewable energy – wind, solar, biofuels -- we need to free ourselves from foreign oil.Since he arrived in the Senate over 20 years ago, he’s voted more than 19 times against the minimum wage.In 1994, I wrote and we passed a Crime bill that put 100,000 new police officers on the street, 3,300 of them here in Michigan, provided shelters and security for tens of thousands of battered women, and helped lead to an eight year drop in violent crime. John opposed the crime bill and the Violence Against Women Act it contained, calling them “ineffective” and “ill conceived.”Time and again John voted against increased funding for Pell grants to help families with incomes under $55,000 send their kids to college.Time and again, John McCain voted to make it harder for women to achieve equal pay for the same work – making it harder to prove, and punish, discrimination. He even voted against a study to determine if there is a gap between what men and women are paid. Twice.Governor Palin says all senators do is vote. Well, just imagine what the country would look like if John’s votes had become the law of the land.In John McCain’s America, we wouldn’t guarantee that more of energy would come from wind, solar, and other renewables. The minimum wage would still be $3.35 an hour. There would have been 100,000 fewer police on the beat. There would have been no national domestic violence hotline for the 1.5 million women who were in crisis and needed somewhere to turn.Over 160,000 members of the Guard and Reserve who answered their country’s call and served more than one tour in Iraq or Afghanistan would get no credit towards an education for their additional sacrifice. Fewer parents would be able to afford to send their kids to college. And women who were discriminated against on the basis of pay would more difficulty making their case. Thank God that’s not the America we live in.John McCain recently said: “the issue of economics is not something I’ve understood as well as I should.” Then he proved it by the advisors he chose to surround him – advisors who have further cocooned him from the reality facing the rest of us. People like Phil Gramm. The man who wrote John McCain’s economic plan actually said, repeatedly, that we’re not going through an economic recession. Phil Gramm says it’s just a mental recession. That we’re a nation of whiners.Tell that to my friend who flew jets for the Navy and then went to work for a commercial airline for over 20 years – only to see his pension wiped out while his CEO got a golden parachute. Don’t tell me that he is a whiner.Don’t tell me that the woman I met in Missouri who worked for the Chrysler plant for 13 years making minivans and lost her job when production moved to Canada is a whiner.Don’t tell me that an engineer who sees his job go overseas because his company has been given a tax break to leave instead of one to stay is a whiner.Don’t tell me that these people, people who are our nation’s heart and soul – deserve to be treated as economic scapegoats.These people worked hard, they did everything right, and they’re willing to work hard again. But instead of their government supporting them, their government walked away from them. Nobody stood up for them.What is John’s response to the state of the economy? Let me quote him: “A lot of this is psychological.” Let me tell you something: Losing your job is more than a state of mind.It means staring at the ceiling at night thinking that you may lose your house because you can’t get next month’s mortgage payment. It means looking at your pregnant wife and not knowing how you’re going to come up with the money to pay for the delivery of your child, since you don’t have health care anymore. It means looking at your child when they come home from college at Christmas and saying “Honey, I’m sorry, we’re not going to be able to send you back next semester.” It’s not a state of mind. It’s a loss of dignity.When you and your economic advisors are so out of touch, it’s no surprise that your economic policies ignore the challenges that normal families face.Let me just give you one more example. In the midst of this housing crisis, John McCain said, “I will fight for those that lost their… real estate investments.” He went on to say, “It's not the role of government to bail out big banks or small borrowers.” What about small borrowers? What about homeowners? What about the people who don’t invest in homes, but live in them? There’s an important distinction between the predators and the preyed upon.I heard that a Republican County Chairman right here in Michigan said that they’re keeping a list of foreclosed homes, suggesting that if you’ve lost your home, you should also lose your vote. I have a different idea. I think that if you’re worried about losing your home, you should vote for the guys who are going to help you keep it!Whatever happened to the guy, who once denounced tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans in a time of war as immoral.When someone running for election changes his views to satisfy the base of the party, that’s not change, that’s just more of the same Washington game. The problem is that in the Washington game today, the American people are losing.Ladies and Gentlemen, as of today, there are 50 days until Election Day. That’s just seven more weeks to talk about the direction we’re going to take this country, to talk about the issues of concern in your lives, to talk about you. But as his campaign manager has said, and I quote, “This election is not about issues.”When Senator McCain was subjected to unconscionable, scurrilous attacks in his 2000 primary campaign, I called him on the phone to ask what I could do. And now, some of the very same people and the tactics he once deplored his campaign now employs. The same campaign that once called for a town hall a week is now launching a low blow a day.Barack and I can take it. That’s not what bothers me.It bothers me that -- as one media watchdog put it -- John’s recent commercial is the, “latest in a number that resort to a dubious disregard for the facts.” As another news organization put it: The wheels have come off the straight talk express.But what really bothers me, is that every punch thrown at us --- is an attempt to distract you. And they can be plenty distracting.Like the McCain advertisements that misrepresent a vote by Barack Obama to protect young children from sexual predators. Like Senator McCain’s effort to obscure the fact that Barack Obama’s tax cuts will benefit 95 percent of all working people. Like John McCain’s attempt to cloak himself in reform by misrepresenting his running mate’s record.It’s disappointing to me to think that John McCain really does approve this message.Every false debate we’re drawn into is a real conversation we don’t have with the American people. Character attacks get media attention, but they make this election about us when it really needs to be about you.Barack Obama believes that progress in this country is measured by how many people have a decent job where they’re shown respect. How many people can pay their mortgage. How many people can turn their ideas into a new business. How many people can turn to their kids and say “It’s going to be okay” with the knowledge that the opportunities they give will be better than the ones they received.That’s the American dream. That’s what the people in my neighborhood grew up believing. And I want our kids to have the same dream.Barack Obama starts from that vision of progress and will do what it takes to get us there.That’s why his tax cuts - benefit the middle class. That’s why he’ll make it easier for families to afford college for their kids. That’s why he says everyone should be able to have the same health care that members of Congress have. That’s why his energy plan will reduce our dependence on foreign oil, bring down gas prices, and, in the process, we’ll create five million new green jobs. Those are the changes we need.Yes, this campaign is about change, but it’s about even more than that. It’s about what we value as a people. It’s not just about a job, it’s about dignity. It’s not just about a paycheck. It’s about pride. It’s not just about opportunity. It’s about respect. That’s why Barack and I are in this race.We know we need change if we’re to restore dignity, pride, and respect. We know America’s best days are ahead of us, and we know why we’re here.We’re here for the for the cops and firefighters, the teachers and assembly line workers, the engineers and office workers, the small business owners and the retiree.All of the folks who play by the rules, work hard, and do what is asked of them. They deserve a government as good and an economy as strong as they are.We’re all are Americans. There has never been a challenge too great. The stakes have never been higher.My father always told me, “Champ, when you get knocked down, get up. Get up.” It’s time to get up. It’s time to trust the grit and determination of the American people. America is ready. You are ready. I am ready. And Barack Obama is ready. Our best days are yet to come.May god bless America and may God protect our troops.'"

"'08-09-15,'0','The long-anticipated study, financed by the National Institute of Mental Health, is the most rigorous, head-to-head trial of the drugs in children and adolescents with this disorder. About three million Americans suffer from schizophrenia, and perhaps 40 percent first show symptoms in their teens or earlier.“This is really a landmark study, because these newer drugs have been around for 12 years or so now, and there were fundamental questions for which we really didn’t have answers,” said Dr. Sanjiv Kumra, director of the division of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved in the study.Dr. Kumra said the results revealed significant differences in the drugs’ side effects that should help doctors and patients choose among them.“What this is saying is that all treatments work, at least for some people, and have serious risks for others,” he said. “It’s a trial-and-error process” to match people with the right medication.Dr. Jon McClellan of the University of Washington, a co-author of the new study and of the current guidelines for treating childhood schizophrenia, said in a telephone interview that older schizophrenia drugs should now be considered as an alternative in some cases.“Some of the children in this study gained 15 pounds or more in eight weeks,” Dr. McClellan said. “That’s as much as adults gain in a year on these medications. Children are especially susceptible to these side effects, and this has broad implications across the board, for the use of these agents to treat any disorder.”Studies have found that more than 80 percent of prescriptions for atypical antipsychotics for children are to treat something other than schizophrenia, like autism-related aggression, bipolar disorder or attention-deficit problems. Some of these are approved uses; others are not.The researchers, led by Dr. Linmarie Sikich of the University of North Carolina, recruited 119 young people, ages 8 to 19, who suffer from psychotic symptoms. The children received either Zyprexa, Risperdal or molindone, an older drug used to blunt psychosis. Neither the young patients nor the doctors treating them knew which drug was being taken, but the researchers told the youngsters and their parents that, if the medication was not working out, the family could switch to another one.After eight weeks, 34 percent of the children taking Zyprexa, 46 percent of those on Risperdal, and 50 percent of those receiving molindone showed significant improvement.But by that time so many of the patients had stopped taking the drug they were on that it was not clear that those differences were significant. Many had gained a lot of weight: an average of about nine pounds for those in the Risperdal group, and 13 pounds in the Zyprexa group.Both groups also showed changes in cholesterol and insulin levels that are risk factors for diabetes. Those taking molindone gained less than a pound, on average, and had little metabolic changes.“I thought the extra weight was putting a lot of pressure on me,” said Brandon Constantineau, 18, a study participant in Wilmington, N.C., who gained 35 pounds while taking Risperdal for several months. “Kids at school were making fun of me, all that. I knew I had to get rid of it. I exercised a lot, but it didn’t happen until I changed drugs.”Mr. Constantineau said he was now doing well on a medication not offered in the study.Dr. Sikich, the study’s lead researcher, said, “One implication of this study is that the guidelines for treating schizophrenia need to be revised, so that some of the milder, traditional or older medications are considered first-line treatments in some cases.” She added: “The other significant thing is that none of these medications were as well tolerated as we had hoped. We really need to find better alternatives.”Spokesmen for Eli Lilly and Janssen said that their drugs were not approved to treat schizophrenia in children and that, given the limited number of options for such patients, there was a need for new therapies.Jamaison Schuler, a spokesman for Eli Lilly, pointed out that the new study, at eight weeks in length, had not lasted long enough to pick up the most worrisome side effect associated with the older drugs: Parkinson’s-like movement problems, which are often irreversible. Patients in the study taking molindone also took another drug to reduce this risk.Beginning in the early 1990s, psychiatrists turned to the newer drugs in large part to spare their patients those problems. Several large studies since then have shown that that shift — while perhaps sparing some patients movement problems — has had a cost.A landmark comparison of older and newer drug in adults with schizophrenia, published in 2005, had findings similar to the new report. Most patients in the earlier study stopped taking the drug they were put on, and some of the medications were associated with rapid weight gain and other problems.“I think the reason the use of these newer drugs has gone up so fast is that there was this widespread assumption that they were safer and more effective than what we had before,” Dr. McClellan said. “Well, we’re seeing now that that’s not the whole story.”'"
"'08-09-15,'0','Will the U.S. financial system collapse today, or maybe over the next few days? I don’t think so — but I’m nowhere near certain. You see, , a major investment bank, is apparently about to go under. And nobody knows what will happen next.To understand the problem, you need to know that the old world of banking, in which institutions housed in big marble buildings accepted deposits and lent the money out to long-term clients, has largely vanished, replaced by what is widely called the “shadow banking system.” Depository banks, the guys in the marble buildings, now play only a minor role in channeling funds from savers to borrowers; most of the business of finance is carried out through complex deals arranged by “nondepository” institutions, institutions like the late lamented — and Lehman.The new system was supposed to do a better job of spreading and reducing risk. But in the aftermath of the housing bust and the resulting mortgage crisis, it seems apparent that risk wasn’t so much reduced as hidden: all too many investors had no idea how exposed they were.And as the unknown unknowns have turned into known unknowns, the system has been experiencing postmodern bank runs. These don’t look like the old-fashioned version: with few exceptions, we’re not talking about mobs of distraught depositors pounding on closed bank doors. Instead, we’re talking about frantic phone calls and mouse clicks, as financial players pull credit lines and try to unwind counterparty risk. But the economic effects — a freezing up of credit, a downward spiral in asset values — are the same as those of the great bank runs of the 1930s.And here’s the thing: The defenses set up to prevent a return of those bank runs, mainly deposit insurance and access to credit lines with the , only protect the guys in the marble buildings, who aren’t at the heart of the current crisis. That creates the real possibility that 2008 could be 1931 revisited.Now, policy makers are aware of the risks — before he was given responsibility for saving the world, was one of our leading experts on the economics of the Great . So over the past year the Fed and the Treasury have orchestrated a series of ad hoc rescue plans. Special credit lines with unpronounceable acronyms were made available to nondepository institutions. The Fed and the Treasury brokered a deal that protected Bear’s counterparties — those on the other side of its deals — though not its stockholders. And just last week the Treasury seized control of and , the giant government-sponsored mortgage lenders.'"
"'08-09-15,'0','The Energy Department said it would release more than 300,000 barrels of reserves from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to refiners, and indicated that it would help to keep supplies going to refineries that were still running. But oil companies said power outages at refineries and pipelines and at hundreds of gasoline stations around the Gulf area were going to make distribution of fuel difficult for awhile.Refiners began to send crews as early as Saturday afternoon to visit refineries along the coast after Hurricane Ike passed quickly through the area. Preliminary reports indicated that the refineries in Texas did not suffer significant flooding or other damage, but company officials said they did not want to speculate about how long it would take to resume normal operations.It will also take time for companies to fly over and board hundreds of oil and gas platforms on the Gulf that were jostled by Hurricane Ike’s extensive wake and gusts. The United States Minerals Management Service reported that at least 10 platforms — out of 3,800 in the Gulf — had been destroyed. At least two oil drilling rigs broke loose from their moorings. There has been no estimate yet of any environmental damages.Platforms and other production facilities around the Gulf account for about 25 percent of domestic oil production and nearly 15 percent of domestic natural gas output.“We don’t even know when we can start the restart process, let alone how long the restart process will take,” said Bill Day, a spokesman for Valero Energy, the country’s biggest refiner. Valero has three big refineries in Houston, Port Arthur, Tex., and Texas City, Tex., that have been closed since a few days before the hurricane made landfall as a Category 2 storm Saturday morning.Mr. Day said that crewmen had not found any serious structural damage at the three facilities, but there was no power for the Texas City and Port Arthur refineries because of a regional blackout. Meanwhile none of the three facilities have adequate fresh water supplies to generate steam because the storm surge pushed salt water through the region’s waterways.Since most of the Houston refineries are clustered in a small area, are supplied by the same utilities and most are expected to face similar problems.Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, “We are looking at another week or eight or nine days before refineries are up and going, so refined gasoline is going to be in a shortage situation because of the power outages and flooding.”“It is going to be felt for the next week that we have gasoline shortages,” Ms. Hutchison said, “so people need to be prepared for that.”The disruptions come as drivers were just getting used to lower gasoline prices.Just before Hurricane Gustav hit Louisiana on the Labor Day weekend, the national average for a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline was $3.69, more than 40 cents below the highs in July. Gasoline prices had fallen sharply until the last few days mainly because oil prices have dropped since early summer by more than $40 dollars a barrel to about $100, about the level at the beginning of the year.Crude prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange declined again on Sunday by more than 2 percent, to $99.70 a barrel a six-month low, as traders continued to view declining economic trends as more important than an active hurricane season. Declining oil prices mean that once the disruption subsides, gas prices could easily drop as quickly as they are now rising.Hurricanes Gustav and Ike are the first major challenge to Gulf oil operations since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita of 2005, which crippled more than 100 production platforms, disrupted refinery operations and sent oil and gas prices rising for weeks.'"
"'08-09-15,'0','So much did his campaign catch on that Mr. Squadron was endorsed not only by his former boss, Mr. Schumer, but also by Mr. Bloomberg; Scott Stringer, the Manhattan borough president; and United States Representative Anthony D. Weiner. And the Working Families Party made his election a priority, dispatching hundreds of campaign volunteers.Mr. Squadron grew up in Riverdale, in the Bronx, and traces his interest in politics to his father, Howard M. Squadron, a powerful lawyer who mixed a thriving practice with liberal politics, support for the arts and a highly visible role in civic affairs and national Jewish groups. His father, who died in 2001, was president of the American Jewish Congress and an adviser to former Mayor David N. Dinkins.“He really had this belief that I have internalized,” said Mr. Squadron. “He believed that just because something is a certain way, it doesn’t mean that you don’t go out there and fight to change the way it is.”A Yale graduate, Mr. Squadron majored in American studies with a focus on race (he spent time studying the political history of black officials elected in cities with largely white populations).After school, he landed a job as an aide to Mr. Schumer, who said he grew so impressed with the young man that he asked Mr. Squadron to assist him in writing his book, “Positively American: Winning Back the Middle Class Majority One Family at a Time.”Mr. Schumer called him a “practical idealist.” He defined that as “someone who keeps his ideals, but is not so pie-in-the-sky that he can’t get things done. He doesn’t think he’s better or morally superior than somebody else. And I think that’s the best type of person to have in politics.”After leaving Mr. Schumer’s office, Mr. Squadron worked as a spokesman for the campaign to pass the Transportation Bond Act. He then traveled to southern Africa to do independent research on providing microfinance services for the poor. He decided to run for State Senate, he said, because “I felt that I could make a difference in the area where my girlfriend and I decided to call home.”During the campaign he was criticized by Mr. Connor for not disclosing information about his stock holdings.Mr. Squadron said he had released his tax returns “and every important financial disclosure statement that I have, and I pledge to do that every year that I’m in office.” His stock holdings, he said, were part of what was left to him in his father’s estate, and essentially were in a blind trust. “I was criticized for not releasing stock information that I don’t have,” he added.Although he faces a Republican opponent in November, John G. Chromczak, a medical technologist, Mr. Squadron’s primary victory in the heavily Democratic district is considered tantamount to winning the election.Mr. Squadron said he believed that despite the prospect of being a freshman member of a legislative body that values seniority, he would find ways to be effective.“I won’t have the seniority and I have a lot to learn,” he said. “But I hope that the message that I had in the campaign and the way I ran my race will be looked at by my colleagues as significant.”Mr. Squadron added: “There is something important about the democratic process that happened here. It wasn’t about institutional support. It was about, at its basic level, me going out and talking to a lot of people and people being excited. And that is what can make someone a new state senator.”'"
"'08-09-15,'0','He arrived early Saturday to the big leagues at its biggest stage, making a beeline toward Yankee Stadium and capturing the moment and images on his cellphone. That was not enough, so David Price also arrived early Sunday to sneak another peek, this time at Monument Park.It followed simple order that Price, the Tampa Bay Rays’ No. 1 overall selection in last year’s amateur draft, would make his major league debut early and for the long haul in Sunday’s 8-4 loss to the Yankees.With Rays starter Edwin Jackson allowing six runs and recording only six outs, a wobbly-kneed, strong-armed, emotion-filled Price jogged onto the mound to take over in the third inning.“I felt like I was about to fall off the mound there,” Price said.He didn’t. Instead, Price retired the side in order, and did the same the next inning, firing a fastball that often crackled into the mid-90s.In the fifth inning, Derek Jeter welcomed Price into the Stadium’s record books. Jeter tied Lou Gehrig for most hits at Yankee Stadium with his 1,269th, a home run to lead off the fifth inning.'"
"'08-09-15,'0','SIMI VALLEY, Calif. — In life they shared little else but the place they called home, and in their diverse stories, they defined it.Of the 25 people who were killed when a Metrolink commuter train collided with a freight locomotive on Friday afternoon in the Chatsworth area northwest of downtown Los Angeles, at least eight were from Simi Valley, a quiet community a few miles west of the wreck site known for its horse ranches and the Ronald Reagan Library and Museum.There were the 59-year-old mechanic on his regular commute and the immigrant from Cambodia who had taken a rare train trip into Los Angeles for an eye appointment. There was the police officer who specialized in catching drug suspects and had once shaved her hair to donate to cancer patients, and there was a tower manager from the Bob Hope Airport in Burbank.There were the reclusive mail clerk who grew animated around his tiny nieces and nephews, and the gregarious pre-med student who took the train home from college to please his mother. Normally she picked him up in Los Angeles; on Friday, he wanted to save her the trip.The stories and photographs of the dead from Simi Valley and the surrounding Ventura County towns reflect the diversity and expansiveness of Southern California, a stretch of coastal land that on Sunday was dotted with grief and shock.“It has affected everyone,” Pat McCoy, a pastor at the Cornerstone Church, said about the crash in which 135 passengers were injured, 40 of them critically, in one of the nation’s worst-ever commuter rail crashes. “We take community seriously here.”A Cornerstone parishioner, Walter Fuller, died in the crash, and an exchange student from Africa who had often helped with the church’s musical worship suffered a brain injury and is in a coma, Mr. McCoy said.By late Saturday afternoon 35 parishioners had descended on Mr. Fuller’s home to comfort his widow, Jenny. “They were there to pray with her, to be with her, to love on her,” he said. “She is remarkably strong and has a lot of faith. She knows her husband is in heaven now and that gives her some comfort.”At house after house in this area, ashen-faced family members answered doors, still unable to comprehend that the mundane choice of the northbound 111 Train on Friday afternoon had proved deadly. Many victims were in the train’s first car.“He was a loving father and grandfather,” said Kong Chao, 38, remembering his father, Yi Chao, 71, who was on his way home from an appointment with an eye doctor. The family emigrated from Cambodia in 1982, Mr. Chao said, “and he took care of me when my mom was not around during my life here in the U.S.” His father dreamed of traveling back to Cambodia and China, and passed his mornings in a nearby park, walking.After the wreck, Mr. Chao built an altar in his home next to a picture of his father, with small chili peppers and sweets and burning candles. “He missed Cambodia,” he said.A few miles away, a steady line of cars pulled up to the Vyas residence. Women in saris and men with their faces twisted in grief came to visit with the family of Atul Vyas, 20, pre-med student in Los Angeles. As a high school valedictorian, family joker and lover of video games and basketball, “his choices were endless,” said his cousin, Ruchi Agarwal. He chose Claremont McKenna College, Ms. Agarwal said, in large part to be near to his family.“I think he wanted to pursue something where he would help others,” Ms. Agarwal said of Mr. Vyas, the younger of two sons, who had begun to peruse his many medical school offers. His coming home for the weekend gave his parents pleasure, and his younger cousin, Sameer Gupta, 12, would come from San Jose to be with him. “He was extremely warm,” Ms. Agarwal said, “kind of jovial, brilliant of course. He could light up the room.”Michael Hammersley, 45, lived in the house where he grew up with four siblings, keeping his mother company. He worked as a mail clerk at City Hall and spent most of his time steeped in his collection of science fiction movies and books, said his sister, Beth Tellefsen. “He loved his nieces and nephews,” she said. “He was a totally different person around them.”Spree Desha, 35, was a Los Angeles police officer, recently assigned to the Office of Operations at the department’s headquarters downtown from her beat in Hollywood. Ms. Desha was known to seize the initiative, organizing a cancer fund-raiser in the office, for which she and other officers shaved their heads for donations, a department spokeswoman, Karen Smith, said.A high school English teacher and assistant pastor at a church in nearby Moorpark, Paul Long, 56, was known to many in Simi Valley. He found himself on the train after a long flight from South Carolina, where he had attended his mother’s funeral. “He and his wife, Karen, tried for 16 years to have children,” said Tony Amatangelo, the family’s pastor. “They finally had Devin, and Devin and Karen were everything to Paul.”An occasional speaker at church, Mr. Long often used running, a hobby, as a metaphor for life lessons.“Devin was there, talking with doctors and making decisions,” to take Mr. Long off life support on Saturday, Mr. Amatangelo said. “He was calm while other people there who had lost loved ones were hysterical. I was so impressed to watch him. He took the lessons Paul taught, Paul’s model, and carried it with him.”Maria Elena Villalobos, 18, was living her dream in Moorpark. She was a student at a fashion design school in downtown Los Angeles, and was carrying her design of a blouse to surprise a friend, Carol Becker.“Thinking about that makes me happy,” Ms. Becker said. “She was always so thoughtful.”Ms. Villalobos’ father, Gonzalo Villalobos Cedillo, described Maria, the second of his three children as “very dedicated and focused.”“She would get up at 5 a.m. and take the train from Moorpark to Los Angeles,” he said. “That takes a lot of dedication.”Standing in front of his home greeting family members who had come to offer their condolences, Mr. Villalobos said out loud to himself in Spanish, “Her car is still at the train station, just parked there.”Christopher Aiken, who lived in nearby Thousand Oaks, worked at a food service company in Glendale, and rode Metrolink daily to and from work. On Friday, he took an earlier-than-usual train home.Michele Clark, a neighbor and friend of Mr. Aiken’s for 18 years, said he had recently remarried, to a woman with twin daughters, both 15. “He had taken them on as his own,” Ms. Clark said.Ms. Clark said Mr. Aiken, who was 38, played volleyball often with his stepdaughters and enjoyed “game night” with friends in Thousand Oaks, weekly gatherings at which they played Scrabble or other board games. He also made a habit of going on picnics with his wife and daughters.“What’s hard for me is that Sharon’s daughters won’t have a father figure anymore,” Ms. Clark said. “It was a good, solid family. To have him taken away with this accident is unbelievable. They were solid.”'"
"'08-09-15,'0','Homeowners, not just in rural areas but also in the suburbs, are scrounging for wood, getting permits to cut in parks, hitting up tree-cutting crews and striking deals with neighbors.Wood and wood-burning heating stoves go through spasms of popularity whenever oil and gas prices shoot up, most recently in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina. But this year’s run-up in prices was so rapid and sustained that people started planning for the coming winter not long after last winter’s snow melted.“Sales never slowed down in May, June and July in the Northeast,” said Alan Trusler, the vice president of sales at Hearth and Home Technologies, which has doubled production of wood and pellet stoves at its factories in Pennsylvania and Washington State. “It’s really fueled by economics.”Residential heating oil prices during the coming season, October to March, are projected to average $4.13 per gallon, an increase of about 25 percent over last heating season, according to a forecast published on Tuesday by the federal Energy Information Administration. Residential natural gas prices over the same period are projected to average $14.93 per thousand cubic feet, compared with $12.72 during the last heating season, an increase of about 17 percent.Angelo and Anna Cioffi of Pleasantville, N.Y., about an hour’s drive north of Manhattan, started looking for a pellet stove in March, when fuel prices were beginning their surge. The Cioffis said their oil company offered to cap their fuel prices at $4.75 a gallon for a $200 up-front fee. If they did not ante up, the Cioffis said they were told, they could pay up to $5.25 — nearly twice the $2.79 a gallon they paid last year.So the Cioffis went to Fire Glow Distributors, whose Web site declares, “Act now and be prepared for the next heating season!” and found a Quadra-Fire pellet stove on sale. But they held off buying until June. By then, the store was sold out, so the stove will not be delivered until October at the earliest.Mr. Cioffi, who runs a handyman business called A C HomePro and plans to install the stove himself, said he expected to recoup its $3,000 cost in five years. This winter, he figures to spend about $600 for two tons of pellets, which come in 40-pound bags for $4 to $6. He will also pay whatever it costs to run the stove’s two electric fans to blow heat from the fireplace into his ranch house.According to an online calculator at the Web site for the Pellet Fuels Institute, www.pelletheat.org/3/residential/compareFuel.cfm, pellets provide twice as much heat per dollar as oil.“I hope to reduce my heating costs by half and not live like an Eskimo,” said Mr. Cioffi, who is installing a more efficient water heater, too. “We just can’t keep sending our money overseas” to oil-producing nations, he said.Mr. Cioffi is not alone in casting wood burning in patriotic terms. A cardboard sign for Dry Creek, a pellet maker, is posted in the Fire Glow store with an Uncle Sam character imploring shoppers to “start your own energy policy.” One bag of pellets, the sign says, equals “approximately 2.5 gallons of oil.”Gail Meeker, the owner of the store, said some of her customers “don’t want to pay the Arabs money.”Politics aside, Ms. Meeker has neither pellet stoves nor pellets in stock because so many customers bought stoves in the normally slow summer season instead of waiting for the thermometer to dip.Pellet stoves are very popular with new converts to wood heat because they are cleaner and easier to maintain than traditional wood stoves and include conveniences like timers and thermostats. Wood stoves take longer to heat up than pellet stoves, and their smoke emissions can sometimes violate local ordinances.But with so few pellet stoves in stock, many homeowners are now looking at wood stoves, which can cost a few hundred dollars less than a comparable pellet stove but take a lot more work. Owners have to find, chop and handle a lot of wood, and clean up the ashes the stoves create.With demand driving up prices for precut cords of wood (technically 4 feet high and wide by 8 feet long), many stove owners are taking to their neighborhood streets in search of free fuel. In the Hudson Valley, crews working for Orange and Rockland, the local utility, which removes about 20,000 cubic yards of wood and branches each year, have noticed a growing number of foragers following their trucks in hopes of a bounty.“One gentleman had a bed liner in the trunk of his Mercedes when he pulled up,” said John Cerullo, whose company, National Field Service Corporation, does trims trees for the utility. Having recovered some logs, Mr. Cerullo said, “he was smiling ear to ear.”Some towns try to prevent roadside scrounging by setting up wood-recycling depots. In Yorktown Heights, landscapers can dump their waste wood at a public works center. The town turns some of the wood into mulch, which residents grab to use in their gardens. They can also take as many of the remaining logs as they like, and lately, they have been disappearing faster and faster.Roger and Mary Muller, a retired couple who have lived in Yorktown Heights since 1972, stop by every couple of weeks for wood to fuel their stove. On a recent sunny afternoon, with the temperatures in the low 80s, Mr. Muller, 70, wielded a 14-inch chain saw to turn several logs into 25 or so manageable wood chunks. In turn, Mrs. Muller, 66, in a short-sleeved shirt and thick gloves, loaded them into the back of their red Chevy TrailBlazer.“Gas is $340 a month,” she said. “So we have a room that we close off. The wood stove keeps it nice and toasty for us.”'"
"'08-09-15,'0','At a recessionary moment, when corporations from Lehman to Merrill Lynch are casting around for a Vice President/Survival, I asked Pinnau, who’s German, what sense it makes to introduce designer M&M’s with a price tag to match.A bundle of sense, he said.The premium chocolate segment, which more than doubled in size to a $2 billion market between 2001 and 2006, is still growing “twice as fast as mainstream.” Although that year-on-year growth rate has dropped in recent months to “between 5 and 10 percent from close to 20 percent,” it remains vigorous.This is the world of “premiumization,” a buzzword among global corporations at a time when the luxury market is still expected to jump more than 70 percent to $450 billion by 2012.I’ll try to explain. Wealth is not so much diminishing, although it certainly looks that way right now on Wall Street, as it is shifting to emergent recession-resilient elites in places like , , , and . They want the same status symbols and brands the world over.But nobody likes to look like everyone else or consume the same way. The result is what marketers call a “differentiation frenzy.” It’s particularly acute because, in a postideological world, who you are is defined less by what you think — if you think at all — than by what you purchase and eat.Tell me how you shop and I’ll tell you who you are, whether in or .A differentiation frenzy spawns things like Tasmanian Rain water, which justifies its price tag (up to $25 for a 750-millileter bottle in luxury hotels) because it’s collected “just minutes from where the World Meteorological Organization records the world’s purest air.”In similar mode, you have Renova Black, a “fashionable” toilet paper; jewel-studded cell phones priced at $5,000 and up; baby strollers; Evian’s limited-release water; computer mice decorated with exquisite crystal; and of course olive oil so virgin pure the only indecent thing about it is its price.“You have more and more discerning customers looking for forms of individual expression,” Pinnau said.Individualization and customization are two other marketing buzzwords. You can now order regular M&M’s online with an image of your face on them. This enables you to eat yourself, so to speak, an act in which narcissism and individualization merge. Yum.I’d say premiumization is a pretty good emblem for our 21st-century world. The growth of a global elite is accompanied by a hollowing out of the middle. The base of the social pyramid remains large. Staples like rice and corn still sell; superluxury water (whatever that may be) sells; stuff in the middle does less well. Countries like increasingly resemble two societies: enclaves of surrounded by Santa Nada.That’s a world in which superpremium products boasting authenticity and purity (Mars practices a “bean-to-bar” quality standard) thrive even in a recession.At the start of here in New York, I went to an M&M’s Premiums event featuring , a star of “Desperate Housewives,” the mega-hit ABC series. A sexy green M&M’s character got things going — “Helloooo my darling fashionistas! Look at this year’s must-have accessory, shimmering chocolate gems!” — before Eva appeared in a sequined mocha outfit and sighed in loving supplication to Premiums as photographers oohed and aahed.“I’m not really a brand person,” she told me in an interview afterward, “but I thought, how cool, 67 years with no change in look, and now this! It’s a bit of escape, and cheaper than a Hawaiian vacation!”In a premiumized, Desperate-Houswives recession, things are a little different. Image trumps logic. Adapt or perish.'"
"'08-09-15,'0','President Bill Clinton represented a conundrum for Mr. Gore’s 2000 campaign. He had a robust record of economic achievement, but the boom had begun to fade. He retained job approval ratings well above 50 percent, but he carried the personal disgrace of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.Campaign strategists differed, then and now, on the right tactics for his vice president. Mr. Gore “should have used President Clinton all the time,” said Matthew Dowd, a top 2000 Bush campaign official. The Clinton White House shared that view.The Gore campaign did not. Mr. Clinton “had viscerally low marks with key groups of swing voters,” said a top strategist, Carter Eskew.“I saw the same numbers,” said Daron Shaw, one of Mr. Dowd’s colleagues in the Bush campaign, who agreed the Democratic candidate needed to strike a separate path.Mr. Gore did so in two ways. For his running mate he tapped Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who had blistered Mr. Clinton’s personal conduct. And when Mr. Gore spoke as “my own man” at the Democratic convention, he promised a populist fight against “powerful forces” constraining Americans’ economic future.For a while, it worked. Trailing after the Republican convention, Mr. Gore moved into an early September lead over Mr. Bush.But voters’ attention shifted toward personal contrasts that favored the genial Texas governor over the sometimes-awkward Mr. Gore. In debates, the Democrat might have alienated more voters with impatient sighs than he attracted with policy arguments.“There were not major issues driving the election,” recalled Michael Feldman, an aide to the Gore campaign. “That’s how the campaign devolved into a conversation about who you’d like to have a beer with.”Today Americans fret about the economy, fear the country is headed in the wrong direction and strongly disapprove of the Republican incumbent’s job performance. That makes Mr. McCain’s challenge “much tougher,” said Fred Steeper, a Republican pollster.Mr. McCain’s complicated history with Mr. Bush represents a mixed blessing. Battling to overcome conservatives’ distrust in the Republican nomination race, Mr. McCain embraced White House economic policies he had earlier scorned.Lately, Mr. McCain, of Arizona, has kept his physical distance from Mr. Bush, who did not even attend the Republican convention. Mr. McCain underscored that distance by reaching all the way to Alaska for Ms. Palin as his running mate and joining Mr. Obama, of Illinois, in embracing the theme of “change.”What the Republican ticket has not done, however, is break with Mr. Bush on the centerpiece issue of the economy. Ms. Palin displayed little familiarity with economic policy details in her interview last week with Charles Gibson of ABC News, but the instincts she articulated matched Mr. Bush’s preference for minimizing government’s role.“They have separated a bit but haven’t really enunciated” any shifts in policy, Mr. Dowd said. “It’s almost like their slogan is, ‘If you want a change from us, vote for us’ — or ‘We broke it, let us fix it.’ ”Thus Mr. Obama vows to hammer away at the idea that a McCain presidency would represent a third Bush term. At the same time, Mr. McCain still has 50 days to tack toward the middle, and a running mate whose popularity on the right can provide political cover.Having run against Mr. Bush once before, some Democrats also warn, Mr. McCain may retain enough credibility to shift gears and try it again.“The Obama campaign is making the Bush-McCain relationship the strategic focus of their entire campaign,” Mr. Eskew said. “This is perhaps understandable given Bush’s numbers, but it is risky.”'"
"'08-09-15,'0','SACRAMENTO (AP) — Peter M. Camejo, a Green Party leader who ran three times for governor of California and was Ralph Nader’s running mate in the 2004 presidential race, died Saturday. He was 68.Mr. Camejo, who had lymphoma, died at his home in Folsom, a suburb east of Sacramento.“Peter was a friend, colleague and politically courageous champion of the downtrodden and mistreated of the entire Western Hemisphere,” Mr. Nader said in a written statement.Mr. Camejo ran for governor in 2002, 2003 and 2006, supporting abortion rights, the legalization of marijuana, universal health care and a moratorium on the death penalty. Before joining the Green Party, he was the Socialist Workers Party nominee for president in 1976.A first-generation Venezuelan-American born in New York City, Mr. Camejo became an activist at an early age, speaking out against the Vietnam War and for the rights of migrant workers. He marched in Selma, Ala., with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Mr. Camejo is survived by his wife, Morella; a daughter, Alexandra; a son, Victor; three brothers; and three grandchildren.'"
"'08-09-15,'0','Three months ago Jacob Weisberg, the longtime editor of Slate, became the chairman of the Slate Group, a new unit of the Post Company that intends to spread the 12-year-old site’s imprint to new subjects. Mr. Weisberg will oversee The Big Money and other new sites, the first of which was The Root, introduced last February for an African-American audience. The plan is to start up one or two sites a year.The Big Money aims to be something in between authoritative print sources of business news and the myriad of newly minted business blogs. A lean editorial team will be supported by Slate’s marketing, technology and sales staff members and, like Slate, most of the site’s content will come from freelance writers.For instance, in an e-mail message on Sunday, when the main news was about the cloudy fate of Lehman Brothers, Mr. Ledbetter said the site would be “handling the Lehman saga in several ways.” There would be, he said, a summary of the coverage in Monday’s papers, a commentary by Daniel Gross about government bailouts and a column by Michael Lewis “on Lehman’s downfall as the unintended legacy of the Bear Stearns bailout.”“Depending on what happens between now and tomorrow morning, there may be more,” he added.The ambitions and the names may be big, but the market for online business news is “extremely saturated,” said Herb Greenberg, a former columnist for MarketWatch.com, The Wall Street Journal and TheStreet.com.Mr. Greenberg, who left MarketWatch to help start GreenbergMeritz Research and Analytics this year, cited the struggles of Portfolio, the business magazine published by Condé Nast, to gain traction. “Everything takes a while in media — everything,” Mr. Greenberg said.Among the other competitors cited by Mr. Ledbetter were CNNMoney.com, Forbes and Fortune. Mr. Ledbetter draws distinctions between sites like TheStreet.com, which pitch stock tips, and what he intends The Big Money to be.Rather than promising to “read us and we’ll make you rich,” Mr. Ledbetter is offering to “read us and we’ll make you smart.”Several popular Slate features, including the “Explainer” (answers to unusual questions) and “Moneybox” (financial commentary) will migrate to The Big Money. The site will also borrow Slate’s “Today’s Papers” concept, an early-morning summary of national newspapers, with “Today’s Business Press.”Infiniti, one of the site’s two initial advertisers, sponsored a preview of the business news summary on Slate in the months leading up to the financial site’s introduction. Infiniti and the other advertiser, American Express, will underwrite the site through the end of the year, when it will adapt a traditional online advertising model.While The Washington Post and Newsweek have been trimming their staffs, the (much smaller) Slate Group has expanded. Its growing family of Web sites attracts six million unique visitors a month, according to Nielsen Online.“We are investing in new sites because we think we’ve found a business model that works,” Mr. Alderman said.Building an audience will not be easy. WashingtonPost.com and Slate and will steer some users to The Big Money, and MSN will offer links to the site. Reuters will republish some of its articles.The Big Money also hopes to use technological tools to differentiate itself. One of them, a data base for socially responsible investing, will let users filter 500 companies to see if they minimize environmental damage or profit from vice.Another feature, called “We Build Your Presentation,” will offer PowerPoint slides of charts and graphs. A third, the “YouTube BrandWatch,” will show popular videos involving companies and ask users to decide whether they help or hurt the brands.The site has also established a Twitter feed called “WSJquips” that consists solely of short observations about, and corrections to, articles in The Journal.“The Facebook generation needs a business site,” Mr. Ledbetter said, “and I think we aspire to be that site.”'"
"'08-09-15,'0','You don’t need an ice cream maker to make this, but you do need a food processor. I use a banana and a small amount of honey to sweeten the yogurt. (See the banana-only variation on this recipe below.) You can serve it like soft-serve ice cream, or let it freeze solid so that it’s more like regular frozen yogurt.1. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Fill a bowl with ice and water. When the water comes to a boil, drop in the peaches and count to 30. Remove from the water and transfer directly to the ice water. Allow to cool for about a minute, then peel off the skin. Dice the peaches, and discard the pits. Place in a resealable plastic bag. Slice the banana, and place in the bag with the peaches. Freeze overnight.2. Chill a one-quart container in the freezer. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade, mix together the yogurt, honey and vanilla extract. Remove the frozen fruit from the freezer. Break up the peaches if they have frozen into a lump. Place the frozen fruit in the food processor, and pulse until it has broken up in the yogurt. Turn on the food processor, and process until the mixture is smooth, stopping the machine from time to time to make sure there are no big lumps. If there are, pulse to break up the lumps, and then continue to process the mixture until smooth. Scrape out of the food processor into the chilled container, and freeze for two hours for soft-serve frozen yogurt or four hours or longer for solid frozen yogurt. Allow to soften for 15 to 30 minutes in the refrigerator before scooping.Note: You can make this with sliced frozen peaches.Advance preparation: This will keep for two to three weeks in the freezer.4 large or 6 medium-size ripe or very ripe bananas1. Peel the bananas, cut into thick slices and freeze for 24 hours or longer, until frozen solid, in airtight bags.'"
"'08-09-15,'0','There are two drummers in the San Francisco instrumental quartet Tussle, and it’s no affectation. Sized down to one drummer, it would be a different band. Muscle or Trestle or Nuzzle. But not Tussle.This was clearer in the band’s show on Saturday night at Cakeshop than on its most recent album, “Cream Cuts” (Smalltown Supersound), where electronics play a greater role and the drummers play their thumping dance grooves in closer unison. It’s always hard to tell exactly what’s happening on a record, anyway, and this group works with that fact, using electronics as bass, triggering various sounds and samples to make up for the lack of a guitar or a singer.The drummers, Warren Huegel and Jonathan Holland, were at the front of the stage, facing each other. (Behind them were Nathan Burazer, playing electronics, and Tomonori Yasuda, playing bass and electronics.) In a loud, dense set, they sifted through heavy-rhythm music with roots in the 1970s and early ’80s. Locking together and pulling apart, they variously clamped right on top of the beat, got way behind it or positioned themselves in the middle, with high-hat patterns pumping.This is a band for people who still go to record stores by choice. For a little more than an hour it cruised around the bins: techno, disco, Afrobeat, Krautrock. In recent-music terms, Tussle sounds pitched somewhere between the bands LCD Soundsystem — the idea of a live rock group playing long disco remixes with trance-inducing repetition — and Isotope 217, performing long jams with improvisation and electronics.But Tussle was murkier, more primitive and more oblique than either. Dancing was possible, even probable, but ultimately not the point. The band doesn’t want to be too perfect, showing up its sources. At the same time, it was more idealistic than it let on. Tussle seemed to want to will its audience into a more naïve time, as if on a mission to understand what it would be like to have curious ears in 1981.'"
"'08-09-15,'0','While still on the periphery of the academic world, his volume, “Introduction to Economic Analysis,” is being used at some colleges, including Harvard and Claremont-McKenna, a private liberal arts college in Claremont, Calif..And that, in a nutshell, is a big difference between textbook publishers and the drug makers. Sure, there have been scientists with Professor McAfee’s attitude — Jonas Salk was asked who owned the patent to the polio vaccine and scoffed: “Could you patent the sun?”For the textbook makers, however, it is a different story. Professor McAfee allows anyone to download a Word file or PDF of his book, while also taking advantage of the growing marketplace for print on demand.In true economist fashion, he has allowed two companies, Lulu and Flat World Knowledge, to sell print versions of his textbook, with Lulu charging $11 and Flat World anywhere from $19.95 to $59.95. As he said on his Web site, he is keeping the multiple options to “further constrain their ability to engage in monopoly pricing.”A broader effort to publish free textbooks is called Connexions, which was the brainchild of Richard G. Baraniuk, an engineering professor at Rice University, which has received $6 million from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. In addition to being a repository for textbooks covering a wide range of subjects and educational levels, its ethic is taken from the digital music world, he said — rip, burn and mash.Unlike other projects that share course materials, notably OpenCourseWare at M.I.T., Connexions uses broader Creative Commons license allowing students and teachers to rewrite and edit material as long as the originator is credited. Teachers put up material, called “modules,” and then mix and match their work with others’ to create a collection of material for students. “We are changing textbook publishing from a pipeline to an ecosystem,” he said.Like Professor McAfee, Professor Baraniuk says he decided to share his material while writing a textbook.“If I had finished my own book, I would have finished a couple years ago,” he said. “It would have taken five years. It would have spent five years in print and sold 2,000 copies.” Instead, he said, he posted it on the Web site and there have been 2.8 million page views of his textbook, “Signals and Systems,” including a translation into Spanish.Connexions is strongest in statistics and electrical engineering — areas with technologically advanced students and a greater need to update material than, say, works on medieval history. He said there were 850,000 unique users a month, with more than 50 percent of the traffic originating from outside the United States.“It’s anyone’s guess as to when we will break through,” he said.One of the most popular Connexions contributors is Sunil Kumar Singh, a production engineer from New Delhi who works for the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India. He explains physics for precollege students, using the feedback from readers who e-mail from all over the world.“It is a two-way process,” he wrote in an e-mail message. “I, for one, have experienced difficulty during my formal study years with the best of textbooks around.” He said the new system “gives me opportunity to respond to the editing needs all the time.”While these open-source projects slowly grow, the textbook publishers have entered the online publishing field with CourseSmart, a service owned by five publishers. In service for only a year, CourseSmart allows students to subscribe to a textbook and read it online, with the option of highlighting and printing out portions of it at a time.The price is generally half of what a print book costs, a sum that can still appear staggering — an introductory economics textbook costs around $90 online. (This semester, a student has the option of downloading a book as well — but it is an either-or choice: read online or download to a computer.)Frank Lyman, executive vice president at CourseSmart, said that the company was created in response to changing times. “There wasn’t a lot of content and it was in a bunch of formats,” he said of past efforts by publishers. “There never was any momentum.”There are 4,000 textbooks currently available — about a third of the market — but the goal is to cover “50 percent of the backpack.” Without being specific, he said that tens of thousands of textbooks have been read online and that 1,240 separate institutions have a student who has made at least one e-textbook purchase.While conceding that open-source textbooks would take hold in a few subject areas, Mr. Lyman stressed that the current system would still prevail and that collaborative works online would have a hard time winning an audience.“Of all the things that are changing, one thing is consistent — the authorship model,” he said.“What doesn’t worry me is that leading experts will say I will write my own damn book and people will read it.”'"
"'08-09-15,'0','A year into the financial crisis, few dreamed that the situation would spiral down so far, so fast. Only a week ago, the Bush administration took control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the nation’s two largest mortgage finance companies. Then, before anyone could sigh a breath of relief after that crisis, Lehman was on the brink.As details of Lehman’s plight began to trickle out on Sunday, the worries deepened that big financial companies might topple like dominoes. Bank of America began discussions to buy Merrill Lynch, the nation’s largest brokerage.“I spent last weekend watching Fannie and Freddie die. This weekend it was Lehman,” said one longtime Wall Street executive.By late Sunday, a consortium of banks, working with government officials, announced a $70 billion pool of funds to lend to troubled financial companies.The rat-a-tat-tat of bad news has frayed nerves up and down Wall Street. “People are just weary,” said another executive. And even more ill tidings loom. Thousands of employees at Lehman are likely to be laid off, casting them into one of the worst Wall Street job markets in years. Other banks are cutting back, too.Even employees who manage to hold on are likely to make a lot less money this year. Bonuses are not only going to decrease; for many, they will evaporate completely.While people were stunned by the near collapse of Bear Stearns in March, they were flabbergasted that Lehman, a respected firm with a 158-year history, could be brought to its knees. Many were equally shocked by the downfall of Richard S. Fuld Jr., Lehman’s chairman and chief executive.“Everyone thought Bear Stearns was a bunch of cowboys; it made sense what happened,” said another executive. “But this is the great Dick Fuld. This is not supposed to happen to Lehman Brothers.”Many Wall Street executives struggled to draw parallels to the current crisis. The collapse of the junk bond powerhouse Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1991 seems small by comparison, as does the 1998 failure of the big hedge fund Long Term Capital Management.On Sunday, as the heads of major Wall Street banks huddled for a third day of emergency meetings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, many rank-and-file employees were at work in their offices.“It’s all hands on deck,” said one senior banker.At hedge funds, analysts worried that investors would rush to withdraw their money.As a precaution, Wall Street banks have taken the extraordinary step of hiring advisers to assess the impact of the possible bankruptcies of other big financial institutions.The mood could darken even further this week as several big Wall Street banks report what are expected to be grim quarterly results.The problems the industry faces are myriad. Mortgage assets that both commercial and investment banks hold on their balance sheets continue to decline in value as potential buyers wait for prices to fall even further and sellers balk at prices being offered. At the same time, revenues from bread and butter Wall Street businesses like debt and equity underwriting and proprietary trading are sliding in a softening economy at home and abroad.“I have not seen a quarter like this since 2001,” said Meredith Whitney, analyst at Oppenheimer. “And the expense bases at the banks are still built for 2006-style revenues. So the clash of these two things is going to produce the kind of quarter we have not seen in some time.”Some thought that Merrill Lynch’s sale of $30.6 billion worth of mortgage-related securities in July to the private equity group Lone Star for $6.7 billion (75 percent of which was provided as a loan by Merrill) would unleash a torrent of similar sales. That has not happened.Big investment groups like Pacific Investment Management Company have put together “vulture” funds worth at least $70 billion to buy distressed assets. So far, not many sales have happened amid a buyer’s strike.Part of the fear gripping Wall Street is the “who’s next” game. After the collapse of Bear Stearns it was Lehman. After Lehman, many worry about who might be next.Those who bet on a rebound in financials are getting clobbered. In March, O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, a $9 billion quantitative money management group, started investing in financials and the group continues to add to its portfolio. “We’re patient and we keep buying,” said Jim O’Shaughnessy, chairman and chief executive of the firm.Mr. O’Shaughnessy created a proxy index of financials to test the performance of previous financial stock routs and recoveries dating back to 1964. The average return for the 20 worst 12 month periods was -34.96 percent. In the last year, through June 30, his proxy index was down 31 percent.But Mr. O’Shaughnessy is betting on the rally.In the subsequent one- and three-year periods after those drastic declines, his index rose an average 30.5 percent and an annualized 19.7 percent. “Financials falling out of bed has happened in the past,” he said. “I’m interested in what happens after they crash and burn.”That strategy has not yet panned out this year. The O’Shaughnessy Dividend fund, which heavily invests in financials, is down 17.2 percent through July 30 compared with a 15.2 percent drop in the Russell 1000 value index. The three-year compounded return through July 30 is 6.5 percent, compared with 2.4 percent for the Russell 1000.By contrast, hedge funds that continue to short financials (betting their prices will fall) are still performing well. Goshen Investments, a $200 million fund seeded by Tiger Management, is up 35 percent through the end of August, according to one investor. The fund has large short positions in American brokerage firms, European banks and American exchanges. Christopher Burn, founder of the fund, declined to comment.'"
"'08-09-15,'0','It remains to be seen whether the sale of Merrill, which was worth more than $100 billion during the last year, and the controlled demise of Lehman will be enough to finally turn the tide in the yearlong financial crisis that has crippled Wall Street and threatened the broader economy.Early Monday morning, Lehman said it would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York for its holding company in what would be the largest failure of an investment bank since the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert 18 years ago, the Associated Press reported.Questions remain about how the market will react Monday, particularly to Lehman’s plan to wind down its trading operations, and whether other companies, like A.I.G. and , the nation’s largest savings and loan, might falter.Indeed, in a move that echoed Wall Street’s rescue of a big hedge fund a decade ago this week, 10 major banks agreed to create an emergency fund of $70 billion to $100 billion that financial institutions can use to protect themselves from the fallout of Lehman’s failure.The Fed, meantime, broadened the terms of its emergency loan program for Wall Street banks, a move that could ultimately put taxpayers’ money at risk.Though the government took control of the troubled mortgage finance companies and only a week ago, investors have become increasingly nervous about whether major financial institutions can recover from their losses.How things play out could affect the broader economy, which has been weakening steadily as the financial crisis has deepened over the last year, with unemployment increasing as the nation’s growth rate has slowed.What will happen to Merrill’s 60,000 employees or Lehman’s 25,000 employees remains unclear. Worried about the unfolding crisis and its potential impact on ’s economy, Mayor canceled a trip to to meet with Gov. . Instead, aides said, Mr. Bloomberg spent much of the weekend working the phones, talking to federal officials and bank executives in an effort to gauge the severity of the crisis.The weekend that humbled Lehman and Merrill Lynch and rewarded Bank of America, based in , N.C., began at 6 p.m. Friday in the first of a series of emergency meetings at the Federal Reserve building in Lower .The meeting was called by Fed officials, with Treasury Secretary in attendance, and it included top bankers. The Treasury and Federal Reserve had already stepped in on several occasions to rescue the financial system, forcing a shotgun marriage between and this year and backstopping $29 billion worth of troubled assets — and then agreeing to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The bankers were told that the government would not bail out Lehman and that it was up to Wall Street to solve its problems. Lehman’s stock tumbled sharply last week as concerns about its financial condition grew and other firms started to pull back from doing business with it, threatening its viability.Without government backing, Lehman began trying to find a buyer, focusing on , the big British bank, and Bank of America. At the same time, other Wall Street executives grew more concerned about their own precarious situation.The fates of Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers would not seem to be linked; Merrill has the nation’s largest brokerage force and its name is known in towns across America, while Lehman’s main customers are big institutions. But during the credit boom both firms piled into risky real estate and ended up severely weakened, with inadequate capital and toxic assets.Knowing that investors were worried about Merrill, , its chief executive and an alumnus of and the , and , Bank of America’s chief executive, began negotiations. One person briefed on the negotiations said Bank of America had approached Merrill earlier in the summer but Mr. Thain had rebuffed the offer. Now, prompted by the reality that a Lehman bankruptcy would ripple through Wall Street and further cripple Merrill Lynch, the two parties proceeded with discussions.On Sunday morning, Mr. Thain and Mr. Lewis cemented the deal. It could not be determined if Mr. Thain would play a role in the new company, but two people briefed on the negotiations said they did not expect him to stay. Merrill’s “thundering herd” of 17,000 brokers will be combined with Bank of America’s smaller group of wealth advisers and called Merrill Lynch Wealth Management.For Bank of America, which this year bought Countrywide Financial, the troubled mortgage lender, the purchase of Merrill puts it at the pinnacle of American finance, making it the biggest brokerage house and consumer banking franchise.Bank of America eventually pulled out of its talks with Lehman after the government refused to take responsibility for losses on some of Lehman’s most troubled real-estate assets, something it agreed to do when JP Morgan Chase bought Bear Stearns to save it from a bankruptcy filing in March.A leading proposal to rescue Lehman would have divided the bank into two entities, a “good bank” and a “bad bank.” Under that scenario, Barclays would have bought the parts of Lehman that have been performing well, while a group of 10 to 15 Wall Street companies would have agreed to absorb losses from the bank’s troubled assets, to two people briefed on the proposal said. Taxpayer money would not have been included in such a deal, they said.Other Wall Street banks also balked at the deal, unhappy at facing potential losses while Bank of America or Barclays walked away with the potentially profitable part of Lehman at a cheap price.For Lehman, the end essentially came Sunday morning when its last potential suitor, Barclays, pulled out from a deal, saying it could not obtain a shareholder vote to approve a transaction before Monday morning, something required under listing rules, one person close to the matter said. Other people involved in the talks said the Financial Services Authority, the British securities regulator, had discouraged Barclays from pursuing a deal. Peter Truell, a spokesman for Barclays, declined to comment. Lehman’s subsidiaries were expected to remain solvent while the firm liquidates its holdings, these people said. Herbert H. McDade III, Lehman’s president, was at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York late Sunday, discussing terms of Lehman’s fate with government officials.Lehman’s filing is unlikely to resemble those of other companies that seek bankruptcy protection. Because of the harsher treatment that federal bankruptcy law applies to financial-services firms, Lehman cannot hope to reorganize and survive. It was not clear whether the government would appoint a trustee to supervise Lehman’s liquidation or how big the financial backstop would be.Lehman has retained the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges as its bankruptcy counsel.The collapse of Lehman is a devastating end for , the chief executive, who has led the bank since it emerged from as a public company in 1994. Mr. Fuld, who steered Lehman through near-death experiences in the past, spent the last several days in his 31st floor office in Lehman’s midtown headquarters on the phone from 6 a.m. until well past midnight trying to save the firm, a person close to the matter said.A.I.G. will be the next test. Ratings agencies threatened to downgrade A.I.G.’s credit rating if it does not raise $40 billion by Monday morning, a step that would cripple the company. A.I.G. had hoped to shore itself up, in party by selling certain businesses, but potential bidders, including the private investment firms and TPG, withdrew at the last minute because the government refused to provide a financial guarantee for the purchase. A.I.G. rejected an offer by another investor, J. C. Flowers & Company.The weekend’s events indicate that top officials at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury are taking a harder line on providing government support of troubled financial institutions.While offering to help Wall Street organize a shotgun marriage for Lehman, both the Fed chairman, , and Mr. Paulson had warned that they would not put taxpayer money at risk simply to prevent a Lehman collapse.The message marked a major change in strategy but it remained unclear until at least Friday what would happen. “They were faced after Bear Stearns with the problem of where to draw the line,” said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor who is now vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisors, a forecasting firm. “It became clear that this piecemeal, patchwork, case-by-case approach might not get the job done.”Both Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke worried that they had already gone much further than they had ever wanted, first by underwriting the takeover of Bear Stearns in March and by the far bigger bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Outside the public eye, Fed officials had acquired much more information since March about the interconnections and cross-exposure to risk among Wall Street investment banks, hedge funds and traders in the vast market for credit-default swaps and other derivatives. In the end, both Wall Street and the Fed blinked.'"

"'08-09-16,'1','A lawyer for Rapetti, Andrew S. Fisher, said William Rapetti, the only full-time employee of the company, which serves as a consultant for contractors that erect cranes, denies wrongdoing.“We intend to defend against these citations, which we think were issued in error,” Mr. Fisher said. “And I think we will be able to establish to OSHA — assuming OSHA has an open mind — that some of the conclusions they reached, which resulted in the citations, are in error.”The collapse sent the 22-story white latticed crane crashing across a two-block swath of the Turtle Bay neighborhood on March 15, piercing one building and tearing a series of terraces off another. Seven people, including a crane operator and three riggers, were killed and two dozen were injured.It was the first of two fatal crane collapses in less than three months — the second, on East 91st Street in June, left two dead — and came amid a spike of fatal construction accidents, bringing intense scrutiny to the Department of Buildings, which regulates construction work in New York City.The subsequent revelation that the Buildings Department had mistakenly issued work permits at the site of the first collapse led to the resignation of the agency’s commissioner, Patricia J. Lancaster, in April.Robert LiMandri, the city’s acting buildings commissioner, said on Monday that the agency’s preliminary findings are consistent with OSHA’s citations.Mr. Rapetti’s crane rigging license, which is issued by the Buildings Department, expired in July, according to city records, which also show that a hold has been placed on it in case he seeks to renew it.The other two companies cited by the safety agency, Joy Contractors Inc., and the Reliance Construction Group, face possible penalties of $74,000 and $19,500, respectively. They were cited for a range of issues unrelated to the March 15 crane collapse that were uncovered in an inspection after the accident.Efforts to reach those two companies on Monday night were not successful.Richard Mendelson, the area director for OSHA, said the inquiry had shown that three of the nylon slings were about two months old, and the agency was able to learn where they had been purchased. The fourth sling was believed to be about two years old and investigators were unable to track its provenance.Mr. Mendelson added that forensic testing had determined that the fourth sling had cuts and tears before the collapse.OSHA investigators purchased similar slings, he said, and conducted extensive tests that in essence recreated the accident.Mr. Mendelson said that the agency, which issues about 600 citations a year, usually issues a little more than a dozen willful violations and only one or two that carry fines of more than $100,000.'"
"'08-09-16,'1','Allianz is a big German insurance company, so its bosses surely know what schadenfreude means. If they can maintain a measure of objectivity, perhaps they can also understand why some people in these parts may be feeling traces of that emotion after the collapse of negotiations to slap their company’s name on a new stadium being built in New Jersey for the New York Giants and the New York Jets.The football teams had visions of a $25 million-a-year bonanza from selling the Germans naming rights to the stadium. But the dallianz with Allianz fell apart over the company’s Nazi-tainted past. During the evil that was the Third Reich, it insured engineers at Auschwitz, making it a handmaiden of Hitler’s campaign to exterminate European Jewry. It also refused to pay off life insurance policies taken out by Jews.Like other German companies, Allianz has long sought redemption for its sins. The depth of its atonement, however, is a matter of debate. After its dark history was explored in this newspaper last week, the teams decided to give Allianz “das boot,” as a Daily News headline neatly put it on the weekend.Is it fair to make today’s Allianz pay for sins of the fathers and grandfathers? Maybe not.But let’s get real. More Jews live in the New York metropolitan region than in any Israeli city. They include many Holocaust survivors and their offspring, people for whom Nazi grotesqueries are not some arcane detail buried in a dusty history text. For the football teams not to have anticipated the strong feelings that might be unleashed by this commercial venture reveals a certain cluelessness about history and even morality.But then, both teams have long been cavalier about names. Witness the way they still insist on calling themselves “New York,” even though they fled the city decades ago in pursuit of bigger bucks in the Meadowlands. They have about as much to do with the five boroughs as does the Garden State Parkway.'"
"'08-09-16,'1','Among markets that were open Monday, Taiwan’s benchmark index was down 4.6 percent, following a 4 percent drop the previous day, and leading indexes in Australia and New Zealand were down about 2.5 percent.In Japan, as in much of Asia, there is fear of a slow down in the United States economy, which would deprive the region of one of its largest export markets. If American consumers buy fewer cars, televisions and cameras, especially in the coming Christmas shopping season, it could spell trouble across manufacturing-based economies across the region, which depend on exports for profits.Shares also fell on concerns of direct losses by Asian and particularly Japanese financial companies as a result of the problems on Wall Street. In its bankruptcy filing, Lehman Brothers revealed that some of its biggest creditors were Japanese banks. According to the filing, seven Japanese banks have $1.62 billion in outstanding loans to Lehman, including Aozora Bank, with an exposure of $463 million, and Mizuho Corporate, with $289 million.Aozora said Tuesday in a statement that its actual exposure is “significantly smaller” than what Lehman reported.Shares of these and other banks dropped sharply on Tuesday, leading the overall Tokyo market down. Aozora fell 19 percent, while two other large Japanese financial companies, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Nomura Holdings, both dropped 10 percent.On Tuesday, Lehman’s Tokyo-based unit suspended operations on the orders of Japan’s Financial Services Agency, the government financial regulatory body. The agency also said it is investigating Japanese banks and brokerages to determine the size of their exposure to the bankrupt American financial company.Still, banks in Asia had far less exposure to the collapsing American housing market than banks in the United States and Europe, leaving them in much better shape during the current crisis. This was reflected in the currency market, where the Japanese yen was seen as a haven from the battered American dollar.The yen has jumped against the dollar amid a loss of confidence in the American economy and currency. On Tuesday morning, the yen was trading around 104 yen to the dollar; it had been trading at more than 107 yen per dollar on Friday.'"
"'08-09-16,'1','“It’s business as usual,” said Scott Silvestri, a spokesman for Bank of America, which reached an agreement on Sunday to acquire Merrill Lynch. “As we move further into the integration process, we’ll have more to share with customers when we can.”This is what generally happens next in these situations: Recruiters besiege the best brokers with lucrative offers to move elsewhere and avoid the tumult that is part of working for an acquired company. If your broker bolts, you will have to decide whether to go along. If you do, the transition period is a bit of a bother and you may lose access to your funds for a week or two as the new firm moves your securities from Merrill.There may be similar hiccups if you and your broker stick with Merrill, however, if Bank of America decides to use different technology for tracking Merrill accounts or a new account numbering system. This has been a problem in previous mergers, though the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has made efforts to fix it.First, it is important to note that Lehman’s brokerage unit did not file for bankruptcy; its parent company did. So for high net worth investors with accounts there, things continue as they were last week.“You can buy and sell, you can move your assets as you wish,” said Stephen P. Harbeck, president of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.Investors in Neuberger Berman’s mutual funds can also continue to trade.Brokerage investors are protected by rules set by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which keeps a special reserve to help investors at failed brokerage firms.Eventually, Lehman’s brokerage accounts will find a new home. Regulators are working at Lehman’s offices to make sure customer assets are transferred in an orderly fashion to one or more brokerage firms insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.Right now, customers do not have anything to worry about. That is because their assets are kept separate from the brokerage firm’s own assets and cannot be touched by the failed institution or its creditors. If customer money is missing — and that did not occur when JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns — that is when the investor corporation would step in.“We would transfer the accounts to a solid brokerage firm, using our money to replace any missing assets,” Mr. Harbeck said. “If we became involved, we would locate a brokerage firm that was ready, willing and able to take the accounts and we would have transferred them in bulk.”If any assets are missing, the corporation will insure an account up to $500,000; of that amount, it can insure up to $100,000 in cash. But the maximum amount covered can be much higher. For instance, if you have a brokerage account, a joint brokerage account with a spouse, an I.R.A. and a 401(k), each account would receive up to $500,000, Mr. Harbeck explained, totaling $2 million in protection.“Each account held in a separate legal capacity would be considered separate,” Mr. Harbeck said.The corporation covers a lot of assets, but not all of them. Investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, other investment company shares and other registered securities are covered. But coverage does not extend to instruments like unregistered investment contracts, unregistered limited partnerships, fixed annuity contracts, currency, and interests in gold, silver or other commodity futures contracts or commodity options.The investor protection corporation has $1.5 billion in reserves, which is invested in Treasury securities, as well as a $1 billion line of credit with an international consortium of banks and another $1 billion line of credit with the Treasury.When we were taking questions on nytimes.com on Monday on how the trouble in the financial services industry will affect consumers, a number of people wrote in with questions about A.I.G.’s life insurance and other policies. Just to reiterate, A.I.G. is still in business, though it is desperately in need of more capital.“We have a very strong message for consumers,” said David Neustadt, the deputy superintendent for public information for the State Insurance Department in New York, where A.I.G. has its headquarters. “If you have a policy with A.I.G. insurance company, they are financially strong and solvent. They have the capability to pay on any claims, and our job is to ensure that they continue to have the ability to pay.”Some insurance agents expressed confidence as well on Monday. Lance Whitney, of HBW Insurance and Financial Services in Sterling Heights, Mich., said he fielded a call from a nervous client who had life insurance through the American General subsidiary of A.I.G.Mr. Whitney said he had told the client that his boss purchased 1,000 shares of A.I.G. that day to show that he was still confident in the company. His boss also said that even if A.I.G.’s troubles eventually affected American General, that unit would probably be bought by another, stronger company.It is hard to predict, however, how clients may act on their own. Glenn Daily, a fee-only insurance adviser in New York, said he had heard Monday from a client with $11 million in cash value life insurance with A.I.G. The client’s plan was to take out a big loan against his policy and hang onto the money for the next few weeks as a precaution, just to see what happened.“If everyone does this, the company could be driven out of business,” Mr. Daily said. “It’s a hard call to make. You don’t want to be socially irresponsible, but you also have to consider the client.”In the event of insolvency, entities known as guaranty funds would step in. Each state has at least two of these, one dealing with claims against defunct life and health insurance companies and the other handling property and casualty claims, as well as workers’ compensation. They’re a bit like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which provides protection to account holders when banks fail.Each state sets its own limits, though most of the life insurance funds provide at least $300,000 in death benefits on a life insurance policy and $100,000 for cash surrender or withdrawal value for both a life insurance policy and an annuity. Some states may cover more.You can look up your own state’s limits (and many more details on how this process works) on the Web site of the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations, found at www.nolhga.com/factsandfigures/main.cfm/location/stateinfo.As for property and casualty insurance, like auto and home insurance, a $300,000 limit often applies as well. For more information, the Web site of the National Conference of Insurance Guaranty Funds offers some helpful details in the first two links after clicking “About Us” on the home page, www.ncigf.org.'"
"'08-09-16,'1','He has 46 minutes an hour to fill; no longer will his time be frittered away on traffic, weather, too many commercials or all those updates, which cut his hourly load at WFAN to 33 or 34 minutes. Can he speak, untethered from Mikey, for 1,150 minutes a week without trauma? “I’ve got to get that drink Madden has, the one Pavarotti gave him,” he told his agent, Sandy Montag, who also represents John Madden, before the show.His move to the national stage, he said, required that he begin with a national story, not the Mets’ bullpen woes. So he picked Denver’s 39-38 win over San Diego. That game was distinguished, if that is the word, by the referee Ed Hochuli’s inadvertent whistle, which turned a fumble by Broncos quarterback Jay Cutler into an incomplete pass, and led to the 2-point conversion that gave Denver a victory.“He’s got all those big muscles he likes to show off,” Russo said.On behalf of a grateful nation, Russo rhetorically exiled Hochuli to officiate lesser games for the remainder of his days.“To me, Hochuli preens a lot,” he said. “If you like to preen so much, you can’t make that kind of mistake.” (Scientists will have to explore the correlation between faulty judgments by men in stripes and their primping and strutting.)Opposite him on WFAN, Francesa opened his show with the Mets, moved on to the Jets, then a broader N.F.L. tableau, including the Broncos-Chargers game.He was not listening to Russo. “He was on against me!” he said. “But I figured he’d do what he used to do on his Saturday show, but base it more on national stuff.”Together, they were a potent pair. In the spring Arbitron rating book, they posted a 5.3 among men 25 to 54, second best in the New York market. Russo will now be judged, in part, by the notice he attracts to Sirius and subscription growth.Russo understands the idiosyncratic performer he is. He is unusual. He is loud. He is silly. He will mispronounce words (“Darth Varder” slipped his lips Monday).He will trample ad copy (his version of the Spongetech car sponge illustrates his joy of mangling). He will, as he did on WFAN, continue to hate the Yankees.His arms flail in a fashion that suggests he might lose his well-defined persona if he were ever required to sit full-time on his hands. And now, he and his listeners can utter dirty words, which is not necessarily his style.“I’m going to annoy you some days,” Russo told his audience, sitting at a hexagonal desk, with the USA Today sports section in front of him and bifocals perched low on his nose. “I’m going to bother you some days. You’ll say, ‘His opinions are awful’ or ‘He doesn’t love my team,’ or ‘He knows nothing about hockey.’ ”He added: “Everything you can say, I’ve heard.”But all that he said, he didn’t remember. In mid-tirade, early in the show, he asked, “Who cares about Derek Jeter with that stupid hit thing with Lou Gehrig?” (Translation: Jeter tied Gehrig for most career hits at Yankee Stadium on Sunday.) Later on, when Joe Torre called in to pay tribute to Russo, he asked the manager of the first-place Dodgers about Jeter’s hit as if it were truly a remarkable feat.A caller then reminded him that he “folded like a cheap suit” for Torre.“You’re right, I played soft,” he said (almost) abashedly.'"
"'08-09-16,'1','On one piece of the audio recordings Mr. Owens played, Mr. Simpson is heard telling another collectibles dealer, Thomas Riccio, a four-time convicted felon who set up the hotel room confrontation: “So they’re going to meet tonight, I’m going to show up with a bunch of boys and” and take back the items. He added, “They can’t do nothing about it.”Such moments, Mr. Owens told the jury, “will show the intent, it will show the force, it will show the demands and it will show the taking of property.” He also said, “It will show the character of O. J. Simpson.”Mr. Galanter countered that during the trial, expected to take a month, jurors would hear audio excerpts that proved Mr. Simpson thought it was appropriate for him and the men to behave as they did because the items, including several of Mr. Simpson’s championship game balls, had been stolen from him. Mr. Simpson was unaware that two of the men with him carried guns and did not see either of them brandish one, Mr. Galanter said.“You hear him gather up these people and say, ‘Listen, I’m going to need help carrying this all out,’ and there’s talk of using a bellman,” Mr. Galanter said. “How many people commit a robbery and use a bellman? Clearly these are not the actions of someone who wants to commit a crime.”Mr. Galanter noted that Mr. Beardsley, Mr. Fromong, Mr. Riccio and the four men who pleaded guilty had all tried to sell interviews or audio recordings of the events to the tabloid news media. Their profiteering, the lawyer said, diminishes their credibility.Hanging over the proceedings is Mr. Simpson’s much-publicized acquittal on charges that he murdered his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1994. A civil jury later found him liable for the deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5 million to the families of the deceased.That judgment, of which Mr. Simpson has paid little, is one reason why the ownership of the items taken in the hotel raid is in dispute. The prosecutor, Mr. Owens, said that if Mr. Simpson had believed they belonged to him, he would have had to list them on asset forms related to the civil judgment that were filed in California in 2007. Mr. Galanter told the jury that the items Mr. Simpson wanted from the dealers included family photos that would not have been viewed as assets.At one point, Mr. Galanter walked behind Mr. Simpson, placed his hands on his client’s shoulders and told jurors: “You can think whatever you want about his past. And you’ve all agreed to ignore it. But what you’re going to see in this courtroom is a case about recovering photographs, personal mementos.”'"
"'08-09-16,'1','“It means your employer is going to have to make an estimate on how much the employer is paying for health insurance on your behalf, and you are going to have to pay taxes on that money,” said Sherry Glied, an economist who chairs the Department of Health Policy and Management at ’s Mailman School of Public Health.Ms. Glied is one of the four scholars who have just completed an independent joint study of the plan. Their findings are being published on the Web site of the policy journal, Health Affairs.According to the study: “The McCain plan will force millions of Americans into the weakest segment of the private insurance system — the nongroup market — where cost-sharing is high, covered services are limited and people will lose access to benefits they have now.”The net effect of the plan, the study said, “almost certainly will be to increase family costs for medical care.”Under the McCain plan (now the McCain-Palin plan) employees who continue to receive employer-paid health benefits would look at their pay stubs each week or each month and find that additional money had been withheld to cover the taxes on the value of their benefits.While there might be less money in the paycheck, that would not be anything to worry about, according to Senator McCain. That’s because the government would be offering all taxpayers a refundable tax credit — $2,500 for a single worker and $5,000 per family — to be used “to help pay for your health care.”You may think this is a good move or a bad one — but it’s a monumental change in the way health coverage would be provided to scores of millions of Americans. Why not more attention?The whole idea of the McCain plan is to get families out of employer-paid health coverage and into the health insurance marketplace, where naked competition is supposed to take care of all ills. (We’re seeing in the , , , and fiascos just how well the unfettered marketplace has been working.)Taxing employer-paid health benefits is the first step in this transition, the equivalent of injecting poison into the system. It’s the beginning of the end.When younger, healthier workers start seeing additional taxes taken out of their paychecks, some (perhaps many) will opt out of the employer-based plans — either to buy cheaper insurance on their own or to go without coverage.That will leave employers with a pool of older, less healthy workers to cover. That coverage will necessarily be more expensive, which will encourage more and more employers to give up on the idea of providing coverage at all.The upshot is that many more Americans — millions more — will find themselves on their own in the bewildering and often treacherous health insurance marketplace. As Senator McCain has said: “I believe the key to real reform is to restore control over our health care system to the patients themselves.”Yet another radical element of McCain’s plan is his proposal to undermine state health insurance regulations by allowing consumers to buy insurance from sellers anywhere in the country. So a requirement in one state that insurers cover, for example, , or annual physicals, or breast examinations, would essentially be meaningless.In a refrain we’ve heard many times in recent years, Mr. McCain said he is committed to ridding the market of these “needless and costly” insurance regulations.This entire McCain health insurance transformation is right out of the right-wing Republicans’ ideological playbook: fewer regulations; let the market decide; and send unsophisticated consumers into the crucible alone.You would think that with some of the most venerable houses on Wall Street crumbling like sand castles right before our eyes, we’d be a little wary about spreading this toxic formula even further into the health care system.But we’re not even paying much attention.'"
"'08-09-16,'1','For example, this year airlines reintroduced minimum-stay fare rules aimed at discouraging business travelers from using cheaper advance-purchase fares. The tactic presumes that a business traveler is loath to stay away from home over a Saturday night or for extra nights, and will opt for a more expensive fare without the restrictions.Staying over the weekend, then, can lower the fare paid by a company “because they now have the Saturday-night stay built in,” Mr. Cohn said. He added that some companies were scheduling more regional meetings on Mondays and Tuesdays or Thursdays and Fridays to accommodate “people who choose to stay a long weekend.”Pete Angles, a sales manager for a big pharmaceutical company, Galderma, said he traveled “a lot nationwide and, depending on the circumstances, I’m often working to combine a business trip with leisure.”Mr. Angles said that his wife, Cristina, sometimes came along, depending on the destination. “The company has already covered my airfare, and I’m usually able to extend the corporate rate for a few extra days at a hotel, so it works out,” he said.In a recent Orbitz for Business/Business Traveler Magazine Quarterly Trend Report, three-quarters of the 450 business travelers responding said they had extended a business trip with some leisure time in the last year. And 81 percent said that in the next six months they were considering extending a leisure trip by adding vacation time with family or friends.More than a third said they had coordinated a business trip to accommodate leisure travel to a desirable location.Mr. Angles said that his wife was “a lot more interested in what my travel calendar looks like several months ahead,” now that the couple often traveled together on his business trips. “She’ll say, ‘Hmmm, this trip is to the Bellagio in Vegas. That might be more interesting than going along to your meeting in Tulsa,’ ” he said.Because they are more intensely affected by the indignities of air travel and other annoyances, business travelers love to complain and commiserate with one another about life on the road. But a lot of them actually like to travel on business, according to research to be released Tuesday by Egencia, the business travel division of Expedia Inc.In that survey, with 2,400 travelers responding in North America and Western Europe, 39 percent described themselves as “experience-hungry” travelers who strove to balance business travel with leisure interests. More American respondents than those in other countries mentioned “how they enjoy traveling for business,” the survey said.“They actually like business travel and would be happy to travel more,” said Rob Greyber, senior vice president in North America of Egencia.“Business travelers are managing work-life balance,” he added. “One of the key things they’re doing is bringing family or friends along, or taking an extra day before or after” the business part of the trip.Mr. Cohn of Orbitz for Business said that given rising travel costs, it made sense to tack some family leisure travel onto a business trip in which “part of the cost can be absorbed through the work trip.”'"
"'08-09-16,'1','The American Dance Guild continued its annual festival of choreography on Friday at Dance New Amsterdam with a program that included a tribute to Anna Sokolow, one of modern dance’s true mavericks. As a choreographer, Sokolow, who died in 2000, stubbornly followed her own path, eschewing commercial success for works that dealt with social and political themes. And as a teacher — demonstrated in an archival video in the lobby — she was one tough cookie.So it was illuminating to see a sunnier side of Sokolow on the program, which featured 11 works in total. The airless theater made it difficult to concentrate on just about anything less substantial than Sokolow’s own choreography, from an overly literal antiwar dance (Sue Bernhard’s “Eyes Wide Open”) to a gentler piece about losing memory (Betsy Fisher’s “Blue Moon”).Kun-Yang Lin choreographed and performed “Dedication,” presented in memory of Patricia Nanon, who founded the performing-arts colony the Yard. For all of its emotion and effort, this solo, which visibly linked movement to breath, was heartfelt in an all-too-obvious way.Sokolow‘s dances were like a balm. In “Adagio Appassionato,” an excerpt from “Lyric Suite” (1953), four members of the Sokolow Theater Dance Ensemble — under the direction of Jim May — stand apart, each with one arm raised. Shifting their weight from one foot to the other, they relax their elbows, allowing their arms to curve in front of their torsos.Wearing long purple dresses, the performers mirror one another in tilts and low leaps, paying careful attention to line and weight; throughout there is the notion of strength yielding to softness. It is a profoundly pretty dance, but Sokolow’s witty juxtaposition of such purity with Alban Berg’s atonal music also allows it to be more.In “Session for Six,” from 1958 and set to music by the Brazilian composer William Catanzaro, Sokolow shows her playful side. Dancers wear black pants and Mondrian-style tops; their arms, frequently held forward and limp at the wrists, create the living image of a 1950s hepcat, albeit with a certain Sokolow grit.'"
"'08-09-16,'1','Senator John McCain’s campaign began running this advertisement on Spanish language television stations in Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico over the weekend.SCRIPT (As translated by The New York Times) A male announcer says: “Obama and his allies in Congress say they are on the side of immigrants, but they’re not. Reports in the press say that their efforts were like ‘poison pills’ that caused immigration reform to fail. The results: ‘No’ to the guest workers program; ‘no’ to a path to citizenship, ‘no’ to secure borders. The reform didn’t pass. Is that being on our side? Obama and his Congressional allies — ready to block immigration reform, but not ready to govern.”ON THE SCREEN The spot switches among montages of Mr. Obama and Senate Democrats — Harry Reid of Nevada; Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont — and Hispanic-looking voters and hazy images of federal buildings as onscreen writing flashes statements like “De Nuestro Lado?” ( “On our side?”).ACCURACY The bill in question, which died in 2007, would have overhauled the nation’s immigration rules by creating a temporary worker program, a “pathway to citizenship” for illegal workers already here and provisions to tighten border security. Members of both parties took the blame for introducing amendments that ultimately killed the carefully developed compromise based upon an initial bill that Mr. McCain had helped draft. Before its fate was sealed, President Bush, who was pushing hard for its passage, directed much of his rhetoric against Republican opponents who dismissed it as “amnesty.”Mr. Obama did support several Democratic provisions that were among those ultimately blamed for undermining it. He introduced an (ultimately losing) amendment curtailing a proposal to award green cards based on a point system that valued education and job skills more than mere family ties. And he joined with most of the Senate Democrats to support an amendment supported by labor groups and widely viewed as harming the bill by limiting the guest worker program at its core.The key votes, however, came from four Republicans who initially voted against the amendment but switched sides at the 11th hour, they said, to destroy the broader bill. Mr. Obama did face some accusations of political expediency for siding with labor on a provision that was not favored by the Democrats who had forged the fragile, bipartisan compromise.'"
"'08-09-16,'1','The reason for this disappointing outcome, in his view, is that natural selection has been far more efficient than many researchers expected at screening out disease-causing variants. The common disease/common variant idea is largely wrong. What has happened is that a multitude of rare variants lie at the root of most common diseases, being rigorously pruned away as soon as any starts to become widespread.It takes large, expensive trials with hundreds of patients in different countries to find even common variants behind a disease. Rare variants lie beyond present reach. “It’s an astounding thing,” Dr. Goldstein said, “that we have cracked open the human genome and can look at the entire complement of common genetic variants, and what do we find? Almost nothing. That is absolutely beyond belief.”If rare variants account for most of the genetic burden of disease, then the idea of decoding everyone’s genome to see to what diseases they are vulnerable to will not work, at least not in the form envisaged. “I don’t believe we should do more and more genomewide association studies for common diseases,” Dr. Goldstein said. Instead, he suggested, the “missing heritability” might be tracked by thoroughly studying the genome of specific patients.Researchers hunting for disease genes strongly disagree. They say genomewide association studies with larger numbers of patients will bring more disease-promoting variants to light.Dr. Kari Stefansson, chief executive of the Icelandic gene-hunting company Decode Genetics, says it does not matter whether disease-causing variants are common or rare as long as they yield insights into the biochemical pathways by which disease develops, and which will provide targets for drugs.The HapMap project was started amid much skepticism but has proved a technical success, even if it has brought to light fewer common disease variants than hoped. “There is no doubt it has succeeded far beyond what some skeptics proposed,” said Dr. David Altshuler, an architect of the HapMap at the Harvard Medical School. He defends the common disease/common variant hypothesis, saying it meant only that some, not all, of the genetic burden of a disease would be conveyed by common variants. And the genomewide association study, currently the gold standard of gene discovery, is in his view only one step along the road.Dr. Goldstein does not shy away from unpopular positions or research. In a new book, “Jacob’s Legacy” (Yale University Press), he recounts how he delved into the genetic history of Jews.Given the abuses of the past, geneticists approach with caution research in the genetics of racial or ethnic groups. But genetics can provide powerful insights into history. Because some Jewish communities, for instance, have for centuries married only within their religion, they have developed certain distinctive genetic profiles. One is a genetic signature on the Y chromosome of the hereditary Jewish priests known as cohens. Dr. Goldstein, as he describes in his book, found a set of DNA variations in the signature that allowed him to estimate when that signature first appeared — about 3,000 years ago. The date fit nicely with the presumed date of King Solomon’s reign and supported the claim that cohens were indeed descended from a high priest of around that time, even if that priest may not have been Aaron, as tradition holds.He gleaned an even deeper insight into Jewish origins from analysis of mitochondrial DNA taken from Jewish communities around the world. In 2000, a team led by Dr. Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona found that men from Jewish communities all carry a certain lineage of Y chromosomes, one that is shared by many Near Eastern peoples. That established the origin of the founding fathers of Jewish communities, but where did the founding mothers come from?Two years later, a team led by Dr. Goldstein provided the surprising answer: the mitochondrial DNA of many Jewish communities looks as if it was derived, a long time ago, from the population of the host community. Jewish communities may therefore have been founded by Jewish men, arriving perhaps as traders, who took local wives, converted them to Judaism, and thereafter married only within the religion.Dr. Goldstein had never been bar mitzvahed and had taken little interest in his Jewish heritage until as a graduate student at Stanford during the Persian Gulf war he was moved by the plight of Israeli civilians being bombarded by Saddam Hussein’s Scud missiles. After gaining his Ph.D. in 1994, he moved to England, to Oxford University and University College, LondonHe later took an appointment at Duke, where he has focused on pharmacogenetics, the interaction between drugs and the genome. He has laid aside, at least for the moment, further research into Jewish genetic history.Another pursuit that interests him, one of high promise for reconstructing human evolutionary history, is that of discovering which genes bear the mark of recent natural selection. When a new version of a gene becomes more common, it leaves a pattern of changes that geneticists can detect with various statistical tests. Many of these selected genes reflect new diets or defenses against disease or adaptations to new climates. But they tend to differ from one race to another because each human population, after the dispersal from Africa some 50,000 years ago, has had to adapt to different circumstances.This newish finding has raised fears that other, more significant differences might emerge among races, spurring a resurrection of racist doctrines. “There is a part of the scientific community which is trying to make this work off limits, and that I think is hugely counterproductive,” Dr. Goldstein said.He says he thinks that no significant genetic differences will be found between races because of his belief in the efficiency of natural selection. Just as selection turns out to have pruned away most disease-causing variants, it has also maximized human cognitive capacities because these are so critical to survival. “My best guess is that human intelligence was always a helpful thing in most places and times and we have all been under strong selection to be as bright as we can be,” he said.This is more than just a guess, however. As part of a project on schizophrenia, Dr. Goldstein has done a genomewide association study on 2,000 volunteers of all races who were put through cognitive tests. “We have looked at the effect of common variation on cognition, and there is nothing,” Dr. Goldstein said, meaning that he can find no common genetic variants that affect intelligence. His view is that intelligence was developed early in human evolutionary history and was then standardized.At Duke, he revels in the greater freedom to pursue his own interests. “In England, there’s a much greater tendency to be wary of something too ambitious,” he said. “The feeling in the American scientific community is one of confidence — let’s get the job done.”'"
"'08-09-16,'1','With their wildly varying shapes, sizes and coats, dogs can be a developmental biologist’s best friend.A case in point is reported in the journal Science by researchers who have discovered the genetic basis for one of the more extreme features of some dogs — baldness. Tosso Leeb of the University of Bern in Switzerland and colleagues report that dogs that are hairless or nearly so have a mutation in a gene they call FOXI3.The researchers compared the genomes of hairless and coated dogs from three breeds — the Chinese crested, and the Mexican and Peruvian hairless. It had been known that hairlessness (accompanied by tooth abnormalities) in these breeds is caused by a single dominant gene, but the precise gene was unknown.The analysis revealed an area on chromosome 17 as the likely location of the gene, and further sequencing showed that this area was similar to a gene previously identified in mice. Manipulating the gene in mouse embryos showed that it was responsible for development of hair and teeth.Further sequencing of the dog gene revealed the actual mutation — a string of only seven pairs of nucleotides is duplicated in hairless dogs, but not in those born with a full body of hair.'"
"'08-09-16,'1','But while this increasingly popular thesis contains a kernel of truth, it conceals a bushel basket of conceptual and scientific problems.For one thing, if modern diagnostic criteria were converting mere sadness into clinical depression, we would expect the number of new cases of depression to be skyrocketing compared with rates in a period like the 1950s to the 1970s. But several new studies in the United States and Canada find that the incidence of serious depression has held relatively steady in recent decades.Second, it may seem easy to determine that someone with depressive complaints is reacting to a loss that touched off the depression. Experienced clinicians know this is rarely the case.Most of us can point to recent losses and disappointments in our lives, but it is not always clear that they are causally related to our becoming depressed. For example, a patient who had a stroke a month ago may appear tearful, lethargic and depressed. To critics, the so-called depression is just “normal sadness” in reaction to a terrible psychological blow. But strokes are also known to disrupt chemical pathways in the brain that directly affect mood.What is the “real” trigger for this patient’s depression? Perhaps it is a combination of psychological and neurological factors. In short, the notion of “reacting” to adverse life events is complex and problematic.Third, and perhaps most troubling, is the implication that a recent major loss makes it more likely that the person’s depressive symptoms will follow a benign and limited course, and therefore do not need medical treatment. This has never been demonstrated, to my knowledge, in any well-designed studies. And what has been demonstrated, in a study by Dr. Sidney Zisook, is that antidepressants may help patients with major depressive symptoms occurring just after the death of a loved one.Yes, most psychiatrists would concede that in the space of a brief “managed care” appointment, it’s very hard to understand much about the context of the patient’s depressive complaints. And yes, under such conditions, some doctors are tempted to write that prescription for Prozac or Zoloft and move on to the next patient.But the vexing issue of when bereavement or sadness becomes a disorder, and how it should be treated, requires much more study. Most psychiatrists believe that undertreatment of severe depression is a more pressing problem than overtreatment of “normal sadness.” Until solid research persuades me otherwise, I will most likely see people like my jilted patient as clinically depressed, not just “normally sad” — and I will provide him with whatever psychiatric treatment he needs to feel better.'"
"'08-09-16,'1','Music companies hope the service, which weaves music through the increasingly popular world of online social networking, will weaken Apple’s dominant grip on the digital music business while helping to recoup revenue lost in the last few years as CD sales have suffered annual declines of 10 to 20 percent.Greg Scholl, chief executive of the Orchard, the largest distributor of digital music from independent labels, says a music business based on advertising “could well dwarf today’s $30 billion global recorded music industry.”Mr. Scholl’s endorsement is something of a coup for the service. He questioned the effort in a public e-mail message to independent labels when it was first announced. But the Orchard is now set to make its catalog of more than a million songs available to the site.After learning more about the venture, Mr. Scholl said, he decided that MySpace would compensate artists fairly and that free ad-supported music represented the industry’s only practical future. “MySpace Music represents the first credible, large-scale initiative in this direction,” he said.When it is introduced, most likely by the end of the month, the service will have several million songs, all ready for instantaneous streaming. Users will be able to assemble private playlists of hundreds of songs, which they can string together to perk up a party or ease the monotony of their workday. They will also be able to post one of those playlists, with 10 songs, to their public MySpace profiles, where their friends can listen and save those songs to their own pages.To transfer the music to another computer or a mobile device like an iPod, visitors will have to buy songs on the site through Amazon.com’s digital music store. Cellphone ring tones will be for sale through Jamster, another unit of the News Corporation.Around five million artists use MySpace to interact with fans, and MySpace Music will change life for them as well. Now, those artists can post up to six songs on their pages. In the revamped site, they will be able to post their entire catalogs and share in the resulting advertising and download revenue. Sony Pictures, McDonald’s, State Farm and Toyota Motor will be among the first sponsors of the site.“What we are really doing is creating an economy for all musical artists,” said Chris DeWolfe, MySpace’s chief executive.Free online music streaming is not exactly new to the Web. Imeem, a four-year-old San Francisco start-up company, and Last.fm, owned by CBS Interactive, offer services with much of the same music from major labels and independent artists.Dalton Caldwell, chief executive of Imeem, said that MySpace has struggled in the past to create services that can take on established leaders. The MySpaceTV site, for example, has failed to dethrone YouTube in online video. Even with its enormous traffic, he said, “they haven’t successfully created homegrown services that can beat competitive threats.”But executives at the major labels say MySpace Music offers a larger stage and bigger financial opportunity than many existing music sites. Despite recent incursions by Facebook, which now has more members worldwide, MySpace still has 120 million users around the globe and a larger audience than Facebook in the United States, many of whom already use the site to discover and share new music.The path to MySpace Music has been a painful one for the music industry. Five years ago, various labels and industry groups sued MP3.com, an early service that permitted people to stream any song free as long as they could demonstrate that they had a copy of the CD. MP3.com lost the lawsuit and closed its service.But the music industry’s victory was pyrrhic. CD sales have plunged since then, and Apple has come to rule the world of digital music with its iTunes store and the iPod. And activity on file-sharing services continues to thrive.“To the average consumer, music is already free,” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at Pali Research. MySpace Music, he said, “is the labels now acquiescing to that fact.”They are also trying to profit from it. People familiar with the arrangement between the News Corporation and the studios say that the labels own about a 40 percent stake in the new venture, with Universal Music, the largest label, owning the biggest share. That would give the music companies a direct interest in MySpace Music’s success. People briefed on the deals say they have given MySpace favorable terms — and waived the penny-a-play fee that is charged to other streaming music sites. MySpace would not comment on terms of the deals with the record labels.MySpace says it eventually will let artists sell merchandise and concert tickets from their pages and keep a share in the profit. Over the longer term, label executives say, they will add exclusive content like new songs and videos to MySpace Music and offer deals to encourage customers to download albums and collections of music.“This is something we should have done earlier,” said Rio Caraeff, executive vice president for the digital division at the Universal Music Group. “It’s kind of like a staging ground for us to experiment with new business models.”There is one more hurdle the new venture must clear: finding a chief executive. Mr. DeWolfe and Amit Kapur, MySpace’s chief operating officer, have run the joint venture until now, but they are now searching for a chief executive. Mr. DeWolfe says the new company will have 70 employees and will soon move to separate offices near the MySpace headquarters in Beverly Hills, Calif.'"
"'08-09-16,'1','While Mr. Hirst risked flooding his own market, he had also spent several months courting potential buyers. Still, he could not anticipate the sale’s timing, amid news that Lehman Brothers had filed for bankruptcy and other serious changes on the financial landscape. Sotheby’s was said to be taking steps to ensure that the sale did not fall flat, like offering buyers a six-month grace period to pay for purchases.Jay Jopling, owner of the White Cube gallery, could be seen in the audience bidding on works (and winning at least one, “The Triumvirate,” which features anatomical models, for $3.1 million). Word in the auction world was that Sotheby’s had given him an incentive to steer his clients to the sale. Sotheby’s declined to comment on any of the financial arrangements.The headlines had little effect on the scene outside the salesroom here. The street was filled with television camera crews; fans hoping to spot celebrities like Bianca Jagger; and a crowd of collectors, dealers and curiosity seekers waiting for the doors to open. Inside later it was standing room only. But most of the action was on the telephone, with Sotheby’s flying in employees from all over the world to handle the bidding.Over the past last 11 days nearly 20,000 people have flocked to Sotheby’s New Bond Street premises to see what looked like a polished retrospective. For sale were variations on all of Mr. Hirst’s best-known themes: dead animals, including several sharks, a calf, a zebra and doves, all submerged in formaldehyde; glass cabinets filled with diamonds, cigarette butts and practically everything in between; and paintings and drawings with his signature skulls and dots, swirls and butterflies.As part of his sales pitch, Mr. Hirst said that he would no longer be making spin or butterfly paintings and that there would be far fewer dead animals and almost no dot paintings.On Monday, the evening’s star was “The Golden Calf,” a white bullock preserved in formaldehyde, with hoofs and horns made of 18-carat gold and a gold disc crowning the head. The work was estimated at $15.8 million to $23.6 million and drew three bidders. It went for $18.6 million to a buyer on the phone.A work along similar lines, “The Black Sheep With the Golden Horn,” had just two bidders, with the winner paying $4.7 million, in the middle of its $3.9 million to $5.9 million estimate. Three potential buyers vied for “The Kingdom,” another formaldehyde-preserved work, this one a tiger shark. It sold for $17.2 million, well above its high estimate of $11.8 million.Also in the spotlight were Mr. Hirst’s glass-front cabinets, like “Fragments of Paradise,” filled with manufactured diamonds. After a bidding war that included Mr. Jopling, the work went for $9.3 million, well above its $2.9 million estimate. The winning bid was taken on the phone by Alina Davey, a Russian-speaking Sotheby’s representative based in London. Another diamond-filled cabinet, “Memories of/Moments With You,” went for $4.7 million, more than twice its high estimate of $2.3 million. But “End of the Line,” a cabinet filled with medical supplies, sold for $2.4 million, less than its low estimate of $2.9 million.Skulls were incorporated in several of the pieces. “Beautiful Maat Intense Fetishistic Painting (With Extra Inner Beauty),” a work with the colorful impact of his swirl canvases, featured a skull in its center. It sold for $868,127, above the high estimate of $790,000. And “Transience Painting 2” had a skull nestled on a leather armchair with bubbles surrounding it. Priced at a high of $1.1 million, it sold for $1.8 million to a bidder on the phone.Other paintings had butterflies, as well as diamonds, scalpel blades, rosaries, crucifixes and religious medals. These included “Sometimes Life Can Be Really, Really Dark,” which brought $1.3 million, above the high estimate of $1.1 million.Mr. Hirst also produced works that resemble stained-glass windows in churches. The round, butterfly-covered “Rose Window, Durham Cathedral” carried a high estimate of $1.7 million but sold for more: $2.2 million. Four bidders sought “Calm,” a red canvas also using butterflies to create a stained-glass effect. It sold for $1.2 million, just above its high estimate of $1.1 million.Dot paintings were on offer too, in a variety of colors and sizes. “Myristoycholine Iodide,” a 6-foot-by-7-foot-11-inch canvas, was estimated at $990,000 to $1.3 million. But it went for $868,126, a sign that perhaps there have been too many dot paintings for sale in the past year.One of his more macabre works, “Devil Worshiper,” a canvas with dead flies, didn’t sell. And neither did “Theology, Philosophy, Medicine, Justice,” which featured four bullsharks floating in two tanks.Mr. Dunphy said that while Mr. Hirst wasn’t at Sotheby’s, he was following the results via phone — while playing snooker.'"
"'08-09-16,'1','Both presidential candidates have now issued answers to a series of questions about science policy, Senator Barack Obama having done so in late August and Senator John McCain on Monday.Their responses show clear areas of agreement on such apple-pie issues as ocean health, as well as sharp contrasts, as when Mr. Obama stresses the role of government and Mr. McCain that of business in addressing some of the nation’s main challenges.What follows is a digest of their answers, as posted by Science Debate 2008. The private group, in an effort endorsed by leading scientific organizations, has worked since November to get candidates to articulate positions on science policy. The full answers are at www.sciencedebate2008.com.INNOVATION Mr. Obama calls for doubling federal budgets for basic research over a decade and supports broadband Internet connections “for all Americans.” Mr. McCain stresses policies to provide “broad pools of capital, low taxes and incentives for research in America,” as well as the streamlining of “burdensome regulations.” Mr. McCain also said Congress, “under my guiding hand,” adopted wireless policies that “spurred the rapid rise of mobile phones and WiFi technology.”CLIMATE CHANGE Both candidates talk of human activities’ warming the planet, with Mr. McCain saying that they “threaten disastrous changes” and Mr. Obama that “they are influencing the global climate.” In terms of 1990 levels of carbon emissions, Mr. McCain would ultimately have the nation’s output drop by 60 percent and Mr. Obama by 80 percent.'"
"'08-09-16,'1','The demonstrators have blockaded the prime minister’s office, and leaders of the protest responded angrily to Mr. Somchai’s nomination, calling him a front man for Mr. Thaksin and saying they would continue their protest until the government fell.In whatever way the nomination plays out, some analysts said they expected the new government to be relatively short-lived, partly because of the continuing political instability in Thailand and partly because the party is at risk of being disbanded by a court for electoral fraud.“I assume that this particular government will not last more than a couple of months and will probably call a snap election and see how the chips fall,” said one analyst, James Klein, the country representative for the Asia Foundation.The protesters, who are being led by a group called the People’s Alliance for Democracy, represent an establishment that is seeking to weaken electoral politics by putting in place a “new order” in which most members of Parliament would be appointed.The protesters accuse the current government of being a puppet of Mr. Thaksin, who was deposed in a coup in 2006, and of wanting to pave the way for his return to politics.Mr. Thaksin and his wife, Pojaman, fled to London last month after she was convicted of tax evasion, and with several corruption cases pending against them. The Supreme Court is scheduled to rule Wednesday in a corruption case against Mr. Thaksin and his wife involving a land deal.Mr. Somchai, a low-key politician, is married to Ms. Pojaman’s younger sister and has a long résumé that includes more than 20 years as a judge and a decade in government ministries, mostly before Mr. Thaksin’s rise to power. He was accused of nepotism when he served in Mr. Thaksin’s government.Mr. Somchai’s wife, Yaowapa Wongsawasdi, was an influential member of Parliament in Mr. Thaksin’s party, Thai Rak Thai, before it was disbanded last year for electoral fraud.Mr. Thaksin, a telecommunications tycoon who is still hugely popular among Thailand’s majority rural poor, remains a power behind the People Power Party. Members of the party said he had been in touch with them by telephone as they maneuvered to select a replacement for Mr. Samak.'"
"'08-09-16,'1','The central bank said in a statement that the goal of the policy shift was to “solve prominent problems in the current economic operation, implement the principle of giving different policies for different needs and optimizing the economic structure, and ensure a steady, rapid and sustained development.”Stock exchanges here were closed Monday for a holiday. The central bank has a history of announcing important monetary policy shifts over weekends or public holidays, often giving advance warning so banks have more time to prepare.Western economists welcomed Monday’s moves toward lower interest rates and less stringent limits on lending.“We see these adjustments as a positive step given the unprecedented uncertainties in the international financial markets and rising downside risks in the domestic economy, in particular the real estate sector,” Goldman Sachs said in a research note.The technical details of Monday’s monetary policy changes were complex.Effective Tuesday, the People’s Bank of China lowered by 0.27 percent, to 7.2 percent, the regulated benchmark rate that commercial banks may charge for one-year loans to business borrowers with strong credit histories. Rates for shorter-term loans will be generally cut even more while rates for longer-term loans will be subject to smaller adjustments, the central bank said, without providing details.The central bank also lowered by a full percentage point the share of assets that small and medium-size banks must deposit as reserves with the central bank, effective Sept. 25. The so-called reserve requirement ratio is an important tool in China for limiting how much money can be lent by commercial banks.The central bank had rapidly ratcheted up the ratio, from 6 percent in August 2003 to 14.5 percent in December and 17.5 percent in June.But the People’s Bank of China made a point on Monday of not lowering the reserve requirement ratio on Monday for the country’s six largest banks. These are the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of China, the China Construction Bank, the Bank of Communications and the Postal Savings Bank of China.These institutions account for more than two-thirds of the banking market in China. The central bank needs large sums of reserves, for which it pays 1.89 percent interest to the banks, so that it can continue buying large sums of foreign exchange reserves.By buying tens of billions of dollars worth of foreign currency each month, the Beijing authorities have been able to limit the rise of China’s currency, the yuan, against the dollar. This has preserved much of the competitiveness of Chinese exports.The People’s Bank of China is in discussions with the finance ministry for an injection of capital, which would strengthen the central bank’s balance sheet and make it easier for the central bank to reduce the reserve requirement ratio.The central bank also cut this ratio by 2 percentage points for banks in areas damaged by the Sichuan province earthquake on May 12.'"
"'08-09-16,'1','The prices of Treasury bills and notes soared as investors sought safe places to park their capital. Oil prices dropped sharply on Monday, on concerns that demand for energy would shrink as economies slowed down.The market volatility was likely to continue for some time, economists and strategists said.“By my own forecasts, it gets worse before it gets better,” said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at in .On Tuesday, will report its earnings, and the Federal Reserve will decide whether to change short-term interest rates. On Wednesday, reports earnings.“Markets will remain unusually volatile for a period of time,” said Marc Stern, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, which manages about $50 billion. “This isn’t a fun period for most investors.”Financial companies led the plunge Monday, with Goldman Sachs dropping 19 percent and falling 15 percent. But stocks that investors view as particularly sensitive to a slower economy, like those of technology companies and manufacturers, were also punished.On Monday, the Dow closed at 10,917.51, down 4.4 percent. The S.& P. 500 index of the biggest public companies fared even worse, falling 59.00 points, or 4.7 percent, to 1,192.69, its lowest close since October 2005.The crisis on Wall Street caused by the bursting of the real-estate bubble has now lasted 13 months and has caused far more damage than analysts initially forecast.In the last two months, the chaos has taken a vicious turn, with investors quick to attack any financial company whose balance sheet appears less than pristine. Three of the five biggest American investment banks have failed or been bought since March, and and , the giant mortgage companies, were effectively nationalized earlier this month.Plunging housing prices have also crimped consumer spending and slowed the overall economy, which has lost 700,000 jobs this year. Even so, investors have generally seemed hopeful that the economy would avoid a full-scale recession. Now that confidence may be fading.Every major sector of the S.& P. 500 fell Monday, with banks and insurers down 10 percent, energy companies down 7 percent, and technology stocks off 4 percent. Health care and consumer staples companies, which are generally viewed as less tied to the overall health of the economy, fell less than 2 percent.High-yield — or junk — bonds, which are also sensitive to economic weakness, are also facing a sharp drop in economic activity, said Martin Fridson, chief executive of Fridson Investment Advisors, which manages about $240 million in junk bonds.So far this year, the default rate on high-yield bonds is about 4 percent, in line with historical averages.But a gauge of junk bond prices shows the default rate is likely to more than double over the next 12 months, Mr. Fridson said. And new junk bond issues have also dried up, preventing companies from raising capital, Mr. Fridson said.Meanwhile, the rates at which banks make loans to each other also rose sharply, a sign that financial institutions feel they must hoard their capital rather than risk lending it and potentially losing it.Mr. Stern of Bessemer said investors are concerned that the wave of Wall Street failures has not yet peaked.“There’s significant uncertainty about a number of large financial firms, including A.I.G., including ,” he said.“Until there’s resolution on firms of that size, investors are going to be skittish.” he said.Still, Mr. Stern said he was cautiously optimistic that housing prices might be bottoming in many areas, setting the stage for an eventual floor for the financial sector and the overall stock market.Asian stock markets tumbled sharply on Tuesday as investors were rattled by concerns over an expanding global financial crisis.’s benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index fell 4.8 percent to 11,632.99, falling under than 12,000-point level for the first time since mid-March.’s Kospi shed 6.2 percent, and ’s benchmark was off 4.6 percent.

"'08-09-17,'0','SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea carried out a rocket engine ignition test for a long-range ballistic missile at a previously unknown missile launching site this year, according to unconfirmed reports in South Korean news media on Tuesday.The engine test did not mean that a missile test was imminent. But it showed that North Korea was defying a United Nations resolution by continuing to develop its Taepodong missile series.When those missiles are fully operational, they would apparently be capable of reaching the West Coast of the United States.It is unclear whether North Korea has mastered the technology needed to arm its rockets with nuclear warheads. Its last Taepodong missile test, conducted in 2006, was considered a failure, with the rocket fizzling out 40 seconds after blastoff from the North’s east coast.It is also unclear whether the North Koreans know how to shrink a nuclear weapon enough to fit it on a Taepodong warhead.'"
"'08-09-17,'0','Almost three weeks after she was reported missing, a young teacher was spotted floating in New York’s Upper Bay on Tuesday and was rescued by deckhands from a Staten Island ferry.The teacher, Hannah Upp, 23, was plucked from the swells, taken ashore and transported to Richmond University Medical Center on Staten Island, where officials said she was in stable condition.The disappearance of Ms. Upp, a New York City teaching fellow set to begin her second year as a Spanish instructor at Thurgood Marshall Middle School in Harlem, baffled her relatives and friends and touched off a citywide search.

"'08-09-17,'0','On Tuesday, the Council’s standards committee was scheduled to hold a hearing on the legislation, but it was canceled at the request of the mayor’s office. “We asked for a postponement so we can give the issue further consideration,” said Stu Loeser, a spokesman for the mayor’s office.Some citizen actions groups and elected officials have expressed qualms with the proposal. Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester who is following the debate, called the city’s proposal a “fundamental lowering of the disclosure standards.”He said the city could provide relief to volunteer board members without reducing the thoroughness of the disclosure process for government officials.After the hearing was canceled, leaders of various watchdog groups were invited to discuss the legislation over lunch at City Hall. One participant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the luncheon was viewed as a private working session, said the city was considering creating a three-tiered disclosure system, with nonprofit volunteers required to provide a minimum amount of information, midlevel government officials a bit more and elected officials, deputy mayors and agency heads to adhere to complete disclosure.The Bloomberg administration has said that those who serve without compensation on nonprofit boards out of a sense of civic zeal should not have to file a comprehensive document sure as a condition of volunteering.But Alan C. Greenberg, a former chairman of Bear Stearns and a director of the American Museum of Natural History, said he would not balk at filing the forms, beginning this fall. “Whatever they ask me, I’ll answer,” he said. “I couldn’t care less.”Under the current rules, someone obligated to file can object to having the form publicly released, as Mr. Rosenfeld did. Mark Davies, executive director of the Conflicts of Interest Board, which interprets the city’s ethics code and oversees the disclosure process, ultimately ruled that Mr. Rosenfeld’s form was public and released the 12 pages that make up the public record. An additional four pages contain information that is never made public.“Although I accept Mark Davies’s decision to overrule my request for privacy,” Mr. Rosenfeld said, “my initial thinking in requesting that is that the income and capital value of a private law firm is not a matter of public record, and I felt that I, as one partner, owed it to my other partners not to make something public for the firm if I didn’t have to. So it had nothing to do with my views about what is appropriate or not appropriate with regards to the requirement of the law, but what I, as one partner, thought I should or should not do on behalf of the firm.”Mr. Rosenfeld said he thought his law partners might have been uncomfortable with his declaration that his capital account at the firm was worth $250,000 to $499,999, as Page 11 of the form notes.'"
"'08-09-17,'0','HONG KONG — Stock markets surged at the opening across much of Asia on Wednesday in response to the Federal Reserve’s rescue of the struggling insurer American International Group, but the rally began to lose steam by lunchtime on concerns about the United States financial system and China’s economy.Economists and fund managers welcomed the opening rally in Asian markets but were concerned about what comes next.“It seems related partly to the A.I.G. announcement but also partly the positive finish on Wall Street,” said Thomas Lam, the senior treasury economist at the United Overseas Bank in Singapore. “I don’t think the financial markets are out of the woods, they’re still pretty edgy.”The Dow Jones Industrials finished Tuesday up 141.51 points, or 1.3 percent at 11,059.02.The CSI 300 Index of shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen dropped 2 percent by midday as worries persisted about a real estate slowdown in mainland China. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong was down 1 percent by late morning after jumping 1.7 percent in early trading, while Singapore’s market had dipped 0.5 percent and Australia’s market had fallen 0.3 percent.But the Tokyo market was still ahead by 1.5 percent after trading resumed there following that market’s daily lunch break.Stock markets elsewhere in Asia also fared better, with the Seoul and Jakarta markets each up 2.4 percent in early afternoon trading.

"'08-09-17,'0','OBIKÀ is how Neapolitans say “here it is.”“It’s about time,” New Yorkers might respond.After more than a year of construction and red tape, the latest installment of Obikà, which opened its first mozzarella bar in Rome four years ago, will open on Sept. 22 in the sculpture garden of 590 Madison Avenue, the former I.B.M. building, between 56th and 57th Streets.Such a single-minded focus on so uncomplicated a cheese seemed like a passing fad when the first Obikà opened. But soon branches arrived in Milan, London, Turin and Parma. And plans are now in motion for locations in Florence, Kuwait City, Athens and Tokyo.Obikà created its own competition beyond Europe long before its North American debut.A visit to the one in Rome gave Nancy Silverton the idea for Mozza in Los Angeles. After leaving Campanile and La Brea Bakery, where she made her name as a chef and baker, Ms. Silverton was searching for a new venture.“I saw Obikà and said, perfect — a mozzarella bar,” Ms. Silverton explained. She first tried the idea out with her friend Suzanne Tracht, the chef and owner of Jar in Los Angeles. At Jar, they created Mozzarella Mondays, a weekly paean to Campania’s top cheese, with pizzas and dishes like burrata with charred marinated escarole, and burricotti with braised artichoke hearts. The restaurant was packed every Monday; the idea was a hit.A year later, in April 2007, she opened Pizzeria Mozza with Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich, and three months after that, Osteria Mozza, with a mozzarella bar in the center of the dining room where most of the restaurant’s antipasti are prepared.'"
"'08-09-17,'0','THE waitress reels off the specials of the day, noting the source of their ingredients, the style in which they are cooked, the sauces and reductions that anoint them — just about every detail short of their DNA.But she neglects to mention the price.Do you order blindly, gambling that the bill will not trigger indigestion and your credit card limit? Or do you take a deep breath and ask the prices, at the risk of seeming like Scrooge or a battered Wall Street investor?That familiar dining dilemma would end under a proposed Nassau County law that would require restaurants to divulge the prices of specials not listed on menus.“I’m sure that at one time or another you have been enticed by a waiter or waitress into ordering the special of the day, only to discover that it was really the price that was special,” said the proposal’s originator, Harvey B. Levinson, chairman of Nassau County’s Board of Assessors. Mr. Levinson does not regulate restaurants, but he discussed his pet peeve with other officials.David W. Denenberg, a county legislator and fellow Democrat, sponsored the legislation. “The special of the day should not be the surprise of the day in terms of price,” he said.The legislature’s presiding officer, Diane Yatauro, said she thought the proposal would pass.Restaurant owners may feel beleaguered under proliferating regulations on artificial trans fats, the disclosure of nutrition facts, warnings about undercooked meat, rescuing choking victims and alerts when nuts are present.But Chuck Hunt, executive vice president of the New York State Restaurant Association, a trade group, signaled resistance to this latest proposal.'"
"'08-09-17,'0','Mr. Chau is ostensibly focused on street food, but he harbors greater ambitions. Green papaya, traditionally a julienne in a salad, is run through a mandoline and paired with strips of cured duck breast ($11), coolly sweet and salty at once. Less successful are sweetbreads, which soak too long in a mushroom broth.To serve authentic food seems less of a priority than to appeal to the young and restless who haunt the Lower East Side. The grilled corn and chili mayonnaise, sticky with coconut ($6), is more South American than Southeast Asian.A savory crepe cradles peppered catfish ($14). Variations on num pang, a sandwich akin to the Vietnamese banh mi, come on sturdy baguettes ($12 to $16). Fillings like house-cured bacon, tucked in with charred chilies ($13), earn happy sighs. But veal hoisin meatballs err on the sweet side, and the oxtail was anemic.In June a less glamorous Cambodian outpost appeared on the Upper East Side. The forthrightly named Cambodian Cuisine started life in Fort Greene, but Manhattanites visiting the Brooklyn Academy of Music urged the chef, Jerry Ley, to move. Trouble with permits, faulty piping and a threat of eviction delayed its opening for nearly three years.The new space feels like the charming, hodgepodge restaurants you’d find in Phnom Penh: a family affair, with the chef’s wife and sister out front; Khmer wedding music trilling; TVs playing sports with the sound down. (All that’s missing is karaoke.)The menu is bewilderingly long and vague. Neophytes may wind up with a meal they can get at a Chinese restaurant. Best to heed the house favorites, including ahmok, a highlight of Cambodian home cooking ($14.95). Customarily made with fish steamed in curry until it achieves a mousse-like texture, here it takes the form of chicken, breaded with curry and swamped in coconut curd. It’s delicious, with biting citrus notes and a subtle flare of heat.The same goes for prahok, the fermented mudfish paste that’s in nearly every Khmer dish. It takes a starring role in prahok ktis, with ground chicken and the national spice palette of galangal, ginger and lemon grass, served with vegetables to dip ($17.95). The flavor is gratifyingly deep.No meal in Cambodia is complete without soup, or samlor, and the versions found here are the real deal, a pitched battle between sour and sweet, whether teeming with turmeric (samlor mchoo kroeurng, $14.95) or chunky with tomato and pineapple (samlor mchoo moen, $3.95).In a concession to local palates, salmon is offered: fried, of all things. Go for the tilapia instead ($17.95), a closer approximation of Mekong River fish.If Cambodian Cuisine represents the old Cambodia, gracious and earnest, Kampuchea is the new: erratic but exciting. Poised at opposite ends of the East Side, the restaurants are not so much rivals as points on a spectrum.HOURS Tuesday to Thursday, 5:30 to 11 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, noon to 4 p.m. and 5:30 to 11:30 p.m.; Sunday, noon to 4 p.m. and 5:30 to 10:30 p.m.'"
"'08-09-17,'0','spent Monday claiming as he had countless times before — that the economy was fundamentally sound. Had he missed the collapse of or the sale of , which were announced the day before? Did he not notice the agonies of the American International Group? Was he unaware of the impending layoffs of tens of thousands of Wall Street employees on top of the growing numbers of unemployed workers throughout the ?On Tuesday, he clarified his remarks. The clarification was far more worrisome than his initial comments.He said that by calling the economy fundamentally sound, what he really meant was that American workers are the best in the world. In the best Karl Rovian fashion, he implied that if you dispute his statement about the economy’s firm foundation, you are, in effect, insulting American workers. “I believe in American workers, and someone who disagrees with that — it’s fine,” he told ’s Matt Lauer.Let’s get a few things straight. First, no one who is currently running for president does not “believe in American workers.”More to the point, the economy is stressed to the breaking point by fundamental problems — in housing, finance, credit, employment, health care and the — that have been at best neglected, at worst exacerbated during the Bush years. And as a result, American workers have taken a beating.In clarifying his comments, Mr. McCain lavished praise on workers, but ignored their problems. That is the real insult.'"
"'08-09-17,'0','His campaign also sent to reporters the text of a speech he was delivering later Monday that included much starker language about the nation’s financial troubles, and by Tuesday had produced a new advertisement asserting that his experience and leadership were necessary in a “time of crisis.” Aides and advisers repeated to anyone who would listen the words that Mr. McCain has frequently spoken following his comments about the economy’s fundamental strengths: that “these are very, very difficult times.”Beyond striking a more populist tone and more explicitly acknowledging the nation’s economic problems, his campaign also began an effort Tuesday to cast him as a strong leader with profound experience on economic issues, given his service on the Senate Commerce Committee, where he was chairman for six years. That effort quickly hit a pothole when one of his economic advisers suggested that he had helped to create the BlackBerry, by virtue of his role in brokering telecommunications legislation; the McCain campaign later disavowed that, calling the suggestion “boneheaded.”For much of this year, Mr. McCain has seemed to struggle to strike a balance between conveying the optimism that many voters want in their leaders, and the I-feel-your-pain empathy that they crave during hard times. His task is complicated by the tension between his plans to continue many of the economic policies of the unpopular incumbent Republican president he hopes to succeed, and his pledges to improve the American economy and shake up Washington.As recently as January, Mr. McCain argued at a Republican debate that Americans were better off than they were eight years ago; by this summer he had released an advertisement that said “we’re worse off than we were four years ago.”His first big speech on the mortgage crisis warned against excessive government intervention; a month later he released his plan for government action to help people keep their homes.And a tour on which he embarked in July to emphasize his understanding of Americans’ economic pain was overshadowed when one of his top economic advisers, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, was quoted as saying that the United States was only in a “mental recession” and had become “a nation of whiners.”The most recent episode began Monday morning at a rally in Jacksonville, Fla., where Mr. McCain spoke of the troubles in the financial sector.“There’s tremendous turmoil in our financial markets and on Wall Street,” he said. “People are frightened by these events. Our economy, I think still, the fundamentals of our economy are strong. But these are very, very difficult times. And I promise you we will never put America in this position again. We will clean up Wall Street. We will reform government. And this is a failure.”His statement about the strength of the economy’s fundamentals was one he has made for nearly a year now, usually adding that times are tough or people are hurting. And in some ways, given that the recession that many have feared all that time has yet to be officially proclaimed, he has been borne out.But his repeating the remark on Monday, even as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers was helping send the stock market plunging to its steepest loss since the terrorist attacks of 2001, quickly became a political problem.His campaign swung into action then, to try to put the remark “in context,” as one top aide said, and to push back against what the McCain organization deemed unfair attacks coming from the Obama camp. In short order Mr. McCain’s campaign sent reporters the advance text — a step usually reserved for major speeches or pronouncements — of remarks he planned to deliver in Orlando, Fla., on Monday afternoon proclaiming that “the American economy is in crisis” and redefining what he had meant when he spoke about the “fundamentals.”On Tuesday morning, Mr. McCain was interviewed for CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC and CNBC. Again and again, he explained that he understood the “crisis” and called for a new commission to study it, modeled on the one that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks.On the NBC News television program “Today,” Matt Lauer asked Mr. McCain how he could say that “the fundamentals of our economy are strong” while his campaign was releasing an advertisement that said the economy was in crisis.“Well, it’s obviously true that the workers of America are the fundamentals of our economy, and our strength and our future,” Mr. McCain replied. “And I believe in the American worker, and someone who disagrees with that — it’s fine. We are in crisis. We all know that. The excess, the greed and the corruption of Wall Street have caused us to have a situation which is going to affect every American. We are in a total crisis.”Mr. McCain’s economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, told reporters Tuesday that the senator, who has often favored deregulation, would push for new regulations as president.“This story line that people want to write that somehow McCain himself or the McCain campaign doesn’t understand what’s going on with the economy is wrong,” Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. “You shouldn’t run for president by denigrating everything in sight and trying to scare people. Let’s be accurate. This is an economy that has serious problems.”By the end of the day, the campaign had gone back on offense. Here in Vienna, outside Youngstown, Mr. McCain noted at a joint rally with his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, that Mr. Obama had originally chosen a former head of the recently bailed-out Fannie Mae to lead his vice-presidential search (though the head of Mr. McCain’s search committee was himself a past lobbyist for Fannie Mae).And Ms. Palin said that Mr. Obama’s “tax plans really would kill jobs and hurt small businesses and make even today’s bad economy look like the good old days.”'"
"'08-09-17,'0','A struggle within the church over how Catholic voters should think about abortion is once again flaring up just as political partisans prepare an all-out battle for the votes of Mass-going Catholics in swing-state towns like Scranton.The theological dispute is playing out in diocesan newspapers and weekly homilies, while the campaigns scramble to set up phone banks of nuns and private meetings with influential bishops.Progressive Catholics complain that by wading into the history of church opposition to abortion — Mr. Biden brought up St. Thomas Aquinas, Ms. Pelosi discussed St. Augustine — Democratic officials are starting a distracting debate with the church hierarchy.“Getting into Augustine and Aquinas — it is just not helpful,” said Chris Korzen, executive director of Catholics United, a progressive Catholic group running television commercials that emphasize the church’s social justice teachings. “It would be wise for them to focus on how policies they are going to implement as leaders are going to move forward the church teachings they say they believe in.”Catholic conservatives, in turn, until recently had worried about a resurgence of the progressive forces in the American church. Now they are reveling. “The Democrats have actually given back some of the progress they had made,” said Deal Hudson, a Catholic conservative who worked with President Bush’s campaign and is now advising Mr. McCain’s.Once a reliable Democratic voting bloc, Catholics have emerged as a pivotal swing vote in recent presidential races. Evenly divided in a New York Times-CBS News poll over the summer, Catholics make up about a quarter of the national electorate and about a third in the pivotal battleground states of Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. “Whoever wins the Catholic vote will generally win our state and, most of the time, the nation,” said G. Terry Madonna, a political scientist at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa.And Scranton, a city dominated by the kind of white working-class Catholics who have often defected from the Democrats in presidential elections, is a focus of special attention this year. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, who generally underperformed with Catholics in the Democratic primary, lost the surrounding Lackawanna County by a margin of three-to-one to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who has family in the area. Now, the Obama campaign often highlights Mr. Biden’s local roots — he was baptized and spent his early years in Scranton — in a bid for Pennsylvania voters.Dozens of interviews with Catholics in Scranton underscored the political tumult in the parish pews. At Holy Rosary’s packed morning Masses on Sunday in working-class North Scranton and the Pennsylvania Polka Festival downtown that afternoon, many Clinton supporters said they were planning to vote for Mr. Obama, some saying they sided with their labor unions instead of the church and others repeating liberal arguments about church doctrine broader than abortion.“I think that one of the teachings of God is to take care of the less fortunate,” said Susan Tighe, an insurance lawyer who identified herself as “a folk Catholic, from the guitar-strumming social-justice side” of the church.But more said they now leaned toward Mr. McCain, citing both his experience and his opposition to abortion. Paul MacDonald, a retired social worker mingling over coffee after Mass at Holy Rosary, said he had voted for Mr. Kerry four years ago and Mrs. Clinton in the primary but now planned to vote for Mr. McCain because of “the life issue.”The choice of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as Mr. McCain’s running mate had clinched it for him, Mr. MacDonald said. “She is anti-abortion, anti-gay-marriage, anti-Big Oil, a lifetime member of the N.R.A., she hunts, she fishes — she is the perfect woman!”One parishioner ruled out voting for Mr. Obama explicitly because he is black. “Are they going to make it the Black House?” Ray McCormick asked, to embarrassed hushing from a half dozen others gathered around the rectory kitchen. (Five of the six, all lifelong Democrats who supported Mrs. Clinton in the primary, said they now lean toward Mr. McCain.)Mr. Madonna, the political scientist, said of the Catholic vote in white, working-class Scranton, “This is a tough area for Obama and some of it is race.”Both campaigns have dispatched teams of operatives and high-profile allies to help fire up like-minded Pennsylvania Catholics. The McCain campaign also disclosed last month that the senator was meeting privately with Cardinal Justin Rigali of Philadelphia. He met with Archbishop Charles J. Chaput of Denver shortly before the Democratic convention. Both were outspoken critics of Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Biden.Former Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, a director of Catholic outreach for the McCain campaign, said the meetings Mr. McCain has held with bishops around the country were “strictly ceremonial.” But the campaign welcomed the bishops’ comments about the Democrats and abortion, Mr. Keating said, as “statements of affectionate support” for Mr. McCain.Both sides say that Mr. Obama has a broader grass-roots turnout operation than Mr. McCain. In Pennsylvania, the campaign has trained organizers to talk about Catholic doctrine on abortion and other issues, held about two dozen “brunch for Barack” events after Sunday Mass and organized what the campaign calls “nun banks” to call lists of Catholic voters.Catholic Democrats outside the campaign have also worked hard to avoid repeating the experience of 2004, when a small group of outspoken bishops dominated news coverage of the church with criticism of Democratic Senator John Kerry focused on the single issue of abortion.Many parishes distributed a voter guide, produced by an outside conservative Catholic group called Catholic Answers, which identified five “nonnegotiable” issues for faithful voters: abortion, embryonic stem-cell research, human cloning, euthanasia and same-sex marriage.After the 2004 election, progressive Catholics started to organize and appeared to win some victories. In 2006, the bishops’ conference all but banned outside voter guides from parishes. And last fall, the bishops revised their official statement on voting priorities to explicitly allow Catholics to vote for a candidate who supports abortion rights if they do so for other reasons. And it also allowed for differences of opinion about how to apply church principles. The statement appeared to leave room for Democrats to argue that social programs were an effective way to reduce abortion rates, an idea the party recently incorporated into its platform.Their revisions set the stage for a clash of voter guides. Catholic Answers is again promoting its “nonnegotiables” voter guide; a new group, Catholics in Alliance for Common Good, has produced a chart comparing the candidates’ views on the war, taxes, the environment and other issues as well as abortion.The same debate is already playing out almost every day in the letters section of Scranton’s newspaper, said Jean Harris, a political scientist at the Jesuit-run University of Scranton. “It is a running debate between Catholics saying ‘abortion is the only issue’ and others saying ‘you have to look at the whole teaching of the church,’ ” she said.'"
"'08-09-17,'0','The lawsuit, consisting of 26 pages, was filed against two Democrats, State Senator Hollis French, who is overseeing the investigation, and Senator Kim Elton, who is the chairman of the Legislative Council, which voted on July 28 to open the inquiry; and Stephen E. Branchflower, the independent investigator, a former Anchorage prosecutor who now lives in South Carolina.The plaintiffs said they hoped to persuade the Legislative Council, a bipartisan body of House and Senate members who can convene to make decisions when the Legislature is not in session, to drop the inquiry by naming it in the lawsuit.At the heart of the lawsuit is the argument that the inquiry exceeds the Legislature’s constitutional power and that the process has been handled in a politically biased fashion intended to besmirch Ms. Palin’s reputation and affect the outcome of the November elections.“The defendants are conducting a ‘McCarthyistic’ investigation in an unlawful” and “partial and partisan political manner,” the lawsuit said.The ethics case has its roots in Ms. Palin’s decision this summer to dismiss Alaska’s public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan, who contends that he was dismissed for refusing to fire Ms. Palin’s former brother-in-law, Mike Wooten, a state trooper.Ms. Palin has denied that, saying his dismissal stemmed from his “insubordination” over budget matters.Tuesday’s lawsuit contends that the investigators have a “predisposition to make findings against Governor Palin” and are manipulating the timing of the inquiry “so as to affect the outcome of elections” by not agreeing to release the report after Nov. 4. Lawmakers have said the report would be completed by Oct. 10 to give both sides ample time to respond. “There is no nonpartisan reason that” the investigation “needs to be completed prior to the election on Nov. 4, 2008,” the lawsuit said.The lawsuit singles out Mr. French and Mr. Elton, pointing out that Mr. Elton gave $2,000 to the Obama campaign and citing comments in which Mr. French called Mr. McCain’s selection of Ms. Palin a “bad choice.” It also accuses Mr. Branchflower of having a conflict of interest because his wife once worked under Mr. Monegan. Mr. Elton said in a written statement that while the lawsuit is a distraction, the investigation would continue.Among the five lawmakers who filed the suit was Representative Wes Keller, an elder in Ms. Palin’s church whom she appointed to his seat.The reaction among their Republican colleagues was mixed. The House Speaker, John Harris, asked the Legislative Council to convene a meeting within the week to discuss the status of the investigation. “What started as a bipartisan and impartial effort is becoming overshadowed by public comments from individuals at both ends of the political spectrum,” Mr. Harris said in a letter to Mr. Elton.State Senate President Lyda Green, a Republican who has frequently clashed with Ms. Palin over policy, said the lawmakers who filed it were all “step-by-step followers” of Ms. Palin.“The McCain campaign is the one that has made this partisan,” Ms. Green said. “This was 100 percent bipartisan effort on the part of the Legislature to ask questions that deserve to be answered.”The attorney general told lawmakers Tuesday that members of Ms. Palin’s administration who had been subpoened would not cooperate with the investigation.Ms. Palin’s lawyer has sought to move the investigation to the state Personnel Board, whose members are appointed by the governor for four-year terms. But on Tuesday, Ed O’Callaghan, a former senior Justice Department official advising the campaign and Ms. Palin’s lawyer, said that even if Ms. Palin succeeds she had not yet decided if she would testify.A person briefed on the campaign activities in Anchorage also said outside lawyers in coordination with the campaign had volunteered legal advice to Ms. Palin’s lawyer. One volunteer is currently in Anchorage, and one or two others have been here to plot legal strategy over the past few weeks, the source said. Taylor Griffin, a campaign spokesman, declined to identify the lawyers by name.A handful of Alaskans, several of them prominent Republican donors, sought to have the investigation thrown out.'"
"'08-09-17,'0','In addition to the industrial portfolio, Lehman was also involved in large office deals in Arlington, Va., in May 2007, and Austin, Tex., in June 2007. By this time, there was already considerable anxiety in the market, prompted by the spate of high-priced deals that occurred after the Blackstone Group, the private equity company, bought the nation’s largest office portfolio, Equity Office Properties, for $39 billion and then began immediately to dismantle it.That April, Moody’s Investors Service said it would adjust its ratings to reflect a growing concern that lending practices had become too risky.“Lehman always had a reputation for being one of the most aggressive lenders in the commercial space,” said Robert M. White Jr., the president of Real Capital Analytics, a New York research firm.One real estate investment broker described Lehman as “the real estate A.T.M.”“They definitely were the mavericks out there,” said the broker, who did not want to be identified to protect his business relationships. “If you needed money, you could get it.”Though Lehman reduced its commercial real estate exposure in the third quarter to $32.6 billion, from $39.8 billion, this broker said it was slower than other banks to sell its real estate positions at a discount. Last week, before its announcement that it would file for bankruptcy protection, Lehman said it planned to spin off its real estate assets into a separate company rather than sell them in a depressed market.Lehman has said that 57 percent of its commercial real estate assets are in the United States, with 26 percent in Europe and 17 percent in Asia. Of its real estate positions, debt represents 58 percent and equity, 26 percent. Another 16 percent is in securities. The investment bank did not respond to a request for comment.Though Lehman may have been quick to finance deals, it did better as a loan originator than some of its competitors, said Frank Innaurato, a managing director of Realpoint, a credit rating agency in Horsham, Pa., that monitors commercial mortgage-backed securities. These are created when mortgages are packaged together and sold to investors as bonds.Of the 2,845 loans that Lehman originated for this bond market, only 0.5 percent are currently listed as delinquent, in line with the average for all the loans backing these securities. Loans originated by Bank of America, for example, have a delinquency rate of 0.7 percent, Mr. Innaurato said. And none of Lehman’s defaulted loans poses a major credit risk, he said.But Lehman itself continues to hold debt and equity positions that have dropped significantly in value, including several investments that were made after the market peaked.In October 2007, Lehman joined Tishman Speyer in buying Archstone-Smith, a publicly traded company with about 360 upscale apartment buildings across the country. Lehman put in $250 million in equity and led a group of lenders that contributed $4.6 billion in bridge equity for the $22.2 billion deal, which was financed in part by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Both Lehman and Tishman Speyer have written down their investment in Archstone by 25 percent. The partners sold a majority interest in 16 apartment buildings when the deal was completed. Since then, they have sold 13 additional Archstone properties, according to Jessica Ruderman, a senior marketing analyst at Real Capital Analytics.In June 2007, Lehman teamed up with Thomas Partners, a real estate investment trust based in Los Angeles, and the California State Teachers Retirement System in a $1.15 billion deal to buy 10 office buildings, including the new Frost Bank Tower, in Austin, Tex., that Blackstone was flipping from its Equity Office Properties acquisition. By last July, Lehman still had a $1 billion equity and debt investment in the deal, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert, a trade publication.Lehman and its partners paid an average price of $328 a square foot for the Austin deal. In the last year, however, buyers of office buildings in Austin paid an average of just $221 a square foot, said Mr. White of Real Capital Analytics.But an Austin broker, Jeff Coddington, a senior vice president of Oxford Commercial, an affiliate of Cushman & Wakefield, said the bulk of the portfolio bought by the Lehman consortium consisted of prime downtown office buildings. “Obviously, you pay a premium for this real estate,” he said.In another deal that occurred at the peak of the market, Lehman and its partner, Monday Properties, bought 10 office buildings in the Rosslyn section of Arlington, Va., for $1.3 billion. Lehman managed to sell its debt financing, but it continues to own 75 percent of the equity.Prices in Arlington have declined by about 12 percent, Ms. Ruderman said. “Compared to the rest of the market, that’s not so bad,” she said.'"
"'08-09-17,'0','The Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry’s trade group, issued a statement Tuesday assuring investors that “the fundamental structure of money market funds remains sound.” It noted, too, that in the only previous case of a fund breaking the buck, investors nevertheless were paid 96 cents on the dollar.But the Reserve Fund’s announcement may shake investors’ confidence. Moreover, institutional markets that are already under severe stress could be further shaken if this giant fund, and others like it, are forced to sell some less-liquid holdings to meet redemption demands from nervous customers in coming weeks.The Primary Fund allowed its share price to fall below a dollar “after reviewing the unprecedented market events of the past several days and their impact” on the fund, the company said in a statement.Specifically, the fund’s management, which boasted as recently as July about its cautious approach to the current crisis, determined that its stake in debt securities issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings, with a face value of $785 million, was essentially worthless, given the investment bank’s filing for bankruptcy protection. As a result, the fund said, its per-share value fell to 97 cents a share.The fund’s financial records also show that more than half of its portfolio on May 31 consisted of asset-backed commercial paper and notes from a host of issuers besides Lehman, few of them names likely to be familiar to the financial markets.If these arcane investments had to be sold or cashed out quickly to meet redemptions, it is unclear what prices they would fetch or whether the issuers would be able to return the fund’s money promptly, said Keith Long, of Otter Creek Management, a hedge fund based in Palm Beach, Fla.The Primary Fund reported that, until further notice, it would delay paying redemptions to customers for up to seven days, as permitted under mutual fund law. That delay will not apply to debit card transactions, automated clearinghouse transactions or checks written against the assets of the Primary Fund, provided that the transactions do not exceed $10,000 from single or affiliated investors.The fund is part of the complex run by Bruce R. Bent, who invented the money market fund concept with Henry B. R. Brown in 1970.Since their inception, money market funds increasingly have been seen by individual investors as a safe harbor in turbulent times. According to industry statistics, the assets of money funds have grown sharply since the credit crisis began to intensify last summer.But, as prospectuses and regulators make clear, money funds are not legally required to keep their share prices at or above a dollar, or to redeem investors’ shares immediately. Like all regulated mutual funds, their share prices are determined solely by dividing total portfolio assets by the number of shares outstanding, and they have seven days to meet redemption demands.Those facts would probably surprise most money fund investors, who have come to think of money funds as being “just like cash, just like a checking account,” a fund industry lawyer, Jay Baris, said.Whenever money funds have run into trouble, they have been propped up by parent banks and investment managers that provided the necessary cash. The single exception was in 1994, when one small regional money fund reported a share price below a dollar, according to the Investment Company Institute.The continuation of this informal bailout policy “is much discussed in the fund industry, because funds are so much bigger today,” said Barry P. Barbash, a fund industry lawyer with Willkie Farr & Gallagher and a former senior mutual fund regulator at the Securities and Exchange Commission.In the past, regulators tended to focus on banning money funds from buying inappropriate investments in the first place, he said. “But now,” he added, “we’re talking about instruments that were completely appropriate for a money fund when they were purchased. That’s what makes this so much harder.”Not only are funds bigger, markets are more turbulent. Many mutual funds have found their portfolios battered by investments in commercial and investments banks that were long considered close to bedrock on Wall Street. Money funds, too, suddenly found that some of their blue chips were tarnishing.But with individual mutual fund investors showing little sign of panic, most funds have simply ridden out the current turbulence.Several industry analysts said on Tuesday, however, that the Reserve Fund’s action came after its Primary Fund was hit by heavy redemption demands that intensified the impact of the Lehman losses.“We’re really in uncharted territory here,” said Peter Crane, the president of Crane Data, a fund industry newsletter.'"
"'08-09-17,'0','In nearly all these cases, the peasants who resist most intensely are often those who know they are qualified to do little beyond eke out a living off the land.If that fundamental anxiety feeds their protests, farmers and farmhands, often egged on by the politicians who seek their support, also stage protests to ratchet up the price of the land or to renegotiate deals.The target of their ire is often the government, which in most cases acquires the land and turns it over to industrial developers. The central government has yet to release a long-awaited national policy on how to compensate those who lose their land.“If the price is right, people will sacrifice the emotional attachment, but if you no longer have the guarantee of living off the land, then what do you do?” asked Subir Gokarn, chief economist for Standard & Poor’s in India. “The people who are being displaced are not the people who see themselves as benefiting immediately from the employment opportunities.”Medha Patkar, one of India’s best-known opponents of large industrial projects, said, “Land is livelihood, it’s not just property.”Last month in this rich farm belt in West Bengal State, protesters laid siege to the new Tata Motors plant, on one occasion preventing workers there from leaving.The protesters now want the government to return roughly a third of the 997 acres that the state acquired for the Tata factory. Some of the land was taken by force from farmers.Their demands have since forced the state government, controlled of all things by an elected Communist administration, to sweeten the deal without taking apart the factory site.On Sunday, in an effort to assuage the protesters, the government announced a new, more generous compensation package for those who had been evicted. It included a 50 percent increase in the price paid for the property and job training for one member of each displaced family. The ruling party and its opponents have been staging competing protests this week.That new deal only revealed the deep wedge of anxiety that the factory has driven through this cluster of villages.“We are farmers,” said Tayab Ali Mandal, 52, of Joymolla village. “We know only farm work; we don’t know any paper-pencil work.” He gave up his land last year, but bitterly. Now, he wants it back, and he rejected the government’s latest offer of a job in the plant.He said he would rather that his 16-year-old son continue to work in a small factory embroidering clothes, a traditional craft in his community. “I won’t go inside that place even to urinate,” he said. “We are disgusted by that place.”Gopal Santra and his clan, who refused to accept money for the land they lost, said they hoped the renewed agitation would prompt the state to raise its offer even more.The Santras also had land across the street from the Tata plant, which they sold to a private party a month ago for more than four times the price the state is now offering.Still others, like Sheik Muhammad Ali, who welcomed the Nano, Tata’s flat-faced, pint-size car, to his fields, threatened to put the naysayers in their place.Mr. Ali, 50, had readily given up his land, and through his contacts with Communist Party workers, started a business supplying cement to the factory developer.On Sunday, he was seething at the protesters who had halted work on the plant for the last two weeks and, in turn, his business.“There’s a limit to our patience,” he barked. “If you take my plate of rice, will I just let you go off with it?”Bidyut Kumar Santra, 30, a rare high school graduate in Joymolla, was among the lucky few to get jobs on the assembly line and, in turn, he realized how poorly equipped he was to keep up with events on the factory floor. The engineers all spoke English, to him an alien tongue.“I feel ashamed, like what kind of education did I get?” Mr. Santra said the other day and vowed to make certain that his son, who is in first grade, learns to speak English.The villages of Singur, where the Nano was to be produced, stand at the crossroads of the two Indias.For Tata, it is ideally located along a new national highway that heads north to New Delhi, the capital, and intersects an important east-west artery.For farmers, it is ideally located on the fertile delta plains of the Ganges River and fed by irrigation canals, making the earth so rich and red that it yields two rice harvests a year, in addition to potatoes, cucumbers and squash.West Bengal lured Tata here with heavy incentives, including a generous land lease and tax breaks from the state’s industrial development agency.Some of these details of the company’s hitherto secret contract with the government have emerged in recent days, prompting the company to go to court, where a ruling blocked further disclosures. If Tata were required to give back 300 acres of land from the factory site, as the opposition demands, it would have to evict auto-parts makers who are setting up shop next to the main Nano plant. Their proximity allows Tata to save on the cost of production. Those savings and the generous land and tax deal allow Tata to offer the Nano at an astonishing price of less than $2,500. The plant’s fate is uncertain. Tata, while welcoming the government’s proposed compensation package, has remained silent on its plans.The company has several other plants where it could produce the Nano in time for the Hindu festival season next month, traditionally a time of big spending. It has dangled the possibility of making the Nano elsewhere if the cost of production and the price of the world’s cheapest car rise too high.'"

"'08-09-17,'0','HOUSTON — The surge in gasoline prices slowed a bit on Tuesday as oil companies reported that the damage from Hurricane Ike to production platforms and refineries appeared to be relatively minor.The upbeat reports, though preliminary, were one of several reasons oil prices continued their slide Tuesday, dropping to $91.42 a barrel, down $4.29 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the second consecutive day of big retreats that have brought crude down more than $50 below its peak of $145.29 a barrel in July.The collapse in oil prices appears to be stem mainly from a growing perception that the global economy is sliding into a recession. It comes despite escalating rebel attacks on oil operations in Nigeria and two major hurricanes that have shut down 20 percent of the nation’s refining capacity and almost all of the oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico.But even as oil prices are sliding, gasoline prices are going up because of tightening supplies. The average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline rose overnight, to $3.85, according to AAA, the automotive club. That was considerably slower than the 16-cent-a-gallon rise in recent days as Ike passed through the Gulf and damage reports began to come in.The oil companies have flown over their oil and gas platforms and begun sending crews to their most important production and refining facilities. The preliminary news is good, with only 28 mostly older and smaller platforms out of a total of 3,800 oil and gas platforms reported destroyed and little flooding or structural damage to more than 20 refineries in and around Hurricane Ike’s path.'"
"'08-09-17,'0','Mr. Davis added: “Mr. Rangel believes, I believe and his colleagues believe that making inadvertent errors with no intention to conceal, no personal enrichment and no corruption of the public trust, is not disqualifying. He is prepared to let his constituents make the final judgment on his fitness to serve. Whatever the facts are, he has not dishonored the House, he has not dishonored himself, he has not done anything intentionally wrong.”Less than two years ago, Mr. Rangel realized his dream of gaining the chairmanship of the powerful committee, which writes the federal tax code. But he has been under fire in recent weeks for an assortment of ethical questions. Late last week, Ms. Pelosi brushed aside Republican requests that he step down, saying they were an attempt to politicize his problems during an election season.But Mr. Rangel acknowledged on Monday that there were more errors and omissions on his financial disclosure forms, and said he would hire a forensic accounting company to pore over his records. Some Democrats expressed worry that Mr. Rangel’s continued leadership could hurt the party’s candidates this fall.One concern Democratic leaders have discussed is whether Mr. Rangel’s vacating his post could set a precedent in which chairmen who have not been charged criminally may be forced from their positions.The New York Times reported in July that Mr. Rangel, a 19-term congressman, had leased rent-stabilized apartments from a prominent New York developer, including one that he used as a fund-raising office, in violation of state regulations.He has also been criticized for using his official stationery to solicit donations for a City University of New York school of public service that will bear his name, failing to report — or pay taxes on — $75,000 in rental income from his villa in the Dominican Republic over the past two decades and failing to disclose that the owners of the beach house had given him a mortgage on the property and waived the interest for more than a decade.Mr. Rangel tried to defuse the furor last week at a news conference and by releasing hundreds of pages of documents and assuring the public that he had “done nothing morally wrong.”He has said he would vacate the apartment he had used as a campaign office, but insisted that he had never helped — or even met — the landlord whose generosity allowed him to save more than $30,000 a year on the multiple rent-stabilized apartments.He also said he had never used his power or public position to help any of the business leaders or foundations he had asked to support the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at CUNY. Mr. Rangel also described his failure to disclose his income from the beachfront villa, or pay taxes on it, as an unintentional oversight by his staff members, his wife and himself.'"
"'08-09-17,'0','After climbing for months, the price of consumer goods and services fell in August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Tuesday.Economists noted, though, that prices were still much higher than they were a year ago, and that the one-month decline might not provide any lasting relief.The Consumer Price Index, a measure of retail goods and services in a selection of American cities, fell 0.1 percent in August from the previous month, after a 0.8 percent monthly increase in July and a 1.1 percent increase in June. Year over year, prices were up 5.4 percent, just below July’s 17-year high of 5.6 percent.“You have to recognize that there’s still considerable inflation in the economy in the sense that the year-over-year rate is elevated,” said Jared Bernstein, the senior economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute. “For the 11th month in a row, weekly paychecks have lagged behind prices on a year-over-year basis, this time by 2.5 percent,” he said, referring to the Bureau of Labor Statistics earnings report, also released Tuesday. “That’s a big decline in workers’ buying power.”While the price index is usually considered a major market-mover, analysts said the report was overshadowed on Tuesday by worries about the nation’s major financial institutions and the Federal Reserve’s decision to leave its benchmark lending rate steady.“We got an on-the-screws report on a day nobody cares about it,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. “If we weren’t losing major investment banks every other day, people ought to care about these inflation numbers. They are too high.”'"
"'08-09-17,'0','TOKYO — The fallout from the collapse of Lehman Brothers caused panicked selling of banking shares in Tokyo, where many of the failed American company’s biggest creditors were based. But analysts and bankers said the actual effect here would be limited.In its bankruptcy filing in New York on Sunday, Lehman said it had outstanding loans worth $1.6 billion to seven Japanese banks, including the Tokyo-based Aozora Bank, to which it owes $463 million. Lehman also said it owed $289 million to Mizuho Corporate and $231 million to Shinsei, among other banks.The disclosures helped initiate a sharp sell-off of Japanese banking stocks on Tuesday in Tokyo, which as a group posted their biggest one-day loss since 1987. The declines were led by Aozora, whose shares plunged almost 16 percent.Lehman’s local unit also added to unease on Tuesday when it filed for bankruptcy in a Tokyo court. Teikoku Data Bank, a market research company, estimated the local unit’s total liabilities at $32.7 billion, making it the second-largest bankruptcy in Japanese history. Calls to Lehman’s Tokyo corporate communications unit went unanswered.Trying to control the damage, the Japanese banks said Lehman’s figures greatly overstated their potential losses from Lehman’s collapse. They said they had limited their exposure by means of derivatives, collateral and selling parts of the loans to other investors.'"

"'08-09-18,'1','NEW DELHI — Markets in Asia dropped in early trading on Thursday, as fears of a global credit crunch drove investors to dump stocks and park cash in safe havens like gold and Treasuries.Financial stocks were the among hardest hit, with Australia’s MacQuarie Bank falling about 20 percent, Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group dropping 7 percent and South Korea’s Kookmin Bank falling by 6.1 percent before lunchtime in Asia. Investors are concerned that banks will halt lending to each other and to their customers.The Nikkei 225 average fell to a three-year low, down 3.6 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index tumbled 7.6 percent, China’s CSI 300 was down 5.8 percent and Taiwan’s Taiex Index was down 3.6 percent.“Global banking sector confidence is gone” said Brian Hunsaker, an Asia researcher at Fox, Pitt, Kelton in Hong Kong. The fear is that “banks will just stop lending” and that there will be nasty consequences for economies around the world, he said.Tuesday’s $85 billion bailout of American insurer A.I.G., rather than reassuring investors in Asia, seems to have stoked fear and confusion, strategists said, because it came after Lehman Brothers was allowed to file for bankruptcy. Investors feel that if an institution is large enough, it will be bailed out, but if it is smaller, there is no guarantee it will, Mr. Hunsaker said. “If everyone knew for certain there would be no more bankruptcies of financial institutions,” he said, “markets would be up.”Gold prices jumped as investors looked for safe havens from stocks. Gold rose 2.4 percent in trading in Australia before noon, capping an 11 percent rise on Wednesday. Mining stocks also climbed on the back of demand for gold.'"

"'08-09-18,'1','The F.D.A. has already said meat and milk from cloned cows, goats and pigs are safe and basically require no regulation.But it appears the genetically engineered animals will require stricter regulation. It is expected that each type of modified animal will require a separate approval, with the F.D.A. evaluating the human health effects of the food, the effects on the animal’s health and environmental effects.F.D.A. officials have said that treating a gene inserted into an animal’s DNA as a drug was the best approach, because it was unlikely Congress would pass entirely new laws governing genetically engineered livestock. The agricultural biotechnology industry has been pushing for guidelines to help propel the industry.“We feel this will enhance investor confidence in this technology,” Barbara Glenn, managing director of animal biotechnology for the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group, said Wednesday night. “A strong regulatory process translates ultimately into public confidence.”The first animal to go through these regulatory steps would probably be an Atlantic salmon developed by Aqua Bounty Technologies of Waltham, Mass. It contains DNA from another type of salmon and from pout, another ocean fish, that allows the salmon to grow to market weight in 18 months instead of 30.Still, the industry faces challenges beyond regulations. Consumers might reject food from modified animals, either because of safety fears or moral opposition to genetic tinkering. Meat and milk companies might not want it either. Some food companies, for instance, have said they will not use such meat or milk.Consumer groups say that the animal drug rules are not ideal for regulating modified animals because the F.D.A. does not have enough expertise to evaluate the animals’ ecological impacts. Also, they say, applications for approval of new drugs are confidential, so the public will not know what animals are being developed.“It doesn’t provide the public the opportunity to comment or see the data,” said Gregory Jaffe, director of the biotechnology project at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “That is problematic for a technology that is highly controversial.”The F.D.A. has been considering a policy for more than 15 years and its delay has irked both the industry and the critics of biotechnology.'"
"'08-09-18,'1','This advertisement for Senator John McCain is the third this week in which he addresses the nation’s financial crisis. Called “Foundation,” it is 30 seconds long and will be broadcast nationally.THE SCRIPT Voice of Mr. McCain: “You, the American workers, are the best in the world. But your economic security has been put at risk by the greed of Wall Street. That’s unacceptable. My opponent’s only solutions are talk and taxes. I’ll reform Wall Street and fix Washington. I’ve taken on tougher guys than this before.” Announcer’s voice: “Change is coming. John McCain.”THE SCREEN Against a dark background, Mr. McCain addresses the camera. As he speaks, scenes from the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange flash across the screen, followed by a street sign that says Wall Street. Then it is back to Mr. McCain, whose image gives way to that of Senator Barack Obama, with his running mate, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., in the background. Mr. McCain speaks to viewers one last time before the screen dissolves to a still photograph of him, accompanied by the phrase “The Original Maverick.”ACCURACY According to a 2007 study by the International Labor Organization, workers in Norway are the world’s most productive (when measured on an hourly basis), followed by the United States and France. Mr. Obama has offered detailed proposals on the economy, for stemming the mortgage default crisis and channeling investment into activities that will generate new jobs. He would raise capital gains taxes as well as income and Social Security taxes on those earning more than $250,000 a year, but the notion that he would also increase taxes on middle-class voters has been repeatedly debunked. Studies have found that Mr. Obama would offer most Americans a tax cut three times the size of what Mr. McCain proposes. Finally, Mr. McCain’s record has favored deregulation of the financial industry, a factor that analysts say has contributed to the credit crisis, and opposed creation of a government agency to oversee Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.SCORECARD Mr. McCain got himself into trouble on Monday by arguing that “the fundamentals of our economy are strong” despite the Wall Street crisis. This advertisement is an effort to rebound from that much-criticized statement with a populist appeal that echoes Mr. Obama’s mantra of “change.” In addition, Mr. McCain seems to be evoking his history as a prisoner of war to underline his argument that he has more experience than Mr. Obama and is therefore more qualified to be president. But he has on occasion also acknowledged that economics is not his strongest suit, so with the financial markets drifting into uncharted waters, it is hard to tell if the experience argument will convince voters.

"'08-09-18,'1','The whole transformation was fascinating in a cheap-thrills kind of way. It’s not every day, outside of “Incredible Hulk” movies, that you see somebody make this kind of turnaround in the scope of a few hours.On Monday in , Fla., McCain made his now-famous reassurance that the fundamentals of the economy were still good. It’s a longstanding line of his, but this was perhaps not the best week to dredge it up. So the handlers went to work, and by the time McCain arrived in a few hours later he was reprogrammed. And angry!“We’re going to put an end to the abuses on Wall Street! Enough is enough! We’re going to put an end to the greed!” he told a town hall meeting crowded with Hispanic Republicans. It was a rather jumbled message, but the new story line was firm. The fundamentals were not things like employment rates or trade statistics. The fundamentals were the workers.We are the fundamentals!And, naturally, the humble, hard-working fundamentals are good. Who could doubt it? Was trying to say that he didn’t think the American working man and woman was good? Was this the sort of thing they talked about at those fancy-schmancy Hollywood fund-raisers? Which, of course, John McCain hates. Give him some hard cider and a log cabin, and he’s happy as a clam.But wait! The fundamentals are in danger! At risk because of “greed.” Which John McCain was shocked to discover has been running rampant in the canyons of Wall Street.Now in an election like this, you expect a certain amount of tactical reimagining. McCain used to like reporters, and now he treats them as if they were carrying the Ebola virus. Fair enough, although given the fact that he’s terrible at speeches, and the famous town halls have now become Republican-only lovefests, the campaign really should invent some new method of communication. (And remember, the man doesn’t text.)It is also disconcerting, of course, to hear the Republicans rail against as if the Socialist Workers Party had been running things there for the last eight years. But really, what would you do if you were McCain? There aren’t a lot of options, and he never did like George W. anyway.This new tactic is different. McCain has always, genuinely, believed in dismantling government regulations, and there he was, vowing to create new “comprehensive regulations that will apply the rules and enforce them to the fullest.” It makes you think that he’s trying to impersonate something he’s not. Or wasn’t. Or might not be. The image is getting fuzzy.This week, while McCain’s chief economic adviser was telling reporters that it was wrong to “run for president by denigrating everything in sight and trying to scare people,” McCain’s ad people were unveiling a new spot announcing “Our economy in crisis!” and calling for “tougher rules on Wall Street” along, of course, with more . Mournful unemployment-line swells.I have absolutely no idea of how John McCain would handle a financial crisis if he were president. But on behalf of all the nation’s fundamentals I would like to say that he now has me ready to stage a run on the first bank in sight.'"
"'08-09-18,'1','Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the Democratic presidential nominee, still clearly sees an opportunity here. He has opened more than 41 offices in the state, compared with Mr. McCain’s 9.“I think people in the state, military and nonmilitary, are really ready for a change and will back Obama,” said John Smith, a machinist with the Air Force getting a haircut at the Naval Air Station Oceana here. “I voted for President Bush in the last election but it’s time for something different.”The northern part of the state, especially the Washington suburbs, has trended Democratic recently and grown by more than 15 percent in the last eight years. The area now accounts for about a third of the state’s population, making Virginia, which has 13 electoral votes, more a mid-Atlantic state than a Southern one.The state has also seen more than 200,000 new voters registered since January, about 45 percent of them under the age of 25, a demographic that has generally backed Mr. Obama.“But so much depends on Hampton Roads,” said Larry J. Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia, referring to a region with more than 1.5 million residents that includes Virginia Beach, Norfolk and a collection of midsize cities and sprawling suburbs.The three Democrats who have won statewide races in recent years — Senator Jim Webb, Gov. Tim Kaine and former Gov. Mark Warner — all had strong support from liberal and moderate voters in Northern Virginia. But they probably could not have succeeded without significant support in Hampton Roads.“On election nights, I can look at Virginia Beach’s returns, and if I see a big G.O.P. margin, I know the Republicans have won the state,” Professor Sabato said. “If, on the other hand, I see a close margin in Virginia Beach late on election night, regardless of which party wins the city, I know the Democrats have won the state.”Mr. McCain is expected to draw strong support from the more rural and southwest areas of the state, particularly among white working-class men, in a region that Mr. Obama lost in his otherwise resounding victory in the Feb. 12 primary, Professor Sabato said.Support for Mr. Obama is much stronger in the northeastern section of the state, especially in places like Fairfax County, near Washington, whose population is younger, wealthier, better educated and more diverse.Hampton Roads is more contested and tougher to predict, because it is home to core constituencies for both parties.The region has, for example, the world’s largest United States Navy base, the Norfolk Naval Station (Mr. McCain was a Navy pilot), more than 50,000 veterans and more than 500,000 people who work for the military. In 2004, President Bush won those who had served in the military by 57 percent to Senator John Kerry’s 41 percent.But more than 20 percent of Hampton Roads’s population is African-American, a group that has largely backed Mr. Obama.Matt Kresling, the field director for the Obama campaign in Virginia Beach, said that from the day he arrived here from Los Angeles, he felt confident the Democrats could win the state.The house where he is staying is owned by a retired Navy commander who voted for President Bush twice but plans to vote for Mr. Obama, he said.Mr. Kresling said that he holds events weekly where he finds himself in the awkward position of introducing neighbors to neighbors and friends to friends.“These people always just assumed they were alone in their support of Obama, and suddenly they were shocked to see how many people they already know backing him,” he added.Many Democratic presidential candidates have not even tried to take this area and more rural parts of the state, he said.But Chuck Smith, a retired Navy lawyer seated in the Silver Diner with two other Navy veterans, said he did not think Mr. Obama would win here.“This city is a military city in a military state,” said Mr. Smith, an African-American supporter of Mr. McCain. “Its voters know the importance of the military and of foreign policy experience, and they show up to the polls.”Since the selection of Ms. Palin, Republican organizers throughout the state have reported many more women volunteering, and phone calls expressing renewed support from evangelicals and anti-abortion voters.“Palin is going to make the difference in Virginia,” said Gail Gitcho, a Republican Party spokeswoman.Mark J. Rozell, a political science professor at George Mason University in Fairfax and an expert on the role of the religious right in politics, said he had watched the reaction to Ms. Palin from Christian conservatives in the state on their e-mail groups and blogs.“They were thrilled,” Professor Rozell said. “They were grudgingly willing to vote for McCain before, but after the announcement they started saying they were going to start working for the campaign.”But he said it was not clear whether that enthusiasm would last.“Except on stem cell research, most of McCain’s voting record is solid on their issues, but they worry about his instincts,” Professor Rozell said, adding that conservative evangelicals have not altogether forgotten Mr. McCain’s speech in 2000.In that speech during the presidential primary, Mr. McCain said, “Neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer reaches of American politics and the agents of intolerance, whether they be Louis Farrakhan or Al Sharpton on the left, or Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell on the right.”Mr. McCain later mended fences with Mr. Falwell, who invited him to speak in 2006 at Liberty University in Lynchburg. Mr. Robertson, who supported former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York in the primaries, has not said whether he will back Mr. McCain.In the northeastern end of the state, Ed Gerwin finished hanging a campaign poster in a new Obama office in Fairfax County before he began rattling ways he sees the state shifting politically.“The bumper stickers in my church’s parking lot, the comments from the friends of my daughters, the lawn signs, everywhere you look you see that this state is changing,” said Mr. Gerwin, a retired lawyer who has been volunteering for Mr. Obama since January.He added that as a devout Roman Catholic, he does not believe that Ms. Palin appeals to all religious people in the state.“I certainly don’t believe, for example, that the war in Iraq is a task from God,” he said, referring to comments that Ms. Palin made calling for prayer that the war was part of God’s plan.One of the wealthiest counties in the country, Fairfax has one-seventh of the state’s population. President Bush lost the county by six percentage points in 2004 and Governor Kaine and Senator Webb won about 60 percent of the vote in the county.Standing near a table with campaign fliers in Vietnamese, Spanish and English, Mr. Gerwin, who moved to the county in 1983, spoke of the influx of immigrants.“The campaign is registering upwards of 4 to 500 new voters in this county per week,” said Mr. Gerwin, adding that many of them are new citizens. “There is serious momentum here,” he said, “but whatever happens, it is going to be close.”'"
"'08-09-18,'1','Judith S. Kaye, the chief judge of New York, who was at the news conference, said the study had found some glaring injustices. “The justice court system as a whole is working adequately, but it is also plagued by problems that are not easily resolved,” she said.Some of the more serious problems uncovered in the report include a duplication of town courts in some areas and a severe shortage in other areas; justices who hand down sentences with seeming disregard for the law; and inadequate courtroom facilities.The report referred to one judge who threatened a litigant for not adhering to a court order, writing to him on court stationery, “Remember, I know where you live.” The report also described one courtroom that was no more than a small, poorly ventilated room attached to the town garage. Judges told the commission that the room got so hot in the summer that they had to wear shorts while hearing cases.The commission acknowledged that it had to forgo some of the more ambitious reforms in the interest of arriving at a swift solution. “These proposals are pragmatic and politically realistic enough to be accomplished in the immediate future,” the report said. “Ours do not require a complete dismantling of the justice court system, amendment of the State Constitution or elimination of nonattorney justices — steps that most members believe may be desirable in an ideal world, but that have politically doomed generations of past reforms.”Justice courts primarily handle traffic violations, but they also have jurisdiction over criminal matters. They hear more than two million cases a year and collect more than $210 million in fines and fees.Judge Kaye said two of the report’s recommendations — setting standards for court facilities and resources and requiring justices to meet minimum requirements for education and training — could be carried out by the judicial branch itself, without legislative approval.Mr. Dunne said that some of the recommendations could take years to implement, while others would require only weeks or months.Some reforms, like merging some of the 1,250 town and village courts and giving defendants the option to have their case heard by a judge who was trained as a lawyer, would require approval by the Legislature.The problems in town and village courts received widespread attention after a series of articles published in 2006 in The New York Times. That series detailed courts in which defendants were jailed illegally, subjected to racial and sexual bigotry and denied the right to trial.The report suggested that new justices be at least 25 years old and have at minimum a two-year degree from an accredited college. Under current law, justices need only be 18 and a resident of the town or village where they want to be elected.Training requirements for town justices would also become more stringent under the commission’s recommendations. Until recently, nonattorney justices had to take a 50-question true-or-false exam that had questions like “litigants who appear in court must be treated with respect.” Under a new set of requirements put in place after an earlier report on the justice courts, training will soon include more classroom time and at-home courses.But the commission report released on Wednesday calls for an even larger increase in the amount of time nonattorney justices have to spend in classroom training. “Two weeks of basic training, even if supplemented with in-home training, is generally not a sufficient primer for serving as a justice,” the report said.These requirements would not apply to sitting judges, however. “Instead, these new prerequisites would apply to new justices only,” the report said.'"
"'08-09-18,'1','“One by one, all of my safe havens aren’t so safe anymore, and that’s a bad thing,” said Matthew Tuttle, a certified financial planner and president of Tuttle Wealth Management in Stamford, Conn.“It used to be O.K. to have money in a CD, but now you have to worry, ‘Is my bank going to go under?’ ” he added. “You used to be able to buy a guaranteed annuity from an insurance company, but now you have to worry, ‘Is my insurance company going to go under?’ Or, you can have auction-rate preferred securities, but now there is no market.”Before you pull your cash out of your money market fund, you need to understand what you own. There is a big difference between money market mutual funds and the money market deposit accounts at a bank (and banks sometimes sell both).Money market funds are essentially mutual funds that invest in securities that, until this week, were deemed relatively low risk. Those include government securities, certificates of deposit, asset-backed commercial paper and other highly liquid securities.The Primary Fund got in trouble because some of its investments were in Lehman Brothers’ debt. To stop what is in essence a run on the fund, the Primary Fund has stopped all redemptions for up to seven days.A money market deposit account, on the other hand, is entirely different. It is an interest-bearing bank account that is insured — up to $100,000 per account and up to $250,000 for some retirement accounts — by the . Joint accounts are insured for $100,000 per account holder.If you had been putting your money into a money market account because you wanted to avoid all risk, then you should consider the money market deposit accounts and other accounts insured by the F.D.I.C., like certificates of deposit and regular checking and savings accounts.There are also Treasuries. But because so many investors were rushing into them on Wednesday, the yields have been driven down. “There is no yield,” said Saxon Birdsong, chief investment officer of - Financial Advisors. “It’s just a safety play.”If you decide to invest — or stay — in a money market fund, there are several things you should keep in mind.When it comes to money market funds, bigger may be better, several financial advisers said. Many investors use the funds that happen to be with the brokerage firm they are doing business with because it’s convenient to sweep money between accounts. But you should make sure your money market account is with a large, diversified money management company that would have the resources to make you whole, even if its funds ran into trouble.Mr. Tuttle said companies like Fidelity and Vanguard fit into this category.“I would be less comfortable with a smaller money management fund that didn’t have a lot of assets and wasn’t making a lot of money,” he said. “From my standpoint, I have a very high comfort level that if a Fidelity money market fund had toxic whatever, they would step up with the money from somewhere else to keep the buck.”Once you decide on a provider, read the prospectus carefully. If you don’t understand the investments, call the company and ask for more details.“I would encourage investors to not stop asking questions until they have complete comfort and peace about what they own,” said Karin Maloney Stifler, a certified financial planner with True Wealth Advisors in Hudson, .And if you are still nervous, ask your current mutual fund company or brokerage if it has a Treasury or government money market fund that invests only in Treasury securities, said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at , a personal finance Web site.“You will have to settle for a lower yield,” he said, “but it takes risk off the table.”Indeed, this is one of those times when you shouldn’t necessarily choose a fund because it has a high yield. That higher yield could indicate that the fund is investing in riskier securities.“This is a painful but poignant reminder that anything that is paying you a higher yield, you have to assume is carrying a higher risk,” said Peter Crane, president of Crane Data, which tracks money market mutual funds.Finally, investors should diversify cash holdings, just as they would with a stock and bond portfolio.“If you have money market mutual funds with multiple providers, you are hedging against the risk that any one of them will encounter problems that they can’t survive,” Ms. Stifler said.But if you don’t have a strong stomach for the slightest risk, stick with investments that are F.D.I.C. insured, even if you need to sacrifice a little yield.After all, “this is a portion of your portfolio that should help you sleep at night, not keep you awake,” Mr. McBride said.The Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry’s trade group, compiled a list of statements late Wednesday from money-market mutual fund managers that assured investors their funds were safe.

"'08-09-18,'1','The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued the Grand Central Partnership in Manhattan on Wednesday on behalf of four security guards who say a policy requiring them to tuck their dreadlocks under their uniform caps discriminates against their Rastafarian beliefs.The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, accuses the business improvement district partnership of violating federal civil rights laws by disciplining the men.According to the suit, the four men — Deon Bailey, Brian Lee, Milton Marcano and Frantz Seraphin — were repeatedly reprimanded, and Mr. Bailey, Mr. Lee and Mr. Seraphin each received a two-day suspension in 2006.A spokesman for the partnership said that it had been trying to work with the employees and their union to accommodate their religious beliefs, and that the lawsuit had come as a surprise.Robert D.

"'08-09-18,'1','The transaction also highlights what a tumultuous period the last decade has been for New York and for the financial sector, which has been the main engine of its economy.The building Barclays is buying — pending approval from the federal bankruptcy court — was originally meant for another financial giant, Morgan Stanley. Having financed some of the biggest successes of the tech-stock boom of the 1990s, like Netscape, Morgan Stanley was thriving and expanding beyond the capacity of its headquarters in Times Square.In 1999, it began constructing the building a few blocks away on Seventh Avenue at 49th Street, a million-square-foot tower of granite, steel and glass with open floors designed to accommodate trading desks. Not long after the frame was completed and the 15,000 square feet of video screens were installed, terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center and awakened corporate executives to the hazards of having their operations concentrated on an island.The core of Lehman’s American operations was housed across the street from the trade center in a building that was damaged and could not be reoccupied for months. Lehman executives began searching for a new home just when Morgan Stanley executives started rethinking the idea of filling two high-rises a few blocks apart in Midtown. (Morgan Stanley, which later bought a campus in Westchester, was reported to be considering an offer on Wednesday to sell itself to Wachovia, a banking company based in North Carolina.)Four weeks after the terrorist attack, Lehman arranged to buy the unfinished building for about $700 million and soon became the first major financial firm to abandon Lower Manhattan after 9/11. The pace of fitting out the interior of the building was accelerated to reunite Lehman’s employees, who had scattered to temporary quarters around the region, and Morgan Stanley’s ambitious plans for using the video screens were scrapped.Rather than selling space on the signs for the sort of consumer advertising that lights up Times Square, executives at Morgan Stanley had considered using the screens to illustrate the constant flow of commerce with live images, according to Peter Frankfurt, the creative director at Imaginary Forces, the company that designed and programmed the screens for the building before Morgan Stanley sold it.“They realized it could become a great brand opportunity for Morgan Stanley,” Mr. Frankfurt said. “The sign could actually play an almost organic role in terms of reflecting activity in the markets” — markets of all kinds, from the stock exchange in Hong Kong to local supermarkets.Lehman shelved that plan and opted for montages of crashing waves and rippling fields of wheat punctuated frequently with the firm’s name. “They took a super-basic approach: This is a motion billboard that’s not live,” Mr. Frankfurt said, not bothering to hide his disappointment.Mr. Frankfurt said he thought it was ironic that the screens became the symbol of Lehman’s demise this week when they served as the 24-hour-a-day backdrop for televised reports from around the world. He said he did not know what Barclays would do with the building or the screens, but he said they could be effective tools in building the company’s image in New York.“It’s basically a very cool canvas from which to broadcast and communicate any number of their messages,” Mr. Frankfurt said. “You can use that screen very articulately to describe yourself. Or they could just do what Lehman did, but look what happened to Lehman.”A spokesman for Barclays Capital, Seth Martin, declined to say whether the company would make the building its American headquarters or to comment about how it might use the screens. Barclays Capital has about 4,000 employees in the United States, many of them in offices on several floors of the MetLife building above Grand Central Terminal.Barclays has agreed to pay $400 million for the naming rights to the arena planned for Brooklyn that is supposed to be the next home of the New Jersey Nets basketball team. It would be called the Barclays Center. But long before the arena is built, there could be another Barclays center a couple of blocks north of Times Square.'"
"'08-09-18,'1','“The W.N.B.A. is in its 12th season, and I think a lot of women college basketball fans are following their college players,” Liberty Coach Pat Coyle said.Much of the newfound interest can be attributed to the transcendent Parker, a graceful athlete who led Tennessee to two N.C.A.A. championships, outdunked the boys in high school, and became only the second woman to dunk in a W.N.B.A. game, after Leslie.Sue Bird, Swin Cash and Sheryl Swoopes, who are also bound for this season’s playoffs, are among the players who have won N.C.A.A., W.N.B.A. and Olympic titles. Not one, however, captured them in the same year.Parker said that she could finally see “the light at the end of the tunnel,” after a winding and wearying season.“Now, we put ourselves in a good position and we just have to take care of business,” she said.Swoopes is in her first season with the Storm (20-10) after playing her previous 11 with the Houston Comets. She is part of a star-studded conglomerate with Bird, Cash, Yolanda Griffith and Lauren Jackson, although Jackson, the team’s leading scorer and the league’s most valuable player, has an ankle injury.If the Sparks advance to the league finals, they could face the Shock, against which Parker garnered headlines across the nation in the fracas at the Palace. Parker was among three players and a coach ejected in the waning moments of a July regular-season game after a brief skirmish involving her and the Shock’s Plenette Pierson.The Shock is a favorite against Indiana and went 22-12 during the regular season after falling in last season’s finals to the Phoenix Mercury.In the East’s other matchup, a Connecticut team that started the season with six rookies heads into the playoffs with legitimate M.V.P. contenders in Asjha Jones and Lindsay Whalen.The Liberty counter with the youngest team in the league but with a core that has been kept intact much of the last two seasons.Both teams aspire for their first title in a league that appears to be on the upswing, but that hopes, like Parker, that the best remains ahead.'"

"'08-09-18,'1','Crispin Porter, part of , relishes efforts to transform perceived negatives into positives. For another client, Burger King, the calorie-stuffed menu is portrayed to a target audience of young men as a rebellious personal choice to “Have it your way.”Mr. Gates makes a cameo appearance in the new Microsoft spots, along with celebrities like the actress , the author and the singer Pharrell Williams. (Mr. Seinfeld is gone, at least for now.)But the stars are everyday PC users, from scientists and fashion designers to shark hunters and teachers, all of whom affirm, in fast-paced, upbeat vignettes, their pride in using the computers that run on Microsoft operating systems and software.Among them are more than 60 Microsoft employees, who are accompanied in the ads by e-mail addresses — even Mr. Gates’s ( ).Apple executives have been “using a lot of their money to de-position our brand and tell people what we stand for,” said David Webster, general manager for brand marketing at Microsoft in Redmond, Wash.“They’ve made a caricature out of the PC,” he added, which was unacceptable because “you always want to own your own story.”The campaign illustrates “a strong desire” among Microsoft managers “to take back that narrative,” Mr. Webster said, and “have a conversation about the real PC.”A giant advertiser responding to the disparagement of a smaller rival can be fraught with peril. Consumers may see it as a validation of the claims, or even bullying. On the other hand, ignoring the taunts can damage images and sales.In the car-rental wars, the market leader, , long kept silent about a cheeky Avis campaign that proclaimed: “We’re No. 2. We try harder.” But after Avis revenue grew robustly, Hertz shot back: “For years, Avis has been telling you Hertz is No. 1. Now we’re going to tell you why.”Similarly, said nothing as -Cola challenged its hegemony in the cola category — until it turned tradition upside-down in 1985 by bringing out New Coke, with a more Pepsi-like taste. , who was in charge of the PepsiCo beverage business, celebrated by co-writing a book titled “The Other Guy Blinked: How Pepsi Won the Cola Wars.”Riffing on the Apple ads is “a smart way of changing the dialogue,” Mr. Webster said, “without taking them through the mud.”Charles Rosen, chief executive at Amalgamated, an agency in New York that specializes in what he calls “cultural branding” for clients like Ben & Jerry’s , said it made sense for Microsoft to engage Apple.Through its campaign, which mocks the PC as it celebrates the Macintosh, “Apple represents the ideology of Silicon Valley, taking on big business as in Microsoft,” Mr. Rosen said.That gives Apple “badge value, identity value,” he added, among consumers who prize brands they deem populist.Trying to gain more firepower for ads by generating talk in the popular culture is another tactic of Crispin Porter’s. For example, commercials for became the subject of considerable buzz because they showed something rarely depicted in auto advertising: sudden crashes.That was what the two-week Microsoft teaser campaign accomplished, according to companies that track discussions about brands.At first, “the ads were ambiguous and confounding to some,” said Ted Marzilli, senior vice president and general manager of the brand group at the New York office of YouGovPolimetrix, a research company, but as they continued they helped improve perceptions about Microsoft.On Sept. 4, when the teaser ads started, the “buzz” about Microsoft was 25 percent positive and 13 percent negative, Mr. Marzilli said, and by Tuesday it was 28 percent positive and 8 percent negative. Microsoft “has been beat up pretty badly by the Apple advertisements in the last six months,” he said. “These are strong numbers, good numbers, for Microsoft.”Another research company, Zeta Interactive, using what it calls its Relevant Noise tool to mine places online like blogs and message boards for brand conversations, found what was described as overwhelmingly positive buzz surrounding Microsoft from Sept. 3 through Monday.Of the posts analyzed by Relevant Noise during that stage of the teaser campaign, 63 percent were characterized as positive and 37 percent as negative.“It did what it needed to do,” said Rob Reilly, partner and co-executive creative director at Crispin Porter in , Colo., and . “People who got it, got it.”To segue from the teaser ads to the actual campaign, he added, the phrase “I’m a PC” will serve to “set up the notion the real PC is not necessarily who we’ve been portrayed as” in the Apple ads.“You can ignore it,” Mr. Reilly said of the Apple campaign, “or you can find a clever way to embrace it, to hug it to death, to turn it to your advantage.”The celebration of PC users is intended to show them “connected to this community,” he added, “of people who are creative, who are passionate.”As for the risks of responding to a smaller competitor, “Apple has done a tremendous job marketing their products,” Mr. Reilly said, so “I don’t know if it’s David versus Goliath anymore.”The theme of “Life without walls” was the concept for the Microsoft campaign “from the beginning,” he added, because it declares “that the goal of Windows is to help remove the walls in your life, now and in the future.”In addition to commercials on television shows like “Grey’s Anatomy” on Thursday, ads will appear in local and national newspapers in addition to new content added to the Web site, which will be reachable from the microsite .Coming magazine and outdoor ads focus on how Windows can be used for mobile devices, TV sets and laptops along with PCs.Beginning on Thursday night, visitors to windows.com will be able to upload video clips and photographs demonstrating how they, too, are PCs. Some photos will be chosen to appear on electronic signs in Times Square from Friday through Oct. 13 and others will be chosen for use in Microsoft banner ads.“This is just the beginning, the first phase of the campaign,” said Mich Mathews, senior vice president for marketing at Microsoft. “We’re on a journey to reposition the PC.”“The conventional wisdom may be, ‘Hey this is motivated by Apple,’ ” she added, “but there has been a re-engineering of Microsoft.”Ms. Mathews listed several steps to improve the consumer perception of Windows, which has been tarnished by problems with the Vista operating systems. Among them are the hiring by Microsoft of hundreds of trained employees, or Windows gurus, to work at retailers like and .As for Mr. Seinfeld, will he return at some point?“Jerry is a friend of the agency and Microsoft,” Mr. Reilly of Crispin Porter said, adding in a sly allusion to Brand X, “You like to keep your friends close — and your enemies closer.”'"
"'08-09-18,'1','Q. What is the difference between a solid-state hard drive and flash memory?A. Solid state is a general term; flash is a type of solid-state memory. Those little keychain drives that plug into U.S.B. ports? Those are flash drives. Some new laptops are now featuring solid-state drives that have far greater capacity than a thumb drive, and are replacing old-fashioned hard drives with this new technology. Unlike a traditional hard drive, which is made of spinning magnetic disks, motors and other hardware, a solid-state hard drive has no moving parts to break down or wear out.Other solid-state drives may use SDRAM — synchronous dynamic random access memory — instead of flash memory, but in either case, there are still no moving parts. Without the mechanics, a solid-state hard drive is lighter and uses less power than a disk-based drive. It can better withstand bumps, bangs and other physical realities of portable computing.The downside is that solid-state hard drives are much more expensive than hard-disk drives. For example, the basic price for Apple’s MacBook Air laptop starts at $1,800 for the model with an 80-gigabyte hard-disk drive — but jumps to about $2,600 for the same computer with a 64-gigabyte solid-state drive. But like flash drives, which in small 512-megabyte or 1-gigabyte sizes have replaced pens as cheap corporate giveaways, solid-state drives should get less expensive and much more common relatively soon.'"
"'08-09-18,'1','By contrast, at this point in the 2004 campaign, President Bush was leading Senator of , the Democratic challenger, by 56 percent to 37 percent among white women.Among other groups, Mr. Obama had a slight edge among independents, and a 16-percentage-point lead among voters ages 18 to 44. Mr. McCain was leading by 17 points among white men and by the same margin among voters 65 and over. Before the convention, voters 65 and older were closely divided. In the latest poll, middle-age voters, 45 to 64, were almost evenly divided between the two.The latest Times/CBS News nationwide telephone poll was taken Friday through Tuesday with 1,133 adults, including 1,004 registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all respondents and for registered voters.The poll was taken during a period of extraordinary turmoil on Wall Street. By overwhelming numbers, Americans said the economy was the top issue affecting their vote decision, and they continued to express deep pessimism about the nation’s economic future. They continued to express greater confidence in Mr. Obama’s ability to manage the economy, even as Mr. McCain has aggressively sought to raise doubts about it.This poll found evidence of concern about Ms. Palin’s qualifications to be president, particularly compared with Senator of , Mr. Obama’s running mate. More than 6 in 10 said they would be concerned if Mr. McCain could not finish his term and Ms. Palin had to take over. In contrast, two-thirds of voters surveyed said Mr. Biden would be qualified to take over for Mr. Obama, a figure that cut across party lines.And 75 percent said they thought Mr. McCain had picked Ms. Palin more to help him win the election than because he thought that she was well qualified to be president; by contrast, 31 percent said they thought that Mr. Obama had picked Mr. Biden more to help him win the election, while 57 percent said it was because he thought Mr. Biden was well qualified for the job.This poll was taken right after Ms. Palin sat down for a series of high-profile interviews with on ABC News.Over the last two weeks, Mr. McCain has increasingly tried to distance himself from his party and President Bush, running as an outsider against Washington. The poll suggested the urgency of Mr. McCain’s task: The percentage of Americans who disapprove of the way Mr. Bush is conducting his job, 68 percent, was as high as it has been for any sitting president in the history of polling. And 81 percent said the country was heading in the wrong direction.The poll found that 46 percent of voters thought Mr. McCain would continue Mr. Bush’s policies, while 22 percent said he would be more conservative than Mr. Bush. (About one-quarter said a McCain presidency would be less conservative than Mr. Bush’s.) At a time when Mr. McCain has tried to appeal to independent voters by separating himself from his party, notably with his convention speech, 57 percent of all voters said they viewed him as a typical Republican, compared with 40 percent who said he was a different kind of Republican.Although nearly half of voters also described Mr. Obama as a typical Democrat, the party’s brand is not as diminished as the Republicans’; the had a favorability rating of 50 percent in August, compared with 37 percent for the Republicans, a fairly consistent trend in the Times/CBS News Poll since 2006, and part of the general political landscape that many analysts believe favors the Democrats.In one of the sharpest differences highlighted in the poll, 37 percent said that Mr. McCain would bring real change to Washington, up from 28 percent before the two parties’ conventions. But 65 percent of those polled said that Mr. Obama would bring real change to Washington.Despite weeks of fierce Republican attacks, Mr. Obama has maintained an edge on several key measures of presidential leadership, including economic stewardship. Sixty percent of voters said they were confident in his ability to make the right decisions on the economy, compared with 53 percent who felt that way about Mr. McCain. Sixty percent also said he understood the needs and problems “of people like yourself,” compared with 48 percent who said that of Mr. McCain.More than twice as many said an Obama presidency would improve the image of the around the world, 55 percent, compared with those who believed a McCain presidency would do so. Mr. Obama also gets high marks for “sharing the values most Americans try to live by,” despite concerted Republican efforts to portray him as elite and out of touch with average voters. Sixty-six percent said Mr. Obama shared their values, compared with 61 percent who said that about Mr. McCain.Mr. McCain, however, was maintaining some core advantages, particularly on preparedness to be president and ability to serve as commander in chief. Forty-eight percent said Mr. Obama was prepared enough to be president, compared with 71 percent who rated Mr. McCain as adequately prepared.Fifty-two percent said it was “very likely” that Mr. McCain would be an effective commander in chief, twice as many as felt that way about Mr. Obama.The two men received similar rankings when voters were asked about what had long been perceived as a McCain strength: the ability to make the right decisions about the war in Iraq. Fifty-two percent said they were “very” or “somewhat” confident in Mr. Obama’s ability on this front; 56 percent said they felt that way about Mr. McCain.In general, Ms. Palin was viewed more favorably (40 percent) than unfavorably (30 percent). She was particularly popular among fellow Republicans, conservatives and white voters who describe themselves as evangelical Christians, which explains her energizing effect on the Republican base. Nearly 70 percent of Mr. McCain’s supporters said they were enthusiastic about the selection of Ms. Palin; 27 percent of Mr. Obama’s supporters said they were enthusiastic about the selection of Mr. Biden.When asked who they thought would win in November, 45 percent said Mr. Obama and 38 percent said Mr. McCain.'"
"'08-09-18,'1','In a statement, GLG said that it had removed the bulk of its assets from Lehman last week and that any remaining exposure was not material.None of that, however, dissipates the darkening mood that has taken root within the hedge fund industry here, one that is felt most acutely in the London enclave of Mayfair where GLG and most other funds are based.“The bling is gone,” said Peter Wetherell, a prominent real estate agent in Mayfair, whose client list includes hedge fund executives, Arab sheiks and others in search of a Mayfair mansion.With his bonhomie, deep tan and a chunky silver watch that hangs heavy on his wrist, Mr. Wetherell seems to be a fading emblem of more exuberant times.Standing outside his office, just opposite Scott’s, the fashionable restaurant and nightclub, he shakes his head.“It’s tough out there and the streets are quieter now,” he said.“You will see people being less ostentatious about their wealth — but it hasn’t been a bad party, has it?”In Mayfair, the first signs of what many say could be a debilitating hangover are already evident.According to Mr. Wetherell, the number of deals he has handled so far this year is down sharply — 48, compared with 136 a year earlier. And during the usually busy lunch hour, many of the shops on Mount Street — from the Porsche dealership where £112,000, or $200,000, Turbo Carreras are for sale to a tobacconist selling £47 Havana cigars — were empty.The list of hedge fund implosions in 2008 is growing here. It began with the precipitous fall of Peloton Partners this spring and has included others like Pentagon Capital Management. More recently, the troubles have extended to funds caught short when commodity prices began to plummet, including RAB Capital and Red Kite Capital.“There are more funds in forced liquidation than at any time I have seen in the last 10 years,” said Christopher Keen, a partner at Culross Global Management, which manages a portfolio of outside hedge funds for investors.But it is the condition of GLG, which manages $23 billion and will celebrate the first anniversary of its listing on the New York Stock Exchange in November, that symbolizes both the headiness and the vulnerability of the hedge fund boom in London.Founded by a group of former Goldman Sachs private-client executives in 1995, GLG — the name composed of the first letter of the last name of the three founding partners, Noam Gottesman, Pierre Lagrange and Jonathan Green — became a meritocratic melting pot by attracting aggressive, foreign-born traders and giving them room to run.Their extraordinary asset growth swung the pendulum of influence from The City, as the financial district is known, and the traditional banking and insurance company arbiters of financial power to the hedge fund center in Mayfair.As their returns soared, so did their swagger. The London media paid close attention to the £150 million paydays of the leading fund operators, their grand houses and their country mansions.In 2006, GLG’s founding partners forced out one of their most profitable traders, Philippe Jabre, a Lebanese native, after his trading practices became the target of a regulatory investigation.That they are now losing a second trader, Mr. Coffey, an emerging market expert from Australia who left $250 million in his pay on the table to start his own firm, has raised questions among London’s hedge funds about their ability to retain talented traders.Worries were only compounded after Lehman’s collapse as investors tried to determine GLG’s exposure. The crux of the issue is that Lehman, as a dominant provider of both complex derivative assets to funds and a prominent insurer of credit default swaps, was an essential conduit for hedge funds investing in these esoteric areas.To the extent that such assets remain at Lehman, in the hands of administrators, large funds will have trouble gaining access to them in the event that investors choose to take out their money. Lehman has an 11 percent stake in GLG.GLG’s announcement that it had been pulling its funds from Lehman for months will comfort investors and counters a view held by some that the doors closed before all money could be transferred.The Barclays purchase of Lehman’s brokerage system should also ease investor concerns, but it does not ensure immediate access to funds.In a presentation at a Lehman conference this month, Mr. Gottesman, GLG’s co-chief executive, argued that the firm — with its diversified lineup of funds — was well placed to survive the volatile markets.He added that GLG’s recent performance had been affected by a plunge in returns from Mr. Coffey’s main fund and that suitable replacements have already been hired to succeed him — including a top proprietary trader from Goldman Sachs, two senior managers from Morgan Stanley and an executive from the bond firm Pimco.But as one hedge fund executive said: “Lehman was a counterparty to everyone — nobody really knows how it will end.”'"
"'08-09-18,'1','“Bill Otterson created the culture here, telling scientists and research people to share ideas and then compete in the marketplace,” said Mr. Roth, a pharmaceutical industry entrepreneur who took Connect’s reins in 2004. Today, he says of San Diego, “We have a chance to become the premier region in the country for innovation.”Rolf Muller, a founder and chief scientific officer of Biomatrica Inc., is one of the people Connect has helped. Mr. Muller and his wife, Judy Muller-Cohn, chief executive of Biomatrica, are molecular biologists. They met at Oregon State University, married, went to Paris to earn doctorates at the Pasteur Institute and came to San Diego 14 years ago to work in bioscientific research.As Mr. Muller recounts it, some of their work involved storing samples of genetic DNA and RNA, which requires preserving cell structures in freezers capable of extremely low temperatures.“For 80 years, we have stored tissue samples and cellular structures in freezers. The costs are huge — $60,000 a year at least for each freezer, and 500 university laboratories have hundreds of freezers to store 10,000 samples a week,” Mr. Muller said.The Mullers were studying small animals called tardigrades that exist in extreme environments, like the Sahara desert. Tardigrades can suspend their metabolism by dehydrating themselves and living in such a state for as long as 10 years.“They dry up completely but come back to life when you put them in water,” Mr. Muller explained. So, he said, he and his wife got to thinking: what if such a state could be duplicated technologically in a simple plastic matrix in which shrink-wrapped molecules are stored at room temperature, eliminating the need for freezers?Four years ago, they decided to give their idea a try. Mr. Muller kept his job at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies “to support our four children” while Judy Muller-Cohn left her job at a biotechnology firm to work at their new company. “We mortgaged the house, took the college money out of savings and threw it all in,” Mr. Muller said in a recent interview at Biomatrica’s headquarters while Mrs. Muller-Cohn was traveling.Connect “was a huge help because scientists need help from people who know something about business,” Mr. Muller said. Connect helped Biomatrica get a $1 million investment from an angel investor and then advised the company on securing technical partners in molecular diagnostics.In 2006, Biomatrica presented its story to investors in what Connect calls its Springboard competition. “We were looking for $2 million, but before the competition was finished, we were oversubscribed,” Mr. Muller said.For Benchmark Revenue Management, a company with a software program for hospital management, Connect played a different role. Tyson S. McDowell, 26, the chief executive, founded the company six years ago. A software writer, Mr. McDowell founded one company in high school and sold it. With Benchmark, he and associates devised a software system that helps hospitals train employees and organize patient information in such a way that it is easier to qualify for cost reimbursement from insurance companies.But when Benchmark needed money to expand, Mr. McDowell said, he came away from venture investors empty-handed. He realized after working with Connect, he said, that he was the problem. “I used to think the guy on the other side of the table was an idiot,” Mr. McDowell said. “But Connect helped me to articulate the pitch about my company so that the people really do believe me.”He secured $1.7 million from investors, and now Benchmark has 13 employees, $2 million in revenue and more hospitals signing on as customers. Connect, Mr. McDowell said, not only helped him learn patience and humility, but “its lessons have served us incredibly well with management boards, employees and investors.”Barbara Bry, one of Connect’s first employees, managed its programs in technology and entrepreneurship from 1986 to 1997. She went on to found two companies, help start another and with her husband, Neil Senturia, a real estate developer and backer of software firms, started Blackbird Ventures, a firm that invests in start-up companies.Blackbird invested $1 million two years ago in Quanlight, essentially backing the invention of Vladimir Odnoblyudov, an electrical engineer from Russia who came to the University of California, San Diego, for his doctorate.Mr. Odnoblyudov, working with an engineering professor at the university, Charles Tu, developed a semiconductor for light-emitting diodes that provided greater stability for red light, a major need in liquid-crystal displays. Quanlight, with Mr. Senturia as chief executive and Mr. Odnoblyudov as technology officer, raised $3 million last year to develop the invention under license from the university. The process is less expensive than current technology, Mr. Senturia said, “but for red light, stable is more important than cheap.

"'08-09-18,'1','In France, where the government has long supported the creation of “national champions” and worked actively to protect select companies from the threat of foreign takeover, politicians were quick to point out the paradox of what is essentially the nationalization of the largest American insurance company.“Today the actions of American policy makers illustrate the need for economic patriotism,” said Bernard Carayon, a lawmaker of President Nicolas Sarkozy’s center-right governing party, UMP. “I congratulate them.”For the “evangelists of the market, this is a painful lesson,” he added.National economies are entering “an era where we have much more regulation and where the public and the private sector will mix much more.”In parts of Asia, the bailouts stirred bitter memories of the different approach the United States and the International Monetary Fund adopted during the economic crises there a decade ago.When the I.M.F. pledged $20 billion to help South Korea survive the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, one of the conditions it imposed was that the Korean government allow ailing banks and other companies to collapse rather than bail them out, recalled Yung Chul Park, a professor of economics at Korea University in Seoul, who was deeply involved in the negotiations with the I.M.F.While Mr. Park says the current crisis is different — it is global rather than limited to one region — “Washington is following a different script this time.”“I understand why they do it,” he added. “But they’ve lost credibility to some extent in pushing for opening up overseas markets to foreign competition and liberalizing economies.”The ramifications of the rescue of A.I.G. will be felt for years within the United States, too.A.I.G. was a different kind of company than Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, which enjoyed government sponsorship, or Bear Stearns, which was regulated by the federal government.“This was an insurance company that wasn’t federally regulated,” said Gary Gensler, who served as a top official in the Treasury Department during the Clinton administration. Nor did A.I.G. have access to Federal Reserve funds or deposit insurance, like a commercial bank.“We’re in new territory,” Mr. Gensler added. “This is a paradigm shift.”A.I.G. is also in a different league because of the breadth of its businesses and its extensive overseas operations, especially in Asia.What’s more, it fell into something of a regulatory gap under the current rules.While the company, based in New York, is better known for selling conventional products like insurance policies and annuities overseen by state regulators in the United States, it is also deeply involved in the risky, opaque market for derivatives and other complicated financial instruments that operate largely outside regulation.Along with the threat to the plain-vanilla insurance policies held by millions of ordinary consumers, it was the threat posed by these arcane financial instruments that led Washington to bail out A.I.G.So far that rescue has not steadied markets.“It’s pure crisis management,” Mr. Chernow said. “It’s the Treasury and the Federal Reserve lurching from crisis to crisis without a clear statement on how financial failures will be handled in the future. They’re afraid to articulate such a policy. The safety net they are spreading seems to widen every day with no end in sight.”'"
"'08-09-18,'1','The New York Times Company announced an agreement on Wednesday with Breakingviews.com, an independent financial publication, to provide opinion columns for the weekday issues and online versions of The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune starting on Tuesday.Breakingviews.com, whose main business is a professional subscription service to investors and corporations, also provides commentary to newspapers worldwide, including Le Monde, The Daily Telegraph of London and Business Times in Singapore. The deal will make The Times the sole United States newspaper to carry the column. Until recently, the columns ran in The Times’s chief competitor for business news, The Wall Street Journal.The companies did not disclose what The Times would pay for the service or how it would be integrated into the newspaper. Larry Ingrassia, the business editor for The Times, said, “The Breakingviews.com column is a perfect complement to both our leading news coverage of finance and business and our roster of award-winning columnists.”He added, “This is the first of many changes we are introducing that will enhance the business section of nytimes.com.”Rob Cox, the United States editor and a director of Breakingviews.com, said, “We are thrilled to work with a news organization whose high standards for editorial integrity and independence we share.”The deal highlights the increased competition for business news between The Times and The Journal as both newspapers struggle with declining ad dollars and the migration of readers to the Web. This week, The Journal introduced its redesigned Web site.'"
"'08-09-18,'1','Speaking to reporters on Wednesday after a meeting with committee chairmen about the crisis, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, attacked the Bush administration, saying, “Because of the inattention or a decision on their part to have crony capitalism in our country, Americans across the country are feeling the pain of this.”She said the committees headed by Representatives Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Henry A. Waxman of California would hold hearings to “examine the Bush administration’s mismanagement of financial market regulation and how it led us to this remarkable failure.”Mr. Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said his committee would examine “what was happening with the people who were in charge in the Bush administration and in the regulatory agencies headed by people appointed by President Bush.”Yet Congress, too, is coming in for blame, both from within — pitting Democrats against Republicans and the House versus the Senate — and from without.After Mr. Dodd previewed his coming hearings on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by telling Bloomberg Television, “I have a lot of questions about where was the administration over the last eight years,” one former White House economic adviser, Allan Hubbard, counterattacked. He wrote a column in The Washington Post, headlined, “Where Was Sen. Dodd?”Mr. Hubbard’s column was unusual by Washington blame-game standards for giving Congress the heat it gives out. In addition to Mr. Dodd, Mr. Hubbard singled out Mr. Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, as well as Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton, John Kerry and Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee.Mr. Hubbard wrote that the Bush and Clinton administrations had tried to rein in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac but that each time, Congressional Democrats beholden to the companies’ lobbyists quashed the regulatory proposals.Mr. Hubbard did not note, however, that some well-known Republican lawmakers and lobbyists had also protected Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Both Democrats and Republicans have also taken turns in the companies’ executive ranks.But Democrats especially have long favored the two companies, which enjoyed implicit government backing, given their responsibility to keep mortgage funds flowing to banks and support construction of affordable housing.In making that point recently, the conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal skewered Mr. Frank. On Wednesday, it published his lengthy rebuttal — Mr. Frank called the editorial against him “one of the most dishonest pieces of journalism I have seen” — but alongside it the paper ran a new editorial, titled “Barney’s Rubble,” again blaming him and other Democrats for the Fannie and Freddie mess.For their part, Democrats as well as nonpartisan critics have renewed longstanding complaints that Republicans, while they controlled the House and Senate for the dozen years up to 2007, permitted Congress’s constitutional oversight powers to atrophy so that federal regulatory agencies and industries went largely unexamined. With Republicans in control of both Congress and the White House for the first six years of Mr. Bush’s tenure, a climate favoring deregulation prevailed, which spawned the current crisis, Democrats assert.The back-and-forth has been most prominent in the presidential campaign this week.On Wednesday, Mr. Obama seized on the government’s bailout of A.I.G. to yet again assail the Bush administration and his Republican rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, for their “failed economic philosophy of the last eight years” that opposed government regulation and promoted big tax breaks for corporations.On Mr. Obama’s behalf, John Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., issued a statement saying that “the Bush administration and Republicans have built an unbalanced and fragile economy in which working people never share in Wall Street’s gain but must shoulder its failures.”Mr. McCain, meanwhile, has struck an increasingly populist tone and tried to divert voters’ attention to Wall Street, where financiers’ “greed and corruption” are the problem, he says. Mr. McCain also faults unnamed federal regulators, though he was long a vocal fan of Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who in turn is coming in for belated blame, accused of causing the housing crisis by holding interest rates too low and neglecting the Fed’s regulatory powers. (Mr. Greenspan has said he is blameless; he cites economic cycles and mortgage fraud.)After saying Tuesday that “we cannot have the taxpayers bail out A.I.G. or anybody else,” Mr. McCain issued a statement on Wednesday supporting the bailout. He attributed the cascading problems to “failed regulation, reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street.”One thing is certain, said Mr. Ely, the longtime financial industry consultant: “There’s plenty of blame to go around.”'"
"'08-09-18,'1','PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Five people were killed and three were wounded when a United States Predator drone fired missiles into a house in the restive South Waziristan tribal region, local residents said Wednesday.The attack came as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, met with Pakistan’s army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani in an effort to ease tensions over an American incursion into the tribal areas and a rising number of drone strikes.Residents of the village of Baghar Cheena, who took the wounded to a hospital in the regional center of Wana, said drones had fired four missiles. Two hit a house, and two others landed in the mountains, they said. The attack occurred in the evening, as the villagers were breaking the Ramadan fast, they said.Local militants immediately cordoned off the area, and retrieved and moved the bodies to an undisclosed location. Local residents said none of the wounded were from the area, but came from the Punjab.A senior security official confirmed the missile attack but said that the identities of those killed were yet to be established. A Pakistani military spokesman, who identified himself as Major Murad, said an investigation was under way. An intelligence source said the attack took place around 7 p.m. local time, less than three miles from the Afghan border. It killed 13 militants, mostly from Punjab, and wounded at least 9, the source said.In his account, five missiles were fired, two of them hitting a compound and the rest falling in the nearby mountains. The target may have been a group of militants based in Wana who seemed poised to cross into Afghanistan for an attack against NATO forces, the official said.'"
"'08-09-18,'1','SAN FRANCISCO — The Berkeley City Council moved late Tuesday to eliminate one of the biggest obstacles to making homes more energy-efficient: the upfront cost.In a move being watched by other cities around the country, the Council unanimously approved a program to give city-backed loans to property owners who install rooftop solar-power systems. The loans, which are likely to total up to $22,000 apiece, would be paid off over 20 years as part of the owners’ property-tax bills.While the more conventional approach of government rebates and tax breaks is being tried by the State of California and many other jurisdictions, this is the first time that a special property tax district has been created expressly to help retrofit homes and businesses to reduce electrical use. In Berkeley, these districts have previously been used to pay for neighborhood improvements, like burying electrical wiring.Property owners can opt to join the new district, which was established by the council vote. The final piece of the puzzle, however, is still missing: a deal with a lender whose capital the city would use to finance the program.At first, Berkeley seeks to raise $1.5 million for a pilot program for about 50 homes. If its program is successful, the kitty could eventually contain tens of millions of dollars, and hundreds of property owners could be eligible.'"
"'08-09-18,'1','Faltering confidence could have an infectious effect in Asia, whose savings has essentially bankrolled America for decades. “Asia, perhaps more than other markets, is a bit more volatile, a bit more based on sentiment,” said Dan Parr, the head of Asia-Pacific for brandRapport, a consulting firm with an office in . “It doesn’t take much for the man on the street to become very, very concerned.” In early trading in , the Nikkei index fell 3 percent.Despite government efforts to reassure investors over the last 10 days by rescuing some giant institutions — , and — many investors remain worried that the financial system has been badly battered and that more firms may fail as did.The has greatly expanded its lending to banks and securities firms this year and is continuing to relax rules that govern financial companies in hopes of alleviating the credit squeeze. Central banks globally are also injecting more money into their economies and lowering reserve requirements for their own institutions out of concern that the problems in the American financial system will inflict further damage.If the problems in the financial system persist, businesses will have less money to put to work, job cuts will spread and consumers, already fearful, will have less money to spend, knocking the economy down another notch. High borrowing costs will further weaken the housing market, which is still struggling. The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that housing starts fell to their lowest level since early 1991.Flashes of fear were evident Wednesday as investors clamored for government debt. When investors bid up the price, the yield falls, and it sank on three-month Treasury bills to 0.061 percent, from 1.644 percent a week ago. The yield was the lowest in more than 50 years.In the stock market, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 57.20 points, or 4.71 percent, to 1,156.39, the lowest close in more than three years. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 449.36 points, to 10,609.66.Worries over financial investments hammered even the well-regarded Wall Street firms of Goldman Sachs, whose shares fell nearly 14 percent, to $114.50, and Morgan Stanley, whose shares dropped more than 24 percent, to $21.75. Now, both firms are reconsidering what their best strategies might be in such a fearful market.In addition to shares of financial companies like , those of other bellwethers like have also tumbled.Responding to this pressure, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed new rules on short selling, or betting on falling share prices, and even suggested that hedge funds and others might have to disclose short positions, a proposal that is likely to meet stiff resistance.One key overnight lending rate was above 5 percent on Wednesday, more than double its level a week earlier. , the auto finance company owned in part by , had to pay interest of 5.25 percent on Wednesday for a form of short-term financing known as one-week commercial paper, up from 4 percent the previous day.Businesses, stung by high interest rates, may be forced to trim expenses, an ominous turn in a slowing economy with unemployment rates on the rise.“This is throwing sand in the gears of the economy,” said G. David MacEwen, chief investment officer for the bond department of American Century Investments. “The economy depends on credit to finance homes, automobiles, , and inventories.”Local governments and other enterprises will feel pressure, too. The city of and in New York postponed debt offerings because they would have to pay such high interest rates to investors, said Daniel S. Solender, director of municipal bond management at Lord Abbett & Company.Money market funds braced for possible fallout from the disclosure that one big fund’s net assets fell below $1 a share, because it had held securities issued by Lehman Brothers. It is so rare for money market funds to fall below that threshold that many investors consider them as safe as cash or a checking account.Some mutual fund companies reported that customers were moving money from broader money market funds that have had higher yields to more conservative funds within the same company, Peter Rizzo, a senior director of Standard & Poor’s, said late Wednesday afternoon. The overall effect is to reduce the appetite for securities of companies with anything other than the most stellar reputations.Governments around the world stepped up their efforts to ease the strain on the global financial system. The Bank of England extended a special bank lending program for three more months, while central banks in Japan and injected more money into their banking systems. injected money into its banks and lowered reserve requirements.In New York, the Federal Reserve on Tuesday night said it would extend an $85 billion credit line to the insurer A.I.G. and receive the rights to a nearly 80 percent stake in the company. The deal came just after the government refused financial support to Lehman, leading it to file for bankruptcy on Monday.The Treasury and Fed also said they would auction more Treasury bills. The Fed will use the securities to manage its balance sheet and inject more money into the financial system. Because the Fed has expanded its lending to banks and securities firm this year, some analysts had grown concerned that the central bank might run out of Treasury securities to conduct its operations. Mark Gertler, an economics professor at , said the Fed was trying to balance two interests: protecting against a crisis but telling the market that it will not bail out every troubled institution. Despite the stress in the markets, he said, the Fed’s actions may have averted a worse outcome.“Maybe this is being Pollyannaish, but they have been successful in signaling that the bailouts are no longer automatic, and thus far they have prevented a market meltdown,” Mr. Gertler said.The dramatic events of the last year have called into question much of what policy makers, economists and investors once espoused about the financial system. As recently as the spring of 2007, many in and New York continued to say housing prices could not fall across the board and that most of the bets made by Wall Street traders were inherently safe.Now, there are signs that psychology is driving a reverse line of thinking. People are assuming that things will get worse and that any move by the Fed or the Treasury is a step down, not a step closer to improvement.“There has been a tremendous amount of denial over the past two years, three years,” said Barry Ritholtz, chief executive of Fusion IQ, an investment firm, and author of The Big Picture blog.The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 6/32, to 104 28/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.41 percent from 3.44 percent late Tuesday.

"'08-09-19,'1','Gov. Haley Barbour agreed to move a special election for Trent Lott’s former Senate seat to near the top of the November ballot, ending a dispute that had threatened to delay the start of absentee voting. Mr. Barbour’s decision came after the state Supreme Court ruled that putting the election near the bottom of the ballot was against the law, but stopped short of ordering him to move it. Opponents had accused Mr. Barbour, a former Republican National Committee chairman, of trying to bury the race to try to confuse voters and hurt the chances of the Democratic candidate, former Gov. Ronnie Musgrove. Mr. Musgrove and the Republican candidate, Roger Wicker, are competing to serve the final four years of a six-year term started by Mr. Lott, who retired last December. Mr. Barbour, who unseated Mr. Musgrove in 2003, appointed Mr. Wicker to fill Mr. Lott’s seat until the special election. People tend to leave less-publicized races blank as they work their way down the ballot, which had some Democrats worried that voters would ignore the special Senate election if it were near the end.

"'08-09-19,'1','Flashing headlights and honking horns penetrated the early-morning sky as police officers and first responders led drivers in a slow procession across the new Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis. Hundreds of vehicles had lined up on both sides, some waiting hours for the bridge to open a few minutes after 5 a.m. Then they inched, bumper to bumper, onto the new $234 million, 10-lane span. The old bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River on Aug. 1, 2007, killing 13 people and injuring 145.Some drivers were jubilant about the new span, but others were hesitant. One survivor of the collapse said he would wait a couple of days before trying out the rebuilt bridge. The man, Andy Gannon, 39, an insurance salesman from Apple Valley, Minn., who cascaded 42 feet in his new silver Chrysler Pacifica and landed on a river road, dangling on an embankment, said he was afraid to drive with the cluster of commuters.Instead, Mr. Gannon said he would drive on the new bridge on Saturday morning to finish the trip he started on the day of the collapse: to attend the wake of a co-worker’s father at the Roseville Memorial Chapel. “For me, it has to happen. I didn’t complete where I was supposed to go,” he said. “I’m going to cross that bridge, go to the church, sit in the parking lot for just a second or so and consider my journey done.”CHRISTINA CAPECCHI'"
"'08-09-19,'1','Under state law, the Legislature monitors itself through the Legislative Ethics Commission, a bipartisan panel with nine members appointed by the leaders of the Senate and the Assembly. Oversight of the executive branch is handled by the Commission on Public Integrity. Of its 13 members, 7 are appointed by the governor.In a letter to Gov. David A. Paterson and legislative leaders, the watchdog groups called for creating one independent agency that would monitor both the executive and legislative branches. They also called for publicly releasing the income that lawmakers disclose on their financial reports and making those reports available online. And they proposed creating a new income category on the financial reports for income over $1 million. Currently the highest category is for income over $250,000.Groups that have criticized Albany lawmakers for condoning secrecy and cozy relationships with lobbyists have been especially hard on Mr. Paterson since he took office in March. They have accused him of turning his back on the kind of reform he advocated when he ran for lieutenant governor in 2006 with Eliot Spitzer, who swept into office on a platform of making Albany more transparent and ethically sound.“Reform has been dropped like a hot potato,” Mr. Horner said at a press conference outside the Capitol on Thursday. “He ran in 2006 as a reformer. By the election in 2008, he hasn’t been delivering the goods. So we think he has to do more.”That jab at Mr. Paterson drew a testy response from the governor’s communications director, Risa B. Heller, who said: “We would hope that Mr. Horner might take the time to observe the new spirit of cooperation that has enabled the governor, working with his legislative partners, to achieve several historic firsts over the past six months. In many ways that constitutes real reform.”By making their case for changing ethics monitoring less than six weeks before the elections — when all 212 state legislators will be chosen — the watchdog groups said they also saw an opportunity to frame the issue as a campaign question.“This is an election season,” said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, which proposed the changes in consultation with the New York Public Interest Research Group, the League of Women Voters of New York State and Citizens Union. “This discussion has got to be happening as part of the election.”So far it appears that legislative leaders are amenable to many of the changes proposed on Thursday. Separate legislation is being drafted in the Senate and the Assembly that would address ethics oversight.Scott Reif, a spokesman for Dean G. Skelos, the Republican leader of the Senate, said, “Senator Skelos is on record as saying that the Senate will act on legislation to strengthen the state’s ethics laws to include greater disclosure of the outside income of legislators.”Dan Weiller, a spokesman for Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, said he could not discuss what specific proposals would be in the Assembly bill. But he said that Mr. Silver was open to the idea of stronger ethics policing. “Speaker Silver has said he supports changes in ethics and disclosure rules, and he’s talking about potential changes with members of the Assembly majority,” Mr. Weiller said.Barbara Bartoletti, the legislative director of the League of Women Voters of New York State, said she feared that once again the Senate and Assembly would pass different ethics bills and then blame each other for refusing to compromise.“And again you get the old mantra, boats, ships passing in the night,” she said. “Therefore you don’t change the status quo. We will not stand for that happening this session.”'"
"'08-09-19,'1','Although the report is certain to get intense scrutiny from Congress and education groups, it is unclear whether the recommendations will win enough support to have much chance of being adopted.The group called for linking the maximum a student can borrow through the Stafford Loan program to the federal poverty level, allowing that maximum to rise with inflation; it also recommended that the standard 10-year mortgage-style repayment plan be replaced with a graduated repayment plan, so payments would rise along with borrowers’ income.It also called for making the interest rates of federal loan programs to parents low enough to discourage families from turning to private student loans. With tuition rising faster than inflation, college affordability has become a growing concern for both voters and Congressional leaders.“We will take a look at these and other recommendations that explore innovative ways to deliver student aid and help make college more affordable,” said Rachel Racusen, a spokeswoman for Representative George Miller, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House education committee.“It is a welcome report,” said Molly Corbett Broad, president of the American Council on Education. “The big question is what we have the political will and the financial commitment to do. So the notion of beginning to save for college at a much younger age is a great idea, and we know that would make a huge difference, but there are significant cost implications.”Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the plan involves the federal government opening — and financing — college savings accounts for low-income children.Unlike children in affluent families, many low-income children do not grow up with parents who expect them to get a college education, or have any plan for paying the tuition.So the panel proposed that the government create accounts for children in low-income families, long before they reached college age. The government would add money each year until they turned 18, but the accounts could only be drawn against for college expenses.“Imagine the impact on the single mother of a 7-year-old who receives a letter informing her that the federal government has just put aside $250 toward the college education of that child and that this money will earn interest until the child is ready to enroll,” the report said.If the program began at age 12, and the yearly deposit was 10 percent of the Pell Grant that the child would be eligible for, it would cost “less than $3 billion” a year, Ms. Baum said Thursday. She said 12 was probably the latest it would make sense to begin such a program, and added that the group had also estimated costs of starting it at age 5.The panel, which worked for two years to produce the report, “Fulfilling the Commitment,” proposed new financial incentives for colleges and universities that do a good job of retaining, and graduating, low-income students.'"
"'08-09-19,'1','The city plan, which draws on the work of climatologists, warns that the failure to act will produce dire consequences.“People think in terms of polar ice caps and rising ocean levels,” Mr. Burke said, “but this takes a look at what would happen to a Midwestern city like Chicago if nothing is done.”By the end of the century, if no action is taken, he said, Chicago is likely to face 30 more days of 100-degree weather per year, as well as stretches of severe drought.“The climate of Chicago,” Mr. Burke said, “would resemble what is currently East Texas.”This was the first time a major American city has produced models to show local effects of global warming, he added.Sadhu Johnston, the chief environmental officer for the city, said that perhaps the most ambitious part of the plan was retrofitting low-cost housing complexes to reduce water and energy use.But getting the cooperation of the private sector for some of the more costly initiatives may be difficult.“Make no mistake,” Mr. Johnston said, “we’re facing huge challenges, especially with the credit crunch.”The Chicago initiative included consultation with business and labor leaders, as well as scientists and environmentalists, and involved 18 months of research and discussion. Mr. Johnston said the initiative came “despite the lack of federal support.”Some of the changes in the building codes will require approval of the City Council, but that is considered virtually guaranteed, given Mr. Daley’s political power.The plan will also publicize ways that people can reduce their carbon imprints.Mr. Johnston said popular sentiment for conservation was so strong these days, especially with high fuel costs, that people were eager to find ways to cut emissions. “We don’t need mandates,” he said, “so much as we need to give people the tools that allow them to green their own lives.”As part of the outreach, the program will issue what it calls “the $800 challenge,” giving tips for everyday life that could cut energy expenses by that amount for the average resident.“We’re going to try to get office buildings to compete against one another,” Mr. Johnston said, to see who can reduce energy levels the most.Some parts of the initiative have already been put into effect. Over the past two years, the city and its partners have distributed more than one million energy-saving compact fluorescent light bulbs.“We can’t solve the world’s climate change problem in Chicago,” Mr. Daley said at a news conference at the John G. Shedd Aquarium, “but we can do our part.”'"
"'08-09-19,'1','This Spanish-language television advertisement for Senator Barack Obama is intended for Latino voters in battleground and other states. Called “Two Faces,” it is 30 seconds long.THE SCRIPT Mr. Obama speaks first, in accented Spanish, saying he approves the message. Then an indignant male voice says: “They want us to forget the insults we’ve had to endure. Intolerance. They’ve made us feel marginalized in this country that we love so much. John McCain and his Republican friends have two faces. One tells lies to get our votes. The other, even worse, follows the failed policies of George Bush, putting the interests of powerful groups ahead of working families. John McCain: more of the same Republican deceit.”THE SCREEN After Mr. Obama’s introduction, the screen splits in two. At the top is a Hispanic mother and her young child; at the bottom is a picture of Rush Limbaugh and the phrase “stupid, unskilled Mexicans.” The image of a middle-aged Hispanic woman in front of a store follows, with another phrase attributed to Mr. Limbaugh: “Shut your mouth or get out!” At the first mention of “two faces,” the images of Mr. McCain and President Bush appear. A newspaper headline reads “they made immigration reform fail,” attributing the phrase to a McCain campaign advertisement. As an image of an oil rig on the left gives way to a gasoline pump and then the accusation of deceit, Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush are shown together again on the right.ACCURACY This advertisement is misleading. Mr. McCain’s history on the immigration issue, though complicated, is misrepresented here, as is his relationship with the nativist wing of his party and Mr. Limbaugh. With Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Mr. McCain sponsored overhaul legislation in 2006. He later backed away from his own bill for reasons still being debated, and though he now says the borders must be secured first, he has not repudiated his support for the principle. (He has tried in his own advertisements to shift the blame for the bill’s failure to Mr. Obama.) On the campaign trail, Mr. McCain has also repeatedly praised the Hispanic contribution to American life. Not one of the anti-Hispanic slights in the advertisement came from Mr. McCain’s mouth. And while Mr. McCain has mentioned the failure of the effort to overhaul immigration in one of his own Spanish-language advertisements, he has not celebrated it.SCORECARD A Spanish-language proverb says it best: “Tell me who you walk with, and I will tell you who you are.” This is an exercise in guilt by association, meant to taint Mr. McCain with Latino voters. But in the Republican presidential debates, he took pains to separate himself from the anti-immigrant posture of candidates like Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado, and Mr. Limbaugh has often attacked Mr. McCain. So while Mr. McCain may need to explain why the Republican platform does not reflect his views on immigration, little in his record justifies this attack, which strongly implies that he holds anti-Hispanic views.

"'08-09-19,'1','WASHINGTON (AP) — Ignoring a presidential veto threat, the House on Thursday approved measures aimed at curbing speculation in oil and other commodity markets. It said federal regulators did not have the tools or manpower to track trading abuses.The bill, passed by a 283-to-133 vote and sent to the Senate, is aimed at certain hedge fund and large institutional investors as well as electronic trading through overseas entities that avoid United States government scrutiny. It would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission authority for more staff and for limiting the stake traders hold in certain markets. It also would require new reporting and other limits on traders.The bill now goes to the Senate, which is grappling with broader energy legislation focused on offshore oil drilling, and it is not certain whether the speculation issue will be wrapped into that effort, or even if an energy package will be passed before Congress leaves town, perhaps as early as the end of next week.The White House said President Bush was likely to veto the bill. There “is no verifiable evidence to conclude that oil speculators were behind the rise in oil prices” or were “behind its recent decline,” the White House said.'"
"'08-09-19,'1','Midway through the fourth quarter, as the Connecticut Sun scrambled for a timeout, the Liberty’s Erlana Larkins high-stepped across the center of the court with her fists in the air and let out a primal scream. The youngest player on the league’s youngest team could not help herself.The Liberty was leading Connecticut, the Eastern Conference’s No. 2 seed, by 12 points and was well on its way to pulling off an upset in the first game of the conference semifinals — which was not bad for Larkins’s first taste of the W.N.B.A. playoffs.Shameka Christon, though, had been there before. At 26, she has taken on the role of seasoned veteran, and it was her 19-point performance, backed up by some excellent play from the post players, that lifted the Liberty over the Sun, 72-63. Forward Cathrine Kraayeveld added a double-double (15 points, 10 rebounds) and center Janel McCarville tacked on 13 points.“We had a lot of energy tonight,” Liberty Coach Pat Coyle said. “Offensively, we did a good job.”Although the Sun has home-court advantage because of its regular-season record, the series began at Madison Square Garden because of the W.N.B.A.’s quirky playoff scheduling. It means the Liberty will try to clinch a place in the conference finals on the road, where it was 8-9 this season.'"
"'08-09-19,'1','Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, traveling in London, said Thursday that the administration was preparing to offer compromise proposals in an effort to overcome Iraq’s objections, which he acknowledged focused on immunity and the authority to arrest and detain Iraqis.The American negotiators, he said, will be “carrying with them some ideas that perhaps meet both the Iraqi and our concerns on some of the remaining issues.”In agreeing to specific dates as a goal for troop withdrawals, Mr. Bush has had to soften his earlier warnings that deadlines were counterproductive. Mr. Bush also agreed to withdraw American troops from Iraqi cities by next July and base them in comparatively remote areas, except during operations.Administration officials emphasized that those deadlines were “aspirational” and could be shifted if security in Iraq did not continue to improve.Michael E. O’Hanlon, an analyst with the Brookings Institution in Washington, said Mr. Maliki’s objections reflected a combination of factors. He cited Iraqi nationalism, Mr. Maliki’s own domestic political necessities and a desire to await the outcome of the American presidential election, on the assumption that the next president could offer different terms.“He knows there has to be a deal in the end — even if it’s with an Obama administration,” Mr. O’Hanlon said, referring to Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee for president. “But by trying to get what he wants — or being seen trying to get what he wants — he shores up his position at home.”Mr. Maliki also, for the first time, raised the possibility of seeking an extension to the United Nations mandate at the Security Council, saying that had become complicated because of American and Russian tensions over the conflict in Georgia.“Even if we ask for an extension, then we will ask for it according to our terms and we will attach conditions and the U.S. side will refuse,” he said in an interview on Wednesday with the directors of Iraqi satellite television channels. “U.S. forces would be without legal cover and will have no choice but to pull out from Iraq or stay and be in contravention of international law.”Such remarks reflect a growing self-confidence that has made Iraqi political leaders far more assertive in matters of sovereignty.Ali al-Adeeb, a member of the Dawa party and deputy head of Mr. Maliki’s political bloc in Parliament, spoke in an interview of repeated American offenses, both real and symbolic. He cited the use of palaces and cultural sites as American bases and headquarters, disrespect for Iraqi women during searches and killings of Iraqis who ventured too close to patrols.He said the Iraqis were insisting on limiting immunity “because the Americans are moving about in a chaotic way in Iraq without consulting with the Iraqi government.”He added, “They arrest whomever they want, and they commit all sorts of mistakes without being accountable.”Administration officials declined to discuss the negotiations in detail, but one official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss diplomatic matters, confirmed that immunity for American soldiers and contractors was a main obstacle.The American ambassador in Baghdad, Ryan C. Crocker, has led the negotiations from the American side, joined by two senior officials from Washington: David M. Satterfield from the State Department and Brett H. McGurk with the National Security Council. Both have spent months in Iraq this year and will return soon, officials said.In August, Iraqi officials applauded Mr. Bush’s acceptance of the withdrawal dates, even if they were only on paper, as a breakthrough that effectively sealed the deal. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in Baghdad at the time, urged caution.“I just want to emphasize we’ll have agreement when we have agreement,” Ms. Rice said, appearing beside Iraq’s foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari.'"
"'08-09-19,'1','The actions of both men captured how they were being forced to make policy proposals and pronouncements on the fly, from one campaign rally to another, as each day’s developments in the financial markets and in Washington were overtaken by new ones the following day.With Election Day less than seven weeks away, the financial crisis has transformed the race, wiping away almost all other issues. In a purely political sense, the developments are highlighting economic anxiety and putting the spotlight on a topic that Democrats believe will benefit them.As the chances increase that Congress will get involved with a plan to help take distressed assets off the books of troubled firms — and potentially put taxpayers on the hook — the politics could become even more intense and complicated, creating further challenges for Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama as they seek to be seen as in command.“I cannot remember a modern election in which the presidential candidates were faced with commenting on a problem of this magnitude this close to Election Day,” said Michael Berman, a Democratic Party strategist.The candidates’ challenge parallels that of the Bush administration and federal regulatory officials who are managing the crisis. From Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. on down, there have been contradictory statements, false starts and emergency actions as the crisis spread from one financial institution to another.But what is worse for Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain is that they are on the sidelines and yet expected to act as if they have the best information available. They are getting updates from economic advisers and supporters on Wall Street and also near-daily briefings from Mr. Paulson and sometimes Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve. Another complication is that the candidates have to balance the political need to look boldly presidential against the danger of further agitating the markets or stoking Americans’ anxiety.By most accounts, Mr. Obama has the advantage, because anything that keeps voters focused on the economy is good for Democrats, since a Republican holds the White House. In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Thursday, Mr. McCain sought to turn that advantage against his rival, charging that Mr. Obama’s “own advisers are saying that the crisis will benefit him politically.”The McCain campaign could not cite an example of an Obama adviser’s claiming that.Mr. McCain has adopted an increasingly populist tone and blamed Wall Street greed. By Wednesday, on a trip through Michigan, Mr. McCain even suggested that he would favor loans to the auto industry, an idea he had once faulted. At a General Motors plant in Orion, he said, “We are not going to leave the workers here in Michigan hung out to dry while we give billions in taxpayer dollars to Wall Street.”On Tuesday, Mr. McCain said he would oppose a federal bailout of the insurance giant American International Group, only to endorse it as unavoidable the next day when the Federal Reserve took over A.I.G. to prevent its losses from infecting other financial institutions. Also on Tuesday, Mr. McCain proposed a “9/11-style commission” to study the problem and recommend solutions for the long term, then switched Thursday to propose the creation of a government agency as soon as possible.Mr. McCain’s call for a new trust to relieve troubled financial companies of their bad loans — much like the Resolution Trust Corporation, which was created after the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s — dramatizes how far he has backtracked from a career as a deregulator who opposed bigger government. He made his proposal hours before the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve disclosed that they were considering a similar approach.Among those who have supported the creation of such an entity is Paul A. Volcker, a former Fed chairman. He is among a core group of Obama advisers on the financial crisis that includes Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers, the former treasury secretaries, and Laura Tyson, an economic adviser in the administration of President Bill Clinton, all of whom are expected to meet with Mr. Obama on Friday in Miami. Aides to Mr. Obama said that he was open to the concept but that the protection of taxpayers was a critical detail yet to be worked out.Mr. Obama calls at each campaign stop for tighter regulation of Wall Street and help for those on Main Street. Although he usually speaks without notes, in recent days he has consistently used a teleprompter, to avoid errors that would undercut his attempts to sound presidential.Between campaign appearances this week, he has received updates and briefings several times each day from Mr. Paulson, his economic advisers and Wall Street donors. Mr. Paulson also has briefed Mr. McCain and his chief economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin.In an example of the frenetic efforts by the Obama side to keep up, the candidate late Tuesday asked for a conference call with core advisers. Mr. Volcker answered his cellphone on a Manhattan street corner, Mr. Rubin called in minutes after landing in New York from London, and they joined others to discuss how Mr. Obama should react.'"
"'08-09-19,'1','One model for the proposal could be the , which bought up and eventually sold hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of real estate in the 1990s from failed savings-and-loan companies. In this case, however, the government is expected to take over only distressed assets, not entire institutions. And it is not clear that a new agency would be created to manage and dispose of the assets, or whether the Federal Reserve or Treasury Department would do so.The bailout discussions came on a day when the Federal Reserve poured almost $300 billion into global credit markets and barely put a dent in the level of alarm.Hoping to shore up confidence with a show of financial shock and awe, the Federal Reserve stunned investors before dawn on Thursday by announcing a plan to provide $180 billion to financial markets through lending programs operated by the and the central banks of , , and .But after an initial sense of relief swept markets in and , the fear quickly returned. Tensions remained so high that the Federal Reserve had to inject an extra $100 billion, in two waves of $50 billion each, just to keep the benchmark federal funds rate at the Fed’s target of 2 percent.None of those actions, however, brought much catharsis or relief, with banks around the world remaining too frightened to lend to each other, much less to their customers. This forced Mr. Paulson and , the Fed chairman, to think the unthinkable: committing taxpayer money to buy hundreds of billions of dollars in distressed assets from struggling institutions.Rumors about the Bush administration’s new stance swept through the stock markets Thursday afternoon. By the end of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average shot up 617 points from its low point in midafternoon, the biggest surge in six years, and ended the day with a gain of 410 points or 3.9 percent.The rally continued in early trading in Asia. The Australian market was up 3.5 percent by mid-day there and the Nikkei 225 Index was up 2.9 percent in .“The markets voted, and they liked the proposal,” said Laurence H. Meyer, vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers.The stock surge began after Senator , Democrat of New York, announced his own proposal for a government rescue on the Senate floor and declared that both the Treasury and the Federal Reserve were open to all ideas.“The Federal Reserve and the Treasury are realizing that we need a more comprehensive solution,” Mr. Schumer said. “I’ve been talking to them about it.”Still, the evening discussions took most of Washington by surprise, especially since Congress had been trying to finish up its business and head home to campaign for re-election.The scale and complexity of the project are almost certain to create huge philosophical differences among the parties, which could make negotiations difficult to say the least. Still, lawmakers said the goal was to work through the coming weekend and to have both the House and Senate vote on a measure by the end of next week.As they exited the session, grim-faced lawmakers said they would await proposals from the Treasury Department. The Senate majority leader, , said he expected to see a proposal within hours, not days.“What we agreed to do is sit down together on a bipartisan basis and work together to solve the problem,” said Senator of , the Republican leader, who said no specific approach was advocated by the administration officials.President Bush and his top advisers have adamantly opposed bailouts, but the mortgage crisis has already forced the Treasury and the Fed to bail out four of the country’s most prominent financial institutions — in March; and earlier this month; and , the insurance conglomerate, just this week.Created in 1989, the Resolution Trust Corporation disposed of bad assets held by hundreds of crippled savings institutions. The agency closed or reorganized 747 institutions holding assets of nearly $400 billion. It did so by seizing the assets of troubled , then reselling them to bargain-seeking investors.By 1995, the S.& L. crisis had abated and the agency was folded into the , which Congress created during the Great to regulate banks and protect the accounts of customers when they fail.By any reckoning, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke were desperate for a way to stem the crisis once and for all by Thursday evening. Over the previous 10 days, they had allowed one Wall Street firm, , to collapse; and an even bigger Wall Street firm, , to be sold to . Then, on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve abruptly took over the nation’s biggest insurance conglomerate, the American International Group, and began bailing it out with an $85 billion loan.The meeting in the Capitol, which began around 7 p.m., came after Congressional leaders had initially appeared unclear about what role they would play in the rapid-fire decisions being made. Leaders of both parties had complained about a lack of hard information flowing from the administration. House Republicans even canceled a closed-door party session Thursday morning after the administration refused to provide an official to brief them on the administration’s emerging policies.But as Thursday progressed, Congressional leaders sought to reassert themselves on the crisis, scheduling oversight hearings, calling for a legislative response to the market turmoil and offering to put off an adjournment scheduled to start at the end of next week if the administration and Congress could find common ground on a solution., the House speaker, in a letter sent Thursday evening to President Bush, reiterated that view. “We stand ready beyond the targeted adjournment date of September 26 to permit Congress to consider legislative proposals and conduct necessary investigations,” Ms. Pelosi said in the letter, which said “the worsening crisis in our financial markets demands strong solutions and decisive leadership.”But whether a legislative consensus could be found remained an open question, and members of Mr. Bush’s own party were among those who were most critical of the increasing federal intervention in private markets.At the meeting Thursday night, where officials said the atmosphere was tense, Senator Richard Shelby of , the senior Republican on the banking committee, was notably skeptical.A spokesman for the senator, Jonathan Graffeo, said later: “Senator Shelby believes it’s his responsibility to be skeptical on behalf of taxpayers. He believes our goal must be to minimize taxpayer exposure while maximizing the benefit to the economy. ”Earlier in the day, Representative of , the House Republican leader, had expressed similar wariness about the risk to taxpayers’ funds. And Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Republican who heads a coalition of House conservatives, was circulating a letter to the administration demanding that it not engage in any further bailouts.Even before the Thursday night session with Mr. Paulson — the second for top Congressional leaders this week — the House had scheduled new oversight hearings. The Financial Services Committee set a session for next week, with Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke as witnesses. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee set hearings for early October to examine developments that led to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the bailout of A.I.G., even though Congress is to be in recess.Ms. Pelosi, suggesting the public was probably not of a mind to wait until 2009 for a Congressional fix, said lawmakers first had to explore the causes of the problems and potential solutions in hearings.“Let’s hear from the Bernankes and the Paulsons and the rest what their view of it is,” she said. “Let’s hear from the private sector. How these captains of the financial world could make millions of dollars in salary, and yet their companies fail and then we have to step in to bail them out.”Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke have been studying an array of new and sometimes radical approaches to fight what current and former Fed officials describe as the worst financial crisis they have ever seen.The Fed has already stretched itself very thin by introducing new emergency lending programs for banks, Wall Street firms and, this week, a giant insurance company.With the Fed running short of unencumbered reserves, the Treasury Department had begun raising fresh cash for the central bank by selling new Treasury bills at an unprecedented pace — $200 billion this week alone — and parking it at the Fed for whatever use it wanted.'"
"'08-09-19,'1','The remainder of the foursomes matches will pit Justin Leonard and Hunter Mahan of the United States against Henrik Stenson and Paul Casey, Stewart Cink and Chad Campbell of the United States against Justin Rose and Ian Poulter, and the Americans Kenny Perry and Jim Furyk against Lee Westwood and Sergio García.“You can see the strengths,” Faldo said of his lineup. “Henrik and Paul Casey, two guys who can bomb it a mile. Rose and Poulter, I’m very impressed with those two guys — I spoke to them yesterday and their eyes came alive. The consistency of Lee and the passion of Sergio. That’s a pretty strong eight guys.”If the Europeans seem to be exuding confidence, they have good reason. In putting terms, the United States faces a 20-foot sidehill slider if it is to reverse recent trends. Europe has won five of the past six Cups, including the last three in a row, the last two by 9-point margins. Small wonder the Europeans swaggered into the opening ceremonies Thursday, taking the stage like rock stars at a sold-out concert.Azinger’s quest to return the Cup — and golfing respectability — to the United States began two years ago when he accepted the captaincy from the P.G.A. of America. He took the job under the condition that he be permitted to change some rules he believed were contributing to the string of American defeats.To stock the United States team with golfers whose current form was the best, Azinger reduced the time frame for accumulating points to one year from two. To switch the format to the one that last worked for the United States, he moved foursomes back to the morning session it last occupied in 1999. Finally, to give himself more options to select golfers he believed in, he doubled the captain’s selections from two golfers to four.He also visited Valhalla numerous times in the six months leading up to the matches, working with the course superintendent Mark Wilson to seek out any possible advantage. Azinger requested a swath of 1 ½-inch intermediate rough ranging from 12 to 60 feet in width so that slightly errant drives would not be penalized and birdies would be possible from all but the wildest tee shots.In the end, on the eve of opening day, he acknowledged he was unsure whether all that work will result in any advantage for the United States.It is all in the hands of the golfers now. Both teams have been motivated. Each side visited the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville this week, and Ali visited both teams Thursday.Jack Nicklaus, Valhalla’s architect, has seen all sides of the Ryder Cup, six times as a player, twice as a captain, and twice as a designer of the host course. It was Nicklaus, in 1977, who went to England’s P.G.A. president, Lord John Darby, to suggest that golfers from all of Europe be eligible for the matches, which had been limited to players from Britain and Ireland and had been dominated by America.Now it is the Europeans who are doing the dominating. Since 1985, Europe has won or kept the Ryder Cup eight times to three for the United States.“The Europeans have just played better in that span,” Nicklaus said. “And so, it’s time for a swing. I think these teams are fairly even.” If Tiger Woods were playing, he said, “I would have said the U.S. was the stronger. How will it turn out? I can’t say for sure. But that’s what makes it exciting.”'"
"'08-09-19,'1','P.& G. has overhauled its main roasting plant in east New Orleans — which employs more than 400 people — to include a step it calls “predry” or “preroast.” Each bean is fully dried before roasting, ensuring a more evenly cooked bean, which makes it less bitter.“This is the largest technical investment in our roasting facility we have done,” Mr. Egasti said.Jim Trout, innovation leader for research and development, at P.& G., said: “It’s like thawing a turkey before you cook it. If you don’t, the outside will be burnt and the inside will still be raw. This way it cooks evenly all the way through.”While the company is realistic about its chances of swaying those in the habit of drinking Starbucks coffee, Folgers believes there is room to win customers among those who brew at home.“Given the economy, there is an opportunity to underscore what Folgers offers with people who may have been going out more frequently than they do today,” said Marnie Kain-Cacossa, executive vice president, global equity director at Saatchi & Saatchi New York, Folger’s ad agency of more than 50 years.The ad campaign includes a TV commercial, print ads, in-store signage, coupons and Web banner ads. The packaging of Folgers’ coffee has also been overhauled to include information about the roasting process.The 30-second TV spot features a man in pajamas preparing coffee as the sounds of a typical morning — kitchen drawers opening, slippers squeaking, a spoon clinking inside a mug — are heard at high volume. The sound effects are intended to deliver a “heightened sense of reality that mirrors the enhanced coffee,” Ms. Kain-Cacossa said.Saatchi & Saatchi created the campaign, as well as the “Best part of waking up” jingle, which first aired in 1984. The jingle appears in the new TV spot, though without lyrics. Ms. Kain-Cacossa said research showed that the jingle was recognizable to consumers without the slogan.The spot will first appear Sept. 29, and run largely on women-oriented networks like Lifetime, HGTV, Food Network and the Soap Network. Neither P.& G. nor Saatchi would disclose a specific budget for the campaign, but it is expected to be in the low six figures. Ms. Kain-Cacossa called it “the largest marketing investment in the history of Folgers.”Print and Web ads will focus on images of the red Folgers canister transformed into a roaster, with copy reading, “Every mountain-grown bean of Folgers is roasted with care, using just the right amount of heat. So every morning, you can wake up to rich, pure taste.”This is not the first time that Folgers has tried to keep pace with the changing tastes of coffee drinkers. The company introduced flavored coffees in 2002, and in 2006 released gourmet roasts with names like caramel drizzle and espresso roast. It has even introduced a variety called Simply Smooth, intended to lessen the chance for an upset stomach.A coffee industry analyst and consultant, Judy Ganes, said that despite the change in consumer coffee habits in the last decade, Folger’s and Maxwell House were still by far the dominant coffee brands on the market and could capture an even greater share as consumers on a budget return to home brewing.“People may be willing to forgo the high end but don’t want to have a bad cup of coffee either,” she said. “When people are trying to watch their wallets, they may be willing to give this a try.”That shift has yet to show itself in the marketplace. According to the National Coffee Association, 17 percent of adults in the United States drank a gourmet coffee beverage every day in 2007, a record high. Over all, coffee consumption dipped to 80 percent of the population in 2007, down from 82 percent the year before.The sale of Folgers was part of an effort by P.& G. to refocus on core businesses, namely global health and beauty brands, and those that show growth of at least 4 percent annually. Folgers grew by about that much in 2007, but is sold only in North America.“The margins that you can earn in the health and beauty space are significantly above those in food and beverage,” Mr. Egasti said.'"

"'08-09-19,'1','Re “Fed in an $85 Billion Rescue of an Insurer Near Failure” (front page, Sept. 17):Why is it that when the wizards of Wall Street are making billions, they get to keep the money, making some of them fabulously wealthy? But when they are utterly incompetent and their enterprises collapse, the taxpayers pick up the tab? Where is the justice?Re “McCain Laboring to Hit Right Note on the Economy” (front page, Sept. 17):John McCain claims to understand American workers’ distress and denounces “greed” on Wall Street. His understanding must be tissue-thin, however, given his historic association with the Republican economic agenda.Consider, for example, what might have happened in the current financial crisis if Mr. McCain and his party had won the battle to privatize Social Security.Those distressed workers, having invested part of their wages in private pension plans, would now face retirement with precious little return on their investments. They’d also be dipping into pension savings just to pay the mortgage or the heating bill.Not for them the luxury of the golden parachute or the government bailout. Just hard times.The media and the Obama campaign have jumped all over Senator John McCain for saying that the fundamentals of the economy are “strong.” This proves, they say, that he is out of touch.Maybe his instincts are not so wrong. Everyone knows that the economy has been hit hard, but psychology plays a huge part in bringing about a recovery. The drumbeat of woe and doom makes things only worse, as people stop spending and investing.Having politically correct politicians and the media scream that we are headed for a depression makes their predictions self-fulfilling.John McCain’s natural instinct was to be optimistic, not to panic.Things will get better if we act now with speed and compassion, but we need to believe that the fundamentals are strong.As a Democratic president once said, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”John McCain’s first instinct was to address that fear. He should not be criticized for doing so.“Wall Street Is Down, and So Are They” (news article, Sept. 18):Every day we read more stories about the woes of Wall Street, which inevitably will affect us all. While it is undeniably necessary to determine how we got to this place so as to avoid winding up here again in the future, I am struck by the runaway train of blame that seems to be running amok.Everyone from the top down seems to need to find someone else to point the finger at. We each need to look ourselves squarely in the eye, in the mirror and honestly ask ourselves a question: Did I in any way contribute to this mess?Until we remember that we are all an “I,” before a “they,” we will never solve any of our problems, and continue to depend on others to save us from ourselves.Cheers to Nicholas D. Kristof for hitting the C.E.O. salary nail on the head. But there’s yet another nail to be driven home: the practice of passing rising costs on to the consumer to maintain sufficient corporate profitability.The effects of this abuse resonate all the way down the line, from shareholders to those shopping at Wal-Mart, the gas station and the local supermarket. People are hurting, and they are finally shouting “Enough!”  Martha D. Trowbridge New York, Sept.18, 2008Nicholas D. Kristof doesn’t go far enough when he suggests that overpaid American C.E.O.’s “should learn from Britain and Australia.” I would like to see some masters of the universe line up, bow deeply and apologize to their employees and shareholders — in the fashion of Japanese managers.And then give back the money they didn’t earn.Paul Wilmott correctly contends that the cause of the current fiscal crisis emanates from the free-rider mentality that spurred Wall Street: bankers will continue “taking risks with other people’s money” so long as they “do not suffer equally on the downside.”Unfortunately, this free-rider mentality has infected not only Wall Street bankers, but also our collective American psyche. Witness the huge government debt that we have incurred, undoubtedly a form of risk-taking that we, for the most part, will not pay for, but our children will.Many blame predatory lending practices for the recent bank failures. I blame the inability of lenders to calculate the effect of a variable interest rate on their monthly mortgage payments.In a culture in which people chuckle at how bad they were in math during their school years, the cost of mathematical illiteracy to this nation is now measured in the tens of billions.The writer, an astrophysicist, is director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History.My student loans are too big and it is hurting the economy.

"'08-09-19,'1','To inaugurate Music on Macdougal, a concert series at the Players Theater, Sequenza21 offered a program celebrating the 50th anniversary of Minimalism on Wednesday evening. But the concept — and to a lesser extent, the performance — provoked a reconsideration of the historical timeline.For a lot of us, Minimalism is a quintessential ’60s movement, with Terry Riley’s 1964 “In C” as the first work in the style to become famous (thanks to a CBS recording) and the term itself cropping up in 1968, shortly after Steve Reich and Philip Glass began using repetition, in different ways, to create elastic, hypnotic scores that were a perfect soundtrack for that trippy time.Sequenza21, and many new-music historians, date Minimalism to La Monte Young’s String Trio, composed in 1958 — when Eisenhower was president, cars were finned behemoths, Van Cliburn won the Tchaikovsky Competition and Elvis Presley went into the Army. Minimalism arose from that? Who knew?The argument turns on the question of how you define Minimalism. Mr. Young’s trio was not performed on Wednesday, but Joseph Kubera, the pianist, played two works — both called “Piano Piece” (1958, 1960) — by Terry Jennings, a friend and colleague of Mr. Young’s. They are Minimalist in the sense that their textures are spare, with notes and chords played softly separated by long silences, in which a listener savors the decay of the sound. Yet Mr. Jennings used 12-tone rows and dissonances: from that perspective, these pieces have more in common with Webern than with Mr. Riley and company.Mr. Reich and Mr. Glass were represented by works composed in 1967 that show the different approaches each took to this new musical language. Mr. Reich’s “Piano Phase” — Russell Greenberg and Mike McCurdy gave a focused, energetic reading on marimbas — is one of several works in which Mr. Reich has two players beginning in sync, gradually moving out of phase and then coming back together in the final bars. Much of the effect is psycho-acoustic: on the page, the strongly rhythmic figures are melodically and harmonically simple, but as the lines move out of phase the overtones take on a life of their own, creating waves of rhythm and melody that are not in the printed score, but are this music’s lifeblood.If phasing was Mr. Reich’s engine of choice, Mr. Glass’s was additive process, a technique in which repeated figures slowly take on (and later shed) extra notes and phrases. That was the point of “Piece in the Shape of a Square,” an intensely contrapuntal flute duet given an athletic, graceful account by Elizabeth Janzen and Jessica Schmitz.'"
"'08-09-19,'1','As it settles into its 10th year, President Hugo Chávez’s government has consolidated power by eliminating the independence of the judiciary, punishing critical news organizations and engaging in wide-ranging acts of political discrimination against opponents, a human rights group said in a report released on Thursday in Caracas.The report, by Human Rights Watch, which is widely known in Latin America for condemning human rights abuses in Colombia, a top Latin American ally of the United States and an ideological rival of Venezuela, was made public at a delicate time for Mr. Chávez, who expelled the American ambassador last week in an angry speech laced with expletives.Before the release of the report, Mr. Chávez was already facing a backlash from his opponents in Venezuela after supporting a blacklist to prevent opposition candidates from running for office in regional elections this year and using his decree powers last month to enact 26 laws further concentrating authority in his hands.The detailed report by Human Rights Watch, which is based in New York, described political discrimination as a defining feature of Mr. Chávez’s presidency, a policy at times carried out with explicit endorsements from the president. Purges of opposition personnel in the national oil company and state agencies have been particularly thorough in recent years.José Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director at Human Rights Watch who released the report in Caracas, the capital, acknowledged that Venezuela was a relatively open society in which public debate still flourished. But he said that Mr. Chávez, through his repeated demonization of opponents as “putschists,” had instilled what he described as an “environment of fear.”'"

"'08-09-19,'1','“Denise makes raising money so much fun,” he said. “I’ve always believed the hard part is raising money before the evening. Because once we get to the evening, it should be a blast.”The guests included past and present stalwarts of Gabrielle’s Angel — Clive Davis from the music industry, Marty Richards of Broadway, Star Jones (formerly) of “The View,” and Joan Collins from another decade — as well as a large number invited mainly for the potential depth of their pockets. They inhaled the view of Central Park and the Plaza Hotel at twilight, sat on chaise lounges upholstered in turquoise and purple silks, and nibbled experimental canapés including tiny fried-oyster sandwiches accompanied on the caterers’ trays by tiny mugs of dark beer.“This is the time of night a party is supposed to be given — and at this location,” Mr. Richards said, admiring the sunset.After dark, a short film about the foundation, featuring voiceovers by Mr. Clinton and Barbara Walters, was projected in small format onto the building’s yellow-brick exterior.Inez Weinstein, a fund-raising specialist who has run Ms. Rich’s events for the last eight years, said that Gabrielle’s Gala — the forthcoming benefit — was on course to raise $1.5 million. “We were well over $500,000 last week, and that was before the invitations even went out,” she said. (The 2007 gala raised $5 million; 2006, $1.4 million. The planners purposely alternate between smaller and larger parties, so perhaps they should consider themselves lucky to have a lower goal in this of all seasons.)Ms. Weinstein acknowledged, however, that the economic picture gave her the jitters, particularly given the scale of the galas she puts on. Over the next two months, she is producing events to benefit the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, Petra Nemcova’s Happy Hearts Fund, and Tony Bennett’s Exploring the Arts foundation. The three have a combined fund-raising goal of $10 million.“The ovarian cancer total hit $3 million yesterday,” she said. “Everything must have been mailed out to us before the weekend.”As for Gabrielle’s Gala, Ms. Weinstein was hoping that Ms. Rich’s far-ranging set of contacts would prevail — “she spends all summer traveling around Europe and she brings in a lot of money from Russians and from Dubai” — but was nervous about finding contributions locally.“I got Howard’s list last night of potential donors, and it was heavy in banking and finance,” Ms. Weinstein said, referring to Mr. Lutnick. “I said, ‘Howard, we’re doing this in the worst time in history.’ He said, ‘Don’t worry, the room will be full.’ ”On Ms. Rich’s rooftop, Mr. Lutnick said that the possible end of the investment banking business as we know it would not stop him from finding donors. “I still think if your cause is core, if it’s respected people raising money for the right purpose — well, we’re going to do fine,” he said. “I don’t perceive raising money for cancer research as a challenge we can’t meet.”For many of the party guests, the crisis on Wall Street could apparently be heard, but not yet felt. “Even as crazy as the world is right now, for some reason we have so much support,” Ms. Rich said.Clive Davis, who founded Arista Records, said he was betting on the foundation’s track record. “I was there for the first one Denise threw — I’ve always had a table,” he said. “It always meets the mark. I was here when she bought this apartment. I picked out those trees in the pots. What are you going to do, stay home?”'"
"'08-09-19,'1','SAN FRANCISCO — Oracle shrugged off concerns Thursday that an imploding financial sector and slowing global economy would hamper technology spending while reporting financial results that cheered Wall Street analysts.“It is a real nothing special quarter,” Safra A. Catz, Oracle’s president, said.The business software maker closed large deals at usual rates during August, Ms. Catz said.Given the concerns in a week in which financial giants tumbled, Oracle provided some reassurance. “Our exposure to banking customers is in the low-single digits,” Ms. Catz said. “Our exposure to U.S. banks is even lower.”She said Oracle had assessed the amount of business it did with some of the troubled companies on Wall Street and did not think their issues had any material impact on sales.Shares of Oracle rose 65 cents, to $18.75. They rose $1.15, or 6.1 percent, in after-hours trading.Oracle reported net income for its first fiscal quarter, which ended Aug. 31, of $1.1 billion, or 21 cents a share, up 28 percent from $840 million a year ago. The results topped predictions by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.'"
"'08-09-19,'1','It was brief, two minutes. His brow was furrowed, and his words were careful: “The American people can be sure we will continue to act to strengthen and stabilize our financial markets and improve investor confidence.” Then, having imparted no specifics, he once again slipped out of sight.In the increasingly surreal world of the White House, the appearance was a sign that all pretense of normalcy is gone. All week long, with Wall Street engulfed by what analysts are calling the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, President Bush had mostly stayed out of sight, except when trying to maintain the façade of business as usual.To be sure, other presidents, most recently Mr. Bush’s predecessor, Bill Clinton, have been careful about what they say in public when Wall Street is in turmoil. But by all outward appearances, Mr. Bush has been reduced this week to almost a bit player in his own government, as Washington has reoriented itself away from the White House and toward Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.On Monday, as Americans absorbed the news that the venerable investment bank Lehman Brothers had been forced into bankruptcy, Mr. Bush received John Kufuor, the president of Ghana, at the White House. The sun-dappled South Lawn was awash in color that morning, as a full military honor guard and a fife and drum band marched across the grass, entertaining the leaders before they exchanged the customary pleasantries.“Your tenure has been full of events and challenges, some very mind-boggling and hair-raising,” Mr. Kufuor told Mr. Bush, raising more than a few eyebrows. “You are a survivor,” the Ghanaian leader told the American president. “And my hope is that history would prove kinder to you.”That evening, after the stock market had nose-dived, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling more than 500 points, Mr. Bush, his wife Laura and more than 100 of their guests dined on Maine lobster and ginger-scented lamb during a state dinner in the African leader’s honor. Then, in their tuxedoes and ball gowns they repaired to the Rose Garden to watch actors from Disney’s musical “The Lion King” perform a medley of songs under the cool, dark Washington sky.'"
"'08-09-19,'1','Ms. Stockton Bagnulo decided that none of that should stop her. She built up experience at various independent bookstores (including, currently, McNally Jackson, where she is the events coordinator). A resident of Park Slope, she took a class from the Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation. Researching business plans for bookstores at the Brooklyn Public Library, she noticed fliers for a Citibank-sponsored competition for business plans, entered it — along with 200 other dreamers — and won the $15,000 first prize.Meanwhile, a couple of neighborhoods over, in Fort Greene, a business group did a survey of residents in which 75 percent of respondents named a bookstore as their first choice for an addition to their retail landscape (which is already well-stocked with places where you can buy a $4 latte or a $150 bottle of wine). “We were hoping to find someone who owned a bookstore already,” said John Zeitlin, a member of the Fort Greene Indie Bookstore Initiative, an offshoot of the Fort Greene Retail Association, which conducted the survey. “But most of them weren’t in expansion mode.”The group met Ms. Stockton Bagnulo after reading about her prize in The Daily News, and this week gave her a party in the lobby of the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music to introduce her to the neighbors and enlist their help, financial and otherwise.A tough week for everyone, it has been particularly rough in its own way for literary types, who learned on Sunday that David Foster Wallace had hanged himself, then opened up New York magazine on Monday to find a story about the book publishing industry titled, simply, “The End.” The Fort Greene party, given everything else going on in the world, felt like a pocket of irrational exuberance, even extravagance — a through-the-looking-glass scene in which an independent bookstore, of all things, was the cause for great optimism and celebration.Sushi donated by a local restaurant owner decked a generous buffet table, and bookish volunteers from around the city — a librarian’s 20-something son, a woman who works for the book publisher John Wiley & Sons — offered the 300 guests wine (also donated by a local merchant). Literary stars from the neighborhood — Colson Whitehead, Jennifer Egan and even Jhumpa Lahiri, the book world’s Garbo — all showed up to offer support.Halfway through the event, Ms. Stockton Bagnulo announced with glee that she had a business partner — Rebecca Fitting, a 34-year-old sales representative for Random House who decided a few weeks earlier to devote a sizable chunk of her nest egg to the cause of making the store a reality. Now they just needed a space, and enough additional money to give them the leeway to do it right.A competition, a party, overflowing community support, celebrities of a sort, an energetic young woman prone to saying plucky things like “All I had was my ambition and my passion” — these are the ingredients of a story of someone realizing a remarkable dream, like crossing the Atlantic in a hot air balloon. That opening a humble local bookstore in New York has more in common with that kind of improbable adventure than, say, opening a dry cleaner is, in its own way, a depressing sign of the times.“Maybe I’m an optimist, but I see the other side of it,” said Ms. Stockton Bagnulo. “Which is that only a bookstore can inspire this kind of passion.”'"
"'08-09-19,'1','But bankers say that because the funds have already invested billions in American financial institutions, they are less likely to put more cash into that sector right now. Middle East sovereign wealth funds “put more money in a few months ago then they would have ideally done,” because financials were cheap then, Mr. Nasr said. That has “unbalanced” the portfolios of sovereign wealth investors, he said. “Now they need to go in the other direction” to diversify, buying up assets that are not financial institutions.Sovereign wealth funds “haven’t disappeared, they’ve remained on the sidelines or gone elsewhere,” said Jan Randolph, head of sovereign risk at Global Insight, an economic forecasting firm with offices in London and Boston.Middle East firms that were eager investors in financial companies a few quarters ago are staying away because the “magnitude of the crisis is much bigger than anyone thought,” Mr. Randolph said. “No one needs to take on unnecessary risks right now,” he said, and it seems like an unnecessary risk to try to chart the course of the tight credit market by doing a deal for a bank or investment bank.The funds are also likely to be turned off by regulatory hurdles, political scrutiny and management issues. Large foreign investments in American financial institutions receive progressively more scrutiny, with the highest level reserved for foreign bids involving majority control.Foreign purchases of American banks have attracted particular attention since 1991 when the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a Luxembourg bank, was seized by regulators. The bank had purchased stakes in American financial institutions without fully disclosing its involvement to regulators.Political concerns are another issue. None of the big sovereign wealth funds want to engage in type of bruising battle in the Congress that the energy company Cnooc of China faced when it lost the fight for Unocal.Finally, the sovereign wealth funds generally have small staffs, with few operations employees who could be sent to protect the funds’ interests in the event they took control of a major investment bank.“There might be some minority stakes purchased, but I don’t think you’ll see majority stakes,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, the chief investment strategist at CFC Seymour, a Hong Kong securities firm.Some sovereign wealth funds in Asia are still interested in American financial assets. For example, South Korea’s state-run fund, the Korea Asset Management Corporation, or Kamco, is hoping to buy nearly a billion dollars in nonperforming loans in the United States.Temasek Holdings, Merrill Lynch’s biggest shareholder, may even have turned a tidy short-term profit on its banking investment. Temasek, the Singapore government’s sovereign wealth fund, spent $5.9 billion to buy stakes in Merrill Lynch that totaled 14 percent. Bank of America said Monday it would buy Merrill Lynch for $50 billion. The deal may earn Temasek a $1.5 billion profit, Bloomberg estimates.'"
"'08-09-19,'1','MOSCOW — The Russian government will inject up to $20 billion into domestic stocks in an effort to halt the free fall of the Russian stock markets, President Dmitri A. Medvedev said Thursday, in the most direct effort yet to use oil profits to ease a deepening stock market crisis here.The two main Russian stock exchanges remained closed Thursday after authorities halted trading Wednesday afternoon. By that time, they had each lost about 57 percent since their peaks in May — the steepest fall of any major stock market since the current financial crisis erupted from Wall Street.In addition to fallout from turmoil in New York and declining oil prices, the Russian market has been weakened by poor corporate governance standards here and investor concerns about a breach in relations with the West after the war in Georgia.But unlike the American financial institutions that were bought up or declared bankruptcy this week, Russia has plenty of capital. The question is whether injecting some of it into the stock market will be enough to restore investor confidence — or whether it will be perceived as a sign of official desperation and perhaps even reason to flee Russian securities.Authorities used the market holiday to unveil measures intended to restore confidence in what had been until this year one of the world’s best-performing emerging markets.'"
"'08-09-19,'1','But so far, the poll suggests, the boost has not gone far beyond that. The poll found that even now, voters are much more likely to identify Mr. Obama — and not Mr. McCain — as someone who would bring change to Washington. He is widely viewed as someone who would continue or expand President Bush’s policies in office.And the New York Times/CBS News poll found no evidence, at least to date, that Ms. Palin has allowed Mr. McCain to expand his appeal to women voters or independent voters. Polls taken immediately after the convention had found evidence of a sharp increase in support for Mr. McCain among white women, but this poll suggests that that effect was, so far at least, limited. White women were evenly divided between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama; before the conventions, Mr. McCain led Mr. Obama among white women, 44 percent to 37 percent.Indeed, in many ways it was as if the past action-packed month — with two conventions and two vice presidential selections — almost did not happen at all. The Times/CBS News poll found the contest is be about where it was before the two conventions and before the vice-presidential selections: Mr. Obama had the support of 48 percent of registered voters, compared with 43 percent for Mr. McCain, a difference within the poll’s margin of sampling error, and statistically unchanged from the tally in the last New York Times/CBS News poll, in mid-August.The latest Times/CBS News nationwide telephone poll was taken Friday through Tuesday with 1,133 adults, including 1,004 registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all respondents and for registered voters.The poll showed that Mr. McCain had some enduring strengths, including a substantial advantage over Mr. Obama as a potential commander in chief. It found that for the first time, 50 percent of those surveyed in the Times/CBS News poll said they considered that the troop buildup in Iraq, a policy that Mr. McCain championed from the start, had made things better there.The poll was taken during a period of extraordinary turmoil on Wall Street. By overwhelming numbers, Americans said the economy was the top issue affecting their vote decision, and they continued to express deep pessimism about the nation’s economic future. They continued to express greater confidence in Mr. Obama’s ability to manage the economy, even as Mr. McCain has aggressively sought to raise doubts about it.This poll found evidence of concern about Ms. Palin’s qualifications to be president, particularly compared with Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, Mr. Obama’s running mate. More than 6 in 10 said they would be concerned if Mr. McCain could not finish his term and Ms. Palin had to take over. In contrast, two-thirds of voters surveyed said Mr. Biden would be qualified to take over for Mr. Obama, a figure that cut across party lines.And 75 percent said they thought Mr. McCain had picked Ms. Palin more to help him win the election than because he thought that she was well qualified to be president; by contrast, 31 percent said they thought that Mr. Obama had picked Mr. Biden more to help him win the election, while 57 percent said it was because he thought Mr. Biden was well qualified for the job.This poll was taken right after Ms. Palin sat down for a series of high-profile interviews with Charles Gibson on ABC News.Over the last two weeks, Mr. McCain has increasingly tried to distance himself from his party and President Bush, running as an outsider against Washington. The poll suggested the urgency of Mr. McCain’s task: The percentage of Americans who disapprove of the way Mr. Bush is conducting his job, 68 percent, was as high as it has been for any sitting president in the history of New York Times polling. And 81 percent said the country was heading in the wrong direction.The poll found that 46 percent of voters thought Mr. McCain would continue Mr. Bush’s policies, while 22 percent said he would be more conservative than Mr. Bush. (About one-quarter said a McCain presidency would be less conservative than Mr. Bush’s.) At a time when Mr. McCain has tried to appeal to independent voters by separating himself from his party, notably with his convention speech, 57 percent of all voters said they viewed him as a typical Republican, compared with 40 percent who said he was a different kind of Republican.Although nearly half of voters also described Mr. Obama as a typical Democrat, the party’s brand is not as diminished as the Republicans’; the Democratic Party had a favorability rating of 50 percent in August, compared with 37 percent for the Republicans, a fairly consistent trend in the Times/CBS News Poll since 2006, and part of the general political landscape that many analysts believe favors the Democrats.In one of the sharpest differences highlighted in the poll, 37 percent said that Mr. McCain would bring real change to Washington, up from 28 percent before the two parties’ conventions. But 65 percent of those polled said that Mr. Obama would bring real change to Washington.Despite weeks of fierce Republican attacks, Mr. Obama has maintained an edge on several key measures of presidential leadership, including economic stewardship. Sixty percent of voters said they were confident in his ability to make the right decisions on the economy, compared with 53 percent who felt that way about Mr. McCain. Sixty percent also said he understood the needs and problems “of people like yourself,” compared with 48 percent who said that of Mr. McCain.More than twice as many said an Obama presidency would improve the image of the United States around the world, 55 percent, compared with those who believed a McCain presidency would do so. Mr. Obama also gets high marks for “sharing the values most Americans try to live by,” despite concerted Republican efforts to portray him as elite and out of touch with average voters. Sixty-six percent said Mr. Obama shared their values, compared with 61 percent who said that about Mr. McCain.Mr. McCain, however, was maintaining some core advantages, particularly on preparedness to be president and ability to serve as commander in chief. Forty-eight percent said Mr. Obama was prepared enough to be president, compared with 71 percent who rated Mr. McCain as adequately prepared.Fifty-two percent said it was “very likely” that Mr. McCain would be an effective commander in chief, twice as many as felt that way about Mr. Obama.The two men received similar rankings when voters were asked about what had long been perceived as a McCain strength: the ability to make the right decisions about the war in Iraq. Fifty-two percent said they were “very” or “somewhat” confident in Mr. Obama’s ability on this front; 56 percent said they felt that way about Mr. McCain.In general, Ms. Palin was viewed more favorably (40 percent) than unfavorably (30 percent). She was particularly popular among fellow Republicans, conservatives and white voters who describe themselves as evangelical Christians, which explains her energizing effect on the Republican base. Nearly 70 percent of Mr. McCain’s supporters said they were enthusiastic about the selection of Ms. Palin; 27 percent of Mr. Obama’s supporters said they were enthusiastic about the selection of Mr. Biden.When asked who they thought would win in November, 45 percent said Mr. Obama and 38 percent said Mr. McCain.'"
"'08-09-19,'1','Benefits of the approach have been seen before. In Alaska, a catch-share system adopted in 1995 has transformed an intense race to catch the last allowable fish into a sustainable and profitable fishery. But the researchers said their study was the first global assessment of this kind of rights-based management.Other researchers said the new study was likely to be influential as officials who manage fisheries around the world considered how to stave off disastrous declines.Ray Hilborn, a fisheries expert at the University of Washington, praised the new work but said: “There is nothing surprising in it. A lot of us have been arguing that various forms of catch shares or dedicated access is essential.”Dr. Costello and his co-authors, Steven D. Gaines, an ecologist at Santa Barbara, and John Lynham, an economist at the University of Hawaii, looked at data from more than 11,000 commercial fisheries around the world, of which 121 had established ownership share systems from 1950 to 2003. Collapse rates were so much lower in the share systems, they concluded, that they saw “the potential for greatly altering the future of global fisheries.”For example, Dr. Gaines said, the Alaska halibut fishery — that is, fishing for halibut in Alaskan waters — is regulated by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, one of eight regional regulatory councils established by Congress. Each year the council, with the advice of scientists, sets the size of the yearly catch in the fishery.For the purposes of the study, Dr. Gaines said, the researchers considered 64 large marine ecosystems, like the Gulf of Mexico, and studied the management of individual fish species in each.The researchers said they drew on the work of scientists at Dalhousie University, in Nova Scotia, who have reported that most of the world’s most important fishing stocks are in precipitous decline. In particular, they relied on data gathered by Boris Worm. He and colleagues reported in 2006 that if current fishing practices continue, all the world’s major commercial stocks will have collapsed by 2048 — that is, they will be at 10 percent or less of their historic maximums.This gloomy prediction has been controversial, but there is wide agreement that many commercial fisheries are in steep decline. Using the standard Dr. Worm used, the researchers found that more than a third of commercial fisheries had collapsed by 2003. The figure for fisheries managed with some form of a catch-share system was half that.The authors of the new report said it would be premature to draw a straight line between rights-based management and restored stocks. For one thing, they said, the approach is common in just a few areas, like Alaska, Iceland, New Zealand and Australia, so it is possible, they wrote, that differences in the kinds of fish caught or other regional factors might “generate misleading results.” Or the fisheries might have been better managed in the first place and less vulnerable to collapse.“That is definitely a weakness in the design” of the study, Dr. Hilborn said, but the only way to know would be to randomly assign various fisheries to different management schemes, “and you cannot do that in the real world.”'"
"'08-09-19,'1','There may be a price for all this. After his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, riveted the overflow crowd for 16 minutes on Tuesday at an airplane hangar here, it was Mr. McCain’s turn, and people in his audience began murmuring and drifting away midway through a 14-minute speech that was flat and cheerless. When Mr. McCain made his first appearance without Ms. Palin, on Monday morning in Jacksonville, Fla., he faced an arena that was one-quarter full.Still, it is the course Mr. McCain has chosen and one his aides say he will stay on.To a certain extent, Mr. McCain, of Arizona, is grappling with the fact that he is now a general election candidate in an environment where, more than ever, the other side (or reporters who are following him) is ready to seize on any slip-up, real or imagined. This is no time for the idle remark, bout of frankness or edgy humor that once stood Mr. McCain apart on the candidate field.And what voters are seeing in these final weeks of the campaign is a deliberately retooled version of Mr. McCain — what he says, how he says it and how he goes about the day-to-day steps of campaigning. It came about as part of a fundamental reordering of his campaign that resulted from the ascension of the hard-driving, disciplined Steve Schmidt, a senior campaign adviser and veteran of President Bush’s 2004 campaign, who popped up on Mr. McCain’s plane one day this week.Mr. McCain is by all appearances struggling to stick to his script and avoiding, whenever possible, events that his campaign cannot control.There are now not one but two drawn curtains on Mr. McCain’s plane separating his spacious quarters from the press corps. Left idle is the couch that was built in the front of the plane — called “Straight Talk Air” — to reproduce at 30,000 feet the freewheeling chats with reporters that were the stock-in-trade on his bus; the other morning it was covered with newspapers. Mr. McCain, who promised to hold weekly news conferences if elected president, has not held one in more than a month.He recently began doing town-hall-style meetings with voters, including one with Ms. Palin on Wednesday night in Grand Rapids, Mich. But these are mostly by invitation only — reminiscent of Mr. Bush’s town-hall-style meetings of 2004 — as was made obvious by the succession of softball and adulatory questions floated across his plate.For anyone who has covered Mr. McCain over the last decade, this new version of the candidate can be a striking sight. There the senator was the other day leading a crowd in a chant of “drill, baby, drill,” the words that now invariably arise from his crowds when he talks about his support for offshore drilling, a position he once rejected.There are the attacks against Wall Street — the denunciation of cheats and greed and self-dealing — which recall the decidedly populist cant of Al Gore when he was the Democratic nominee for president in 2000. Mr. McCain attacked Mr. Obama, of Illinois, for holding a celebrity-strewn, big-dollar fund-raiser in Hollywood despite the fact that he had just held his own celebrity-strewn, big-dollar fund-raiser in Hollywood.There are the indignant attacks on corruption and self-dealing in Congress, the institution in which he has served for 25 years. “The word is going out, my friends — to the old-boy network, the pork-barrelers, the earmarkers — that change is coming,” Mr. McCain said at stop after stop. “Change is coming! Two mavericks are coming to Washington, and we’re going to shake things up!”And most notable are the dizzying cascade of attacks on Mr. Obama, who seems to have come to consume Mr. McCain as the weather turns cool, a reminder that this long election cycle is approaching its end.“Let’s have some straight talk,” he said. “Senator Obama is not interested in the politics of hope. He’s interested in his political future. That’s why he is hurtling insults and making up facts.”For years, Mr. McCain has struck a different kind of cloth as a presidential candidate: as a politician capable of defying his party or embracing it; holding a world view that defied any easy ideological setting; having an ironic detachment as he observed himself on the campaign trail, combined with a sly sense of humor that leavened his occasional bursts of temper.These days, Mr. McCain sounds less like his old self than Bob Dole, another Republican senator who ran for president in 1996, sounded in the closing days of his campaign — speaking louder or repeating statements that he thinks might be overlooked. “The American economy is in a crisis!” Mr. McCain said. “It’s in a crisis!”Mr. McCain’s aides suggested that their candidate would spend as much time as possible campaigning with Ms. Palin in the final weeks of the race, pointing to her proven ability not only to draw a crowd but also to animate the ticket in a way that Mr. McCain cannot. And she has shown no hesitancy about carrying a traditional burden of vice-presidential candidates by attacking Mr. Obama.But these days, this Mr. McCain seems content carrying that burden himself.'"
"'08-09-19,'1','Caught in a wild and gyrating market, crude oil prices briefly returned to triple-digit territory on Thursday, but gave up most of their gains to fall below $100 a barrel by the end of the day.Crude oil futures settled at $97.88 a barrel, up 72 cents for the day, after jumping above $102 when trading opened on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The rise followed a 6.6 percent jump on Wednesday when panicky investors fled the stock market to seek shelter in the perceived safety of commodities.After spending six months above $100, oil prices slumped earlier in the week because of concerns that the financial turmoil on Wall Street would slow economic growth and hurt oil demand. Prices fell to $91.51 a barrel on Tuesday, but since then they have made up some of their losses.The worry in the markets now centers on efforts to restart production and refining operations on the Gulf Coast, the nation’s largest energy hub, which was battered by two powerful hurricanes in recent weeks. The disruptions forced oil companies to draw on their inventories, pushing stockpiles to their lowest levels in years.Oil inventories are now below their five-year average and gasoline stockpiles are at their lowest since 1969. Retail gasoline prices spiked in recent days but fell slightly Thursday, to about $3.84 a gallon on average, according to the automobile club AAA.To make up for short-term disruptions in fuel supplies, the government is considering appeals to the International Energy Agency to release emergency fuel stocks. The agency, whose role is to coordinate energy policies for 27 industrialized nations, last released emergency supplies after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Even without government action, refiners are already exporting extra gasoline from Europe.'"
"'08-09-19,'1','The authorities also announced that Ji Chuntang, the mayor of Shijiazhuang, a city whose officials have been accused of failing to deal with reports of tainted formula, had been dismissed. He was the most senior official to be punished so far.Sanlu Group, one of China’s largest dairy companies and the first company that was found to be selling contaminated formula, has its headquarters in Shijiazhuang, which is in the northern province of Hebei. Investigators have discovered traces of melamine, an industrial chemical, in batches of powdered baby formula made by the 22 dairy companies, all of which have said they were recalling their milk products.Producers trying to cut costs often dilute milk with water, which lowers the nutritional content. But the addition of melamine, which is high in nitrogen, helps the milk appear to meet nutrition standards by artificially raising its protein count.Mr. Ji was dismissed in the investigation of what appeared to be a chain of neglect and a cover-up that began with Sanlu. Sanlu received complaints months ago about suspected problems in the formula, but the company waited until Aug. 2 to tell the Shijiazhuang city government, Hebei’s deputy governor said Wednesday. City officials waited until Sept. 9 to tell provincial officials, who did not inform the central government until the next day.Sanlu finally recalled 700 tons of the formula on Sept. 11.Mr. Ji’s firing indicated that the political consequences of the scandal could increase as more information emerges on the role played by officials and as the death toll climbs. Four city officials were fired before Mr. Ji’s dismissal. The general manager of Sanlu, Tian Wenhua, has also been fired and was detained by the police.The police in Hebei Province have arrested 18 people, including six who sold melamine to milk producers, the official news agency Xinhua reported. The others were milk producers who added melamine to their products and then sold the milk to dairy companies.The police are seeking a milk seller named Xue Jianzhong, who is accused of adding melamine to his milk. Mr. Xue was put on a wanted list late Wednesday, Xinhua reported.On Thursday, Hong Kong ordered the recall of the dairy products of the Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group after tests found melamine in 8 of the company’s 30 products.United States Food and Drug Administration officials said they had been reassured by manufacturers of infant formula for the American market that they did not import products or ingredients from China.An F.D.A. official said the agency was also inspecting bulk shipments from Asia to examine milk-derived ingredients, like milk protein concentrate and whey powder, in order to determine if they were contaminated with melamine. So far all the samples have shown no contamination.'"
"'08-09-19,'1','The move seemed to cheer equity investors, who reversed part of the earlier deep slide in Asian markets and bid stocks up in Europe. American stock indexes opened with strong gains, with the Dow Jones industrials rising more than 100 points in early trading.The central problem is that, lacking confidence in one another’s ability to repay, banks have slowed their lending to each other via the money markets. The short-term rates at which they borrow have surged as they seek to keep cash on their books.Besides the Fed, the coordinated action involved the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and central banks in Canada, Switzerland and Britain.Analysts are starting to talk about the need for much more intervention from Washington, warning that Thursday’s move would not provide a quick fix to unlock bank lending.Writing in The Financial Times on Thursday, Kenneth S. Rogoff, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said the United States would have to spend 5 to 10 times as much as it already has on bailouts, an amount closer to $1 trillion to $2 trillion.The monetary fund had estimated in April that the losses related to the crisis, which started in mortgage markets in the United States, would be $1 trillion.Such a rescue would dwarf the huge bailout of the American financial system in the 1980s by the Resolution Trust Corporation, a government-owned, asset-management company charged with liquidating assets of thrifts and the Japanese government’s mass purchase of bad debts from banks during the 1990s.“We are moving from a monetary solution to a fiscal solution,” said Richard McGuire, a fixed-income strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London. He said that while the central banks’ moves had helped, other efforts would be needed.Traders usually look at spreads in the money markets to measure the health of the money markets and judge whether banks are willing to lend to one another — and ultimately to consumers. Spreads are the differences between interest rate charges overnight and those charged over a longer period.After the fund injections by the banks, the cost of borrowing dollars overnight fell, with the benchmark Libor rate falling 1.19 percentage points, to 3.84 percent, Bloomberg News reported, citing the British Bankers’ Association.But the gap between three-month United States Treasury yields and the three-month London interbank, or Libor, rate — known in the market as the TED Spread — narrowed only slightly, to around 299 basis points at midday in London, from just over 300 basis points Thursday. A similar slight narrowing of spreads was seen in sterling and euro markets.“The dust may settle and the market may take a more sanguine view in time,” Mr. McGuire said, “but for now, it looks like a palliative rather than a panacea.”In its statement Thursday, the Fed said that as part of the infusion, it had also authorized increases in the existing swap lines with the European Central Bank, up to $110 billion, from $55 billion, and the Swiss National Bank, up to $27 billion, from $15 billion. Similar arrangements were announced with the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada.“The central banks continue to work together closely and will take appropriate steps to address the ongoing pressures,” the European Central Bank said in a statement.Smaller central banks were also active on Thursday in providing extra money to their country’s financial systems so as to make sure that banks and other financial institutions could find money to borrow without having to pay exorbitant interest rates.The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, for example, injected 1.556 billion Hong Kong dollars, worth $200 million, into the territory’s banking system on Thursday afternoon, John Tsang, the financial secretary of Hong Kong, said.The monetary authority acted after the interest rate that Hong Kong banks pay to borrow money overnight from one another suddenly tripled shortly after lunchtime, to 4 percent, and threatened to rise further.The maneuver appeared to be successful, with overnight interest rates falling through the rest of the afternoon. Central banks in Japan, Australia and India pumped tens of billions more into money markets, while China’s central bank said it had lowered the rate at which it conducts bond repurchase agreements.Analysts said the central banks were doing what they could.“This is clearly a very significant help and central banks are showing decisive leadership here as risk aversion is hitting the private sector,” said Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclays Capital in London.Still, noting that the Fed left its benchmark short-term rate unchanged this week, analysts said that the cash infusions did not necessarily mean that central banks would lower their benchmark short-term interest rates.“If anything,” Mr. Callow said. “this sends the signal that they are trying to achieve stability via money markets rather than by cutting short-term rates.”'"

"'08-09-20,'0','The European pairings for Saturday morning’s foursomes, announced Friday evening, had two big surprises: two of the most decorated Ryder Cup players, Sergio García of Spain and Lee Westwood of England, were not on the list.García is 8-0-1 in his Ryder Cup career in foursomes, or alternate-ball, play. Westwood, who was paired with García in Friday’s foursomes and tied Kenny Perry and Jim Furyk, is 6-2-3 in his career in the foursomes format. Westwood is playing in his sixth Ryder Cup, García in his fifth.Together, García and Westwood have nearly twice as many foursomes Ryder Cup victories as the entire American team combined.Westwood, teamed with Soren Hansen of Sweden, halved his Friday afternoon four-ball match against Boo Weekley and J. B. Holmes. García, paired with Miguel Ángel Jiménez, lost decisively to the Americans Justin Leonard and Hunter Mahan, 4 and 3, in the afternoon.Nick Faldo, the European captain, spoke to reporters before the pairings were announced. The American captain Paul Azinger said of Faldo’s decision: “I’m not going to justify it. Ask Nick.”'"
"'08-09-20,'0','Debt can also act as a drag on economic growth, she said, pointing to heavily indebted countries like Italy and Japan. And although public debt does not by itself fuel inflation, it can tempt governments to pursue an inflationary policy, as has happened regularly in Italy in recent years.Not all of the potential consequences of the plan are negative. Nouriel Roubini, an economist known for his pessimistic views, said the rescue, if properly executed, could lift the economy by reducing the burden on households, particularly those afflicted by troubled mortgages.“If you reduce their debt payments, they will start spending again,” said Mr. Roubini, a professor at New York University. “It’s not going to help us avoid a recession, but it could make it shorter.”To finance the rescue effort, the United States will have to borrow even more from foreign investors. That has not been a problem in recent days, given the intense demand for Treasury bills, which are perceived as a safe haven by investors around the world.But if the bailout does not quickly restore confidence in the American financial system, foreign investment could slow, which would drive up the cost of financing that debt, said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard.So far, the dollar has shown remarkable resilience in foreign markets, suggesting, he said, that foreigners still have faith in the ability of the United States to get out of this crisis.The concerns of foreign central banks over the fate of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, played a role in the Treasury department’s rescue of the mortgage finance giants. That influence is likely to grow, along with the debt they hold.“The people with leverage are the Japanese, the Chinese and the oil-producing countries, who will want assurances that the debt they hold is worth something,” said Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who worked in the Treasury department during the Reagan administration.Mr. Steuerle said he hoped that the additional burden would force policy makers to confront the country’s long-term budget imbalances. The last time this happened, he said, was in the early 1990s, after a much more modest government rescue effort in the aftermath of the 1987 market crash.But first the Treasury department and the Federal Reserve must successfully carry out this plan. And the sheer scale and complexity of it left economists and other experts slack-jawed.“It’s like doing a quintuple jump in figure skating,” said Edwin M. Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a Treasury department official during the Clinton administration. “It’s impressive if they can do it. It’s impressive even to try.”Among the potential sources of tension is the Treasury’s ultimate decision on whether it will buy troubled mortgage-backed securities from non-American banks. European banks, like UBS, invested heavily in such securities.“If Paribas has bought a mortgage-backed security, why can’t they present it to Treasury?” Mr. Truman said. “If the government is going to do it for the American banks, they should do it for everyone.”But that could provoke a strongly negative reaction from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who already protested that other countries should chip in for the $85 billion rescue of the insurance giant American International Group, because it has operations in those countries or has insured their banks.“Are the taxpayers in the United States going to bail out all the banks in the world?” said Allan H. Meltzer, a historian of the Federal Reserve. “I just don’t know how this works out.”Mr. Meltzer said he believed the plan would be politically viable only if participation was voluntary, and if the banks that received government aid were required to pay it back later. “We’re protecting private industry, not the public interest,” Mr. Meltzer said.Beyond issues of fairness, he said the government could be overwhelmed by the task of identifying troubled securities, which are bundled together in complex packages, with varying degrees of risk. The challenge, he said, dwarfed that of the Resolution Trust Corporation during the savings and loan crisis.Perhaps the longest-term consequence of the plan is a wholesale reordering of the financial landscape. Economists said the government would almost certainly impose a raft of new regulations on banks.“It’s hyperbole to say we’re abandoning the free-market system,” Mr. Rogoff said. “But we certainly seem to be entering a new uncharted territory of regulation.”'"
"'08-09-20,'0','Down in , was also endorsing a bipartisan approach to the rescue. For good measure, he also tacked on a call on both parties to join together in backing “an emergency economic plan” crafted out of a whole bunch of things that the Republicans are never going to support in a million years.Obama declined to provide many specifics. The most notable thing about his performance this week — besides his really extraordinary skill in packing large numbers of economic advisers onto a stage — has been his calm. Even this late in the campaign, it’s hard to tell whether it’s the product of wise serenity or a low metabolism. But, under present circumstances, it was definitely soothing., on the other hand, was angry. Still. He had been angry Monday, when he blamed the financial crisis on greedy speculators, and on Tuesday, when he blamed it on people who didn’t respect the American worker. He was furious on Wednesday, when he blamed the crisis on C.E.O.’s with golden parachutes until it was pointed out that one of his highest-profile advisers, , had sailed out of Hewlett-Packard with a 24-karat whopper. On Thursday, he was mad at the head of the Securities Exchange Commission.On Friday, McCain looked steamed when he gave a new policy speech in with at his side. The Republicans have discovered that McCain can’t draw a crowd without Palin, and the dangers of letting her float off by herself are apparent. So the two are manacled together these days like and in that old escape-from-a-chain-gang movie.McCain’s proposals were pretty much in line with the emerging consensus. The real theme of the speech was assignment of blame. Normally at times of great national trauma top politicians say they want to avoid finger-pointing. But the McCainian digit was ready for action, and its owner assured the audience that he had found “plenty of places to point.”The main culprit, the finger’s final resting place, turned out to be — Obama! His opponent, McCain claimed, took campaign contributions from officials at and , and had a couple of former C.E.O.’s of Fannie Mae as advisers. “In a McCain-Palin administration, there will be no seat for these people at the policy-making table,” he vowed.Given the amount of time the campaigns have spent arguing about the misdeeds of advisers, I think we might all be better off if the term was eliminated completely. From now on, everybody who is invited to consult with a candidate should be referred to as “complete-stranger-who-dropped-by-to-talk” or perhaps “the person I thought was a deliverer.”Actually McCain’s remarks were a bit more muted than on Thursday, when he helped restore the financial markets’ shattered confidence by accusing Obama of responding to the crisis with “the kind of me-first, country-second politics” that “sees an economic crisis as a political opportunity instead of a time to lead.”Still, he managed to get himself pretty riled up, culminating in a claim that people like Obama were “too busy gaming the system” to fix things, and that the junior senator from , despite his brief career in Washington, was smack dab in the middle of a “culture of lobbying and influence-peddling” that created the whole financial crisis.He ended with a call for bipartisanship.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','This pope is looking to reconquer Europe, if not in numbers, then at the political table.“Let’s not make mistakes, there are laws in Europe that the Vatican would like to change,” said John L. Allen Jr., a columnist for the National Catholic Reporter. Benedict’s remarks in France were “not an apolitical reflection,” he said.The Vatican, Mr. Allen added, is concerned about “a progressive secularization of European institutions” that is “heavily influenced by the French model.”For one, European Union legislation forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In an ongoing clash in Britain, Catholic orphanages have said they will have to shut down or break ties with the church if they are required to place children with same-sex couples. Spain legalized same-sex marriage in 2005, following the Netherlands and Belgium.Some say the pope’s visit might encourage Catholics to speak up in opposition.For its part, the Vatican seemed pleased with Benedict’s trip. The pope’s reception in France was “encouraging,” the Rev. Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said in an interview this week. The climate in France, he said, indicated that “the church has a contribution to make and it’s accepted and respected as a cultural and moral force, a force of moral commitment.”Benedict ostensibly traveled to France for the 150th anniversary of the year a 14-year-old peasant girl, Bernadette Soubirous, said she had visions of the Virgin Mary in a Lourdes grotto that this year is expected to draw a record eight million pilgrims.Lourdes always has epitomized “a kind of Catholic counterculture” and “the power of faith over science,” said Ruth Harris, an Oxford professor and the author of “Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age.” Over the years, she said, the city’s popularity “gets strengthened in these periods where the republic is seen as persecuting the church.”That may be the case today, when some devout European Catholics see themselves as a persecuted minority facing a secular hegemony.Sociologically, “I think papal trips perform the same function as gay pride parades,” Mr. Allen said. “It’s about a group that perceives itself as a minority that has been in their view closeted for too long and wants to take it to the streets and proclaim that ‘We’re here.’ ”In Paris, an estimated quarter-million people turned out to hear the pope celebrate Mass at the Esplanade des Invalides, more than greeted Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, in his visit to Berlin in July. And thousands of young people waited for hours to hear the pope’s address in the Cathedral of Notre-Dame.In today’s Europe, many Catholics “feel the need for public manifestations of who they are because they can’t rely on the institutions of the culture to transmit it,” Mr. Allen said.But that strategy has not convinced critics. Claiming victim status “is a classic move, a deft rhetorical move,” said Paolo Flores d’Arcais, the editor of the left-wing Italian journal MicroMega, who argued for atheism in a public debate against Benedict, then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, in 2000.Some see the church as not unlike the American right, which continues to depict itself as an outside force fighting a dominant liberal culture even after eight years of Republican rule.France, Germany and Italy are now governed by church-friendly center-right coalitions. Last spring, the right made unprecedented challenges to Italy’s 30-year-old law legalizing abortion. In 2005, Italy passed a law restricting artificial insemination.“So how can you say that you’re an oppressed minority?” Mr. Flores asked. “That’s madness.”Today, Europe is defined largely in economic, not cultural, terms. It is uncertain about its identity, its shared values, its future. Will the pope’s visit change the conversation?“I don’t think it’ll change because the pope spoke,” said Mario Marazziti, a spokesman for the Community of Sant’Egidio, a lay Catholic group. But Benedict clearly has his sights on Europe. “It’s interesting,” Mr. Marazziti said. “The two don’t understand each other, but they talk to one another.”'"
"'08-09-20,'0','An initial confidence that the global crisis would spare France is eroding. A poll taken Wednesday and Thursday of about 1,000 adults and published Friday in Le Figaro found that 80 percent of the French expected “a grave economic crisis” at home. Some 94 percent expected the United States to undergo such a trauma. Sixty-six percent said that Mr. Sarkozy’s government could not protect France from the aftershocks, and only 14 percent that it could.Eric Le Boucher, an economist and editor, said Thursday that “it’s frustrating for Europeans to think they are paying for the excesses of the American financial system,” according to Jacques Mistral, head of economic studies at the French Institute of International Relations.Élie Cohen, director of research at the Center for Political Research at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, known as Sciences Po, and a member of the government’s Council of Economic Advisers, was blunter. “There’s certainly an idea that the American financial system has gone crazy,” he said in an interview. “This has dealt a mortal blow to the timid admiration we had of the American system. But not even the most conservative French person is capable of defending it anymore.”Mr. Sarkozy, who is often described as a “fisher for ideas,” is pressing his government and the European system for political responses to the economic anxieties. As president of the European Union, he is expected to make better regulation of global markets a prime topic when the European leaders meet in mid-October.One of his chief ministers, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, said Friday that the measures taken by the United States government showed the need for state intervention.“The Americans have the courage of doing a healthy purge, nationalizing when necessary,” he said in a column in Le Monde on Friday. But he added, “This shows the limits of the ideology of financial liberalism and the need for pragmatic intervention.”Growth has already slowed all over Europe. The European Commission on Sept. 10 forecast a recession in Germany, Spain and Britain, with France and Italy barely doing better. The commission had cut earlier growth estimates even before the latest financial collapses. It estimated that the economy of the 27-country European Union would expand by just 1.4 percent this year, below the 2 percent forecast in April.In July inflation hit a record 4 percent in the countries that use the euro, and in August declined only slightly, to 3.8 percent. The French economy is expected to grow by only 1 percent this year, with inflation of 3.5 percent.Last month Mr. Fillon, the prime minister, called the government together for what Yves de Kerdrel, an editorialist in Le Figaro, described at the time as “the war against recession. The war against the fall of national wealth. The war against purchasing power at half-mast.”That “war” continues, but Mr. Sarkozy’s weapons are further reduced. His policy of reducing some taxes on the middle class but raising others on companies, while doing little to reduce the budget deficit, has created confusion.“His economic policy is not easy to define, but it is incompatible with what is developing outside,” said Mr. Mistral, the economist. The high deficit, already close to breaching European Union rules, has left the government with relatively little room to maneuver in a crisis.Mr. Sarkozy’s regular attacks on the independence of the European Central Bank are not widely shared across Europe, even if some countries would also like an easing of interest rates. And France faces problems in keeping industrial jobs. The strong euro is driving companies like Renault and Airbus to outsource jobs to Asia and Eastern Europe.Mr. Cohen of the Council of Economic Advisers said that the press had exaggerated the risks of this crisis to French institutions, which are more highly regulated.“It’s not the direct effect I fear, but the indirect effect, the progressive paralysis of the system of credit that touches the whole world,” he said. “Concretely, it will be harder to find credit to finance industrial projects or housing.” And growth in 2009 could be even lower than 1 percent, he said.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','It is painfully clear that the financial system will not rebound on its own from the excessive lending and borrowing of the Bush years and the credit collapse in their wake. The one-bailout-at-a-time approach hasn’t worked. And modest steps are no longer an option.Lawmakers and administration officials must be prepared to tell Americans the full, hard truths about this plan:¶ What is this going to cost the taxpayers and who decides? It’s generally believed that many of the troubled assets that the government would buy will, in time, be worth more than they can fetch in today’s chaotic markets. That’s far from a sure thing. The assets are tied to housing, so their value will depend on how far prices fall, how many people end up defaulting and how long it takes before housing rebounds — all big unknowns.For those reasons, it’s important for Americans to know who is going to decide what is the right purchase price for these assets. Wall Street will have a role, of course, but outside experts should be allowed to analyze the results. Americans also need to know how the process will be monitored to ensure that taxpayers’ interests are protected. If the government gets the price right, the upfront outlay could be recouped when it later sells. If it overpays, the taxpayer is stuck with the loss.¶ How will Congress balance the bailout of Wall Street and the needs on Main Street? If financial markets stabilize, all Americans will benefit. But Congress must do more to provide direct help to struggling American families. Lawmakers should use the bailout legislation to also extend unemployment benefits, bolster food stamps and provide aid to state and local governments to provide health care and other services that are especially important during tough times.¶ The administration and lawmakers also need to tell Americans that the era of cheap and easy money is over and that there are more tough times to come. Whose taxes will have to go up? How will the government help to create the jobs of the future? How will the most vulnerable Americans be protected? And they need to explain that the cost of the bailouts will compete with other spending.¶ Finally, Americans need to be told a more fundamental truth: This crisis is the result of a willful and systematic failure by the government to regulate and monitor the activities of bankers, lenders, hedge funds, insurers and other market players. All were playing high-stakes poker with the financial system, but without adequate transparency, oversight or supervision.The regulatory failure, in turn, was grounded in the Bush administration’s magical belief that the market, with its invisible hand, works best when it is left alone to self regulate and self correct. The country is now paying the price for that delusion.If lawmakers and administration officials really want to restore confidence, the bailout must be only a first step. The hard work of establishing and enforcing the regulations that are needed for a truly trustworthy financial system, still lies ahead.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','This week, North Korea’s state-run news media have said Mr. Kim has been going about his usual chores and sending letters to foreign leaders and wreaths to national cemeteries. But they did not actually show him doing anything, a conspicuous omission.“It’s all nonsense spread by bad people who wish ill for our country,” Hyon Hak-bong, a North Korean diplomat, told South Korean reporters on Friday in Panmunjom, near the border. He was at a meeting on energy aid promised to the North in return for disabling its nuclear weapons programs.Reports about Mr. Kim’s health surged after he failed to appear at the parade on the Sept. 9 anniversary of the North’s founding.The South Korean government has said it believes that Mr. Kim, 66, had a stroke but that he is recovering fast, his power unchallenged. It has given no details.Mr. Kim is not known to have groomed a successor, whether one of his three sons or anyone else. His control and his country’s isolation are so complete that no one outside the North can say who is in or out of favor.The absence of facts is fertile ground for unrestrained speculation. News reports citing unnamed sources — or no sources — have proliferated. “At least North Korea doesn’t sue you,” journalists in Seoul say.Depending on which Seoul newspaper one reads, Mr. Kim’s condition varies from “four limbs paralyzed” to “spasms after a brain surgery” to “able to brush his own teeth.” Lee Cheol-woo, a legislator briefed by the government’s spy agency, duly reported that Mr. Kim “can speak and stand if assisted.”Mainichi, a newspaper in Japan, quoted an unnamed Chinese source as saying that Mr. Kim began losing consciousness at work in April and could not properly govern. Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Waseda University in Tokyo, has claimed that Mr. Kim died in 2003, with only body doubles being seen since then.Mr. Kim’s taste for rich foods and his habit of working into the night have been blamed for his reported stroke. But South Korean newspapers also say he may have collapsed after Kim Jong-un, 25, his youngest son, was seriously injured in a car accident.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','The accidents and their aftermath have also brought heightened scrutiny of the Department of Buildings’ oversight of crane operations, which, an investigation revealed, was torn by corruption and hobbled by a lack of experienced inspectors.The dispute between the industry officials and the Buildings Department represents the first open rift since the accidents. Several leading construction industry groups have worked closely with the Buildings Department and the mayor’s office since then, playing an active role in reviewing proposed policy changes and legislation.Indeed, the heads of several industry groups have appeared frequently with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and department officials to announce new measures.“No one knew this was coming — this came like a shot in the dark,” said Louis J. Coletti, the head of the Building Trades Employers Association, who has been involved in the process. “What this means is people are going to be laid off and jobs are going to be delayed.”Construction officials say that one of the most significant changes is a requirement that engineers or crane manufacturers provide detailed rigging plans for raising a crane, and certify the actual work, which is now done by licensed master riggers under a plan approved by a professional engineer.The rigging plan would include a detailed outline of how sections of a crane are raised at a construction site as work proceeds higher and higher.Since tower cranes are set up in different ways at different construction sites, said Joseph S. Kaming, an engineer and the counsel for the Cement League, which represents unionized concrete workers and contractors, a crane manufacturer’s rigging plan would not be specific to each situation.Engineers would be reluctant to certify the rigging work, Mr. Kaming said, because they would then be liable for any problems that arose, although they would have no control over how the rigging crew at the scene operated.The changes in the requirements were contained in an e-mail message sent on Wednesday from the head of the Department of Buildings’ Cranes and Derricks Division, Jason Ocharsky, to principals of the area’s two largest engineering firms that specialize in crane-related work.After explaining the requirements, Mr. Ocharsky acknowledged that the changes were instituted on short notice, but offered no explanation for the sudden action.Mr. LiMandri, in a statement released in response to questions about the provisions, said: “Other sectors of the industry have had no difficulty submitting rigging and jumping plans, which are designed to increase safety for construction workers and all New Yorkers. Safety must be everyone’s top priority.”Alfred G. Gerosa, the Cement League’s executive director, said in a letter he sent to Mr. Ocharsky on Wednesday: “The effect of your new provisions, not discussed with the industry and whatever their legality, is to shut down the entire tower-crane industry in the city, throwing thousands of construction workers out of work. The compliance with these provisions is impossible.”He said in an interview that his group had not been consulted. And Mr. Kaming maintained, as did Mr. Coletti, that the “new” requirements went beyond crane legislation that the mayor is expected to sign on Monday. It makes into law the new protocols regarding cranes that the Building Department had issued after the accidents.Both men acknowledged that the new law provided a framework that could be made to include the requirements, but said the specific provisions being outlined now had not been included or discussed.Mr. Coletti said that his group recognized that there was a need for change in crane operations and has “been working in partnership to make changes, at the same time trying to ensure both worker safety is met and our jobs proceed in an economic and timely fashion.”He said that the construction industry is the second-largest contributor to the city’s tax base and that, given financial conditions on Wall Street, this was an inopportune time to put construction projects at risk.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','Mr. McCain was an author of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, known as the McCain-Feingold law, an ambitious measure that supporters hoped would help drive big money out of politics. He has also helped sponsor legislation to improve the public financing system for elections and attacked Mr. Obama for backing away from a pledge to participate in it for the general election if his opponent accepted public money as well.But now, as Mr. McCain’s top legal adviser, Mr. Potter, a former F.E.C. chairman, and his team have been helping the campaign finesse the strict spending limits it faces under public financing. Although Mr. McCain is supposed to be out of the business of private fund-raising after he received his $84 million infusion from the Treasury this month, it is sometimes difficult to tell.This month, the McCain campaign began running banner Web advertisements asking for donations to the McCain-Palin Compliance Fund, a fund-raising vehicle rooted in a 1980s F.E.C. ruling that candidates who accept public financing can still collect private donations for legal and accounting costs for complying with campaign finance laws.Only a careful observer, however, would have noticed the advertisements’ fine print, which said donations to the fund would be used to pay for “a portion of the cost of broadcast advertising,” as well as other expenses.That would seem to be a far cry from the legal and accounting exemption. But the F.E.C. issued an advisory opinion last year that said Senator John Kerry’s presidential campaign could use its compliance fund to cover up to 5 percent of its advertising costs, because of the several seconds candidates must devote in their advertisements to a disclaimer.The Campaign Legal Center, founded by Mr. Potter, joined with Democracy 21, a watchdog group, to file a strongly worded brief opposing the practice, warning that it would be exploited.The McCain campaign declined to make Mr. Potter available for an interview. Brian Rogers, a spokesman for the campaign, said in a statement that the campaign had not yet paid for advertising with its compliance fund but “reserves the option to do so under this recent, clear F.E.C. precedent.”The centerpiece of McCain-Feingold was its efforts to rein in “soft money,” or unregulated contributions, in national elections. But McCain fund-raisers continue to build much of their efforts around the solicitation of large contributions of up to about $70,000 for a special joint fund-raising account for the Republican National Committee and several state parties, which can spend money on behalf of the campaign, called McCain-Palin Victory 2008.Campaigns have used the joint fund-raising committees in the past, but the McCain campaign took the practice to a new level by linking them with state party accounts, which can accept contributions of $10,000, on top of the $28,500 collected for the national party, $2,300 for the compliance fund and, until recently, $2,300 for the campaign’s primary coffers.Critics have contended that the large donations to the joint fund-raising accounts amount to a form of soft money. The Obama campaign has been using its own joint fund-raising committee with the Democratic Party, but it only recently created a separate account for the state parties, so the checks are not nearly as big.“The real irony here,” said Craig Holman, a lobbyist for Public Citizen, a watchdog group, “is we fought so hard to get B.C.R.A. through, McCain-Feingold through, with the whole intent of getting rid of those large donations, which everyone, including McCain, realized were potentially corrupting. And we’ve gone full circle with these large donations for the joint fund-raising committees.”McCain fund-raisers certainly seem to pitch donations to the victory committee as supporting the ticket. The McCain campaign Web site attracts donors with a prominent “Contribute” button that sends them to a donation page for the committee, along with some lengthy disclaimers of the various entities that benefit from it.By contrast, the Kerry campaign’s contribution button on its Web page in 2004 was more clearly labeled “Contribute to the Democratic Party.” The Obama campaign is not soliciting contributions for its joint fund-raising committee on its Web site.Some lawyers said that some of the ways the McCain campaign is pushing its victory committee fit awkwardly with the broader mandate of public financing to halt private fund-raising, as well as rules that ban the designating of funds to party committees for specific candidates.“I think it’s both an appearance and a legal question,” said Lawrence H. Norton, who left his post as general counsel to the F.E.C. last year.But Mr. Rogers pointed to explanatory language used in literature by the joint fund-raising committees and said they undertook “substantial efforts to avoid any potential misunderstanding.”Mr. Potter built his reputation as an activist while he was F.E.C. chairman in the 1990s and later founded his reform-minded legal center. He took a leave this year from his position as president to devote himself to being the McCain campaign’s general counsel while also still maintaining a private practice.Guided by Mr. Potter, the McCain campaign is also adopting one of the most controversial innovations introduced by the Bush campaign in 2004: the use of so-called hybrid advertisements, which allowed it to split the cost of television commercials with the Republican Party. The practice was later copied by the Democrats.The F.E.C. deadlocked on the legality of the advertisements last year, paving the way for the McCain campaign to rely heavily on them. But Mr. Potter’s Campaign Legal Center joined Democracy 21 last year in a vigorous objection to the practice, labeling it a “scheme to evade the spending limits.”Some election law lawyers speculated that the McCain campaign might push the envelope further and try to split the costs of its hybrid advertisements with state parties as well, or produce some advertisements in which the party picks up more of the cost.Mr. Rogers said the campaign had no plans to change the 50-50 ratio for dividing the advertising costs but declined to comment on the state parties question.Mr. Rogers said Mr. McCain’s detractors often insinuated that because of his reformist reputation “almost anything he does to raise or spend money is a violation of his principles.”But Mr. Rogers said the campaign was complying with all laws.Indeed, some lawyers argued that Mr. Potter and Mr. McCain were simply dealing with the realities of a close race.“They’re taking full advantage of opportunities the law provides for them,” said Robert D. Lenhard, a former Democratic F.E.C. chairman.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','Titled “Advice,” this is a 30-second advertisement for Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee. It is running online, but the McCain campaign said it would begin running on television nationally on Monday.THE SCRIPT A narrator says: “Obama has no background in economics. Who advises him? The Post says it’s Franklin Raines, for ‘advice on mortgage and housing policy.’ Shocking. Under Raines, Fannie Mae committed ‘extensive financial fraud.’ Raines made millions. Fannie Mae collapsed. Taxpayers? Stuck with the bill. Barack Obama. Bad advice, bad instincts. Not ready to lead.”ON THE SCREEN The advertisement begins with a picture of Mr. Obama, with his head cocked and a perplexed expression, as the words “No economic background” appear next to him. Next is a similar shot of Mr. Obama, this time next to a quote from The Washington Post reading, “Advice on Mortgage and Housing Policy.” The advertisement goes on to show a darkened background with several pictures of Mr. Raines, side-by-side with pictures of Mr. Obama, over the words “As Much as $25 Million,” again attributed to The Post. Then an elderly woman appears on screen, next to the words, “Taxpayers stuck with bill.” The spot concludes with an image of a smiling Mr. Obama.ACCURACY This advertisement forced a series of heated attacks between the McCain and Obama campaigns beginning on Thursday, a debate that was left unresolved by the end of Friday. What is clear is that the McCain campaign has left the strong impression that Mr. Raines, a former chief executive of Fannie Mae who was ousted in 2004 amid an investigation over its accounting practices, is a close adviser to Mr. Obama, a suggestion that is totally unsupported by the facts. But the advertisement’s basic assertion is not a whole-cloth fabrication. The Post reported on July 16, in a Style-section article on Mr. Raines, that he had “taken calls from Barack Obama’s presidential campaign seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters.” Others immediately repeated the information, including Politico.com.Until the advertisement came out on Thursday evening, the Obama campaign did not question the claim. Since then, it has vigorously denied a relationship between Mr. Obama and Mr. Raines, with Bill Burton, a spokesman for Mr. Obama, calling the advertisement “another flat-out lie from a dishonorable campaign that is increasingly incapable of telling the truth,” and demanding a correction of the original article from The Post. The campaign also sent by e-mail a statement from Mr. Raines, saying: “I am not an advisor to Barack Obama, nor have I provided his campaign with advice on housing or economic matters.” On Friday, Mr. Burton said that Mr. Raines and Mr. Obama met once on the campaign trail, sometime in 2007 or 2008, and had not talked since then. He said Mr. Raines conducted an “introductory meeting” with a Senate aide to Mr. Obama, also sometime in the last two years.SCORECARD The McCain campaign’s goal was to link Mr. Obama to Fannie Mae; its disintegration contributed to the worst economic upheaval in decades. It is meant to play into voters’ fears, as well as anger, as both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama jockey to prove their superior ability to lead the nation through the crisis. Most viewers will not know that Mr. Raines has not been a major adviser to Mr. Obama, making it possible that the taint of Fannie Mae will stick. Yet there are so many ominous-sounding political commercials circulating that this one could be lost in the hubbub. JULIE BOSMAN'"
"'08-09-20,'0','Vietnam’s relations with the United States are on an even keel, and Vietnam has little at stake in the election.While Mr. McCain wins points among some Vietnamese for having supported the normalization of relations with the United States in 1995, his story, for the most part, has taken on an aura of wartime kitsch in Vietnam, like the self-parodying propaganda posters that are now sold in galleries, or the “Good Morning Vietnam” T-shirts popular with tourists.There is Mr. Duyet, the jailer with the vivid imagination. There is the nurse who treated Mr. McCain for a few minutes after he was shot down. And there is Mai Van On, the man credited with pulling Mr. McCain from the lake after he crashed, and who died two years ago.There is the little chunk of the prison, preserved as a museum when the rest of the building was razed to make way for a high-rise, with its half-hearted and anachronistic wartime propaganda.Mr. Duyet still seems at home here, and his memories are in harmony with the carefully chosen exhibits in the museum; he pointed proudly to a sweater and a paper fan as evidence of the comforts the prisoners enjoyed.The walls are hung with photographs of prisoners playing sports and making Christmas dinner and of Mr. McCain lying on a cot being treated by a doctor.“That’s me with the prisoners,” Mr. Duyet said, pointing to a group photograph. “And there we are shaking hands like friends when the prisoners were released.”But his greatest pride is his account of his relationship with Mr. McCain.“I used to meet with him in my office at the end of the day and debate with him,” Mr. Duyet said. “We debated quite fiercely, but there was never any personal prejudice between us. The debate was between two men in a manly style. But after that we were quite friendly. We didn’t take it personally.”This is certainly not the way Mr. McCain remembers it, nor is it the way that witnesses and history have recorded it. In 2000, Mr. McCain called his captors “cruel and sadistic people” and declared, “I will hate them for as long as I live.”Mr. McCain has visited Hanoi several times in recent years, and although he has returned to the prison, he has not met with Mr. Duyet to compare memories. “I’ll call right now my interrogator that tortured me and my friends a gook,” Mr. McCain said in 2000, using a particularly offensive term for Asians. “You can quote me.”Soon after the prisoners were released in 1973, he described his torture in a long essay in U.S. News & World Report.“They bounced me from pillar to post, kicking and laughing and scratching,” he wrote. “After a few hours of that, ropes were put on me and I sat that night bound with ropes.”He continued: “For the next four days, I was beaten every two to three hours by different guards. My left arm was broken again and my ribs were cracked.”None of that is true, Mr. Duyet insisted. All fabrication. All political posturing by Mr. McCain. “Some Americans still carry a prejudice toward Vietnam,” he said. “So McCain has to say he was beaten to gain the votes of these people.”At the edge of the lake in Hanoi where Mr. McCain parachuted to earth stands a small concrete marker noting the event. It depicts a man on his knees with his arms in the air as if surrendering.“I don’t know much about him,” said Do Van Sy, 78, who was exercising nearby in white shorts and a white tank top, carrying an umbrella in case of rain and a paper fan in case of sun. “You’ll have to ask the older men about that.”Although he is two years younger than Mr. Sy, Bo The An, 76, sitting on a bench nearby, knew quite a bit about Mr. McCain. “He was a pilot who bombed Vietnam, and he was our enemy,” he said. “But that was a long time ago. The important thing is what is in his mind today. I wish him good luck.”In his 1973 account, Mr. McCain said that he broke his right leg and both arms when his plane crashed and that he was surrounded by an angry crowd, “all hollering and screaming and cursing and spitting and kicking at me.”Once he was pulled from the crowd, a nurse named Nguyen Thi Thanh said she bound his wounds and gave him a few sips of medicinal liquor.In an interview, Ms. Thanh, now 81, said she had followed his career since then, although with her fading eyesight he is just a fuzzy image now on television.“It seems he’s been running for president for a long time,” she said. “So he’s quite persistent, isn’t he?”She is confident that whatever happens, he will not give up. “I’m only 81 now. My mother lived till 94. That’s 13 more years. So each time he runs for the presidency, I’ll have a chance to see him again.”'"
"'08-09-20,'0','IF you put all your money into American stocks this year, congratulations. You may have lost money, but you have also done better than investors in almost any other stock market around the world.This was the year of the bear, at least until Friday’s worldwide recovery. But the bear was tamer in the United States than in almost any other country.The accompanying chart shows the performance this year of the Standard & Poor’s Global Broad Stock Market indexes. Those indexes, which include nearly every stock traded in 52 markets around the world, showed losses in 51 of the countries through Thursday. Complete Friday results were not available at press time.The best performer was Jordan, which was up less than 1 percent. Morocco was second, with a loss of just 2.8 percent.In third place, outperforming every major stock market in the world, was the United States. The decline of 16.4 percent from the end of 2007 was improved greatly by the rally on Thursday, which came after prices had plunged the previous day. But the United States was near the top even before that recovery in prices.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','The Obama campaign was hoping to reintroduce Mr. Biden this week as running mate attack dog. But his penchant for verbal rambling ensured that much of the attention he drew was unwanted: he said wealthy Americans had a “patriotic” duty to pay more taxes, a remark the McCain campaign mocked relentlessly.Yet Joltin’ Joe has also become a fascinating Off Broadway spectacle in his own right. He is a distinctive blend of pit bull and odd duck whose weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything — “gaffes,” out-of-nowhere comments (pivoting midspeech to say “Excuse my back!” to people seated behind him), goofy asides (tapping a reporter’s chest and telling him, “You need to work on your pecs.”)Mr. Biden’s role is red-meat serious: to pulverize Mr. McCain, lend foreign policy heft to Senator Barack Obama and be his campaign’s main ambassador to two at-risk constituencies: former supporters of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and blue-collar Democrats. He speaks to working-class voters in the harsh language of their economic trials, and summons easy rage at ear-splitting volumes.“John said that the economy can have a ‘psychological effect,’ ” Mr. Biden said at a twilight rally in Media, Pa., on Tuesday. “Let me tell you about the psychological effect,” he said, describing his family’s economic struggles when he was young. Mr. Biden might seem like an afterthought on the national airwaves, but he can clearly resonate close up.“People got to wake up, because these guys in Washington are raping this country,” said Dave McLimans, a steelworker from Coatesville, Pa., who attended the rally in Media. “Joe Biden talks in a way that can wake people up.”Mr. Biden’s venues are, in many cases, economically challenged areas of swing states. His crowds are up-and-down in number and enthusiasm — some loud and in the thousands, others sleepier and small. But his reviews are generally good from voters, some who came in unconvinced about Mr. Obama.“Biden is a guy who I really believe, who really seems like he is going to help us out,” said Sheryl Kline, a loader for the United Parcel Service who attended a rally in Maumee, Ohio. “He sounds like someone who knows how we’re struggling.”Despite his hard words, there is also a joy to Mr. Biden’s pursuit. On Monday, he walked into a Ford plant in Macomb County, Mich., jumped behind the wheel of a red Mustang convertible and let loose with a few satisfying vroom-vrooms of the engine.“I know I’m not supposed to like muscle cars, but I like muscle cars,” Mr. Biden said as clusters of autoworkers whooped around him. “I tell you man, this is nice,” he said, giving a few extra revs of the engine for good measure, and his Senate cuff links clicked on the side of the car as he jumped out to more applause.In an interview, he rejected any notion that his message was not being heard. “I just don’t get that, I don’t see any evidence of that,” he said in the back office of the Maumee Elks Lodge.He barely mentions the Alaska governor in speeches; in the interview, he described her as “a very attractive political personality” who can “really deliver a political message.”Mr. Biden, 65, has been part of the national political furniture for decades. Like most senators, he thought he could be president, and he made runs for the job twice. Then Mr. Obama picked him for a job he said he never wanted.Mr. Biden retains his regal senatorial bearing even in gritty settings of the campaign trail. On Wednesday, he wore a pressed blue blazer with a hanky folded smartly into the breast pocket. His skin is perma-tanned, and his smile is shiny white. He has his own big entourage now — own bus, own plane. He conveys the giddy sense of a man who has won a political lottery, or been plucked from an elite purgatory.In Mansfield, Ohio, on Thursday, Mr. Biden made an improvisational stop at a diner, shook a bunch of hands and walked out into the sun holding a vanilla ice cream cone. “I’m dripping here, man,” Mr. Biden said to a well-wisher as he headed across the street to a carousel.“Am I too old to get on it?” he asked no one in particular, then headed back to his campaign bus.“Anyone need a ride?” he asked some people standing nearby. “I’ve got a nice bus.”Mr. Biden’s tone turns somber when he discusses Mr. McCain, a colleague of over two decades. The tenor of this campaign has tested a friendship that has been close even by Senate standards, where everyone claims to be “my good friend.”“That guy I used to know, he’s gone,” Mr. Biden said of Mr. McCain at the campaign event in Maumee, shaking his head. “It literally saddens me,” added Mr. Biden, who tends to used the word “literally” about a dozen times per speech (literally).Mr. Biden recalls that after Mr. McCain came under heavy attack from George W. Bush in the 2000 race for the Republican presidential nomination, he called Mr. McCain and offered to “go anywhere in the country and testify to his character.” Now, Mr. Biden asserts, Mr. McCain has embraced the same tactics he once criticized.“I tried to talk to John,” Mr. Biden said in the interview. When both men were at Columbia University last week on the Sept. 11 anniversary, Mr. Biden had a staff member try to arrange a dressing-room visit with Mr. McCain. But Mr. Biden was told not to come, he said.“I walked down anyway,” Mr. Biden said. “And who the hell is going to stop me?” Mr. McCain looked up and was “like, what is this about?” Mr. Biden said. Mr. McCain hugged Mr. Biden’s wife, Jill, and the two senators shared a quick handshake, but there was no time for any discussion.Leaving the Elks Lodge in Maumee this week, Mr. Biden threw his arms around volunteers, posed for photos, and said he was flattered about the attention.“Remember, no one decides who they’re going to vote for based on the vice president,” he said. “I mean that literally.”'"
"'08-09-20,'0','“The financial crisis looks like fire on a distant shore,” said Atsushi Nakajima, chief economist at the research arm of Mizuho Financial Group. “Japan has remained very calm and peaceful.”Part of the reason is that Japan has already suffered its agonizing crisis. The 1980s bubble economy collapsed in the 1990s because banks were burdened with real estate-related bad loans, not unlike those that Washington is moving to have the American government take over from banks.In Japan, it took a “lost decade” to work through those debts. The Japanese became very cautious after the bitter experience of the cleanup. One result was that they seem to have largely avoided the risky subprime loans that set off the current crisis. According to the International Monetary Fund, subprime-related losses at Japanese financial companies have totaled just $8 billion, out of global subprime-related losses that some say could total $1 trillion.“Japan learned its lesson in the 1990s,” said Akio Makabe, an economics professor at Shinshu University. “It was wise when Wall Street was foolish.”Of course, Wall Street’s pains have been felt here. The stock market fell this week in volatile trading, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 index losing 2.4 percent — largely as panicked foreign investors dumped shares. There are also bigger fears that slowdowns in the United States and China will end up hammering Japan’s export-driven manufacturing sector.There have also been small but telltale signs of rising risk aversion in credit markets. Japanese banks raised short-term interbank lending rates to foreign banks to 0.7 percent, from 0.5 percent, though they still use the lower rate among themselves. That contrasts with New York, where a benchmark interbank lending rate has tripled in recent days to about 3 percent.Still, its relative detachment makes Japan an oddity in a world where globalization has seemed inevitable. Countries in Europe have also tried to find ways to be part of the global economy while staying apart from it, but to no avail. Other nations, like China, have bet their future on becoming enmeshed in it.Japan’s aloofness has its downside. For example, with its healthy banking system and abundance of capital, Japan would seem in an ideal position to help bail out the shell-shocked global economy, stepping in for the weakened United States and Europe. Instead, Tokyo has kept a low profile throughout the crisis, other than joining a multinational effort by central banks to pump dollars into the global economy to keep it moving.When asked during a prime minister candidate debate on Friday whether Japan could assert more leadership during the crisis, the leading candidate, Taro Aso, a former foreign minister, said he was “proud that Japan was not involved in that money game,” referring to mortgage debt.Economists and bankers say Japan is able to keep itself apart for a very simple reason: it has enough cash to finance its own needs.The country sits on a $14 trillion pile of household savings, the product of decades of trade surpluses and frugal lifestyles. This has allowed Japan to finance its immense $8.1 trillion fiscal deficit and still have enough money left over to be the world’s largest creditor nation for the last 17 years.Last year, the nation’s net overseas assets — the sum of all Japanese investments abroad, minus what foreigners hold in Japan — reached a record 250 trillion yen, or $2.4 trillion.That means that Japan’s domestic economy has been largely insulated from global credit market turmoil because it does not borrow from those markets. At the same time, with so much money flowing out — usually into safer investments like Treasuries — stability in the United States clearly matters.Still, Japan’s corporate coffers are filled with cash from the nation’s long economic recovery in the 2000s after the stagnant 1990s.“Japan is clearly in a different place” from the rest of the world, said John Richards, head of Asia research at the Royal Bank of Scotland. “It doesn’t need money.”This blessing has also been a curse to investors, say economists. Its wealth shields Japan from pressures to meet global standards of growth or corporate profitability. This is what allowed the nation to accept near zero growth rates in the 1990s and what permits the survival of Japanese corporate practices like valuing employees and clients over shareholders.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','And while economists and other experts say there are plenty of culprits — Democrats and Republicans in Congress, the Federal Reserve, an overzealous home-lending industry, banks and also Mr. Bush’s predecessor, Bill Clinton — they do agree that the Bush administration bears part of the blame.These experts, from both political parties, say Mr. Bush’s early personnel choices and overarching antipathy toward regulation created a climate, that, if it did not set off the turmoil, almost certainly aggravated it.The president’s first two Treasury secretaries, for instance, lacked the kind of Wall Street expertise that might have helped them raise red flags about the use of complex financial instruments that are at the heart of the crisis.To his credit, Mr. Bush accurately foresaw the danger posed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and began calling as early as 2002 for greater regulation. But experts say the administration could have done even more to curb excesses in the housing market, and much more to police Wall Street, which transmitted those problems around the world.Vincent R. Reinhart, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute here, said that, in retrospect, “it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the F.D.I.C.” — the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation — “to look at these issues more closely.”He said it would also have helped “for Congress to have held hearings.”Instead, voices inside the administration for tougher policing of Wall Street found themselves with few supporters. William H. Donaldson, a former Wall Street executive with respected Republican credentials who became chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission under Mr. Bush, quit after facing resistance from the White House and Republican members of the agency, who criticized his support for stiffer regulations on mutual funds and hedge funds.Today, even some sympathetic to Mr. Bush say he cannot disentangle himself from a home-lending industry that ran amok or a banking industry that mortgaged its future on toxic loans.“The crisis definitely happened on their watch,” said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard who advises Mr. McCain. “This is eight years into the Bush administration. There was a lot of time to deal with it.”To some extent, Mr. Bush was simply following a deregulatory pattern set by his predecessor, President Clinton. Perhaps the most significant recent deregulation of the banking industry — the landmark act that allowed commercial banks to expand into other financial activities, like investment banking and insurance — was signed into law by Mr. Clinton in 1999.Mr. Bush also inherited a culture of borrowing and a frothy housing market that has become “deeply embedded in the American psyche,” Mr. Rogoff said.And Mr. Reinhart said the markets seemed to be doing so well that few analysts, either in government or the private sector, had a critical eye. “When everybody is doing better,” he said, “it is difficult to see the underlying weaknesses.”Still, the White House, in the view of critics, fostered a free-market hothouse in which these excesses were able to flower. It avoided regulation of banks and mortgage brokers, leaving much of that work to the Federal Reserve, which, under Alan Greenspan, showed little appetite for regulation.By the time Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. proposed an overhaul of regulations governing the financial sector in April, the storm was already brewing.The administration’s push to rein in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was stymied by Congress. But the administration’s intense focus on fending off what it foresaw as a looming housing crisis did not include an effort to curb the proliferation of fiendishly complex mortgage-backed securities, said Harvey S. Rosen, an economist who served on Mr. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, briefly as chairman.“Maybe there should have been” such an effort, Mr. Rosen said. “But we were focused more on the fact that if these entities just held plain-vanilla mortgage-backed securities, it was still a disaster in the making.”Beyond the administration’s deregulatory bent, some economists argue that its fiscal and tax policies made the United States more dependent on foreign capital, which inflated the bubble in housing prices.“A different Treasury would have taken a different approach,” said Lawrence H. Summers, who served as Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration. “I don’t think the economy has been well managed, and that has certainly been crucial for the problems we’re facing.”The White House and Congress wanted to make housing affordable to more Americans, and freeing up the lending markets was a way to do that. As Mr. Rogoff said: “It was a market-based way to help poor people. There was an incredible belief in free markets.”For all that faith, Mr. Bush’s first two Treasury secretaries, Paul H. O’Neill and John W. Snow, came from top jobs in industry, not Wall Street. They were viewed in Washington as advocating the interests of business, and being less comfortable with the mysteries of markets.Neither was seen as having much influence with the White House, and the Treasury Department lost some of the primacy in economic policy it had enjoyed under Mr. Summers and his predecessor, Robert E. Rubin.Mr. O’Neill and Mr. Snow declined to be interviewed for this article.“The primary agency responsible for keeping an eye on these things is, and should be, the Treasury Department, and I think the president erred in the first place by appointing two secretaries who had no background in finance,” said Bruce R. Bartlett, a Republican economist who worked for President Ronald Reagan and President George H. W. Bush.The White House did name people well versed in the markets to other posts, not least the chairmanship of the Securities and Exchange Commission. But Mr. Bush’s first S.E.C. chairman — Harvey L. Pitt, a prominent securities lawyer — was brought down by political missteps. Mr. Pitt was succeeded by Mr. Donaldson, who quit in 2005.Critics say the S.E.C. has been less active under its current chairman, Christopher Cox, a former Republican congressman from California. It has spent less on enforcement and imposed less in fines on wrongdoers, according to the Government Accountability Office. This week, Mr. McCain called for Mr. Cox’s resignation.In other areas, the Bush administration’s failures seem more a case of inaction. The administration, economists said, did little to curb the practices of mortgage brokers, who are regulated by the states. But Democrats in Congress were equally to blame for this, these people said.“The Democrats pushed affordable housing goals, even in the face of evidence that people who got the loans shouldn’t have gotten them,” said Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.He added: “I blame the Democrats for demanding that Fannie Mae keep buying these loans. I blame the administration for going along with it.”White House officials note that the administration did propose reforms of real estate settlement procedures and the Federal Housing Administration, two areas it had identified as posing the greatest systemic risk to markets. Democrats in Congress, they said, blocked these efforts.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','I don’t know how or where this will end, and neither do any of the experts.It’s a humbling time for everyone, and it makes it extremely hard to assess all of these personal risks and come up with a decisive plan of action.The temptation is to either make drastic changes in your financial life or do nothing and hope that the impact is not too severe.So here’s another idea, a middle path of sorts. Consider a few modest but concrete things you can do that could reduce your exposure to four of the big areas of risk — investments, job security, your mortgage and insurance — that have been front and center this week.Some of these suggestions may have more impact for you than others, but they all can help you feel as if you’ve taken back some measure of control.Before you do anything with your portfolio, ask yourself this: Do you still believe in capitalism?Several financial planners I spoke with felt the need to stop and reaffirm the fact that companies will still need to raise money from investors — any quasi-Socialist, short-term federal government intervention aside.Andrew Orr, a financial planner in , Fla., says clients with money in index funds are investing in 17,000 companies that seek to generate earnings and pay dividends. That, he says, is a sustained bet on capitalism itself. “Capitalism is not always pretty. But it’s evolved and gotten better, and there are clearly going to be more protections to come.”If you’re under 50 or so, you can start by protecting yourself against the biggest investment risk of all, outliving your savings. Thomas Fisher, a financial planner in , Mass., said that this risk was one that people generally underestimate. “Our parents haven’t usually run out of money,” he said. “There has been a whole generation of people with pensions.”Those days are gone, though. And as he took calls this week from clients considering bailing out of the stock market, he said he realized how few people actually understood the big picture. The most acute long-term risk is, in fact, too little risk. Unless you’re saving a huge chunk of your income in cash, you’ll need consistent exposure to more risky investments like stocks to produce a suitable retirement balance. Keep your stock allocation lower if you must for a few months to sleep at night, but don’t get rid of it altogether.Most people get back into stocks once you explain this. A bigger challenge now is the one facing those who are in or close to retirement and whose portfolios have declined in the last year. Rebecca Rolfes, a 59-year-old marketing executive in , has ridden out down markets before, but now her time horizon is shrinking at the same time as her assets. “I keep going on my mutual fund sites but not actually doing anything,” she said.Even if you can’t bring yourself to make big changes to your portfolio, spending just a bit less money in retirement may make a huge difference. “Small changes in retirees’ burn rate will affect them far greater than what the market will do today,” said Bill Schultheis, of Sagemark Wealth Management in Kirkland, Wash., and the author of “The Coffeehouse Investor.” That’s because overspending is a risk you can actually control, even if you can’t predict how the markets perform. “I’ve found that many clients really like that, because they like to be in charge.”He noted that spending on grandchildren was often a huge item for retirees. If you can’t bring yourself to cut back there, consider the cost of eating out. He says he is often surprised by the amount people spend on that.Aside from the job losses at financial services companies in the news, there was also concern the economy could slow significantly and ultimately affect employment levels everywhere.This week, people who work for themselves seemed to feel better about their prospects than those who work for large companies. “It feels safer than having a job with a single employer,” said Mike Sanislo, who helps companies with new product development through his firm High Energy Consulting in Woodbury, Minn. He says he expects to lose clients every so often, but his business doesn’t fall apart when one goes away.Though you may not be ready to chuck it all and hang out a shingle, it’s worth considering the approach that Kathy Santos has taken. Ms. Santos, a webmaster in Pepperell, Mass., has a job by day at the environmental nonprofit group Earthwatch Institute, but is developing a Web design and photography business on the side, Rhino Hill Studios, to spread out her income risk. She also picks up a bit of extra money as an emergency medical technician for the town.All the problems that funny mortgages have caused have hopefully taught important lessons about interest rate risk. This is something you can control. If you’re applying for a new mortgage, a fixed-rate mortgage means no risk that the rate will rise. If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage and have enough equity in your house to refinance, get a fixed-rate loan.Here’s another certainty for those skittish about investing: If you put extra money beyond the minimum toward the monthly payment on a 6 percent mortgage, you’re effectively earning 6 percent by ridding yourself of that extra debt (though the number may be a bit less if you’re taking advantage of the mortgage interest tax deduction).That’s what Nell Eakle of Sterling, Ill., has been doing, even though she had to ratchet down the overpayment because of a bout with . “We just want to be a little bit ahead,” she said. An added bonus is that the extra payments mean the mortgage will hit zero about two years ahead of schedule.A few caveats here. Given the tightened policies among home equity loan providers, you may not be able to easily get this money back out of your house anytime soon. Also, it makes more sense to first pay down 18 percent credit card debt, or max out any 401(k) match that your employer provides, even if you’re parking the money in cash.A.I.G.’s crisis suggests one simple tactic to reduce your exposure to troubled institutions: Split your life insurance policies and annuities among more than one provider.Meanwhile, many of the things that insurance protects against are precisely the sorts of risks over which people have the most control. In uncertain times, there’s some small comfort in taking measures to avoid having to use the insurance at all. “Stay in during the first snowfall,” said Kevin Albaugh, an engineering consultant in Williamsville, N.Y. “That will shake out all of the people who don’t know how to drive on it. That’s usually when you see a bunch of S.U.V.’s off the side of the road.”Michael Fripp of Carrollton, Tex., says the only risk he can control is the health risks from the stress. “The financial risks are beyond my control (and a little beyond my understanding),” he wrote in an e-mail message this week. “I am bicycling to work, walking with the kids and ignoring the 401(k) balance.”'"
"'08-09-20,'0','Gov. Sarah Palin was presumably brought onto the Republican ticket to attract women’s votes. But we have heard little from her about some of the issues that matter most to women in the United States and reflect the reality of their lives.For example, one out of eight women in the United States lives in poverty. Women disproportionately receive subprime mortgages. Women also hold more minimum wage jobs (68 percent) than men. Half of the work force, of which women make up 48 percent, does not have not one single paid sick day.We need to hear how Ms. Palin plans to develop policies that will enable women to lead successful, productive lives and how she will foster an economy that works for everyone.Although some claim that her nomination is a breakthrough, at this point we need to ask whether it is more of a setback for women in the United States.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','Despite the rebound on Friday, the RTS index was still down about 48 percent from its peak in May.On Thursday, Russian officials announced that government oil revenue would be used to bolster the stock market. They allotted $44 billion in loans to banks, lowered reserve requirements for banks to increase liquidity, lowered oil export tariffs and pledged to invest up to $20 billion in the market.The two main stock markets rebounded so quickly Friday that trading was halted twice when jumps exceeded the limits.Brokers said that the government was not buying actively, but that the increased liquidity in the banks and reassuring official statements had played a role. Also, a government ban on short selling aided the rebound. “The whole package has been enough, at least in the short term, to attract money back into the Russian market,” Roland Nash, chief analyst at Renaissance Capital, said.But in a sign that the short-term fix may have a long-term price, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded Russia’s debt outlook to stable from positive on Friday.The plan for the government to buy shares will expand the state’s already sprawling involvement in the economy. In a nod to this concern, the share buyback was announced in a way intended to “dispel fears of wider state control,” by focusing on companies already under the government’s management, like the gas monopoly Gazprom and the oil company Rosneft, Rory MacFarquhar, a Goldman Sachs economist in Moscow, said.The stock market collapse began in May and accelerated in August after Russia went to war with Georgia and oil prices fell from their peak. The market fell again this week in response to the bankruptcy filing by the investment bank Lehman Brothers.The Russian economy benefited from the same easy credit that inflated the housing market in the United States. The country’s total foreign debt for the state, state companies and private companies is about $500 billion, and billions more are needed to rebuild crumbling Soviet-era infrastructure.Russian companies will be seeking to roll over debt in a tight credit market, while also trying to convince banks that their enterprises will not fall prey to the government attacks that have toppled some big companies during Mr. Putin’s administration. Political risk adds a few percentage points to borrowing costs here.Oil price volatility remains the largest concern, economists said. Viewed through the lens of high commodity prices, the Russian economy appears a muscle-bound giant. But turn the telescope around, and Russia is a very diminutive and vulnerable economy.The nonpetroleum sector contributes 30 percent of the federal budget and about that amount in exports.Russia exports about 150 million cubic meters of natural gas and 7 million barrels of crude oil and refined products daily. At the peak price of $139.97 a barrel on July 11 this year for Ural blend crude, Russia’s main export commodity, the country was taking in $1.25 billion a day in energy export revenue. Today, with Ural blend trading at $88, Russia is making $825 million a day, according to UralSib bank. That is a difference of $425 million.In another sign of vulnerability, the minister of economy, Aleksei L. Kudrin, has said the federal budget will go into deficit if Ural oil prices fall below $70 a barrel next year, or $18 dollars lower than the current price.“That’s what investors are worried about,” Chris Weafer, the chief strategist at UralSib bank, said in an interview.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','CARACAS, Venezuela — President Hugo Chávez’s government expelled two employees of Human Rights Watch late Thursday night after chafing at their documentation of widespread political discrimination, intimidation of union members and a subservient judiciary.Armed men in uniforms apprehended José Miguel Vivanco, a Chilean citizen who is the Americas director for the New York-based group, and Daniel Wilkinson, an American who is deputy director for the Americas, and placed them on a flight to São Paulo, Brazil, where they arrived on Friday morning.“About 20 men, some of them in military uniform, intercepted us when we arrived at our hotel after returning from dinner Thursday night,” Mr. Vivanco said in a telephone interview from São Paulo. He said he struggled briefly with the security officials when he tried to send a message on his BlackBerry to The New York Times about the expulsion.The officials then disabled the BlackBerries of the two men and prevented them from contacting anyone in Venezuela, including diplomats from the embassies of Chile or the United States. “They informed us of our apprehension and told us they had entered our rooms and had packed our belongings,” Mr. Vivanco said.The expulsion, broadcast partly on state television here, comes at a time of increasingly erratic actions by Mr. Chávez. In the last week, he expelled the American ambassador, rounded up military officers and accused them of plotting to kill him and clashed with the Vatican over its granting of political asylum to a political opponent.The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Mr. Vivanco violated the law by entering the country on a tourist visa to do human rights work. The ministry also said that Human Rights Watch, which is an outspoken critic of the Bush administration, was acting in concert with the United States government in a campaign of aggression against Venezuela.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','LOS ANGELES — A victory by a dissident group of actors in the closely watched election by the Screen Actors Guild injected new turmoil into the labor union’s internal divisions this week, but had no immediate impact on the long-stalled contract negotiations with the major Hollywood studios.The dissidents, who have the backing of several big-name stars including Tom Hanks, won 6 of the 11 open seats on the guild’s Hollywood division, SAG announced Thursday. With allies in New York and other regions of the country, the group may achieve a majority on the national board, which will meet on Oct. 18.During the election the group, called Unite for Strength, promoted a merger between the 120,000-member guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, a union with 70,000 members. The two unions broke off joint negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers in March. When Aftra ratified a three-year deal with the studios in July, SAG dismissed it as inadequate and dug in its heels for a prolonged standoff.While the newly elected members may try to steer the union toward new contract talks with the studios, the 13-member committee that leads the negotiations will continue to be controlled by the hard-line incumbent group Membership First. That group also counts Alan Rosenberg, the president of SAG, as a member.“Nobody really has a majority now,” Mr. Rosenberg told the Associated Press. “I’m going to be behaving as if no one is treating any issue as a fait accompli.”Mr. Rosenberg noted that a mail-in poll by the guild, conducted in the last month, found that 87 percent of members supported the group’s effort to continue negotiating with the studios.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','The and the Treasury continued efforts on Friday to intervene in the frozen credit markets. They deployed additional tens of billions of dollars to prevent an investor panic and flight from the nation’s money-market mutual funds. Money-market funds, totaling some $3 trillion that are held by tens of millions of individuals and traditionally considered as safe as bank deposits, had come under pressure in recent days as investors began to pull money out faster than the funds could sell of assets.The Fed announced that it would lend money to money-market funds in order to make certain they could meet all the demands of investors without having to sell assets — including mortgage-backed securities — at fire sale prices.The Treasury Department, in a coordinated announcement, said it would use $50 billion in the government’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, a fund normally reserved to deal with currency imbalances, to insure money-market fund customers from losses. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for its part, temporarily banned short selling, a bet that a company’s shares will decline.But even amid pledges of bipartisan cooperation, the political obstacles remained high. One is simply the matter of time: Congress is set to adjourn at the end of next week, and it is being asked to approve a plan involving more money than any single program in history.Eventually, the bailout proposal could result in the most direct commitment of taxpayer funds so far in the financial crisis that Fed and Treasury officials say is the worst they have ever seen.Senior aides and lawmakers said the goal was to complete the legislation that would grant new authority to the administration and require what several officials said would be a substantial appropriation of federal dollars.Democrats, having a desire for a second round of stimulus aid to help struggling Americans, see the administration’s request as a way to win White House approval of the new spending in exchange for support for the Treasury request. Democrats also say they will push for relief for homeowners faced with foreclosure.The proposed fix does not envision creation of a quasi-government body like the , which bought up and eventually sold hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of real estate in the 1990s from failed companies.Instead, officials at the White House, Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve want existing government entities to become a securities buyer of last resort. It is a more open-ended commitment, in part because the problem crosses international borders and its scope is as yet unknown.The bailout discussions began on a day when the Federal Reserve poured almost $300 billion into global credit markets and barely put a dent in the level of alarm.Hoping to shore up confidence with a show of financial shock and awe, the Federal Reserve stunned investors before dawn on Thursday by announcing a plan to provide $180 billion to financial markets through lending programs operated by the and the central banks of , , and .But after an initial sense of relief swept markets in and , the fear quickly returned. Tensions remained so high that the Federal Reserve had to inject an extra $100 billion, in two waves of $50 billion each, just to keep the benchmark federal funds rate at the Fed’s goal of 2 percent.None of those actions, however, brought much catharsis or relief, with banks around the world remaining too frightened to lend to each other, much less to their customers. This forced Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke to think the unthinkable: committing taxpayer money to buy hundreds of billions of dollars in distressed assets from struggling institutions.The reaction from the presidential candidates came quickly Friday. Senator , the Democratic candidate, in a speech in offered his support of a plan to give the Treasury Department the “broad authority as necessary to stabilize markets and maintain credit,” but he said any rescue plan also should include help for working families.Mr. Obama, after meeting with economic advisers, stopped short of outlining proposals to resolve the crisis. He said that any government rescue needed to protect taxpayers.In Green Bay, Wis., the Republican candidate, Senator gave a few new details of his proposals in a speech that seemed as much a political shot at Mr. Obama as a policy prescription. Mr. McCain has criticized the S.E.C., saying that it had allowed “speculators and hedge funds turn our markets into a casino.”On Thursday, he said the new institution he proposed — the Mortgage and Financial Institutions Trust — would differ from similar agencies because it would not wait for financial institutions to become insolvent before offering help.Mr. McCain painted Mr. Obama as being beholden to and , the loan giants that were taken over by the federal government, by virtue of the campaign contributions he took from them and his ties to their former leaders.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','“This action should enhance market confidence and alleviate investors’ concerns about the ability for money market mutual funds to absorb a loss,” the Treasury statement said. “Investors in money market mutual funds with a net asset value that falls below $1 would be notified that their fund triggered the insurance program.”Treasury also said that President Bush had approved use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, established in the 1930s to intervene in foreign exchange markets, to guarantee the payments.In its statement, the Fed said that it would expand its emergency lending to allow commercial banks to finance purchases of asset-backed paper from money market funds. It also said that it planned to purchase short-term debt obligations issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, which offers financing for mortgages, small businesses and farms.Money market funds are essentially short-term mutual funds that invest in government securities, certificates of deposit, asset-backed commercial paper and other highly liquid securities.They are different from money market deposit accounts, which are offered to consumers by many banks and credit unions. Those are interest-bearing bank accounts that are insured — up to $100,000 an account and up to $250,000 for some retirement accounts — by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Joint accounts, each account holder is insured for $100,000.The actions to reinforce confidence in money market funds came in a week when one multibillion-dollar fund was forced to close and liquidate and another said that its customers might lose money on their investments.Putnam Investments, one of the oldest names in the mutual fund industry, announced Thursday that it was liquidating its Putnam Prime Money Market Fund, a $12.3 billion fund that serves only professional investors.With liquidity dwindling in the short-term credit markets — a problem that did not ease significantly in Thursday’s trading — the fund’s board determined on Wednesday that selling assets to meet redemptions would risk losses for the remaining investors, Putnam said.On Tuesday, the Primary Fund, which had almost $65 billion in assets at the end of May and is part of the Reserve Fund, said the value of some investments had fallen and that customers had only 97 cents for each dollar they had invested in several of its funds. The company has subsequently imposed redemption limits on 18 money funds it operates.The Investment Company Institute, an industry trade association, said Thursday that the funds serving institutions shrank by more than $173 billion, to $2.17 trillion, in the week that ended Wednesday — the worst decline ever among institutional money funds. Retail investors, however, added almost $4.3 billion to their money fund holdings, for a net decline of $169 billion during the week.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','“The emergency order temporarily banning short selling of financial stocks will restore equilibrium to markets.”Analysts raised questions about whether financial institutions would be able to put the new requirements in place quickly. Emily Steed of the consulting group Daylight Forensic and Advisory, and a former senior enforcement counsel at the S.E.C., said institutions would have to develop sophisticated internal controls and that this would be costly and take time.“It’s one thing to present the rule,” she said.”It’s another thing whether it’s practical for firms to implement it.”Short selling — a bet that a stock price will decline — is the practice of selling stock without owning it, hoping to buy it later at a lower price and thus make a profit.It has often been blamed for forcing prices down in times of market stress, but the level of anger has intensified as the American government has been forced to bail out major financial institutions and the leaders of some investment banks have asked for action to protect their shares.Both the S.E.C. and the New York State attorney general promised to intensify investigations into short selling abuses. “They are like looters after a hurricane,” said Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general. “If you pass a rumor in a normal marketplace, people are calm, they check it out, they do their due diligence. When you get the market in this frenzied state and they are on pins and needles, any false information is much more impactful.”Short sellers say that the criticism directed at them, and any restrictions on their activity, are wrong-headed, because they were among the first to raise the alarm about the risky mortgage lending practices that led to the current financial crisis.“Investors are best served when they can hear both the reasons to buy and the reasons to sell any given security,” said Jim Chanos, a hedge fund manager and chairman of the Coalition of Private Investment Companies. “These emergency orders limit the free flow of information and ultimately will not work to help the United States maintain the freest, strongest and most liquid capital markets in the world.”Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, said Thursday that the S.E.C. had “kept in place trading rules that let speculators and hedge funds turn our markets into a casino” and said that the S.E.C.’s chairman, Mr. Cox, had “betrayed the public’s trust.”Speaking at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Mr. McCain said, “If I were president today, I would fire him.”The White House immediately said it supported Mr. Cox, who has said he would resign at the end of the Bush administration. Mr. Cox said he had moved against short sellers and was doing all he could to stem the financial crisis.“Now is not the time for those of us in the trenches to be distracted by the ebb and flow of the current election campaign,” Mr. Cox said in a statement released by the commission. “It is precisely the wrong moment for a change in leadership that inevitably would disrupt the work of the S.E.C. at just the wrong time.”Mr. Cox is a former White House aide to President Ronald Reagan and a former Republican congressman from California. Some conservative columnists and commentators, including Robert Novak, supported him as a running mate for Mr. McCain. Writing in The American Spectator earlier this year, Quin Hillyer said that conservatives would rally to a Cox selection and called him “the best choice, bar none.”In recent weeks, Mr. Cox has also stepped up his criticism of short-sellers, particularly those who engage in “naked” short selling. While short sellers are supposed to borrow shares before selling them, naked shorts do not borrow. That saves the cost of borrowing, though the trader is still vulnerable to losses if the share price rises.Opponents of short selling believe that it can force share prices down and destroy confidence in a company that might otherwise survive. Regulators have long thought that the practice was crucial for efficient markets to function, but earlier this year the S.E.C. imposed temporary limits on short selling of some financial stocks. Financial share prices rallied when those limits were announced but fell during the period in which the rule was in effect.Share prices for many financial companies shot up Thursday afternoon after plunging the day before in the wake of the government decision to take control of the American International Group, a large insurance company, to prevent it from collapsing. Financial shares were especially hard hit Wednesday, with Morgan Stanley plunging 24 percent, to $21.75, and its chief executive, John J. Mack, blaming false rumors spread by short sellers. On Thursday, Morgan Stanley regained part of that loss, rising 3.7 percent, to close at $22.55.The latest moves against short sellers began Wednesday. In the morning, Mr. Cox announced new rules to prevent brokerage firms from selling a stock short if they previously had sold the stock short without having borrowed it. That night, he said that he would propose more rules, to force large short sellers to disclose their positions.The rules were needed, he said, “to ensure that hidden manipulation, illegal naked short selling or illegitimate trading tactics do not drive market behavior and undermine confidence.”It is not clear how much authority the S.E.C. has to force disclosure of short positions by hedge funds, which have successfully sued to prevent the commission from forcing them to even register with it. Institutional investors, including some hedge funds, provide details of stocks they own every three months but do not disclose short positions. Mr. Cox said he wanted daily disclosure of short positions, which he said would be made public, though he did not say how quickly.Richard Baker, the president of the Managed Funds Association, a hedge fund trade group, said the funds would comply with any rules but said that disclosure of their trading positions should not be made so quickly that it would harm them in the market.Mr. Cox also said the S.E.C. would intensify its investigations of short selling by hedge funds and would demand their records on trading in certain securities.In Britain, the Financial Services Authority said that beginning Friday it would bar traders from taking new short positions in listed stocks of financial companies, and that starting next week, investors would have to disclose their short positions if they were at least 0.25 percent of a company’s outstanding shares.This week, the British bank, Lloyds TSB, took over HBOS, a mortgage lender, after HBOS’s stock tumbled. That fall was widely blamed on short sellers, and Prime Minister Gordon Brown vowed to clean up the financial system.To obtain shares to sell short, traders often borrow them from institutional investors, who receive small fees for the loans. But public pension funds in New York and California said Thursday that they would stop lending shares of some financial companies.New York State’s comptroller said the state’s Common Retirement Fund would temporarily stop lending the shares of 19 banks and brokerage firms to short sellers. “This speculative selling has put downward pressure on the entire stock market and threatens to drive our national economy deeper into decline,” Thomas P. DiNapoli, the comptroller, said in a statement.The suspension removes 105 million shares from the fund’s securities lending program. It will last until market conditions stabilize, a spokesman said.New York City’s comptroller announced the same move, as did officials in California.“We’re pulling them back because of the unfortunate predators that are out there right now, trying to be greedy,” said Patricia K. Macht, an official of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.'"
"'08-09-20,'0','But across Wall Street, many of the basic mechanisms of the marketplace broke down after the Securities and Exchange Commission announced on Friday morning that it would ban short selling in nearly 800 financial stocks, making it harder for people to bet against those securities, and that it also would force investors to disclose those trades. When investors sell short, they borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back at lower prices and profit from the difference. Short sellers had come under fire for contributing to the sharp decline in financial shares this year.Computers that automatically buy and sell for big investors hit snags because they were not programmed for such a restriction. Securities firms and money managers that routinely sell short to hedge against possible losses wondered how they would cope. In certain stocks and funds traded on New York Stock Exchange, some prices and trades were “erroneous,” a spokesman said.The surge in financial shares was driven at least in part by traders who were forced to buy those stocks to cover earlier short sales, raising doubts about whether the rally will last.Hedge fund managers who made vast profits betting against the nation’s financial titans called the ban unfair, and said the move would only prolong the financial crisis. Some traders said they were no longer betting on the intrinsic health of companies, but rather on what the government might do next. Others simply withdrew from the market.“Some of my clients are literally closing their books and going on their vacation for two weeks — they can’t operate in this environment,” said Meredith A. Whitney, a financial services analyst. “You pack up and come back and play the game when you know what the rules are.”One hedge fund manager, who declined to be named, likened the changes to “turning a football game into badminton.”Many players warned that the government’s sweeping actions might have unintended consequences. The ban on short selling raised questions about how certain parts of the capital markets would function. Companies may have a harder time raising money by selling instruments like convertible bonds, which can be exchanged for shares, because many investors short stocks to hedge against the risks of owning these instruments.Byron Wien, chief investment strategist at Pequot Capital Management, the big hedge fund, said that forcing big investors to disclose short positions could create a run on stocks. It might not be immediately apparent whether investors with short positions were using it to hedge another position or bet against stocks.In the market for options — instruments that give holders the right to buy or sell shares at certain prices — traders reported frantic trading in Chicago and New York. Many big options traders, or market makers, must frequently sell shares short to hedge other trades.“It was the most difficult day we have ever seen in the market,” said Peter Bottini, an executive vice president at optionsXpress, a brokerage. “We have had a very volatile day.”William J. Brodsky, the chief executive of the nation’s largest options exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, lashed out at the S.E.C. “The need for the policy intervention notwithstanding, it is difficult to comprehend the merits of a draconian measure that will result in the sudden and severe removal of liquidity from the marketplace at the same time that the government is taking unprecedented steps to preserve it,” he said in a statement.Later in the day, the S.E.C. said its staff had recommended that the commission exempt options market makers from the short-sale trading restrictions.“People have definitely been saying that this is no longer an investor’s market, nor even really a trader’s market — it’s all entirely speculation on what the government is going to be doing next,” said a broker at a Wall Street firm, who was not authorized to talk to the press. “Anyone who thinks they have a handle on where things are going is deluding themselves.”The immediate targets of the S.E.C.’s actions were short sellers, who have been blamed for the plunges in the stock prices of large investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. To many observers, shorts were to blame for the collapse of Bear Stearns and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers; the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants; and the $85 billion bailout of A.I.G.The world of deal-making was turned upside-down by the stock market rally, as mergers like Merrill Lynch’s $50 billion sale to Bank of America, struck as Lehman Brothers slid toward bankruptcy last weekend, could unwind. Arbitrageurs, investors who bet on the outcome of deals by buying shares in the target company while shorting those in the seller, were unable to play one side of that trade.Some hedge fund managers complained bitterly that they had been singled out, even as they were among the few to properly manage risk. Those whom the government had propped up were the investment banks, whose hundreds of billions of dollars in losses arose from reckless risks undertaken to raise profits to hedge-fund-like levels.“Bailing out the banks should not be done,” said Carl C. Icahn, the activist investor. He suggested that the government should have extended those firms a loan, instead of buying their toxic mortgage-backed securities.In the end, the market closed on Friday at nearly the same price it did last week before all the mayhem. An e-mail message circulating around Wall Street on Friday carried the subject line: “If you took the week off ... you didn’t miss anything.”'"

McCAIN: Now, on Wall Street, I'd--obviously we need to stop--we need tomore--have more transparency. We need to take the regulatory agencies andmerge them together in one effective agency. These regulatory agencies, thisalphabet soup, was really designed for a different era. We're now in globaltransactions. We need more transparency. We need to combine the regulatoryagencies, and we need to give them some more authority, if necessary, to doso. You know, Secretary Paulson had a package of recommendations sometime agothat basically did not really go anywhere. Maybe we can look at those andother recommendations in the future.In Washington, I still think that it was the special interest money thatwent--and Fannie and Freddie money that went, and everybody was involved inthis--not everybody, but certainly Senator Obama got next amount of money,except for the two Democratic chairman. His vice presidential search team washeaded by Mr. Johnson, and...HARWOOD: And your campaign manager?Sen. McCAIN: And my campaign manager has stopped that, has had nothing to dowith it since, and I'll be glad to have his record examined by anybody whowants to look at it.HARWOOD: If this goes through, and it looks like it will, the nextpresident--could be you--is going to have obligations of $700 billion, maybe atrillion dollars, that you hadn't planned on when you were formulating anagenda for--to run for president in the last two years. I asked Senator Obamathis morning whether he would alter any of his tax or spending plans inresponse, he said no. What is your position--is there anything that you wouldalter in response to this huge, unexpected event, either in terms of changingyour plans for tax cuts, for fiscal reasons, or changing your plans forprivate accounts on Social Security?Sen. McCAIN: Well, let me answer your second question first. I've said, ifsomeone voluntarily wants to invest their money that--their tax dollars,that's their own--that they should be able to--allowed to do that if they wantto do that. If a young worker wants to. That's being portrayed as some kindof privatization. I mean, that's just outright distortion. And I stillbelieve that young Americans ought to have, if they seek to, to be able to, ina voluntary fashion, to give--put some of their money into accounts with theirname on it. And obviously that would be very restricted and have a lot ofparameters associated with it.On the first question, which--excuse me, I was focusing so much on the secondquestion, the first one was about tax cuts.HARWOOD: Is there anything else you would give up? Would you give up taxcuts because we couldn't afford them with this huge expense for bailout?Sen. McCAIN: About tax cuts, yeah. I think anything that has theeffect--that has the effect of a tax increase would be very dangerous andharmful to our economy at this time. If we tell the Americans, no matter atwhat level, that we are going to increase their taxes, such as a capital gainstax increase, such as any of the others that have been proposed by some, Ithink it would be a serious error. Look, it's still about spending. It'sstill about the fact that we've allowed government to grow by 40 percent,greater in the last seven years, greater than any great society.HARWOOD: And you're spending--Washington's getting ready to spend another 700billion, so...Sen. McCAIN: We're going to--we're going to...HARWOOD: ...can you still preserve all your tax cuts in that circumstance?Sen. McCAIN: It's--we've got to make our economy grow, and nearly half topreserve--not have anything that has the effect on our economy of taxincreases. This is an increase argument, not to increase taxes.HARWOOD: Would you concede then...Sen. McCAIN: So I would not at all support anything that is perceived as atax increase.HARWOOD: Would you concede then that you could not achieve your goal ofbalancing the budget in your first term with this huge bailout?Sen. McCAIN: Not at all. I believe we can still balance the budget. Ithink that it's--that it is restraint of spending, and I think it's growth ofgovernment and the economy--and the recover of our economy. And anything youdo that would have--take more money from the American people who are hurtingmore now I think would be a serious mistake.HARWOOD: In the last week, you said initially that the fundamentals of theeconomy were strong.Sen. McCAIN: And let me stop you right there. The American worker is thestrongest, the best, the most innovative and the most productive, and they'llbring America back. And anybody who disagrees with that, I respect theirdisagreement.HARWOOD: Late in the week there was a magazine article in which you citedfinancial deregulation as a model for health care reform.HARWOOD: So my question is...HARWOOD: ...look at that and say, either that you're instincts on the economyare out of step with theirs...HARWOOD: ...or even headed in the wrong direction?Sen. McCAIN: Sure. What I was saying is that we can--you can go to an ATManyplace in America, in any state in America. I want Americans to be able toget health insurance in any state in America. Right now, the citizens ofthe--my state of Arizona can't go outside the state of Arizona and get theirhealth insurance. Of course they should be able to. So, again, I believethat--I'm a Teddy Roosevelt Republican. Teddy Roosevelt was the first onethat took on the big trusts, first time we began to have regulatory agencies.He said, unfettered capitalism leads to corruption. I've always agreed withthat. I...Sen. McCAIN: Of course. I don't--Americans don't want increased regulationson their lives. They want to lead their own lives as much as they can. Ispoke out against--I argued against the excesses of Fannie and Freddie. Ispoke out against corporate greed years ago. I've continuously done soagainst my own party and against others. And I haven't always made WallStreet happy over the years, and that's just a record. As far as I know,Senator Obama has never spoken out against any of these. He never spoke outagainst Fannie and Freddie and their practices. He never spoke out about someof the excesses on Wall Street, and I certainly did. So it's very clear. Myrecord is very clear.HARWOOD: Last question. Given the gravity of this situation, certainly wesaw a lot of official Washington and ordinary Americans frightened by whatthey were looking at the other day. Can you really tell the American peoplethat someone with Governor Palin's background and expertise is the bestpartner for you to attack an economic crisis as president?Sen. McCAIN: Absolutely. She has cut taxes, she's reformed government. Wehave to reform government. This crisis is a product of Washington and WallStreet excess and corruption. It cries out for reform. She's a reformer.She has a clear record of reform. So I think she is ideally suited. Ratherthan--frankly, her record, I think, argues in this crisis more for hercandidacy rather than less.HARWOOD: Senator, thanks so much for talking with us.'"
"'08-09-21,'0','Third principle is that we've got to have relief for the homeowners. Theunderlying problem in this whole situation is that home values are declining,foreclosures are going haywire. We've got to make sure that we're addressingthat underlying problem and that relief flows to homeowners and it's not justa bailout for Wall Street.And the fourth principle that I think is important is that as we increaseliquidity in the system as we restore market confidence; that we're alsomaking sure that CEOs and executives, large investors, that they are notwalking away with billions of dollars in profits or added value. I thinkthere's got to be some constraints on what they benefit in terms of makingsure that the program works and the taxpayers aren't paying for multimilliondollar bonuses.HARWOOD: It looks as if there's the bipartisan will to move this throughquickly in Congress, and if that happens then the government will have justtaken on $700 billion of obligations that you haven't planned on throughoutyour two-year campaign for president. So how do you adjust your agenda inlight of that, whether it's the scale of your plans for spending on healthcare, energy or other issues, whether it's on the advisability of raisingtaxes on capital gains and dividends, even staffing your administration?Would you ask Hank Paulson, for example, to stay on as Treasury secretary?Sen. OBAMA: Well, I'll take the last question first. I think that thetransition from the current administration to the next one is going to besomething we've got to pay a lot of attention to; not just because of thefinancial crisis, but also because we're in the middle of two wars and we arestill vulnerable to terrorist attacks. So without saying specifically whatwe'll do, I think it's important to make sure that that transition is seamlessand that we pass the baton effectively.HARWOOD: Would you consider having Paulson stay on?Sen. OBAMA: I would certainly want to make sure that Paulson was involved inthe transition. That doesn't necessarily mean that he'd end up being thesecretary Treasury, but I think it's important for us to make sure that thosewho are currently in charge when it comes to the financial crisis and defenseand intelligence, that they are deeply involved in the transition process.When it comes to the issues of my long-term economic plan, look, here's whatwe've got. We've got a immediate crisis that has to be dealt with, and Ithink it's important for us to act in a bipartisan fashion, to act swiftly anddecisively and not get too bogged down with a lot of partisan rankle. Butwhat we have to remember is how we got into this problem in the first place.Contrary to what John McCain says, the fundamentals of the economy are notsound. The problem that we have in part has to do with wages and incomes thathave been flat, and so homeowners and ordinary families out there have beenworking very hard but it's tough for them to pay the bills and stay afloatwith rising gas prices and health care. So if we don't address our long-termcompetitiveness, if we don't address some of the inequities in the tax code,if we're not addressing some of the things that weakened the family budget,then we're not, over the long term, going to solve these larger problems inthe financial markets.HARWOOD: Does that mean you can do everything that you have been campaigningon and spend $700 billion on this bailout?Sen. OBAMA: Here's what I think we have to do. I do think that we're goingto have to change our tax code in the ways that I've described so that we aregiving a middle-class tax cut. Ninety-five percent of families have moremoney in their pockets, that allows them to save more, pay down some of theircredit card bills, deal with rising gas prices, deal with rising food prices.That has a stimulative effect that will help to create jobs, that'll help thesmall business owner, retail sales. I believe that that is very important.Now, I think it's important to pay for it, which means that it's time for usto close some of these tax havens and loopholes that haven't contributed togrowth in the economy overall. In fact, what they've contributed to areoutsized profits that have gone into some of these risky instruments that haveended up getting us into financial trouble.HARWOOD: And what about on the spending side?Sen. OBAMA: Well, on the spending side, I think it's going to be importantfor us to deal with the health care crisis and...HARWOOD: So no change in your health care plan?Sen. OBAMA: Well, the--but keep in mind, my health care plan is paid for.And I continue to believe that rolling back the Bush tax cuts on thewealthiest Americans makes sense. They are still going to be wealthy afterthose are rolled back. I still believe that it is important for us to makecollege more affordable. And I think it's important that all those things arepaid for in light of this huge additional potential expense.But one last point I want to make, though, on what Secretary Paulson isproposing. If this is done properly, then the expenditure should not be $700billion. But that's why it's important to have oversight, that's why it'simportant the taxpayers participate in the upside, and we have to make surethat we have a overall strategy that is helping Main Street with the samesense of urgency as we're helping Wall Street. I don't want us to get boggeddown over the next week in dealing with what is a severe crisis. We've got tounlock the credit markets, we've got to restore liquidity, we've got to helpthe banks recapitalize, but we can't simply do that and then go back tobusiness as usual.HARWOOD: Well, speaking of that, you can't legislate against bubbles.It--you can't legislate against risk taking on Wall Street. Hard to legislateagainst the sale of securities. What specifically could you do to preventwhat's happened recently from happening again in the future?Sen. OBAMA: Well, I disagree that you can't regulate some risk taking.Look, what--during the Great Depression we put in place regulations related tobanks that said we're going to provide insurance so you don't have a bunch ofpeople starting a run on your bank. But in exchange for that--we're going tolook carefully at your books and we're going to make sure that you havecertain capital requirements and other steps that make sure that you're actingresponsibly in exchange for this insurance, this backstop that the federalgovernment's provided. The problem that we have is that those 20th centuryregulations never adapted to a 21st century financial environment. So now thetraditional bank accounts for only a small portion of the overall financialsector. I think it's going to be important for us to make sure that if we area backstop, let's say on an investment bank, that that investment bank hascertain capital requirements and other requirements to assure that they arenot taking wild risks. What we don't want is a situation where they are ableto say, ""Heads, I win; tails, the taxpayer loses."" And you know, this wholeprocess of deregulation is one that I think could have been thought through.John McCain has said that, you know, he is always a deregulator. That was hisphilosophy. Phil Gramm, one of his main economic advisers, took that sameapproach. The truth of the matter is that, you know, we have had an ideologythat says regulation is always bad. And my argument is that smart regulationscan in fact improve the marketplace because they improve transparency, theygives people a sense of if they're buying something, they know what is--what'sin there. And you know, this is one of those situations where we canstrengthen the marketplace, strengthen capitalism by making sure that thefederal government has some oversight.HARWOOD: What do you do about the part of the problem that's broader thanWall Street, that goes to the fact that our society has been consuming morethan we've been producing, people have been spending more than they're earningon bigger houses, more gadgets. You don't get votes by telling people thatthey ought to downscale their expectations, but how do you deal with that partof the problem?Sen. OBAMA: Well, I think what we can do is to make sure that people'sincomes are rising. I actually think that, you know, this is--this is sort ofa myth that's evolving, that the problem here is that, you know, the Americanpeople have been spendthrifts. Half of bankruptcies are occurring becausepeople get sick and they don't have health insurance. A lot of the creditcards that people are racking up--the credit cards that people are racking upis because at the end of the month their expenses just don't match up withwhat they're bringing in, despite the fact that they may be working two, threejobs. Some--many people are--go deeply in debt because they've got to pay fortheir kids' college educations. So this is why it's so important that weunderstand that the fundamentals of the economy have been weakened. Wages andincomes have gone down $2,000 for the average family during George Bush. Theywent up $7500 under Bill Clinton. That's a big differential for somebodywho's making 40, $50,000 a year. And it's not surprising, then, that oursavings rates plummeted.Look, people are going to make adjustments on their own. You know, mostAmericans I meet, they don't want to be in debt. They are embarrassed by theprospects of bankruptcy. You're already seeing in the transportation sector,people have changed their buying habits once gas got to a certain price. So Ithink consumers are naturally going to make some adjustments. But what wehave to do is create--whether it's a sound energy policy that's focused onalternative energy and improved efficiency on cars, whether it's a health caresystem that's much more...(unintelligible)...and books as on prevention,whether it's making sure that college is affordable; if we're doing thosethings that helps get into the middle class and stay in the middle class, thenwe are going to be able to create a better cushion for them and they're goingto be able to save more. That will be good for the overall health of thesystem.HARWOOD: Let me ask a question about you that goes to risk and trust. Whenyou saw the picture of those legislators in both parties with Ben Bernanke andHank Paulson the other night, they looked frightened. They were looking atthe potential for real--very severe economic dislocation, which would affect alot of people's life savings.HARWOOD: When you talk to voters, how do you convince them to trust you as arelatively inexperienced person on the national stage, that they can entrustthis economy and their savings to you?Sen. OBAMA: Well, a couple of things. I think if you--if you look thisweek, I was in constant communication with Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke; myeconomic advisers which include Paul Volcker, the former Federal ReserveBoard chairman; Bob Rubin, former Treasury secretary; Warren Buffet, who Ithink everybody feels knows the economy pretty well. And I think if you talkto those folks, they would say this guy knows what he's talking about and,most importantly, he knows how to put together a team of people that know whatthey're talking about and has the ability to bring them together to ask theright questions and find solutions. I don't think that the American peopleexpect somebody to deal with this who is a economics PhD. What they do expectis that we have a president who is engaged, who understands the argumentsinvolved, who understands the principles that have to be fought for. Andthat's what I bring to bear in this race.HARWOOD: What do you think they've seen from John McCain?Sen. OBAMA: Well, I--you know, look, I'll just--I'll let people draw theirown conclusions. On Monday, John McCain said the economy was fundamentallysound. He then said that, well, what he really was talking about wereAmerican workers, which wasn't very persuasive. He was initially opposed tothe AIG bailout, the next day he says that he's for the AIG bailout. He thencalls for the firing of Chris Cox and starts sounding like a Huey Longpopulist.HARWOOD: You don't support the firing of Chris Cox?Sen. OBAMA: Well, the point is I actually do think that Chris Cox has notoverseen the markets the way he could have, and he's a Republican appointee.But...HARWOOD: But would you fire him in the middle of a crisis?Sen. OBAMA: Well, what I would do is I would say let's get through this andthen let's make an assessment. I think that what's important is to understandthat John McCain's bill fails to recognize that it's the overarching economictheories that have been operating over the last eight years that need to befired, that have failed. And you know, that is not something that you haveseen acknowledged yet. They've--John McCain has historically said that wedon't need regulation. In fact, he recently stated that he thought we shoulduse the health care--we should adopt the same principles of deregulation tothe health care system as we have to the banking system. You know, he'ssomebody who has been supportive of privatizing portions of Social Security.Imagine what would have happened if we had gone through with the Bush-McCainprivatization scheme. You would have retirees right now seeing half, maybetwo-thirds of their retirement accounts vanished. And so there is a--just afundamental difference between John McCain and myself in terms of how we getthis economy back on track.HARWOOD: Last question. Given all that, as we head toward the first debateyou're locked in a very close race, perhaps you're slightly ahead. But somepeople look at what's going on in the economy and other politicalcircumstances and think you should be doing better. Some people say it'sbecause you're aloof, some people say you're cerebral, John McCain says you'renot ready to lead, some people think it may have something to do with yourrace. Why do you think, especially on the economy, you have not connectedbetter than you have so far?Sen. OBAMA: Well, you know, I have--I have to say that this notion thatsomehow it should be a cakewalk to win the presidency is--it's never happenedin history, a nonincumbent--people wisely, I think, want to lift the hood andkick the tires, and they want to listen to the debates. And they're going tomake up their minds relatively late. And that's been true throughout history.So we feel very confident about the kind of campaign we're running. I thinkthe most important thing that I want voters to think about when they're goingin to, you know, vote on November 4th, is can we afford eight more years ofthe same economic philosophy? And I don't think anybody disputes, despite thechange slogan that John McCain's been trying to hoist lately--I don't thinkanybody disputes that John McCain, his basic economic orientation is the sameas George Bush's. He's got the same tax plan, he's got the same health careplan, he's got the same privatization of Social Security plan, he's got thesame absence of a plan when it comes to college education, and the--and he'sgot the same approach to regulation, or...HARWOOD: Do you think race...HARWOOD: Do you think race is a big barrier between you and swing voters?Sen. OBAMA: Look, if you're asking me are there some people who might notvote for me because of my race? Of course. Are there some who might vote forme because of my race? You bet. I think ultimately, though, the question'sgoing to be decided by a guy or a woman who is working hard every day tryingto save enough to send their kid to college, trying to pay the bills. And thereal question they're going to have is, you know, can this guy help me in mylife? Can this person, regardless of what he looks like and what his name is,can he guide the economy in such a way that I have a better chance ofachieving the American dream? And is this guy going to fight for me everyday? And if people look at my background and they see who I've fought forthroughout my career--yes, as a community organizer, then as a civil rightsattorney, then as a state legislature--legislator and now as a United Statessenator and candidate for president--I think what they can feel confidentabout is not only do my plans focus on Main Street and how we give ordinaryfolks a fair shake, but my track record has--that's who I've been fighting foras well. And I think that's going to be something that people understand bythe time they vote.HARWOOD: Senator, thanks so much for joining us.Sen. OBAMA: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.'"

"'08-09-21,'0','WASHINGTON — News reports about the upheaval in the world of finance have been full of esoteric terms like “mortgage-backed securities” and “credit-default swaps,” but the crisis has resonated for people who know little about Wall Street and who did not think they would ever have to know. Here are several questions and answers of concern to Main Street Americans:Q. The bailout program being negotiated by the Bush administration and Congressional leaders calls for the government to spend up to $700 billion to buy distressed mortgages. How did the politicians come up with that number, and could it go higher?A. The recovery package cannot go higher than $700 billion without additional legislation. As for that figure, it lies between the optimistic estimate of $500 billion and the pessimistic guess of $1 trillion about the cost of fixing the financial mess. But the $700 billion is in addition to an $85 billion agreement on a bailout of the insurance giant American International Group, plus $29 billion in support that the government pledged in the marriage of Bear Stearns and JPMorgan Chase. On top of all that, the Congressional Budget Office says the federal bailout of the mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could cost $25 billion.Q. Who, really, is going to come up with the $700 billion?A. American taxpayers will come up with the money, although if you are bullish on America in the long run, there is reason to hope that the tab will be less than $700 billion. After the Treasury buys up those troubled mortgages, it will try to resell them to investors. The Treasury’s involvement in the crisis and the speed with which Congress is responding could generate long-range optimism and raise the value of those mortgages, although it is impossible to say by how much.So it would not be correct to think of the federal government as simply writing a check for $700 billion. It is just committing itself to spend that much, if necessary. But the bottom line is, yes, this bailout could cost American taxpayers a lot of money.Q. So is it fair to say that Americans who are neither rich nor reckless are being asked to rescue people who are? What is in this package for responsible homeowners of modest means who might be forced out of their homes, perhaps for reasons beyond their control?'"
"'08-09-21,'0','It was a Saturday afternoon in middle America and it was as if a college football game had broken out on a golf course, something even Weekley noticed.“At times there today it felt like I was playing football and I was standing in the middle of the field with the whole stadium cheering me,” he said, a wide smile on his face and a large chaw of tobacco in his cheek. “I’ve never done that on a football field, but that’s how it felt.”Weekley was also in the middle of the closest thing to Ryder Cup enmity at this year’s competition. Tense or unfriendly exchanges between opposing players has fed the rivalry at previous Cups. More common lately has been rowdy crowd behavior.A tempest of both kinds appeared to be brewing Friday night, when Westwood, an Englishman, suggested that Weekley, who spent many minutes Friday flailing his arms to encourage the home crowd to cheer, had stepped over the line because occasionally the cheerleading preceded Westwood’s attempts to putt.On Saturday, it was clear that the crowd loudly supporting Weekley and Holmes was aware of Westwood’s comments. The gallery responded to his good shots with obvious silence, while Hansen received polite applause for his good play. But there was little apparent heckling of Westwood. There was an early moment, when Weekley and Westwood made consecutive birdie putts, that Westwood seemed to glare at the grandstand. But any friction passed quickly in a match that went to the 17th hole.“It was fine, the crowd was fine,” said Westwood, who added that he thought Weekley tried to do his Saturday cheerleading at times that would be less distracting to his opponents.“He apologized last night, which is the kind of man he is,” Westwood said of Weekley.For his part, Weekley said he felt bad for Westwood, but then laughed and added: “But not too bad. If we were over there, we might be seeing the same thing.”García, who in Ryder Cup appearances on European soil has been known to rev the crowd with some cheerleading of his own, came to the 17th green 20 minutes after Weekley on Saturday. His 20-foot birdie putt attempt would have given his pairing with Paul Casey a one-hole lead in a crucial late match. It was the kind of Ryder Cup moment that García has made his own. This time, García, who the European captain Nick Faldo said was taking antibiotics for an undisclosed ailment, left the putt two feet short.And even on the 18th hole, where the Europeans needed a birdie to tie the American team of Steve Stricker and Ben Curtis, it was Casey who came through, sinking the decisive putt.García, who still has Sunday’s singles matches to assert himself at the 2008 Ryder Cup, clapped his hands alongside the green at Casey’s birdie, an expression of exhausted relief on his face.'"
"'08-09-21,'0','In 1980, the company introduced a line of all-natural juices with the Snapple name, which came from one of its first products, a carbonated apple juice that had a “snappy apple taste.”“When it first came out,” Mr. Greenberg told The New York Times in July 1994, “we sold 500 cases. The next month we sold 500 more cases and got some calls from distributors. ‘You’ve changed your formula,’ they said. ‘This Snapple’s tasting better and better.’ Then one day in our warehouse the tops of the bottles started shooting off. Bang! Pop! We found out it was fermenting. We’d made Champagne.”The company enjoyed modest success with its natural sodas in the early 1980s, but it was when it introduced its iced tea in 1987 that sales began to skyrocket. Amid a nationwide boom in health consciousness, Snapple became perhaps the only ready-to-drink iced tea promoted as having natural ingredients and being made from real brewed tea. Consumers increasingly chose it over its carbonated competitors.Besides winning appeal through its 52 fruity flavors, Snapple quickly endeared itself to Americans with an aggressive marketing campaign. Its unconventional television ads featured a wildly popular spokeswoman from Long Island, Wendy Kaufman, or Wendy the Snapple Lady, who would read letters from devoted Snapple drinkers in her distinct “New Yawk” accent while promoting the beverage as “Made from the best stuff on earth.” Snapple is now sold in 80 countries.The company, which was founded in Brooklyn, eventually moved to Long Island, where Mr. Golden and his two business partners lived. All the while the three friends cherished their product, having a level of fun with it that was reflected in its quirky flavors and reputation.“They used to sit in their office with chemists, and they would have concentrates all over the table as they did taste tests,” said Mr. Golden’s daughter, Sharon. “It wasn’t even work to them. It was total enjoyment and they just loved what they were doing. They had a ball with it.”Hyman Golden was born in 1923 in Passaic, N.J., and raised in the Middle Village section of Queens. He served in the Air Force and in 1948 met his wife, Mitzi, whom he married the next year.In the early 1990s, as Snapple was exploding in popularity, Mr. Golden served as its chairman. The company was sold several times — eventually ending up with Cadbury Schweppes, now known as the Dr Pepper Snapple Group — making the men a fortune. But Mr. Golden, who retired in 1995, always remained thankful, his daughter said.“He accomplished the American dream,” she said. “When he and his partners would get together for events and celebrations, their favorite song to sing was ‘God Bless America,’ because they were so appreciative.”“In their wildest dreams,” she added, “they never thought that this would be the end result.”Mr. Golden is survived by his wife, Mitzi Golden; his three children, Sharon Golden Brenner, Dr. Bruce Golden, and Robert Golden; and seven grandchildren.'"
"'08-09-21,'0','Sometimes Mr. Frank and Mr. Marks saw things differently, like whether people could cope with a similar economic disaster today.“People are accustomed to so much more; they take a year off to go to Europe after college — I don’t know how they would adjust, I really don’t,” Mr. Frank said, shaking his head. “You take a 50-year-old man, two kids in college, expensive house, how can he keep that up? How can he find the same kind of work?”“I have to disagree,” Mr. Marks said, tapping his hand gently on the arm of his chair. “Our generation coped, the next generation will cope, and the generation after that. People learn, and now there’s more available to learn from.”But they shared a sense of disquiet, as if they believed we had veered too far off the road in too many ways — the quality of leadership, the sense of shared purpose, basic common sense.“If you’re building a house, you need to have a strong foundation,” said Mr. Frank as they sat side by side, two thin bookends in matching stuffed chairs. “And I’m looking around this country for a foundation, and I don’t see it.”The two had many shared memories — the exhausted-looking World War I veterans in their military hats selling apples for a nickel on the street, the years of economic stagnation that became a way of life, the excitement and hope generated by Franklin D. Roosevelt.“People waited all week for his fireside chats,” Mr. Marks said of Roosevelt’s radio speeches. “He buoyed people, he gave them hope. People wouldn’t miss those talks for anything. There’s no one today who can give that kind of hope.”“There’s no leadership now,” Mr. Frank agreed. “The president is a puppet. The people in Congress are in it for themselves. F.D.R. was like a God to people.”Typical of the Depression generation, both are eternally wary about money. Mr. Marks, who grew up in Brooklyn and went on to work appraising merchandise for what was then the United States Customs Service, used one credit card — sparingly — for 30 or 40 years. He drove a Chevrolet Caprice for maybe eight years before buying a new one.“I’m not going to owe what I can’t pay,” said Mr. Frank, who owned a printing company and designed financial reports. “I’m not going to buy a Cadillac if I can only afford a Ford. Today, I know people who have a dozen credit cards, and they go from one to the other like they’re dealing playing cards.”Age 90 or age 30, we were all whipsawed last week. So on Thursday, Mr. Marks and Mr. Frank were disagreeing on how desperate the financial devastation would be, and by Friday, they were trying to gauge whether the federal rescue plan would stave it off.Mr. Marks said the bailout might avoid a 1929-style disaster, but it didn’t do anything to address the lack of jobs, the outsourcing of economic activity, the slow slide he saw in American life.Mr. Frank pointed to the breakdown in families. Back then, he said, one brother would start a trucking business, the others would join. Today, he said, one is in New York, another in Chicago, another in California.“I don’t think that’s it at all,” Mr. Marks said. “We were a country endowed with great natural wealth, forests and minerals and fresh water. Our agriculture was the best in the world. But that’s not enough anymore.“We taught other people around the world, and now they’re just as efficient as we are or better,” he added. “And some of them work harder. We don’t have to be in a Depression to see they’re coming up and we’re sinking down, and we don’t know how to change it.”'"
"'08-09-21,'0','Seven years after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the remains of 13 of the 19 men responsible have been identified and are in the custody of the F.B.I. and the New York City medical examiner’s office.But no one has formally requested the remains in order to bury them.“Politically, one can understand that this is a hot potato,” said Muneer Fareed, secretary general of the Islamic Society of North America and a former professor of Islamic studies. “People don’t want to identify with the political equivalent of Jeffrey Dahmer.”What would happen if someone asked for the hijackers’ remains is not clear.Neither the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which holds the remains of the nine hijackers whose planes hit the Pentagon and crashed in a field in Somerset County, Pa., nor the New York City medical examiner’s office, which holds the remains of 4 of the 10 hijackers who flew planes into the World Trade Center buildings, has policies to deal with such a request.“If and when it comes up, we’ll address it then,” an F.B.I. spokesman, Richard Kolko, said.The bureau could turn down such requests, Mr. Kolko said, because the Sept. 11 investigation is an open case.The medical examiner’s office, which, like the F.B.I., refuses to say where exactly the remains are being kept, will eventually put together a committee to come up with a policy, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the office.'"
"'08-09-21,'0','The price-earnings ratio is the traditional measure of how expensive stocks are. It divides the current value of a stock (or a stock index, like the Standard & Poor’s 500) by the annual earnings of a company (or the companies in the index). But there are several different versions of the ratio, depending on which measure of earnings is used.Some analysts like to use an estimate of future earnings. The main problem with this approach is that it is based on Wall Street’s forecasts of future earnings, which are often unreliable.Another approach is to use the earnings over the previous 12 months. This depends on more solid data than earnings forecasts. But it has the disadvantage of being based on a relatively short-term period. In a given year, earnings can soar or plunge; stocks, which are a bet on companies’ long-term futures, should really be less volatile than earnings are.Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd, the authors of a famous 1934 textbook on the market, argued that investors should look at a longer time horizon than just one year. (Mr. Graham was Warren Buffett's mentor.) In their textbook, “Security Analysis,” they suggested looking at earnings over “not less than five years, preferably seven or ten years.” The price-earnings ratio used in this week's Week in Review article on the market uses a five-year window.An Economic Scene column in August 2007 discussed this subject in more detail.'"
"'08-09-21,'0','“Tourism depends on political stability more than security,” he said, adding that he believed the security situation would continue to improve. “Tourists want entertainment, rest, relaxation. If they find that in any place, they will come.”Capt. Thomas J. Karnowski, an enthusiastic Navy officer with the Civil Engineer Corps in the Green Zone, has been providing technical support to the Tourism Board on the island project.“I look at the risk and say he who gets here first with the best idea gets the best opportunity,” Captain Karnowski said recently as he led visitors on a tour of a jetty with a view of one of Saddam Hussein’s eight presidential homes across the Tigris.Mr. Yakobi, 47, seems in some ways an unlikely candidate for the task he has been given. In his black suit and maroon checked tie, he looks far more like a bureaucrat than a visionary. Asked what he wakes up worrying about at night, he said, “I never wake up.”The tourism board, he said, will hold a weeklong conference in Baghdad in November to promote the island — which is a little more than a mile long by less than a mile wide — and other projects. Those include a hotel expected to open soon in the ancient city of Babylon in Babel Province, where cholera cases have recently been reported. He also has plans for a hotel, a sports complex and a medical center in the holy city of Najaf, and resorts in Anbar Province and the marshlands in the south.The island development has no investors so far, though Mr. Yakobi believes the project might be two-thirds completed within five years. He said representatives from the tourism industry around the world had been invited to the conference, though it was unclear how many would attend.“They will bring the message to all other countries that Iraq is secure,” he said. “I am depending on them.”Hassan al-Fayadh, head of the tourism board’s media relations department, was more skeptical.“Western visitors are very sensitive to bombings and things like that,” he said. “You can’t achieve the tourism industry without security.”In fact, the State Department strongly warns Americans against travel to Iraq. “Despite recent security improvements, Iraq remains dangerous, volatile and unpredictable,” its Web site says, noting that bombings, kidnappings and mortar fire are common and that “such attacks can occur at any time.”Still, even in Iraq’s precarious state, tourism has not entirely vanished. Pilgrims from Iran, Pakistan, India and even Canada travel to the country’s major religious shrines. Mr. Yakobi said their numbers had increased in the past year as large bombings and ground battles between militias and Iraqi and American forces had diminished.He said about 1,500 Iranians arrived every day for religious tours that include three days in Najaf to visit the shrine of Imam Ali, the Prophet Muhammad’s son-in-law, and four days in Karbala, the site of the gold-domed shrine of Imam Hussein, Imam Ali’s son. Both shrines are revered by Shiite Muslims. The tours are supervised by the tourism board, a self-financed agency of the Iraqi government, and the visitors are provided with security, Mr. Yakobi said.The autonomous Kurdish region in the north, where rapid development is taking place and violence is far lower, also attracts travelers, though most go there for business. Between meetings, they visit Erbil’s citadel and the Kurdish Textile Museum, dine at restaurants in Sulaimaniya and sometimes venture into the mountainous countryside.Distant Horizons, a travel company based in Long Beach, Calif., has begun offering excursions to the Kurdish region.“We operated our first trip in June of this year (which went out full with 18 travelers and a wait list) and will be offering several departures in 2009,” Janet Moore, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-mail message.She said that although the Kurdish government was more prepared for such trips than she expected, “the concept of tourism is a very new one.”Before the American invasion in 2003, Westerners wandering the capital with cameras were not an uncommon sight. A Bradt travel guide to Iraq published in 2002 noted that “Iraqis tend to be very friendly, hospitable people, but most will not discuss politics or controversial topics.”It suggests, among other expeditions, a day trip from Baghdad to see the shrine at Samarra, which was bombed in 2006, setting off a wave of sectarian violence that brought Iraq to the brink of civil war; a visit to the Christian churches in Mosul, now emptied of most of their worshipers; and a stroll down the streets of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, currently at the center of a struggle among Arabs, Kurds, Turkmens and other groups.But if Mr. Yakobi has his way, the old days of tourism will soon return, and at least one intrepid traveler is ready for them.Charles MacDonald, an adviser to a member of the provincial Parliament in Ontario, met Iraq’s ambassador to Canada at a luncheon and decided to spend his vacation in Kurdistan. When he arrived, he said, Kurdish officials were astonished that he had come as a lone tourist, but they showed him the sights and arranged meetings with government leaders.Mr. MacDonald, however, wanted to see more. So he hired a private security firm and set up a two-day trip to the Green Zone in Baghdad.“This is modern history, and I wished to experience it first-hand,” he said.'"
"'08-09-21,'0','Virtually every career employee — as many as 97 percent in one recent year — applies for and gets disability payments soon after retirement, a computer analysis of federal records by The has found. Since 2000, those records show, about a quarter of a billion dollars in federal disability money has gone to former L.I.R.R. employees, including about 2,000 who retired during that time.The L.I.R.R.’s disability rate suggests it is one of the nation’s most dangerous places to work. Yet in four of the last five years, the railroad has won national awards for improving worker safety.“Short of the gulag, I can’t imagine any work force that would have a so-to-speak 90 percent disability attrition rate,” said Glenn Scammel, long one of Capitol Hill’s top experts on railroads. “That defies both logic and experience.”Said Dr. J. Mark Melhorn, co-editor of a book on occupational disability published by the : “No one has a rate that high — that just doesn’t happen.”And it is not just engineers, conductors or track workers seeking disability payments. Dozens of retired white-collar managers are doing it as well, including the former deputy general counsel, employment manager, claims manager and director of government and community affairs.In fact, two formerly influential figures at the L.I.R.R. — a married couple, one from management and one from labor — are retired and drawing about $280,000 annually in combined disability and pension payments, according to estimates based on public records.Railroad officials say that as far as they know, most of the disabled workers were able-bodied until their early retirement, and only then filed papers seeking occupational disability payments.“How is it that somebody is occupationally disabled the day after he retires when he wasn’t occupationally disabled the day before he retired?” asked Gary Dellaverson, chief financial officer for the , the railroad’s parent.The answer, according to government records and dozens of interviews, stems from a combination of factors, including highly unusual L.I.R.R. contracts that allow longtime workers to retire with a pension as early as age 50, federal rules that let railroad retirees claim disability for jobs they no longer hold, and an obscure federal agency called the Railroad Board that almost never says no to a disability claim.The federal agency pays the disability claims, but losing so many workers to early retirement costs the L.I.R.R. money — in overtime, training of replacements and early pension payments. At the same time, passengers could soon face another fare increase and the transportation authority is seeking more taxpayer support, already half a billion dollars a year, to close a huge budget gap.Union contracts also inflate operating costs through arcane work rules, some dating back to the 1920s, which pad employee paychecks, boosting pension and disability payments in turn.“There are maybe nine different ways to show up at work and get two days’ pay without doing anything extra,” Michael J. Quinn, general chairman of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen at the L.I.R.R., said in an interview.These work rules made it possible for eight senior train engineers to earn from $215,000 to $277,000 in 2006. Younger workers earn much less, and income in the top tier was lower in 2007.Since medical records are private, individual cases could not be examined, and there is little doubt that some of the retirees receiving disability payments actually have debilitating conditions.Still, the L.I.R.R.’s disability rate in recent years has been three to four times that of the average railroad, and is particularly striking when compared with the number of disabilities at Metro-North, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority subsidiary that serves commuters north of .Their work forces are of similar size and composition. Employees perform roughly the same tasks: operating trains, punching tickets and maintaining tracks.And yet in one area — debilitating illness and injury — the difference is so vast as to almost defy medical explanation.One example: disabilities resulting from . From 2001 through 2007, Metro-North had 32 cases, compared with 753 at the L.I.R.R. In one year, Metro-North had just 2 cases. The L.I.R.R. had 118.For certain diseases of the musculoskeletal system, like a herniated disc, Metro-North had 49 cases. The L.I.R.R. had 850.No one at the two railroads, at the transportation authority or at the Railroad Retirement Board could explain these gaping differences, nor were they even aware of them.“I’ve not seen that until you just showed it to me,” Michael S. Schwartz, the retirement board’s chairman, said in an interview this summer. The board focuses on individual claims, not specific railroads, Mr. Schwartz, said, but added, “We want to make sure that anything we do here is done correctly.”The L.I.R.R. president, Helena E. Williams, called the data compiled by The Times “alarming” and has asked the inspectors general of the retirement board and the transportation authority to investigate.Dr. Melhorn, who has studied disabilities, said the numbers alone were a cause for concern, “in particular if there seems to be a limited number of physicians who are providing this disability impairment.”Work-related injuries and illnesses do not explain the high disability rate. From 2005 through 2007, the L.I.R.R. had 2.91 per 200,000 working hours, compared with 2.98 for , 3.13 for Metro-North, 9.42 for PATH and 12.91 for ’s transit system, according to an analysis of federal records.The L.I.R.R.’s record also raises questions about why the Railroad Retirement Board approves nearly 100 percent of disability requests from all the nation’s railroads. The board is funded through taxes on railroads and their workers, but Social Security had to contribute $3.6 billion last year to cover expenses.“Everyone in America is going to contribute to that,” said Rick Lifto, assistant vice president of general claims for B.N.S.F., a large freight railroad. B.N.S.F.’s disability rate is lower than the L.I.R.R.’s, but even so, Mr. Lifto said, disabilities still cost his company millions of dollars.John Britt Jr., a former engineer, is an example of someone who benefited not only from the work rules, but also from disability payments. In his last year on the job, during which he earned more than any other engineer, Mr. Britt’s paycheck swelled with $58,853 for tasks that had violated the normal work rules of his union contract, including $2,309 for running diesel and electric trains on the same shift and $3,354 for working through his regular meal period, government records show. He also got $40,553 for overtime, $41,594 for a vacation buyout and $47,337 for a sick leave buyout.For the year, Mr. Britt received $277,075 — five times his base salary and $100,000 more than the highest-paid engineer at Metro-North. Then, after retiring at age 56 in 2006, he was classified as disabled by the Railroad Retirement Board.In fact, the 12 highest paid L.I.R.R. engineers in 2006 — most earning over $200,000 — are now retired and receiving disability payments, records show. And so are the top-earning conductors, three of whom had incomes over $190,000.Mr. Britt could not be reached for comment, but a woman responding to a note left at his listed residence said, “Our family has no comment.”The L.I.R.R. president, Ms. Williams, who has been on the job a little more than a year, says she recognizes the need to fix the railroad’s problems. The transportation authority’s inspector general has praised her willingness to quickly address deficiencies once they are identified. She has taken steps to help curb overtime, and the railroad’s on-time record has never been better.But many problems are beyond her control. Without the political support needed to weather a strike, management has been unwilling to press for the removal of costly work rules, according to former management and union officials. The railroad also has no authority to intervene in federal disability cases.Changes in the railroad’s contract have made it more difficult for many employees to retire early, although it is still possible for them to receive a regular pension at age 55, and 1,100 long-term employees were still working under the old provisions at the end of 2007.If the transportation authority needed any expertise on disabilities, it could have turned to a former board member and union official, Joseph Rutigliano, who became occupationally disabled after retiring in late 1999 at age 52.Mr. Rutigliano said in an interview that he “crushed” his back in a fall at home and eventually could no longer work as a conductor, where his duties included walking through trains taking tickets and repeatedly climbing in and out of railroad cars. “I needed to use my legs and my back every day,” he said. “It meets the criteria for what the railroad retirement system says prevents you from performing your railroad occupation.”If Mr. Rutigliano’s condition kept him from working, it did not stop him from golfing. He was a regular this summer at Sunken Meadow, often walking the course twice a week. As a disabled worker, he played free.About five years ago, L.I.R.R. officials say, they wanted to know more about why some employees were retiring and then filing for occupational disability. Because the L.I.R.R. had made progress in reducing workplace accidents, railroad managers wondered if something was amiss, so they contacted the Railroad Retirement Board.But L.I.R.R. officials said the retirement board assured them that the number of disabilities among former L.I.R.R. workers “was typical of railroads industrywide.” Nothing more happened, officials said, until several months ago, when they were contacted by The Times and shown numbers far exceeding the industry average.“We have been asked by newspaper reporters to explain why the L.I.R.R. has a high number of retirees who receive a disability annuity,” Ms. Williams said on July 15 in a letter to Mr. Schwartz of the retirement board.In a letter late last month to the retirement board’s inspector general, Ms. Williams expressed specific concerns about why so many retirees were citing the same two disease categories.“I find the high rate of R.R.B. disability awards in these categories alarming,” she wrote, asking the inspectors general from the retirement board and the transportation authority to look into the matter.Barry L. Kluger, inspector general for the authority, said, “The numbers and the cost I think do merit the kind of review that’s going on at this time.”Ms. Williams said the railroad also examined its own disability program, which, unlike the retirement board’s, handles disability claims from current employees.The figures looked nothing alike. The number last year, she said: zero.“So, the question I have is, ‘What is the medical criteria used?’ ” Ms. Williams said in an interview, referring to the retirement board. “How are they evaluating the standards for an occupational disability?”Outside the insular world of railroads, little is known about the Railroad Retirement Board. With headquarters not in , but in an old insurance building in , the board is overseen by three presidential appointees: one from labor, one from management and one representing consumers.The board, created in the 1930s, performs many of the same functions as Social Security, but for rail workers only. Both offer disability programs, but the similarities end there.A worker must be incapable of any gainful employment to be classified as disabled by Social Security. But rail workers can get disability payments even if they can perform other jobs — just not their regular railroad jobs. This provision, enacted in 1946, was based on the view that rail workers had especially hazardous jobs involving skills not easily transferred to other occupations.To document their occupational disability, rail workers can choose their own doctors who provide the board with detailed medical evaluations, usually including test results. Workers must also describe in full the physical demands of their rail jobs.L.I.R.R. officials say they have little interaction with the retirement board. “We do not have any representation on the board,” Ms. Williams said. “We are not asked for any medical evidence. We are not participants in any way. This is something employees do after they leave employment.”Cathleen Quinn, who runs the office of the retirement board, said her office gets “mainly orthopedic disabilities — herniated discs, bad knees.”L.I.R.R. employees favor certain doctors, and their disability applications are sometimes so similar as to be almost interchangeable, said one Long Island resident who has seen dozens of those applications. That person said that M.R.I.’s merely document physiological changes that commonly affect people over the age of 50.“I’ve never heard of anybody not finding something,” said the person, who did not wish to be identified for fear of angering friends who are getting disability payments.Dr. Robert K. McLellan, section chief for occupational and environmental medicine at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in , said M.R.I.’s alone were not enough to determine whether someone was incapacitated.“As we get older, we accumulate all kinds of abnormalities on M.R.I.’s,” Dr. McLellan said. “You can’t use an M.R.I. to say, ‘This person must have really bad back pain and therefore must be disabled.’ It is extremely common to have disc bulge and disc degeneration and disc herniation and have no symptoms whatsoever.”He said most people with a herniated disc recover within 6 to 12 weeks “without any intervention except time.”To account for those who might regain their ability to work, Social Security requires medical re-evaluations for the disabled, said Mark Lassiter, a Social Security spokesman. The Railroad Retirement Board has no such provision for an occupational disability and does not require any rehabilitation therapy.In all, the retirement board is far more generous in handing out disabilities than the , which says it rejects roughly 45 percent of its applicants for total disability. The railroad board rejects only 2 percent of those seeking occupational disability, a lower threshold than total disability.“You have to say to yourself, ‘Why is Railroad Retirement Board so different?’ ” Ms. Williams said.Martin J. Dickman, the retirement board’s inspector general, acknowledged in an interview that the retirement board’s rejection rate was “almost nonexistent,” but he added: “If Congress wants to change the statute and raise the threshold, that’s up to Congress. That’s not up to us to do.”Mr. Lifto, the B.N.S.F. claims official, said he was so concerned about the board’s generosity that he and representatives of other freight railroads went to Chicago a couple of years ago to see how the retirement board decided disability cases. He said he couldn’t recall finding a single applicant who had been rejected on medical grounds — only for incorrect or incomplete paperwork.Railroad management’s concerns got support from an internal retirement board audit in 2000 that found serious shortcomings in the disability program. A copy of that report, obtained by The Times, stated that medical files did not justify all the disabilities awarded. “This number could be as high as 10 to 20 percent of the cases reviewed,” according to the report, by two physician auditors.The audit also found that disability decisions were “largely made on the medical disease being present rather than an understanding of the functional limitations created by that disease.” The report also suggested that applications were overstating job demands.In a follow-up audit submitted in June of this year, one of the auditors, Dr. Natalie P. Hartenbaum, a management representative, found the problem had not been resolved.“Dr. Hartenbaum did not feel that the medical opinions rendered sufficiently took into account the actual work performed,” the audit stated. A second doctor representing labor found fewer faults than Dr. Hartenbaum.Although railroad work is not as difficult or as dangerous as in years past, it does require that can strain the body. Engineers have to climb ladders. Conductors are on their feet for hours.Charles Anderson, a former L.I.R.R. engineer, said a shoulder injury unrelated to work made it hard for him to climb up and down on the train. “I was doing it with one arm,” Mr. Anderson said. “The thing that really made me retire is I fell and I was by myself.”Mr. Rutigliano, the former transportation authority board member, said injured workers are seeking only what the law provides. “The doctors don’t lie,” he said. “They got X-rays, M.R.I.’s. They have bad backs. They have hearing disabilities.”Steven A. Bartholow, general counsel for the retirement board, said workers for the most part would not give up well-paying jobs unless there was a good reason.“I think most of the people who apply for occupational disability annuities are in fact occupationally disabled,” Mr. Bartholow said. “They are hurting.”If L.I.R.R. workers are hurting, it is also true that they have an added financial incentive to seek disability. Unlike other rail workers, they have a contract that allows them to get an early pension, which they can then supplement with disability payments.L.I.R.R. employees hired before 1988 with 20 years of service can start drawing on that pension at age 50. In fact, most workers start filing for disability in their 50s, records show. With monthly disability payments averaging about $3,000 a month, plus pension, retirees can earn their base salary and sometimes more until they reach normal retirement age.“When you’re 50, you’re still active,” said Tom Prendergast, a former L.I.R.R. president who is now running a transit system in . “You like to work on your house, go out on your boat, travel, whatever.”In each year since 2000, between 93 percent and 97 percent of employees over 50 who retired with 20 years of service also received disability payments.Four years ago, the transportation authority’s inspector general cautioned that occupational disabilities could have financial implications for the L.I.R.R.’s pension plan, which it found to be “extremely” underfunded. “An added incentive for employees to take their pensions is the ease with which they can qualify for occupational disability,” the inspector general said in a 2004 report.The railroad for a variety of reasons had to triple its annual contributions to the pension fund to $94 million in 2004 from $32 million in 2000.There are other benefits to being a disabled L.I.R.R. employee. Those deemed to be so severely incapacitated that they cannot hold any job — not just their regular railroad job — also get health care through , as well as special tax breaks. Nearly half of L.I.R.R. workers classified as occupationally disabled are later reclassified by the retirement board as totally disabled, records show.And then there is the free golf. Debbie Keville, an official with the state’s Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, explained who qualifies for what is called an Access Pass, allowing the disabled free use of sports facilities in state parks:“You have to have a functional disability. By that, I mean a person has to have severe limitations — for example, with sight impairment, you have to have a high level of visual loss — you can’t have your better eye seeing fine. If you have to have an ambulatory aid — such as a cane — you need to have it at all times, not just some of the time. or developmental disability qualifies you.”Ms. Keville says her agency isn’t in the business of saying no to the truly disabled. “You’ve probably heard of blind and visually impaired golfers,” she said. “They’re out there.”Ms. Keville said the state could not investigate each and every case. “We have no way of knowing why or how they are disabled, just that the government says they are,” she said.The size of a disability payment, as well as a pension, is determined partly by what an employee earns in the five years before retirement. Here again, the L.I.R.R.’s unique work rules give employees an edge.Take the case of Edward J. Koerber.On a spring evening in 2004, Mr. Koerber reported for his overnight shift as a train engineer at the Storage Yard. By the end of his eight-hour shift, Mr. Koerber would earn four days’ pay for one day’s work, transportation authority records show.Assigned to the railyard that night, Koerber was instead sent to passenger service. Under union rules, this change entitled him to an extra day’s pay. Over the next few hours, he ended up operating both an electric engine and a diesel engine. These dual duties earned him a second day’s pay.Around 2 a.m., Mr. Koerber took an engine in for maintenance. With that came another day’s pay.These three contract violations resulted in penalty payments that totaled $718. He also earned, among other things, $157 for a few hours of overtime and $15 for not getting to eat during his normal lunch break. The L.I.R.R. was supposed to pay him $247 for his work that day. Instead, he ended up with $1,177.Shifts like this were not that unusual. Mr. Koerber pulled off seven others like it that year.Nor was he alone: L.I.R.R. engineers were paid four days’ wages for a single day of work on 30 occasions in 2004. These cases were documented in a 2006 report by the transportation authority’s inspector general, who also found more than 500 examples of engineers making three days’ wages in one day and nearly 150 examples of conductors doing the same.That year, Mr. Koerber earned $211,586, according to payroll data. But his compensation the next year was even more remarkable: $276,456. Only the president of the railroad earned more: $287,658.Soon after, Mr. Koerber retired from the L.I.R.R., and he ultimately took with him more than just a pension. In 2006, records show, he began receiving disability payments from the Railroad Retirement Board. In all, his retiree income is about $170,000 a year, according to estimates based on public records.Mr. Koerber, who is now 60, declined to comment.Metro-North operates differently. “We don’t have full-day penalty payments here,” says Jane Murawski, assistant director of labor relations at Metro-North. “It would never be that the person works their eight-hour shift and then they get another eight hours and another eight hours for other things. That doesn’t happen here.”Metro-North, formed in 1983 from the old Conrail commuter lines, largely inherited the work rules of its parent, which was mostly a freight railroad. But because the L.I.R.R. has always been primarily a commuter railroad, many existing labor agreements remained after the authority took it over in 1966.The disparity in pay between the two railroads is considerable. At the L.I.R.R, 107 nonmanagement workers earned more than $150,000 in 2006, compared with only a handful at Metro-North.“We have the best work rules in the industry nationwide — I would say worldwide,” said Mr. Quinn, the official with the Long Island chapter of the engineers union. “They’ve never been able to negotiate them away from us.”Over the years, management has tried to chip away at those work rules.In the 1980s, L.I.R.R. officials became worried about losing so many veteran workers to early retirement, many of whom were quitting to take other jobs. So management made early retirement an issue during negotiations. The result: an 11-day strike. In the end, the rules were changed so that employees hired after 1987 had to reach age 55 and work 30 years before retiring on a normal pension.But that did not affect thousands of employees hired before 1988. And in time, it started to become apparent that second jobs were not necessary, not when it was so easy to be classified as occupationally disabled.During contract negotiations in 1994, management also tried to take a stand against work rule provisions that inflated earnings. But the political will to fight for these changes evaporated after workers went on strike, as they were legally entitled to do, unlike some other transit workers.“What’s lacking is leadership on the public side, people with strong beliefs and the courage to act on those beliefs,” said Louis Anemone, a former security director of the transportation authority. “There’s no stomach for it on the management level, and none of it on the political level.”There is a reason for that, Mr. Quinn says: “We move millions of people a week. And for this railroad to stop, people would be screaming. Politicians would have to answer questions: ‘What the hell is this? What are you doing?’ So they let us kind of co-exist.”But work rules and penalty payments, much like overtime, can be managed to reduce their financial impact — something that Ms. Williams, the railroad president, says she is trying to do.Over the years, the railroad has also made its share of serious mistakes. In 2006, the transportation authority inspector general found a 50 percent error rate when sampling sick-leave buyouts, a negotiated entitlement in which the railroad buys unused sick days. The buyouts cost the L.I.R.R. nearly $2 million in 2006.“The Long Island Rail Road has to confront its culture of and develop a proactive management structure,” Matthew D. Sansverie, the authority’s inspector general, wrote in a 2006 report. “The failure of staff and supervisors to question things that do not make sense must end.”Getting overtime costs under control has been a longstanding problem. “There continues to be lax controls over overtime and penalties earned by crews in the railyards,” authority investigators said in 2006.Early retirements by those seeking disability payments haven’t helped. “The railroad has experienced a substantial number of retirements in the last seven years,” said Ms. Williams. “It takes two years to train an engineer.”The L.I.R.R. has been successful under Ms. Williams in reducing overtime and some penalty payments, but eliminating those penalties is another matter. “We have not been successful in achieving that in collective bargaining,” she said.One penalty payment agreed to by management proved so embarrassing that the union was willing to give it up. In the 1980s, workers who maintained the track corridors got an extra two hours of pay if it rained. But because the agreement was poorly constructed, it opened the gates to abuse.The intent was to pay extra for work performed in the rain, but workers got paid even if it rained going to or from the work site. In one year, they got rain pay on 42 days when no rain fell, transportation authority investigators said in a 1989 report. One union official was quoted as saying that workers deserved the supplement “even if a flies over and urinates on them.”In one six-month period, rain pay cost the railroad $1.1 million. “Some of these things are ridiculous,” said Gerard P. Bringmann, general chairman of the Long Island Rail Road Commuter Council. “It makes absolutely no sense. Any company would go bankrupt that operates that way.”If L.I.R.R. managers had decided in years past to investigate disabilities, they would not have had to look very far; most of them were retiring and getting disability payments, too.Records show that in one recent three-year period, more than 60 white-collar managers retired and were classified as disabled. Like union members, many managers can retire at age 50 or 55 with benefits.One such retiree was Janet Lewis, a former director of government and community affairs. Ms. Lewis declined to discuss the nature of her disability, saying it was a private matter. Her husband, Michael J. Canino, is also retired on disability. He is a former authority board member and chairman of the L.I.R.R. labor council, which represents all of the L.I.R.R. unions.Between their pensions and disability payments, Ms. Lewis and Mr. Canino take in about $280,000 annually, according to estimates based on public records.Mr. Canino could not be reached for comment. On two occasions Ms. Lewis said he was out of town, and he did not return a message left at his house.Walter Kueffner is one manager who didn’t say he was disabled, even though many others around him did.“People claimed they had back problems and carpal tunnel,” said Mr. Kueffner, a former auditor at the railroad. “I am sure some really did, but a lot of healthy people were doing it.”Disability awards were being handed out when he started at the railroad in 1968, and the numbers “got bigger as time went on,” he said. “They don’t reject too many for a disability, you know.”Mr. Kueffner said that while he’s not “a saint,” the thought of claiming disability never crossed his mind for one simple reason: “I didn’t have a disability,” he said. “I was doing a job that people do everywhere. I worked at a desk and I retired in good shape.”'"
"'08-09-21,'0','The good news is that attendance is up more than 30 percent from last year. The bad news: the average home crowd of about 22,000 is still one of the lowest in the majors this season. Only Florida, Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Oakland are worse draws. Tropicana Field’s capacity is 36,048.The Rays managed to sell out just one of the three games against Boston as the teams battled for the American League East lead earlier this week. Vocal Red Sox fans made up a good chunk of those crowds.“Seriously, if the plucky, exciting Tampa Bay Rays make the playoffs, shouldn’t their games be moved to a place where fans actually care about the product?” Steve Buckley, a columnist for The Boston Herald, wrote this week after the Rays drew fewer than 30,000 for the opening game against the Red Sox.The excuses for the malaise are familiar to anyone who had been around for the first 10 seasons of the expansion team when the club finished out of the division basement just once:¶Home for the foreseeable future is an uninspiring dome.¶The stadium is in St. Petersburg, clear across the bay from the population center in Tampa.¶Most people in the area are from somewhere else, meaning the Rays are still creating homegrown fans in their 11th season.“It’s the same reason that attendance has been bad for 11 years here,” said John Romano, a sports columnist for The St. Petersburg Times who grew up in the area. “This is not a great sports market for a lot of different reasons.”Denise Ankenbauer of Clearwater, who was using her parents’ season tickets for Thursday night’s game, said of Tropicana Field: “A lot of it is this place. A lot of people want the outdoor stadium.”The Rays’ principal, owner Stuart Sternberg, remains upbeat. Sternberg, who bought the team three years ago and cleaned house, says fan support will follow the team’s success.“I think the proof will be next year,” he said. “Once people have gotten used to the fact that we’re actually a winning organization and an organization they’re proud of, to see from Day 1 how we hit the ground. If we’re having these conversions next year at this time, I might have a different answer for you.”Players say larger home crowds would be nice but obviously are not necessary to win. The Rays had the best home record in major league baseball entering the weekend.Outfielder Jonny Gomes, who has been in the Rays organization since 2001, said he did not blame the fans for being slow to come around.“You gotta crawl before you can walk,” he said, adding that it was hard to draw fans to a franchise that had never won more than 70 games in a season.“We had a good half, and everyone was begging for fans to come,” Gomes said. “I can understand where they’re coming from.“I think the best thing that can happen for this area is to bring the division title, to bring the playoffs and hopefully bring a World Series here. Will it make it easier if it’s a sold-out house? I don’t know. But it won’t hurt.”'"
"'08-09-21,'0','As excited as Cardinals fans may be about the rookie running back Tim Hightower’s scoring touchdowns in consecutive weeks, it may be time for them to worry about his ability to hold on to the ball.Last week, Hightower, a fifth-round pick who is Edgerrin James’s backup, carried the ball 10 times for 24 yards and a touchdown. But he fumbled once and now has three fumbles in six games as a professional, including preseason games.It is understandable why the Cardinals would want to use Hightower as a goal-line specialist, considering James’s declining skills near the end zone. But James, a former Pro Bowl player, has never had a problem holding on to the ball. In 2005, he fumbled twice in 360 carries and has yet to fumble this season.The Cardinals are facing the Redskins this week, and it is unclear what Arizona should expect. In Week 1, the Giants ran over Washington for 154 yards on 32 carries. But last week, Reggie Bush and the Saints managed only 55 yards on 19 carries.Despite his high draft status and attention-getting nickname of Megatron, Calvin Johnson, below, the Lions’ second-year wide receiver, was not the game-changer last season many had expected. He posted respectable totals of 48 receptions and 756 receiving yards, but after scoring touchdowns in his first two games, he scored only two more in his next 13.In 2008, he again has two touchdowns in two games, but he appears to be arriving as an elite receiver. He is eighth in the league in receptions (13) and second in yardage (236).On Sunday, Johnson faces the 49ers and Mike Martz, the Lions’ offensive coordinator last season and San Francisco’s coordinator this year. But it is unlikely Martz can offer anything that will stop the 6-foot-5, 239-pound Johnson.'"

"'08-09-21,'0','The English Premier League was beginning to look a little red, white and blue last season. There were so many Americans at Fulham in London that the team was dubbed Fulhamerica.But the Yankees have largely gone home. Or elsewhere in Europe.Less than six months after a dozen Americans had spots on rosters in soccer’s wealthiest and most prestigious league, that number has dropped sharply.“It was kind of odd,” said the United States national team and Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard, one of the five Americans still on a Premier League roster. “I don’t know why it happens, it just kind of ebbs and flows that way.”This latest shift can be attributed largely to two things: relegation and the pull of home.Four Americans were on teams that were sent down to the League Championship, England’s second division. Marcus Hahnemann and Bobby Convey are still at Reading this season, while Eddie Lewis and Benny Feilhaber have both left Derby.Brian McBride and Kasey Keller were two of the five Americans at Fulham last season, with McBride the Cottagers’ captain. But both are in their mid-30s and have school-age children. When their contracts ran out at the end of the season, McBride and Keller decided it was time to return to the United States.'"
"'08-09-21,'0','DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — Senator Barack Obama delivered an ominous warning to Florida voters on Saturday, suggesting that Senator John McCain would “gamble with your life savings” by investing Social Security money in private accounts that could be affected by the roiling financial markets.While Mr. McCain has not called for a full privatization of Social Security, he has supported the concept of allowing individuals to invest part of their payroll taxes in stock and bonds, and he has pledged to consider all options to prevent the program from going insolvent. But the idea has taken on a new air of political vulnerability because of the upheaval on Wall Street, which Mr. Obama sought to seize on as his campaign intensified its efforts in Florida.“If my opponent had his way, the millions of Floridians who rely on it would’ve had their Social Security tied up in the stock market this week,” Mr. Obama told an audience here. “How do you think that would have made folks feel? Millions would’ve watched as the market tumbled and their nest egg disappeared before their eyes.”A spokesman for Mr. McCain, Tucker Bounds, accused Mr. Obama of trying to scare voters. In a statement, Mr. Bounds said, “John McCain is 100 percent committed to preserving Social Security benefits for seniors and Barack Obama knows it — this is a desperate attempt to gain political advantage using scare tactics and deceit.”The debate over Social Security, which has been unfolding for weeks between the two candidates, took on fresh urgency as the government on Saturday presented details of a $700 billion rescue of the nation’s financial system. The bailout plan changes the landscape of the presidential race and places the proposals of both candidates under higher scrutiny.'"

Where is the additional transparency essential to reasonably rely on this action and therefore the system?What is the next, as yet unidentified financial crisis to call for a government to bail out? Where will it end?'"
"'08-09-21,'0','Both campaigns see the four debates as pivotal moments in a presidential race that is not only extraordinarily close but also drawing intense interest from voters; roughly 40 million viewers watched the major speeches at the two parties’ conventions. The upheaval in the financial markets has recast the race in recent days, moreover, which both sides believe will only heighten attention for the debates.A commission member said that the new agreement on the vice-presidential debate was reached late Saturday morning. It calls for shorter blocks of candidate statements and open discussion than at the presidential debates.McCain advisers said they were only somewhat concerned about Ms. Palin’s debating skills compared with those of Mr. Biden, who has served six terms in the Senate, or about his chances of tripping her up. Instead, they say, they wanted Ms. Palin to have opportunities to present Mr. McCain’s positions, rather than spending time talking about her experience or playing defense.While the debates between presidential nominees are traditionally the main events in the fall election season, the public interest in Ms. Palin has proved extraordinary, and a large audience is expected for her national debate debut.Indeed, both the McCain and Obama campaigns have similar concerns about the vice-presidential matchup in St. Louis: that Ms. Palin, of Alaska, as a new player in national politics, or Mr. Biden, of Delaware, as a loquacious and gaffe-prone speaker, could commit a momentum-changing misstep in their debate.The negotiations for the three 90-minute debates between the men at the top of the tickets were largely free of brinksmanship. Neither side threatened to pull out, and concerns about camera angles and stagecraft were minor.Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the Democratic nominee for president, and Mr. McCain did not intercede personally to settle any disputes. They agreed to one substantive change to the format originally proposed by the debate commission, giving them two minutes apiece to make a statement at the beginning of each segment on a new topic.Mr. Obama successfully sought to flip the proposed topics for the first and third debates, so foreign policy is now coming first and economic and other domestic issues come last. There is a second debate, in the format of a town hall meeting, in which the candidates will sit on director’s chairs and take questions from the audience and Internet users on any topic.The debate commission had proposed that the first debate be on economic issues and the third on foreign policy — in part, people involved in the process said, because the first debate is usually the most watched, and many voters rank the economy as their top concern.Mr. Obama wanted foreign policy first to show viewers that he could provide depth, strength and intelligence on those issues, his advisers said, given that Mr. McCain consistently wins higher ratings in opinion polls as a potential commander in chief.Mr. Obama wanted domestic issues to come last; advisers said that they believed even before the start of the financial crisis that the election was most likely to turn on the state of the economy and that he wanted the final televised exchange to focus on those concerns. He has argued that Mr. McCain would continue the economic policies of President Bush.Mr. McCain also wanted foreign policy topics to come first in the debates, his aides said, in the hope of capitalizing on his positive reputation on national security issues across party lines.He wanted limits on the original format for the first and third debates, which had been nine topics with nine minutes of free-flowing debate on each one. Mr. Obama went along, though his aides did insist that at least several minutes of open-ended debate occur in each block of questioning, because they believe he does well in that format.Now the candidates will be asked a question, each will give an answer of two minutes or less, and then they will mix it up for five additional minutes before moving on to the next question in the same format.Obama aides also agreed to use lecterns at the first event, which Mr. McCain preferred; at the third debate, the two men will be seated at a round table, in the 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock positions, with the moderator at 6 o’clock.McCain aides said that they were conscious of the fact that Mr. McCain has a prominent scar on one side of his face, and that they could not predict how prominent it would appear with the camera angles, lighting and make-up.The debate formats were negotiated by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, representing the McCain campaign, and Representative Rahm Emanuel, Democrat of Illinois, for the Obama camp. A handful of aides from both camps were also involved, hammering out issues between themselves and then holding conference calls with members of the commission to reach final agreements, people involved in the process said.Mr. Obama plans to begin debate camp on Tuesday with a tight circle of advisers at a site in the Tampa Bay area of Florida, his aides say, with a prominent Democratic lawyer, Greg Craig, playing the part of Mr. McCain in mock debates.The Obama campaign has been studying Mr. McCain’s debate performances from the Republican primary as well as in his 2000 race for president. Each debate has been rated and scored, with briefing points and highlights sent to Mr. Obama.Mr. Obama’s advisers have been studying in particular Mr. McCain’s temperament and mood and looking for potential flash points of anger.Mr. McCain, his advisers say, has yet to spend much time watching the dozens of primary debate performances of Mr. Obama over the last two years. But they said that a small staff of aides had been reviewing them and that Mr. McCain would see some highlights next week.McCain aides refused to say when his debate camp would be or where, or who was playing Mr. Obama or Mr. Biden. (Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, Democrat of Michigan, is playing Ms. Palin for Mr. Biden’s preparations.)Mr. Obama plans to sequester himself and a few advisers at his debate camp. The attendance is limited to a small group of foreign policy advisers, each rotating in for separate sessions with Mr. Obama and Mr. Craig.The choice of Florida, particularly the politically critical region near Tampa, was selected with a dual purpose in mind. While Mr. Obama will have few public events from Tuesday through Friday, aides said, his presence could draw considerable local news media attention in a state where he hopes to fiercely challenge Mr. McCain.While the intense portion of debate training begins on Tuesday, Mr. Obama has been preparing for weeks, in part by drawing upon his experience debating Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York in the Democratic primaries. His aides have been studying those debate performances to address one of his biggest shortcomings: his ability to deliver a tight answer. Already, his campaign is trying to diminish expectations for Mr. Obama’s performance.“Despite the fact that we got the chance to do this a lot during the primaries, these debates are not by any stretch of the imagination his strong suit,” said Robert Gibbs, a senior strategist to Mr. Obama. “He likes to talk about a problem, give some examples that addresses some solutions and oftentimes that doesn’t fit into the moderator’s allotted time.”The campaigns had no say over the choice of moderators — Jim Lehrer of PBS, Tom Brokaw of NBC and Bob Schieffer of CBS for the presidential debates, and Gwen Ifill of PBS for the vice-presidential debate.“Everything matters and issues can always come up, such as the size of podiums — like for Carter and Ford in 1976 — to the timer lights if the candidate doesn’t like them,” said Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist who advised Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004. “There hasn’t really been a ‘debate about the debates’ this year, but that can change in a minute.”'"
"'08-09-21,'0','Some question the prudence of adding to the nation’s overall debt at a time when the Treasury relies on the largess of foreigners to cover the bills. Even so, there is wide agreement that a broad intervention like the one Treasury is proposing is necessary.“It goes a long way; it ameliorates it very substantially,” said Alan S. Blinder, an economist at Princeton and a former vice chairman of the board of governors at the Federal Reserve, who has said for months that the government must step in forcefully to buy mortgage-linked investments.“We’re deep into Alice in Wonderland’s rabbit hole,” Mr. Blinder said.But significant skepticism confronts the plan. Under a proposal circulating Saturday, the Treasury could spend as much as $700 billion to buy mortgage-linked investments, then sell what it can as it works out the messy details of the loans. But no one really knows what this cosmically complex web of finance will be worth, making the final price tag for the taxpayer unknowable. One may just as well try to predict the weather three years from Tuesday.Also, what message does that send to the next investment bank caught up in the next speculative bubble and contemplating the risks of jumping in while wondering who is ultimately on the hook if things go awry?Many economists say such questions are beside the point. The nation is gripped by the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Before Thursday night, when the Treasury secretary, the Federal Reserve chairman and leaders on Capitol Hill proclaimed their intentions to take over bad debts, the prognosis for the American financial system was sliding from grim toward potentially apocalyptic.“It looked like we might be falling into the abyss,” Mr. Blinder said.As the details of the government’s plans are hashed out, no hallelujah chorus is wafting across Washington, down Wall Street or through the glistening condominiums of the nation. Too many households are having trouble paying their mortgages. Too many people are out of work. Too many banks are bloodied.Still, the prospect that the government is preparing to wade in deep — perhaps sparing families from foreclosure and banks from insolvency — has muted talk of the most dire possibilities: a severe shortage of credit that would crimp the availability of finance for many years, effectively halting economic growth.“The risk of ending up like Japan, with 10 years of stagnation, is now much lessened,” said Nouriel Roubini, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University. “The recession train has left the station, but it’s going to be 18 months instead of five years.”If the plan works, it will attack the central cause of American economic distress: the continued plunge in housing prices. If banks resumed lending more liberally, mortgages would become more readily available. That would give more people the wherewithal to buy homes, lifting housing prices or at least preventing them from falling further. This would prevent more mortgage-linked investments from going bad, further easing the strain on banks. As a result, the current downward spiral would end and start heading up.“It’s easy to forget amid all the fancy stuff — credit derivatives, swaps — that the root cause of all this is declining house prices,” Mr. Blinder said. “If you can reverse that, then people start coming out of their foxholes and start putting their money in places they have been too afraid to put it.”For many Americans, the events that have transfixed and horrified Wall Street in recent days — the disintegration of supposedly impregnable institutions, government bailouts with 11-figure price tags — have been less stunning than inscrutable. The headlines proclaim that the taxpayer now owns the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, along with the liabilities of a mysterious colossus called the American Insurance Group, which, as it happens, insures against corporate defaults. Much like the human appendix, these were organs whose existence was only dimly evident to many until the pain began.Yet these institutions are deeply intertwined with the American economy. When the financial system is in danger, it stops investing and lending, depriving people of financing for homes, cars and education. Businesses cannot borrow to start up and expand.“Wall Street isn’t this island to itself,” said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute. “Even people with good credit histories are having a very hard time getting loans at terms that make sense. If that gets worse, we’re going to be stuck in the doldrums for a very long time, because that directly blocks healthy economic activity.”The financial crisis gripping the United States is the direct outgrowth of the speculative orgy in real estate that began early this decade. Once home values began falling two years ago, the financial institutions that had poured capital into real estate confronted a very big problem.Over the last year, one financial giant after another has written off billions of dollars worth of mortgage-linked investments. Some have succumbed to the storm. In March, the investment bank Bear Stearns nearly collapsed before JPMorgan Chase bought it at a fire-sale price. This month, the government effectively nationalized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — government-backed mortgage companies that together guarantee $5 trillion in American mortgages.Last week, Merrill Lynch — a name synonymous with Wall Street — found itself forced to pawn itself off to Bank of America. Lehman Brothers, an investment banking giant, collapsed into bankruptcy. Worries now hover over other banks.“It may not be over,” said Mr. Blinder, the former Fed vice chairman.Some say the tightening of credit is an unavoidable corrective. For a quarter-century, the American economy has gorged itself on borrowed money, from the speculative investments that created the dot-com boom to the exuberant borrowing that made houses in Las Vegas trade like technology stocks.“Credit was too easy for too long, and now it’s a little tighter,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wachovia in Charlotte, N.C. “It’s a necessary though painful correction.”Others say that in the last few weeks, the profligate era of easy money had swung to the opposite extreme: a widespread reluctance to lend.“The danger is swinging from far too risk-friendly to far too risk-averse,” Mr. Bernstein said.The economy has shed roughly 600,000 jobs since the beginning of the year. If healthy companies cannot get their hands on financing, they will not be able to expand and hire.“What we’re looking at now is simply an amplified version of what we’ve been in since last August,” Mr. Bernstein added. “You’re witnessing a sudden death instead of a slow bleed.”The impact of the pullback among banks was evident in the interest rates banks pay other banks to borrow money short-term. Traditionally, banks charge one another a little more than 0.2 percentage point over the rate on the safest investment, United States Treasury bills. But on Friday that spread was more than two percentage points, meaning a bank must pay an enormous premium to persuade another to part with its money.And still no one knows the extent of the carnage. The financial system has acknowledged roughly $400 billion in losses so far, Mr. Roubini estimates, yet as much as another $1.1 trillion may be lying in wait.As the government steps in to take over bad debts, it is aiming to clear away the detritus and lift the uncertainty, emboldening banks to lend anew. Whether it will work in the long term is a question that awaits reaction from investors. But even the most skeptical economists say this is the path the government must take for confidence to crystallize that a genuine fix is under way.“It’s not enough,” Mr. Roubini said. “But it’s the first time they have done something that makes a difference.”'"
"'08-09-21,'0','The plan to buy $700 billion in troubled assets with taxpayer money was shaped by two men who did not know each other until two years ago and did not travel in the same circles, but now find themselves brought together by history. If Mr. Bernanke is the intellectual force and Mr. Paulson the action man of this unlikely tandem, they have managed to create a nearly seamless partnership as they rush to stop the financial upheaval and keep the economy afloat.Befitting their roles and personalities, Mr. Paulson has become the public face of their team — he plans to appear on four Sunday talk shows — while the less visible Mr. Bernanke provides the historical underpinnings for their strategy.Along the way, they have cast aside the administration’s long-held views about regulation and government involvement in private business, even reversing decisions over the space of 24 hours and justifying them as practical solutions to dire threats.“There are no atheists in foxholes and no ideologues in financial crises,” Mr. Bernanke told colleagues last week, according to one meeting participant.The improvisational nature of their effort has turned President Bush and Congressional Democrats into virtual bystanders, sometimes uncertain about what comes next and left to wonder about the new power dynamics in the capital. Seemingly every time lawmakers tried to get a handle on what was happening and what role they might play with elections around the corner, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke would show up again on Capitol Hill for another evening meeting with another surprise development.The two men have been working early and working late, tracking Asian markets and fielding calls from their European counterparts, then reconnecting with each other by phone eight or nine times a day, talking so often that they speak in shorthand. Mr. Paulson has powered through the long days with a steady infusion of Diet Coke. Asked twice to testify by the Senate last week, he begged off.“He told me he had like four hours of sleep,” said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Banking Committee. But there were limits to Mr. Dodd’s sympathy. “The public wants to know what’s going on,” he said he replied.Mr. Bernanke (his drink: Diet Dr Pepper) has made a point of leaving the office by midnight to get at least some rest, but friends say the toll on him is clear as well. Alan S. Blinder, a longtime friend and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, recalled seeing Mr. Bernanke at a conference last month in Jackson Hole, Wyo. “He looked like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders,” Mr. Blinder said.And that was before last week.Mr. Bernanke took office in February 2006 and Mr. Paulson five months later, both Republicans and Bush appointees, yet arriving from starkly different places. Mr. Bernanke, 54, had managed the academic politics of the Princeton economics department, where he served as chairman, by developing a conciliator’s style. Mr. Paulson, 62, rose to the top of Goldman Sachs by pounding the phones, and the occasional table.“Hank is just the most hyperactive, get-it-done kind of guy who’s always trying to get the problem solved and move on. He’s impatient to fix things,” said Allan B. Hubbard, a former national economic adviser to Mr. Bush. “Ben is much more low-key. He’s very thoughtful. He’s an incredible thinker, listens well, analyzes well and is not intimidated by anyone. It’s probably a great pair.”While Mr. Bernanke talks in lofty terms and Mr. Paulson speaks in great bursts of Wall Street jock language, the new Washington odd couple bonded in part over baseball. The Treasury secretary is a Chicago Cubs fan and the Fed chairman is a Boston Red Sox fan who has adopted the Washington Nationals and shares season tickets with the White House chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten.But neither Mr. Paulson nor Mr. Bernanke has been deeply involved in the political process before. As they try to navigate Washington together, they have surrounded themselves respectively with advisers drawn from Goldman and career professionals at the Fed.Mr. Paulson initially declined to join the cabinet. He changed his mind only after extensive lobbying by Mr. Bolten, a former Goldman executive, and commitments by Mr. Bush to let him truly run economic policy, unlike his predecessors. The Hammer, as Mr. Paulson has been called since his days on the Dartmouth football squad, brought to Washington his characteristic intensity.“He is a hurricane. He is used to living in a turbulent world,” said John H. Bryan Jr., a close friend and former chief executive of the Sara Lee Corporation. “He has lived in a world of deadlines, decisions and pressure-packed things.”Mr. Paulson, a Christian Scientist, does not drink or smoke. Once, at a cocktail party where he was giving a speech, recalled Andrew M. Alper, a former Goldman colleague, Mr. Paulson accidentally took a gulp from a glass of vodka, thinking it was water. His face turned bright red and his eyes were watering for an hour. “He just kept going,” Mr. Alper said. “It did not slow him down.”Mr. Bernanke has a more obscure nickname, Helicopter Ben, after a speech he gave in 2002 in which he talked about the Fed’s “helicopter drops” of emergency money to keep the system liquid. For Mr. Bernanke, the current crisis is the culmination of a lifetime of figuring how the system works from a theoretical viewpoint.Mr. Bernanke made clear long ago that he realized he might someday be called on to act on his studies. Vincent R. Reinhart, a former Fed official, said Mr. Bernanke’s research into Japan’s financial crisis in the 1990s reinforced his view that the government had to be aggressive in intervening during market crises.And at a party he had in 2002 to honor the 90th birthday of Milton Friedman, the famed economist, Mr. Bernanke, then a governor of the Federal Reserve, brought up the mistakes the nation made in the face of the Depression and promised not to repeat them. “We did it,” he said then. “We won’t do it again.”Mr. Paulson, in the interview Friday, said that Mr. Bernanke had long warned that a moment might come like the one they saw last week.“Going back a long time, maybe a year ago, Ben, as a world-class economist, said to me, ‘When you look at the housing bubble and the correction, if the price decline was significant enough,’ ” the only solution might be a large-scale government intervention, Mr. Paulson said. “He talked about what had happened when there had been other situations historically.”Mr. Paulson said he agreed but hoped it would not come to that. “I knew he was right theoretically,” he said. “But I also had, and we both did, some hope that, with all the liquidity out there from investors, that after a certain decline that we would reach a bottom.”He was also hearing as late as last Monday from senior Democratic and Republican lawmakers, including Steny H. Hoyer, the House majority leader, and Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, that there was no chance Congress would adopt any legislation before it planned to leave town in September. Even Representative Barney Frank, a proponent of a greater role for the government in the market, said on Monday that the issue would have to be resolved by the next president and the new Congress next year.By Tuesday, however, the troubles were only deepening. Lehman Brothers had declared bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch had agreed to be bought by Bank of America and A.I.G. was on the verge of collapse. Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke put together an $85 billion bailout of A.I.G. and presented it to Mr. Bush.But the two warned the president that it might not be enough to stabilize the broader crisis. A senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, paraphrased their message to Mr. Bush this way: “There may still be problems after this, and if there are, we’ll come back to you.”They did, two days later, after plunging stock prices and frozen credit markets made clear the case-by-case strategy was not working. Mr. Paulson had been talking with Mr. Bush by telephone throughout Wednesday and early Thursday. The decision to finally take a radical, systemwide step came after an endless stream of conference calls involving Fed, Treasury and Securities and Exchange Commission officials, one participant recalled, when Mr. Bernanke said: “We have got to go to Congress.” Mr. Paulson concurred.On Thursday afternoon, the two men, along with Christopher Cox, the S.E.C. chairman, went to the White House to explain their plan. “The president said, ‘Let’s do it,’ ” an official said. “There was no hesitation.”Within hours, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke were in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, briefing Congressional leaders on how bleak the situation was. Lawmakers were shaken but offered tentative support. Torn by conflicting imperatives to take action and to go home to campaign, they seemed alternately grateful and resentful of the new power couple in Washington. Some referred to “President Paulson” and others groused about an unelected central bank chairman doling out hundreds of billions of dollars.Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke came under fire for being too aggressive and for not being aggressive enough. Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, said they were killing the free market. R. Glenn Hubbard, former chairman of Mr. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, said they should have acted sooner.“The opportunity to have taken bold action would obviously have been better had they done it months ago,” he said. “But better late than never.”In the end, what left so many lawmakers and economists frustrated was the sense that no one had a better idea. So they waited for Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke to give them more details about what they wanted to do.'"

"'08-09-21,'0','Other than the veal piccata, the second courses I sampled were disappointing. Grilled wild Canadian salmon had the dense flesh of a fish that had swum freely, but coarse black pepper distracted from the salmon’s mild flavor. (I did like the beautiful small vegetables, sautéed in a little butter, that came with it.) Dainty pan-roasted chicken with rosemary sauce made a pretty presentation, but fell short of being memorable.As courses arrive, diners might find themselves asking a perfectly reasonable question: Does the food I’m eating justify the stiff tariff? I ordered the insalata primavera, which despite its hackneyed reference to spring, promised “seasonal greens with seasonal vegetables.” It proved a delightful, wholesome show of tiny mixed greens; slim, snappy green beans; fresh-shucked corn; tart green apples; nutty Pecorino cheese; and mellow vinaigrette. Fifteen dollars? Worth every cent.And those silken folds of San Daniele prosciutto ornamented with sugar-sweet ribbons of cantaloupe made to look like a perfect damask rose? Twenty-two dollars? Who’s counting? But this muddy-tasting branzino with its sticky, over-rich mustard cream sauce — $36? Call my lawyer!In all fairness, there are a few things I’d go back for, especially if someone else pays. To start, I’d order the beautiful, milky mozzarella and organic tomato wedges drizzled with fruity olive oil. Or I’d choose the full-flavored breasola, served with wisps of arugula and generous shavings of parmigiano. I might also opt for the earthy black-eyed beans tossed with shrimp and brightened with lemon. And a side of crispy roasted new potatoes would definitely be in order.Pastas are the most attractively priced offerings on the menu. Potato gnocchi the size of minimarshmallows were a little tough, but tossed with peppery arugula and crunchy shrimp, they made an honest dish. The “signature” lasagna was simple and satisfying. But where was the lemon in the tagliolini al limone? All but devoid of its namesake ingredient, the dish was mostly about heavy cream. Risotto with radicchio and green peas — a special — was all about pungent, overripe gorgonzola.Pacing was a problem. Antipasti came in a hurry, but pastas lagged behind. After a long hiatus, a side dish arrived and sat alone on the table for a full five minutes before second courses materialized, by which time we’d drunk the glasses of wine we’d hoped to pair with them.The wine list, with its broad selection of wines by the glass, covers Italy from the Sud Tirol to Sicily. By the glass, I liked the 2006 Lagrein rosé from Alois Lageder, with its strawberry and rhubarb notes ($11); the steely 2004 Greco di Tufo “Cutizzi” from Feudi di San Gregorio ($15); and the ripe plum flavors of the 2003 Chianti Classico Riserva from Vigna Vecchia ($11).Desserts — a roll of the dice — included an achingly sweet lemon meringue tart and a lychee semifreddo frozen hard as a rock. Others drew raves: the deep, dark, warm-chocolate soufflé with preserved cherries tucked inside; a warm pear glazed with honey and grappa, served with dreamy hazelnut gelato; buttery peach tart; and tiramisù — a huge, square portion — light-textured and brazenly rich.THE SPACE Milan comes to White Plains, with terrazzo floors, vintage Italian posters, brocade banquettes and a rain forest’s worth of orchids. Most of the tables are well spaced; a few are far too close.THE CROWD Spirited, well dressed and presumably well heeled. Service was mostly friendly and professional; one waitress showed impatience with a diner’s indecisiveness but was also on top of the details.THE BAR Specialty cocktails ($12 to $14) include a particularly good blue mojito made with Bacardi rum, Hpnotiq liqueur, lime juice, brown sugar and strong mint. The bar menu features assorted cheeses and cured meats.THE BILL Antipasti, $13.50 to $22. Pasta, $16 to $25. Entrees, $36 to $42.

"'08-09-21,'0','And, yes, the money was good.But after the seismic disruptions in the financial sector last week, she is not sure the Wall Street life will be quite the same any time soon, if ever.“The business is going to change,” said Ms. Wong, whose position selling mortgage-backed securities for UBS was eliminated in the spring. “There are just going to be far fewer people doing this, and far fewer clients to take out. Even if you do have clients to take out, you’re not going to be spending as much out. This is definitely going to suck the fun out of the industry.”And perhaps not only the fun.The most recent generation of strivers on Wall Street — those in their 20s — are too young to remember the last recession and too new to the business world to have experienced the dot-com bust or the post-9/11 gloom. They arrived in a New York boomtown: money was seemingly being minted in the hedge-fund and private-equity sectors; investment banks were paying gigantic bonuses.For them, Wall Street was mythic terrain. For people with the conqueror gene, its outsized risks and rewards seemed like a personal challenge, a peak to be scaled.Now, Wall Street is more like “Survivor.” Thousands of layoffs loom as the industry shrinks and consolidates. And even when recovery comes — presuming it does — traders and bankers said profits would most likely be lower, deals fewer, bonuses minuscule and regulation greater.A result may be a more subdued Wall Street, one where professionals make a comfortable living but where the enormous payouts and outrageous bravado have faded. If so, this cultural shift could change not only the industry, but New York, which has adapted to a quarter-century-long (if occasionally interrupted) financial boom.“There was so much optimism, so much froth,” said Delilah Rothenberg, 25, who now works at a private equity firm in Manhattan; she was an associate at Bear Stearns until that firm imploded in March. Even recently, she added, investment professionals in their 20s “were buying all kinds of luxuries on credit because they expected the money to keep coming in: watches, cars, apartments, boats.”In recent years, compensation packages soared “by double-digit rates, which of course created an impression of impregnability,” said Adam Zoia, a managing partner of Glocap Search, a New York-based recruiter.As recently as last year, a first-year investment banking analyst on Wall Street made $125,000 to $150,000, including bonuses, according to Options Group, a recruiting and consulting firm based in New York. An investment banking associate, which is one rung above that, made $250,000 to $300,000.“Bonuses will be substantially lower in investment banking as well as many other areas,” said Michael Karp, the company’s chief executive. The people who once browsed Porsche showrooms may simply be happy to have a job, any job.And so is the compact that young bankers make with themselves: punishing workweeks for huge pay down the road.“The whole glamour of investment banking is that you’re going to earn so much money that in the end it’s going to be worth it,” said a 22-year-old former JPMorgan Chase analyst who was laid off in May and later found work at a private equity firm, but only after going to nearly 40 interviews. “If you get rid of the bonus, then there’s basically no point.”Young traders and bankers were willing to endure brutal hours and high stress to taste a rarefied New York life, said Dr. Rosalind S. Dorlen, a clinical psychologist in Summit, N.J., who said she sees a large number of Wall Street workers in her practice.“There is something nice about being king,” Dr. Dorlen said, describing the mind-set of young Wall Street players. “The sense of power, the sense of omnipotence, the sense of testosterone. What other reason are people attracted to being an investment banker than to flex muscles? It’s ‘Whose wallet is larger?’ ”Such swagger meant that Wall Street hotshots were never beloved figures on New York’s cultural landscape. It’s no coincidence that the protagonists of books and movies like “The Bonfire of the Vanities” and “American Psycho” tended to be narcissistic jerks, or worse.But New York’s Gordon Gekkos played a crucial role in reinventing New York in the 1970s, when even the city’s champions wondered if the nearly bankrupt city was going to go the way of Detroit, said Kurt Andersen, the writer and a co-founder Spy magazine at the height of the 1980s Wall Street boom.“If you look at two things, other than the ineffable spirit of New Yorkers, that made the city better again, you look at police and crime, and prosperity,” Mr. Andersen said. “And in speaking about prosperity, we’re talking about the tremendous sums of money that, despite 1987 and 2000, kept gushing into the city thanks to the people wearing yellow ties.”Wall Street’s highfliers helped rebrand the city in the eyes of the world, Mr. Andersen said, from a tired postindustrial necropolis to a sleek 21st-century financial dynamo.And that is the city today. Or it was.Even before the recent carnage, the city’s financial services sector had shed about 9,200 jobs from September 2007 to June, according to the state comptroller’s office. Industry analysts predict that thousands more may disappear after the meltdowns at Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. And even the leading Wall Street minds seem to have no idea when the industry might rebound; at the depths of the crisis last week 2010 sounded like an optimistic estimate.And that makes business students very wary. “There’s a certain scary factor that’s come into this,” said Roy C. Smith, a professor at the New York University Stern School of Business and a former general partner of Goldman Sachs. “My students have a stunned look in their eyes.”Steven Song, 29, who started as an analyst at a Manhattan investment bank in 2001 and recently left a job at a hedge fund, runs a volunteer organization that provides mentoring and guidance to college undergraduates who aspire to work in finance. He said that several students he works with expressed reservations last week about pursuing jobs on Wall Street because of a perceived lack of opportunities.“There are fewer banks that are out there now, and each one that’s out there remaining is hiring fewer people,” he said.One top student recently asked him for a “list of smaller, boutique investment banks and brokerage firms instead of going for big-name shops,” he said. “In previous years that would never be the case unless you were a quote-unquote marginal candidate.”Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers could once be counted on to hire 20 to 30 graduates from the M.B.A. program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, a spokeswoman for the university said. Those graduates will now have to look elsewhere, said Gautam Tambay, 26, a first-year student in the program, “so there just aren’t as many opportunities anymore.”Another M.B.A. student said that students were starting to wonder where they would find jobs to pay off their student loans. So, imagine legions of M.B.A.’s pinching pennies to pay off student loans. That will change New York as we know it.“New York’s going to take a big hit,” said Bryan Gunderson, 28, a former investment banker for Lehman Brothers. “This city is priced for people who work on Wall Street. It’s ridiculous that cocktails cost $15 in New York.”The 23-year-old Wall Street phenoms who are used to spending $300 or more for a bottle of vodka at a West Chelsea nightclub, he said, are “going to have to tone it back.”Tom Wolfe, the author of “The Bonfire of the Vanities,” said that “if Wall Street really does take a hard shot, it will diminish the image of New York as capital of the Western world.”But then, Wall Street — and the fantasyland it helped create in New York — was likely to shrink even without a credit crisis.“I hate to use the phrase ‘masters of the universe,’ but they’re not in investment banking anymore, they’re in hedge funds,” Mr. Wolfe said. And “hedge funds don’t need glass office towers. They can run $15 billion with 25 people” in the leafy suburban sanctuaries where their directors live.“The new Wall Street,” he said, “is Greenwich, Conn.”In a possible indication of night life to come, Mr. Gunderson and his girlfriend invited friends to their West Village apartment last week to “party like it’s 1929.”“If all the radio stations were playing big band music and this message were headed your way through the main switchboard, I would swear this was the Great Depression,” the invitation read.“Unless you just lost your job,” the invitation continued, “or your fund is down more than 20 percent, please bring beer or booze.”'"
"'08-09-21,'0','I was sitting on my father’s lap listening to a Yankee game on our old Philco radio. It was 1948 and I suddenly realized I was a Yankee fan. The team was headed for a dismal third-place finish. I was 7, and there was nothing to do but wait for 1949 and the new Yankee manager, Casey Stengel.I was standing in a subway car, holding my dad’s hand when the train emerged from the tunnel, climbed the elevated tracks, and I saw Yankee Stadium for the first time. How beautiful! The emerald green grass, the old-fashioned white facade and the dots of color that were the fans in their seats. We were in the left-field bleachers and the colors seemed even more intense, the grass a bluer green, the pinstripes dazzling and the ball a white rocket that shot from the hands of the outfielders playing long toss.We were playing the Indians and DiMaggio was returning to the lineup after an injury. As he approached the plate, the crowd was thumping. At the crack of the bat everyone around me stood to watch the ball’s trajectory. I couldn’t see a thing. It was a home run. I stood on my seat as Joe rounded third. I’d like to play in Yankee Stadium, I thought.“Just lay it in there,” I told Artie. “I want to see how far I can hit it.” It was 1968, the year Mickey Mantle retired and “Mrs. Robinson” was nominated for a Grammy. Simon and Garfunkel had gotten permission to make a video at Yankee Stadium. As an ex-high school baseball player (all-Queens second team), I was eager to test my left-handed swing against the fabled “short porch” in right field. After fouling off a couple of pitches I finally hit one on the screws, as they say. The ball arced gracefully and landed in what could be charitably called medium right field, about 250 feet from home. Porch not short enough. Stickball was really my game anyway.1988. Would Mickey Mantle be willing to play stickball in a music video of “Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard”? Calls were made. Feelers put out. Yes! The Mick would do it but was demanding $1,500 and a limo from his hotel. We met at a playground at 46th and 10th, and for a good hour I got to play stickball with Mickey Mantle. Did I thank him as he eased his aching knees into the limo? Profusely. Did I mention that I spent countless hours imitating his style of running? No, I was too embarrassed, but the photo of the two of us is one of my treasures.A month after DiMaggio’s death I was standing in center field with Bernie Williams. It was a few hours before the unveiling of the Yankee Clipper’s monument before 53,000 fans. I asked Williams, the Yankee center fielder, how it felt to view the three-tiered majesty of the Stadium from his vantage point. He replied, “It’s a little like looking at the Grand Canyon.”'"
"'08-09-21,'0','Since the 1960s Jamaican musicians have been recycling rhythm tracks, called riddims. The success of a riddim is judged by how many artists “juggle,” or make their own vocal interpretations, of it. Marked by a tension between sparse, punching jabs of sound and lush snatches of melody, Stephen’s riddims are so popular that more than a dozen people might sing over them; his thematically linked riddims have their own compilations on the top reggae label, VP Records.Stephen’s skills are also propelling the careers of the lanky, dashing Chino, whose slightly abstracted air suggests constant mental wordplay, and Shema, whose rich voice and cameo features recall her mother, Judy Mowatt of Bob Marley’s backing trio, the I Three. Shema was in a band with Damian (Jr. Gong) Marley, Bob’s son, and she is now working on her own album, to be released this year on Big Ship Records.Their father, Freddie McGregor, has been a star since he was a child, recording in the early 1960s for the Studio One label, where Bob Marley was an artist and in-house arranger. “I remember how Bob kept on saying, ‘We must have our own studio, our own thing,’ ” he recalled. “When I recorded songs for different producers, I always wished I owned them. I knew I had to take a chance and build my own studio.” He finally started Big Ship in 1996.Stephen gravitated to the studio when he was a little boy. “If we saw the door was open, we’d know Stephen was in there,” Freddie said. “He was just so short you couldn’t see him over the mixing desk.""By the age of 7 Stephen had taught himself to play keyboards, bass, guitar and violin. But his prodigy status was cemented even earlier: he wrote and released his first song, “School Done Rule,” when he was 5. That was Stephen’s sole foray as an artist; he prefers the producer’s role. ""It’s psychological, dealing with all the different egos and attitudes,"" he said. Clearly, his laid-back but cheery demeanor can coax the best out of artists ranging from the suave Sean Paul to gangster ragamuffins like Vybz Kartel and Mavado.Stephen’s “whole energy is fresh,” Sean Paul said, “and I feel excited to work with a new sound and a new crazy young talent like him.”Stephen had his first hits in Jamaica in 2004, while he was still attending the prestigious Ardennes High School; a local D.J. gave him the nickname Di Genius. “I never spoke about my music at school, except to my closest friends,” Stephen said.Tactfully Stephen won’t identify the big reggae star who promised to sing on his first professional production — and then brushed him off. Instead, on a whim, he and Chino drove to the cassata-colored mansion of the zany reggae star Elephant Man, higher up the Havendale hills. He gave Stephen a break and became the first of about 15 vocalists to put their stamp on his “Cartoon” riddim.With its cheeky samples of the flatulent trumpet sound familiar from old Warner Brothers animations, “Cartoon” was whimsical, surprising and like no other reggae track. It was followed by a string of hit riddims. “In Jamaica if you do something different that’s working, as soon as one person hears it the whole industry wants to be on it,” Stephen said.Jamaican dancehall, the quintessential sound of the young McGregors’ generation, is far removed from the spiritually oriented conscious reggae of 1970s artists like their father and Marley. Many of the lyrics of Stephen’s songs with Mavado and Vybz Kartel are brutally violent.Perhaps Stephen’s appeal to the American hip-hop audience is the way he projects urban tension and alarm. The somber “Darkness” riddims, with titles like “Shadow,” “Darker Shadow” and “After Dark,” sound almost frightening when heard at bone-shaking volume at a bashment, or street dance.Still, Stephen’s key attribute is his versatility. He has worked with the Hasidic reggae artist Matisyahu. He delivers sweet lover’s rock songs for his father (“Sharing the Night”) and radio-ready pop reggae for Chino (“Ruff It Up”), and the siblings’ collaborations tend more toward happy hedonism. “Our ‘Red Bull and Guinness’ riddim actually became a big movement in Jamaica,” Chino said. “Sales of Champagne slowed down.”Another alcohol-infused McGregor hit was “Ghetto Whiskey,” named after a Jamaican tipple of Guinness, Stone’s Ginger Wine, Red Bull and Magnum Tonic Wine. “It proved the power of music,” Chino said. “People didn’t know if it would poison them, but they had to try it.”Whether sweet, funny or ominous, Stephen McGregor’s sound palette is always fine-tuned by his domestic think tank. “We have a support system here because we’re family,” he said with a laugh. “More heads are better than one.”'"
"'08-09-21,'0','Given the difficulty of calculating ratings Webwide, the viewership for these lectures is typically gauged by how they perform on iTunes U, where each video must be fully downloaded (and not merely clicked on) before it earns a popularity point. The top of the iTunes U chart features some self-help fluff on abs and guitar instruction, but it also brims with provocative titles like “How Did Hannibal Cross the Alps?” by Patrick Hunt of Stanford (audio only); “String Theory: What Is It Good For?” by Sera Cremonini of the University of Michigan; and “What Makes a Terrorist?” by Alan B. Krueger of Princeton (also audio only).Recently, I set out to learn something — anything, as long as it was a little bit impressive — from lecture videos online. Though some of the audio-only tracks on iTunes U interested me, I chose to focus on lectures I could also watch. I didn’t know how to be systematic, so I wasn’t. Instead, I watched lectures that seemed prestigious, popular, both and neither; I followed my interests and I followed other peoples’ interests. I got a particular kick out of seeing lecturers — like Harvey Mansfield of Harvard — that I’d heard were legendary and whose disquisitions I’d insecurely imagined as conspiratorial meetings in which it was formally decided that those present were truly educated and the rest of us weren’t. And so, finally, I would be in on the secrets! And truly educated! Herewith, the five charisma-senseis that no online student should miss.Why lecture at all? Why not just make students buy your book? Take one look at Walter H. G. Lewin, a professor of physics at M.I.T., and you’ll never ask again. Lewin, a prizewinning teacher, has proved to be box-office gold since his courses went online in 2003, as part of M.I.T.’s pioneering OpenCourseWare project. And it’s no accident that he’s a virtuoso at teaching: he evidently refines those lectures — on subjects like rainbows, pendulums and rocketry — as if they were mathematical proofs. He cuts every extraneous word and streamlines the stagecraft until what’s left is a 50-minute pedagogical masterpiece.Replete with seemingly off-the-cuff asides and anecdotes, each Lewin lecture is actually 25 hours in the making, during which Lewin decides when exactly to write on the board, to physically demonstrate something, to recruit a student or to make a joke. The series is a sharp, potent teaching weapon, one that sliced to ribbons even this humanities student’s resistance to physics, mathematics and hard science.Lewin, a rangy and good-looking 70-something who onstage has the physicality of a much younger man, could be played by Ralph Fiennes or Ed Harris. His decisive chalk strokes on the rolling, multilayer M.I.T. chalkboards alone manage to turn high-level numeracy into a tennislike sport: something requiring aggression, hand-eye coordination and laserlike focus. But not only does Lewin convey enthusiasm for his subject — a “Dead Poets Society” talent that perhaps ought to be superfluous in a nuclear physicist speaking to the best and the brightest — but he also empowers his students by demonstrating the way of the physicist and assuming you can walk it with him. Watching the lectures, I keenly wanted to rise to Lewin’s confidence; I dredged up anything I could possible remember about high-level math and used it to follow his demonstrations. Sometimes, I got lost. But always I felt both smart and challenged. And prepared, as the next lecture rolled, to try again.For months I resisted the hugely popular “Last Lecture” of Randy Pausch, who was a computer-science professor at Carnegie Mellon until he died of pancreatic cancer in July. I worried that the spiel, which later became a book called “The Last Lecture,” would be too inspirational, too elegiac, too sad. Too Tony Robbins. It wouldn’t qualify, in short, as an academic lecture. But once I set the video rolling, I changed my mind before Pausch finished his opening thank-yous.Most striking, Pausch embodies a particularly American professorial ideal. Looking like an off-duty fighter pilot in a polo shirt, early on he drops and gives the audience some one-armed push-ups. No lecture in a cultural-studies course could sum up as succinctly the American charisma-sensei with his real-world experience, his conversational style and his commitment to “fun.” (That holy word turns up so many times I lost count. Toward the end, Pausch, who knew at the time he had only months to live, sums up his approach to computer science, saying, “I’m dying and I’m having fun.”)What’s more, the image of the American educator-salesman is a great global export. Students in Asia, facing the riddle of admission to good college and post-collegiate programs, especially in the sciences, may well find Pausch’s combination of bona fide academic achievement, nerdy humor, personal disclosure and tech evangelism inspiring in the way of George Lucas or Bill Gates — other highly decorated mavericks who talk without irony about following dreams. (At least one of Pausch’s lectures is already available in Chinese translation.)In Pausch’s case, however, the American idea of dreams-becoming-reality takes on a curiously nonmetaphorical dimension, since his academic specialty was virtual reality, the literal encoding and reification of fantasies. His enthusiastic tales of working at Disney designing rides and starting a course at Carnegie Mellon called “Building Virtual Worlds” are at bottom little more than adventures in alliance building and bureaucracy avoiding. But his capacity to find opportunities for heroism in institutional politics is surprisingly moving — and quite enough to make an aspiring engineer, here or abroad, resolve to vanquish naysayers or software bugs and turn his most arcane mental pleasures into chances for profit and laurels.Dan Ariely had a revelation while bedridden after a horrible accident that burned 70 percent of his body. His nurses, wonderfully caring people who knew well the science of burns, nonetheless subjected him to unnecessary agony, he decided, because they believed that bandages ought to be torn off quickly, when — as his subsequent research showed — most people prefer low-grade pain at length to high-intensity pain for short spurts. This revelation, and the subsequent making of a “behavioral economist,” which is what Ariely now is — he teaches at both Duke and M.I.T. — is the subject of Ariely’s first bite-size lecture online, “How an Injury Led Me to Irrationality.”The installments in his “Predictably Irrational” series are short — the length of pop songs — and padded with too many credits, titles and promotions for both Duke and Ariely’s book. They are, however, enjoyable and thought-provoking. Ariely appears half-lighted in a tuxedo, sometimes with jacket and sometimes without, as he tells of small insights into seemingly ordinary events. Montages of contemporary images play to illuminate his insights. The placebo effect, procrastination and the allure of free things come in for analysis and are brightly put into context. (An example: making the registry of a hybrid car free would be a way for the government to encourage their purchase, he argues.)Even for those of us who are not sure that individual marketing breakthroughs — which admittedly follow a satisfying narrative arc — ought to be taught as economics have to concede that this guy is cool. Furthermore, his willingness to factor human wackiness into macroeconomic phenomena demonstrates intellectual ingenuity and a gift — like Pausch’s — for having fun. While presenting how to design research projects and moreover how to package insights, Ariely makes the potent case that the brain can be an organ of survival.It’s hard not to be biased in favor of the Open Yale courses at OYC.yale.edu simply because they are presented in such a frank, unfussy way. The silky audiovisuals start without graphic rigamarole and don’t stall till they’re over. Professors wear clip-on microphones but otherwise seem to conduct the classes just for the students, as in the case of Langdon Hammer, whose set of lectures on modern poetry are weak on sizzle but strong on steak. Hammer can also be seen distributing handouts and encouraging students to do their homework; he’s not playing to the online bleacher seats or would-be book buyers. This is the real New Haven stuff.I chose one of Hammer’s first lectures on Hart Crane, as Crane is the subject of several of Hammer's books, including “Hart Crane and Allen Tate: Janus-Faced Modernism.” Indeed, he appears to take great satisfaction in simply reading Crane aloud. His signature gesture is an outstretched arm from which he twists his hand as if turning a stiff dial on the elaborate dashboard of a spaceship. With this, he suggests how well a poet encapsulates or compresses an idea. His voice is neither blasé nor sporty, like Ariely’s or Pausch’s. Instead, it’s suave and nervous at once: call it the humanities voice. Hammer stumbles as he ad-libs — unlike the others, he evidently keeps no notes, only poems, in front of him — but picks up fluency, tellingly, when he reads from Crane (or Eliot or Pound; it’s a canonical syllabus of modernists).Hammer stresses that his course is not specifically for English majors. The poets under discussion knew something about economics, science, mathematics and other fields — and didn’t consider poetry a discipline apart from the rest of the world. As a consequence of Hammer’s emphasis, his poets come across as much more than emotional crooners (as might the adolescent-friendly Romantics); they’re sophisticated, canny practitioners of translation and quotation.This seems like the right tack to take with these urbane modernists, who slip in and out of languages and dialects and cities and who are impressive not so much as followers of dreams but as boulevardiers in bowlers — or open-collared shirts and cashmere, which is what Hammer seems to opt for. Keen, witty, cold-eyed observers of the turning world: what undergraduate doesn’t like to see himself in the Eliot paradigm?Christine Hayes, Introduction to the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible), Yale (Video)In Christine Hayes’s first lecture, she breezes into her subject — wearing an open aqua blue shirt and matching tank top, as if on a cruise — and quickly becomes, personally, a compelling enigma. Maybe it’s immature to wonder, but what’s her story?Here is a specialist in Talmudic-Midrashic studies, who is the Robert F. and Patricia Ross Weis professor of religious studies in classical Judaica at Yale. As she lays out for a crowd of students how tenacious the monotheism of the early Israelites has been, how influential, how really miraculous, she shows a rousing philo-Semitism. It seems to kindle a warm glow in anyone raised as Jewish, Christian or Muslim.Her enthusiasm for the concept of one God might make more sense coming from a kindly rabbi or Sunday-school teacher. Delivered by a professor at Yale, where you might expect more cultural relativism and frank atheism, Introduction to the Old Testament seems at first a little off — a high-toned monotheism infomercial.Except that it’s not. Hayes’s seemingly simple formulations twinkle with fascinating implications for contemporary religious life. In the last two centuries, she says, with the help of archaeology, we first glimpsed the ancient world; that world included many extinct cultures and one that had curiously survived; the survival of the Jews is testament to the versatility and might of the Bible. While the course sidesteps theological issues and Hayes stresses that questions about the Bible’s divine inspiration will be tabled, she nonetheless reveals that the Hebrew Bible stirs in her a special kind of longing and delight. Students with even a passing familiarity with the Bible will find it hard to keep aloof from Hayes’s affection.Intellectual pursuits can satisfy religious longings: that’s a powerful lesson, and one that Hayes unfolds and demonstrates with patience and spirit.Pick Your Favorite Video at The Medium blog'"
"'08-09-21,'0','The day’s news was not bad for everyone, at least not immediately. “I’m O.K.,” said Medit East, a technology consultant from New Jersey. He added that he usually bet on the euro but had not done so even though the currency was up against the dollar that day. “I’m telling myself that I wish I could have,” he said.Kristin McDonough, the library’s director, was standing nearby. She said that attendance at the library’s investing classes, which are run by a former pension adviser, had shot up in the past six months. Some classes have been so full, she added, that students have had to share computers.But maybe on this afternoon, another day of dispiriting losses before the market regained ground later in the week, people were tired of thinking about stocks. A class in a side room on investment research started late because of low attendance. When it did begin, three students were present, along with a librarian who led them through Web sites and other resources.The librarian was careful to stick to the curriculum, offering no financial advice, but there were cracks. On a tour through a Standard & Poor’s Web site, she caught a glimpse of the day’s news. “Oh, my God, the S. & P. is down 57,” she murmured. “So the market is not doing good.”A man sitting near the front already knew that. As the librarian spoke, he clicked through headlines cast in scarily large type: “European Stocks Crumble” and “Street Cracks Further.”When the class ended, he got up and hurried from the room, explaining that he had an appointment. A second class member, near the back, turned out to be a librarian who was just sitting in; he wanted to be sure people knew about the library’s free information services.The only remaining student, then, was a 60-year-old former schoolteacher named Marc. He does not want his last name used, he said, because he has made his own share of bad financial decisions and owes people money. His anxiety level was high because of the week’s events, he said, with no relief in sight. Even if the downturn offered buying opportunities, he fretted that he might miss them.“I realize that I’ve got so much more to learn,” he said, eyes wide with dismay. And there seemed to be so little time. “Six months ago, I thought it was much more easy,” he said. “Right now, it seems much more complicated. Now that everything is going wacko.”'"
"'08-09-21,'0','Fall may be just beginning, but the season feels well under way at Wightman’s Farms in Harding Township, where the roadside store is well stocked with pumpkins, squash, apples and, of course, sweet cider ($4.99 a gallon).On a stretch of road known as “the country mile,” about four miles south of Morristown, Wightman’s has retained its rustic charm even as it has expanded over 86 years of operation. Originally, fruits and vegetables were sold from a table set up under a mulberry tree on the farm. Today’s spacious store offers modern conveniences like an ATM, while continuing to sell homemade pies, including peach and rhubarb ($11.99 for 10-inch pies). The old-fashioned apple pie is especially popular and in demand for Thanksgiving (orders will be taken starting Nov. 1).Besides growing about 30 varieties of apples on roughly 200 acres of land it owns and leases in the area, Wightman’s harvests homegrown vegetables in season. White and bicolor sweet corn (59 cents an ear) should be available until the first frost, which is expected in early October. Decorative gourds (79 cents to $1.99 a pound) will be available longer.The busiest, and perhaps the best, time to visit Wightman’s is on the weekends when family activities, like apple picking and hayrides, are available. (Hayrides are $7.50, including a pumpkin and a donut; pick-your-own apples cost $1.19 a pound with a seasonal family membership of $11.) Wightman’s also has six mazes, including ones made of corn, hay and rope ($8 for unlimited maze wandering). The pumpkin slingshot attracts parents as well as kids ($2 for three shots).Wightman’s Farms, 1111 Mount Kemble Avenue (Route 202), Morristown; (973) 425-9819; www.wightmansfarms.com. Store open daily, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.; apple picking weekends and holidays, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; hay rides and other activities weekends and holidays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.'"
"'08-09-21,'0','A new feature film, still untitled, is planned for 2010, with more in development. Meanwhile the Muppets will work overtime elsewhere, appearing on a new float in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, on “Nightline” interviewing political candidates and on various talk shows. More Muppet-theme attractions are being discussed for Disney theme parks.And then there is the merchandise. Coming soon: Muppet clothing at Urban Outfitters and Limited Too stores; Muppet-theme items like stuffed animals and tote bags, at Macy’s; and a Muppet boutique at the New York flagship of F. A. O. Schwarz.Disney does not want to create a flash in the pan; it sees the Muppets as a franchise that can sit side by side with, say, Winnie the Pooh. But creating any flash at all is the challenge. With the exception of a guest appearance here and there, the characters have largely been in cold storage for the last three years. And because the Muppets have been without a regular television gig for more than a decade, many children and younger teenagers don’t know them.Ms. Breier said recent focus groups indicated that some children could not even identify Kermit and Miss Piggy, much less ancillary characters like Fozzie Bear and Gonzo the Great. The wisecracking, irreverent Muppets (a combination of puppets and marionettes) also don’t fit that neatly in the Disney culture, as they differ from most of the company’s bedrock characters in two big ways: Kermit and coterie were primarily created to entertain adults, and they live in the real world. Henson was so insistent that they stand apart from his “Sesame Street” creations in personality and tone that he (misleadingly) titled the 1975 pilot that would boost their careers “The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence.”Undeterred, Disney expects the Muppets to expand their fan base beyond nostalgic older generations to the age group between 6 and 12 that has powered “Hannah Montana” and “High School Musical” into international blockbusters. But how do you make 50-year-old puppets, even those as beloved to many people as these, relevant in a “Wall-E” world?The Muppets are hardly moribund, but they do represent one of the most striking examples of franchise fumbling in Hollywood history.“The Muppet Show” made its debut on CBS stations in 1976, introducing the classic characters Disney owns today. (The Muppet characters that populated the inaugural season of “Saturday Night Live” a year earlier were different.) “The Muppet Show” was full of song-and-dance numbers and skits, often featuring absurdist humor, along with backstage antics. Dancing chickens were thrown in for good measure.Some of the biggest names in entertainment at the time populated each episode. Rudolf Nureyev and Miss Piggy, clad in towels, sat in a sauna and sang “Baby, It’s Cold Outside”; a bejeweled Elton John performed “Crocodile Rock” with Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, the show’s house band.Witty, somewhat subversive dialogue and the hilarious-looking Muppets themselves quickly won audiences over. The show, which ran for five seasons, at one point was syndicated in 100 countries. The ubiquitous franchise spawned hit movies (“The Muppet Movie”), hit songs (“The Rainbow Connection”), loads of merchandise and, eventually, an animated series called “Muppet Babies.”But those glory days are long gone. After Henson’s death from a rare bacterial infection, at 53, in 1990 his five children took control of the company. They set about working on new adventures for the Muppets — but not before dragging them into a nasty court fight with Disney over terms for a Muppet attraction Henson had completed for Walt Disney World. And the franchise’s pop-cultural resonance slipped; the last Muppets movie, “Muppets From Space,” sputtered at the box office in 1999.The next year Henson’s heirs sold the family business to the German media company EM.TV and Merchandising for about $680 million. But as the German conglomerate slumped under crushing debt and an insider-trading and fraud investigation, the Muppets stagnated further. The Henson children later bought back the classic Muppets and the characters from the HBO series “Fraggle Rock” for $78 million (before selling the classic characters to Disney in 2004 for $75 million); the “Sesame Street” Muppets were sold to Children’s Television Workshop. The family continues to operate the Jim Henson Company, which retains ownership of the Fraggles.But even Disney, skilled in immortalizing the vision of a single man, has struggled to rekindle the Muppet spark. Although Disney estimated three years ago that the Muppets would be generating about $300 million a year in merchandising sales by now, retail analysts say the total for 2008 will be closer to $50 million.Meanwhile Henson loyalists like the performer and puppeteer Frank Oz publicly criticized aspects of Disney’s stewardship. Allowing Miss Piggy to serve as a Pizza Hut pitchwoman in a Super Bowl commercial created a major dust-up among fans, even though Henson himself was overtly commercial. (The piano-playing dog Rowlf was created in 1962 to sell Purina Dog Chow.) And family members have at times been frustrated at what they saw as Disney’s lack of focus.“Have they been a little slow? Perhaps,” said Brian Henson, the co-chief executive officer of the Jim Henson Company. “But the most important thing to us is that they are careful. Now, more than ever, we believe they are doing just that.”Dick Cook, chairman of Walt Disney Studios and Ms. Breier’s boss, attributed the pace to the scale of Disney’s plans. “Developing the kind of high-quality entertainment we have planned for the global relaunch of the Muppets takes time,” he said.In early August a motley group of puppeteers, lighting technicians, camera operators and Disney executives gathered on a Hollywood soundstage to work on Miss Piggy’s comeback.She perched on the arm of Eric Jacobson, who performs the Muppet characters originated by Mr. Oz, stared blankly downward. A crew member brushed her hair and plucked a piece of lint from her forehead. “Miss Piggy, are you with us?” asked the director, Bill Barretta.In the scene at hand, destined for Disney.com, Miss Piggy would demonstrate her workout routine: bend at waist, pick up bonbon from box on floor, eat; repeat. “Kissy, kissy, it’s moi,” she said after the camera started rolling.Gently attaching the Muppets to today’s touchstone issues — healthy living, the environment — is one way Disney hopes to make them more relevant to the young and the trend conscious. Hence Miss Piggy’s donning of workout gear and Kermit’s recent appearance on ESPN (yet another Disney outpost) chatting with athletes about being environmentally friendly.At the same time maintaining the core DNA of the characters is crucial, so as not to alienate an older generation with warm memories from their own childhoods. Miss Piggy, as a result, does not suddenly become a vegan; she communicates about exercise by talking about how she hates to exercise. Kermit does not pontificate on going green; he listens to others talk about it in his humble, unassuming way.“We want to be very, very careful that whatever we do is in the spirit of the Muppets and that we are enhancing the brand,” Mr. Cook said.The new Muppet film, for instance, will be geared to a broad audience, but Disney understands the need it to retain an adult sensibility. Mr. Cook hired the team behind the raunchy comedy “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” Jason Segel (the writer and star) and Nicholas Stoller (the director), to deliver the script. Leading up to a film rather than starting with one reflects the feeling among studio executives that the film will make a bigger splash if the marketplace is prepped first.With merchandising partnerships like the one with F. A. O. Schwarz, Disney is also trying to tap into a retailing trend popular with children and teenagers: customization. American Girl Place stores, for instance, give shoppers the opportunity to design dolls to their specifications. F. A. O. Schwarz will do the same for Muppets fans.At the store’s Muppet-theme boutique, customers (for $100) will pick a body shape from various styles and then accessorize it with “a huge variation of Muppet parts,” said David Niggli, the president of F. A .O. Schwarz. (Versions will be sold on its Web site, fao.com.) The result will be what Jim Henson referred to as a “hand rod” Muppet: one hand goes inside the head of the puppet and the other holds thin rods connected to the puppet’s hands, allowing for gestures.“Younger consumers expect to be able to immerse themselves in the brands they like, so this idea is spot on,” said Samantha Skey, an expert on youth marketing at Alloy Media & Marketing. She added that as far as teenagers and children are concerned, “it’s a great way to bring this brand back from the dead.”That resurrection is being planned at Disney’s headquarters in Burbank, inside what Ms. Breier has called the Muppets’ war room. At a recent meeting the Muppets team watched a newly completed video for distribution on YouTube in which Sam, the moralistic eagle, and the rock star Animal, still chained to his drum set, perform “Stars and Stripes Forever” with a chorus of clucking chickens and other Muppets. Everyone in the room laughed.The viral videos have exploded on YouTube over the last month, giving Ms. Breier confidence that her strategy is starting to work. Four YouTube videos had been viewed a total of more than five million times as of Sept. 9, according to Disney research.And some parents are starting to notice that the Muppets are suddenly on the radar screens of their young children.“I tried getting them to watch DVDs of ‘The Muppet Show’ probably a year or two ago, and they weren’t that interested,” said Tom Weber, a New York father of two girls, ages 5 and 9. “But now that Disney is making its marketing push, they seem more aware and into it.”Ellie Weber, the 5-year-old, confirmed it. “Miss Piggy is really funny,” she said. “I like it when she plays with the froggy.”'"

"'08-09-22,'0','At any time of the year, you can find red, yellow, orange, green, and even purple peppers at the supermarket. But, in fact, peppers are a seasonal vegetable, and when freshly picked they are sweeter and more intense than any hothouse variety. The skin is thinner, and the flavors are vivid. Eat the real ones often enough, and you may never return to the bland, expensive ones from the grocery store.Peppers are very low in calories (about 25 calories per cup), and red peppers in particular are an excellent source of vitamins C, A and B6, as well as a very good source of potassium and vitamin K. By weight, red bell peppers contain three times as much vitamin C as citrus fruit. They also contain lycopene, a carotenoid found in tomatoes and other red fruits and vegetables. Some research has suggested that lycopene helps fight certain kinds of cancer.Peppers offer the cook endless possibilities. Roast them and they become a household staple, useful for snacks, salads and quick toppings for sandwiches and bruschetta. Fry or stew them, and they can be stirred into scrambled eggs and frittatas, risottos, pastas and pilafs. Uncooked peppers make a great, healthy snack, a crunchy vegetable that kids will eat.Roasting or grilling sweet peppers makes them taste still sweeter, and the charred skin adds yet another layer of flavor. You can grill peppers under a broiler or over a flame or coals. Alternately, you can roast them in the oven; it’s the easiest method if you’re roasting more than one or two peppers, and roasting yields more juice than grilling.Sea salt (fine or coarse) or kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste'"
"'08-09-22,'0','The campaign features television commercials, magazine advertisements and coupons in newspaper inserts, which offer $3 off each tube. Free samples will also be distributed in stores, at events and on packs of other Prestige Brands products.There is also an extensive online component, including Web sites like allergenblock.com and littleallergies.com, which were created by the New York office of Duval Guillaume. Other elements involve ads on Web sites like parenting.com, pollen.com, walmart.com and weatherbug.com as well as on sites visited by pet owners.The introduction of Allergen Block is indicative of efforts being made by marketers to draw attention to new products. To help the newcomers stand out amid the clutter on store shelves, they are increasingly being sheltered under the umbrella of existing brands rather than brought out as separate, distinct products with their own, new names.The tactic can also help marketers save money, because it typically requires a much larger ad budget to get consumers to become aware of and recall a new product with an all-new name.For instance, the Bayer HealthCare division of Bayer has introduced a hangover remedy under the aegis of the venerable Alka-Seltzer brand, as Alka-Seltzer Wake-Up Call, and a probiotic supplement under the banner of the vintage Phillips’ brand, as Phillips’ Colon Health.And Procter & Gamble has brought out so many detergents under the Tide umbrella that the graphic device of a shelf on the Tide Web site slides horizontally to display them all. Among the varieties: Tide Coldwater, Tide Simple Pleasures, Tide to Go, Tide TotalCare and Tide With Febreze Freshness.“We’re heavily vested in this idea of innovation” based on capitalizing on “these trusted and well-known brand names,” says Jim Kelly, chief marketing officer for over-the-counter and personal-care products at Prestige Brands, which like its agency is based in Irvington.“We’re a company built on acquiring a series of brands,” Mr. Kelly says, referring to products like Chloraseptic and Comet, which Prestige Brands bought from Procter & Gamble. “But the growth is going to be generated by innovative opportunities, where we can leverage the equities we purchase.”“We get instant credibility and awareness,” he adds, by placing the new products under the umbrella of a familiar trademark.Allergen Block represents “a new category for us,” Mr. Kelly says, which “always represents a challenge.” So anything that could improve the odds in favor of the company — considering how daunting it is to persuade shoppers to try new products — is welcome, particularly because, he adds, the budget for Allergen Block is “the most we’ve ever spent on a new-product launch in the history of the company.”“There are 40 to 45 million allergy sufferers in this country,” Mr. Kelly says, who spend about $700 million a year on remedies.“If you can get 5, 10 percent of that, you’ve done pretty well,” he adds. “We’re not going to overtake the Zyrtecs and the Claritins, but we think we’re offering something so different we can play well in the category.”The commercials for Chloraseptic Allergen Block present a big, tough football player who runs interference for a woman out for a walk. Rather than be bothered by airborne allergens, an announcer says, “you can block ’em” because Chloraseptic Allergen Block “lets you play offense.”In demonstrating how to apply the product, the “invisible shield” turns up, superimposed over a nose and upper lip. The spots end with the announcer’s assertive advice, “Hit allergens before they hit you.”The adult consumer “wants a confirmation on efficacy,” says Jerry Carrafiello, president at Carrafiello Diehl — that is, he or she “wants to know this works and how it works.”So the commercials “take an aggressive stance by using our football-player blocker,” he adds, along with the “Hit allergens” line.The commercials for Little Allergies Allergen Block emphasize that the product comes from Little Remedies because, Mr. Carrafiello says, the brand “has a great relationship with moms for understanding the issues moms face in medicating children.”The announcer says that Little Allergies Allergen Block works “without drugs or side effects.” The spots end with the slogan for Little Remedies, “We make it all better.” The spots mark the first TV commercials for a product under the Little Remedies banner.The commercials use a cartoon boy who battles allergens, superhero-style. “Ragweed, eat my dust!” he proclaims. (The character also turns up in the print ads.)The women who watched the commercials in tests liked “the animated approach,’ Mr. Carrafiello says, and they outranked “any of the spots tested.”The TV commercials will appear on national broadcast networks and cable channels.The print ads are scheduled to run in magazines like American Baby, Better Homes and Gardens, Good Housekeeping, Parenting, Parents and Redbook.The online aspects of the campaign, on the Web sites like pollen.com, reflect that “today’s media landscape requires a launch of this type,” Mr. Carrafiello says, which will “tap into all the different ways to reach consumers.”UPDATE: In the July 7 issue of In Advertising, the Campaign Spotlight reported on the Real Meat Moments Contest, sponsored by Alpo dog food, in which consumers could enter video clips showing dogs whose mealtime antics made them “meat maniacs.”The winner of the grand prize has been selected, Alpo says: Ike, a pug from Barrington Hills, Ill., owned by Mary Beth and Frank Holsteen. The Daily Herald, Ike’s hometown newspaper, reports that his behavior includes spinning wildly before eating, then leaning “so far forward into the bowl his hind legs leave the ground.”If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that runs Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times print edition and on nytimes.com.'"

I appreciate Members of Congress in both parties resisting the urge to do so, and keeping the rescue bill focused on solving the crisis in our financial markets.Americans are watching to see if Democrats and Republicans, the Congress and the White House, can come together to solve this problem with the urgency it warrants. Indeed, the whole world is watching to see if we can act quickly to shore up our markets and prevent damage to our capital markets, businesses, our housing sector, and retirement accounts.Failure to act would have broad consequences far beyond Wall Street. It would threaten small business owners and homeowners on Main Street.Everyone recognizes that it's not easy to write a bill of this magnitude in a timely manner, and all those who have worked so hard over the weekend and continue this morning deserve the thanks and appreciation of every American. Working together, I am confident we can enact the legislation necessary to prevent lasting damage to our economy and meet the unique challenge facing us today.'"

"'08-09-22,'0','It’s always a little disconcerting — and even irritating — when stars at awards shows, dripping in Chopard jewelry and self-regard, try to banter about current events. But there is at least one reassuring point to it: if television actors feel free to make light of dark events then things must not yet be that bad. It’s when comedians stay silent that you know things are really dire — think of the frothy escapist Busby Berkeley musicals and screwball comedies that distracted audiences during the Great Depression.By that standard, then, Sunday night’s 60th Primetime Emmy Awards were not all that reassuring. The funniest stars there — Stephen Colbert, Ricky Gervais and Steve Martin — were very funny but didn’t make any jokes about the looming financial crisis. Even Alec Baldwin, not known for restraint, held back. Tina Fey did, though, thank NBC for sticking with her show despite “the turkey burger economy.”It was the unamusing Howie Mandel, the host of the NBC game show “Deal or No Deal,” who took it head on.He and his four fellow reality-show M.C.’s opened the show by telling the audience they had no prepared material. “It’s like we are on Sarah Palin’s Bridge to Nowhere,” Mr. Mandel mugged. The audience laughed less when Mr. Mandel went on to the Treasury Department’s $700 billion bail-out proposal — the ultimate “Deal or No Deal” — saying, “The government can’t even bail us out of this.”Live award shows always have found it awkward hitting the right note in uncertain times — the contrast between the glitz and celebrity self-celebration and war or hurricane devastation is too acute.'"

"'08-09-22,'0','WASHINGTON — Gov. Sarah Palin will meet with former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and President Álvaro Uribe of Colombia as the United Nations General Assembly opens on Tuesday, an aide to Senator John McCain’s presidential campaign said.Ms. Palin is to meet on the same day with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan. She will also meet Wednesday with President Jalal Talabani of Iraq, President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan and President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia.The sessions are part of an effort to demonstrate that Ms. Palin, Mr. McCain’s running mate, is prepared to operate in the arenas of foreign policy and national security despite criticism of her level of experience. Ms. Palin, who has been the governor of Alaska for less than two years, got her first passport last year.The McCain campaign provided no details about the time or place of the meetings or the issues to be discussed.But it is likely that Mr. Kissinger, a close outside adviser to Mr. McCain’s campaign, will give Ms. Palin a broad overview of international affairs, focusing particularly on Russia, China and the Middle East. Mr. Kissinger, who was national security adviser and secretary of state in the Nixon and Ford administrations, is regularly called on by Mr. McCain for advice on foreign affairs.But Mr. Kissinger differs with Mr. McCain on some key aspects of foreign policy, including his support for direct American negotiations with Iran without conditions.'"
"'08-09-22,'0','Mr. McCain was never a leading critic or defender of the mortgage giants, although several former executives of the companies said Mr. Davis did draw Mr. McCain to a 2004 awards banquet that the companies’ Homeownership Alliance held in a Senate office building. The organization printed a photograph of Mr. McCain at the event in its 2004 annual report, bolstering its clout and credibility. The event honored several other elected officials, including at least two Democrats, Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania and Representative Artur Davis of Alabama.In an interview Sunday night with CNBC and The New York Times, Mr. McCain noted that Mr. Davis was no longer working on behalf of the mortgage giants. He said Mr. Davis “has had nothing to do with it since, and I’ll be glad to have his record examined by anybody who wants to look at it.”Asked about the reports of Mr. Davis’s role, a spokesman for Mr. McCain said that during the time when Mr. Davis ran the Homeownership Alliance, the senator had backed legislation to increase oversight of the mortgage companies’ accounting and executive compensation. The legislation, however, did not seek to change their anomalous structure as private companies with federal support.The spokesman, Tucker Bounds, also noted that the Homeownership Alliance included nonprofit organizations like Habitat for Humanity and the Urban League. “It’s not controversial to promote homeownership and minority homeownership,” Mr. Bounds said. More than a half-dozen current and former executives, however, said the Homeownership Alliance was set up mainly to defend Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by promoting their role in the housing market, and the two companies paid almost the entire cost of the group’s operations.“They were financed largely, possibly exclusively, by Fannie and Freddie,” said William R. Maloni, a Democrat who is a former head of industry relations for Fannie Mae. “We thought it would be helpful to have someone who was a broadly recognized Republican to be the face of the organization, and that person became Rick Davis.” Mr. Maloni added, “Rick, for that purpose, turned out to be quite good.” (Several executives said Mr. Davis’s compensation was not unusual for the companies’ well-connected consultants.)The federal bailout of the two mortgage giants has become an emblem of what critics say is the outdated or inadequate regulatory system that allowed the financial system to slide into crisis this summer.At the time that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac recruited Mr. Davis to run the Homeownership Alliance in 2000, they were under new pressure from private industry rivals and deregulation-minded Republicans who argued that the two companies’ federal sponsorship gave them an unfair advantage and put taxpayers at risk. Critics of the companies had formed their own Washington-based advocacy group, FM Watch. They were pushing for regulations that would deter the companies from expanding into new areas, including riskier and more profitable mortgages.Mr. Davis had recently returned to his lobbying firm from running Mr. McCain’s unexpectedly strong 2000 Republican primary campaign, which elevated Mr. McCain’s profile as a legislator and Mr. Davis’s as a lobbyist.“You can say what you want about free-market distortions, but people like the system because it gets them into houses cheap,” Mr. Davis said to Institutional Investor magazine in 2000, adding that he would run the advocacy group out of his Alexandria, Va., lobbying firm.The organization also hired Public Strategies, a communications firm that included former Bush adviser Mark McKinnon. Mr. Davis wrote letters and gave speeches for the group. In April 2001, he sent out a press release headlined, “It’s Tax Day — Do You Know Where Your Deductions Are? For Most Americans, They’re in Your Home.”But by the end of 2005, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were recovering from accounting problems and re-examining costs, former executives said. The companies decided the Homeownership Alliance had outlived its usefulness, and it disappeared.'"
"'08-09-22,'0','To be a typical teenager is to hold, simultaneously, two completely contradictory opinions about adults: to maintain the firm conviction that grown-ups have no clue, and yet to trust that when it comes to running things, they basically know what they’re doing. If adolescents did not have that doubt, culture would stop evolving. If they did not have that faith, they’d never get out of bed and go to school.The always tenuous balance of those oppositional belief systems shifted last week at the Bronx School of Law and Finance, where the students — 85 percent come from economically disadvantaged families — have, at relatively young ages, bet on the world of business as the surest path to upward mobility. Teenagers watching the sordid spectacle of Watergate already knew they weren’t supposed to trust anyone over 30. But teenagers observing the markets gyrate and the government officials scramble are seeing institutions that they had every reason to trust flailing in ineptitude.All last week, many of the 400 or so students at the school, not far from Van Cortlandt Park, kept approaching Roig Duran, a 17-year-old senior, wearing an argyle sweater and a large diamond stud in his ear. Roig had spent the summer as an intern at Lehman Brothers, so his classmates had a lot of questions. “What’d you do, press the wrong button or something?” one of his friends wanted to know.Barely a month had passed since Roig’s last day at Lehman’s gleaming Midtown offices. What most of his fellow aspiring financiers really wanted to know was: Were there any signs this was coming? “I was shocked,” was Roig’s standard answer, which makes his foresight regarding Lehman’s fate, or the larger financial crisis it helped fuel, for that matter, about as prescient as anyone else’s.Sitting in the principal’s office on Friday, Roig, who lives in the Soundview neighborhood of the Bronx and won that internship on the strength of his grades and character, still looked a bit dazed. “I did notice that the stock price kept going down,” said Roig, who grew accustomed to tracking stocks on the electronic ticker in the classroom of a finance teacher at the high school, and this summer checked it on the Lehman Web site every morning. “But I just thought that was something that was common, that they knew how to handle. I thought it was normal.”Then again, Roig had noticed that some of his co-workers seemed to be checking the stock on the company’s Web site pretty compulsively, eight, nine times a day. “They seemed kind of stressed out,” he said.'"
"'08-09-22,'0','Dubai is, in some ways, a vision of what the rest of the Arab world could become — if it offered comparable economic opportunity, insistence on following the law and tolerance for cultural diversity. In this environment, religion is not something young men turn to because it fills a void or because they are bowing to a collective demand. That, in turn, creates an atmosphere that is open not only to those inclined to a less observant way of life, but also to those who are more religious. In Egypt, , and , a man with a long beard is often treated as an Islamist — and sometimes denied work. Not here in Dubai.“Here, I can practice my religion in a natural and free way because it is a Muslim country and I can also achieve my ambition at work,” said Ahmed Kassab, 30, an electrical engineer from Zagazig Egypt, who wears a long dark beard and has a prayer mark on his forehead. “People here judge the person based on productivity more than what he looks like. It’s different in Egypt, of course.”No one can say for sure why Dubai has been spared the kind of religion-fueled extremism that has plagued other countries in the region. There are not even metal detectors at hotel and mall entrances, standard fare from to . Some speculate that Dubai is like Vienna during the cold war, a playground for all sides. There is a robust state security system. But there is also a feeling that diversity, tolerance and opportunity help breed moderation.“There is not going to be somebody who has a grudge against the system,” said Tarik Yousef, dean of the Dubai School of Government. “You might have a problem with something, but there’s enough to make you happy. You have a job — and the mosque is open 24 hours.”Dubai dazzles, but it also confuses. It appears to offer a straight deal — work hard and make money. It is filled with inequities and exploitation. It is a land of rules: no , no littering, no speeding, no drinking and driving. But it also dares everyone to defy limitations. There is the Burj Dubai, a glass tower that will be the tallest in the world. There is the Dubai Mall, which will be the biggest in the world. There are artificial islands shaped into a palm tree design (they said it couldn’t be done) and an indoor slope. There is talk of a new hotel, the biggest yet in Dubai, that will cool the hot sand for its guests. There is credit, and there are credit cards, for anyone with a job. There are no taxes.“They should give you an introduction when you arrive,” said Hamza Abu Zanad, 28, who moved to Dubai from Jordan about 18 months ago and now works in real estate. “It is very disorienting. I felt lost. There are fancy cars, but don’t speed. You can have prostitutes, but don’t get caught with a woman. I was driving along the beach and there were flashes — I thought someone was taking my picture.”The flashes turned out to be surveillance cameras. He was speeding. The next day the police called and told him to pay his fines, he said, still laughing at his initial innocence.He had lived for years in and graduated from college there. He spoke English, drank beer, dated women, lifted weights, lived a Western-style life, but felt culturally out of sync. “At Christmas I was lonely,” Mr. Abu Zanad said one day with a beer in one hand and the tube of a Turkish water pipe in the other. “Everyone is celebrating, but international students don’t know what’s going on.”In this way, Dubai offers another prescription for promoting moderation. It offers a chance to lead a modern life in an Arab Islamic country. Mr. Abu Zanad raised his beer high, almost in a toast, and said he liked being able to walk through a mall and still hear the call to prayer.“We like that it’s free and it still has Arab heritage,” he said “It’s not religion, it’s the culture, the Middle Eastern culture.”“The Arabs have a future here,” said his best friend, Bilal Hamdan. “Where are we going to go back to? Egypt? Jordan? This is the future.”Mr. Galal sees it as his future too, especially when he thinks of what would await him at home, where success is guaranteed only to those with connections and wealth.One evening, as he set out for the night to meet Egyptian friends, he was noticeably agitated. It turned out he watched on television as Egypt’s upper house of Parliament, a historic building in the center of Cairo, burned for hours in a humiliating symbol of the state’s decay.“Look how long it’s taking them to put out a fire in Parliament and they’re using the most primitive methods,” he finally said. “I feel like I’m watching a black and white movie. What would I go back and do?”Mr. Galal grew up in Shubra, a busy, crowded neighborhood in Cairo, where the streets are packed with young men who are unemployed or underemployed. He comes from a traditional, observant household where family honor is linked to obeying social norms and respecting religious values.Mr. Galal graduated from college with a degree in social work, but the only job available was as a maintenance man for about $100 a month. He felt as if he was treading water, and so at the urging of his family got engaged to a young woman from his neighborhood. He said that he thought the goal of marriage would give him a purpose, something to work toward.About a year later, a friend working in Dubai recommended him for a job in construction, and he grabbed the chance. It was a difficult adjustment.“I didn’t feel like anyone understood how I felt,” he said. He gained weight and got depressed.He works at a construction company helping to assemble massive air-conditioning units, essential in the withering heat and humidity of Dubai. He reviews blueprints and decides which materials are needed.His company gave him housing in a dormitory, a three-story, sand-colored building in Jebel Ali, a sprawling desert landscape of big-box warehouses and construction sites.“When I first arrived it was not what I expected,” Mr. Galal said. “You hear about the Emirates, but all the people I worked with were Indian. I wanted to leave.”Now his home, or rather, where he sleeps, is in Labor Camp No. 598,655. He shares a room the size of a walk-in closet with two other men on the first floor of the dormitory. The hundreds of men on his floor share a bathroom and a kitchen, where he will not eat because they serve only Indian food. There are about 20 Arab men out of 3,000 mostly Indian residents. Most of his meals are at mall food courts or in cheap restaurants serving Arabic cuisine.“It’s not nice, it’s normal,” Mr. Galal said as he closed the flimsy door to his room, stepping over the piles of shoes and sandals in the hall. It was 5:30 p.m. and his roommates were fast asleep after a long hot day at the construction site.In fact, the mix of nationalities has made Mr. Galal redefine himself — not predominantly as Muslim but as Egyptian. Asked if he feels more comfortable with a Pakistani who is Muslim or an Egyptian who is Christian, he replied automatically:His best friend, Ayman Ibrahim, 28, lives in the room next to Mr. Galal, also with two other men. Mr. Ibrahim is from Alexandria, Egypt, and has been in Dubai for more than two years. He works as a senior safety supervisor in another division of the company.Mr. Ibrahim was waiting outside in a white provided by the company. His Egyptian fiancée’s picture dangled from his key chain in the ignition.Dubai has been built along roadways, 6, 12, 14 lanes wide. There was no central urban planning and the result is a city of oases, each divided from the other by lanes of traffic. The physical distance between people is matched by the distance between nationalities. Dubai has everything money can buy, but it does not have a unifying culture or identity. The only common thread is ambition.As Mr. Galal and Mr. Ibrahim headed to town, the traffic was ferocious, another downside of Dubai’s full-throttle development. It took two hours to get to Diera, the old part of the city. But the friends did not seem to mind inching along. Popular Egyptian love songs played from the stereo as the car crawled past the Marina, another exclamation point in a city full of them, with skyscrapers, a Buddha Bar and a marina, a real marina, for boats.“This is not for us, the sheiks live here,” Mr. Galal said as the car passed the Marina. But there was no anger or envy in his voice, as there would be if he were in Egypt, where when he sees wealth he knows that it is beyond his reach. When Mr. Galal came to Dubai his salary was 2,000 dirhams a month, or about $550.“I wish I can make 40,000 a month,” he said with a dreamy smile. “When I first came here I was hoping for 5,000, now I make 5 and I want 10, and I will start making 10 in a month. Salaries here increase.”The young men made it to Diera, parked in a hotel lot and walked down the sidewalk, until the smell of scented tobacco was strong and sweet. They turned left at the , up a flight of stairs and into Awtar, an Egyptian-style coffeehouse that served Turkish water pipes, called shisha in Egypt, and showed Egyptian soccer on television. The place was filled with Egyptian men who were smoking, and drinking sweet tea and coffee.Mr. Galal put his cellphone on the table and lit a Marlboro, again. He described how he no longer felt at home anywhere. The diversity and opportunity in Dubai, he says, have made Egypt seem more unlivable than it was before. But he said the openness, the temptations of Dubai, also frightened him.“The things I saw here, I can’t tell you,” he said “I can’t trust anyone here, I can’t.”‘A New Way of Life’The Rattlesnake Bar and Grill, where he and his friend often go after the coffeehouse, is cheap by Dubai standards, about an $18 cover charge. Inside there is a Wild West theme and a Filipino rock band blasting pop and many single women lined up like merchandise by the front door. A sign by the bar promised “a new way of life.”This is where Mr. Galal met Reem — though he said that was probably not her real name. On a Thursday night — the first night of the weekend — Rattlesnake was packed with single men and prostitutes. Mr. Galal seemed jealous when Reem was working the floor, talking to guys. His head was tipped, his shoulders up, a bit like a nervous schoolboy. Reem wore skin-tight black tights, a black, low-cut top, and held a stern gaze as Mr. Galal leaned in and talked to her. They chatted a few minutes before Reem went off.“Look, I’m not a muscle man and I’m not loaded, she must like me,” Mr. Galal said, sounding a touch unsure of himself.“She’s here for business and I know she has to do this. She tries to make me understand. But I get attached.”A week later, Mr. Galal was overloaded. “I am suffocating here,” he said as he walked into the coffeehouse. He moved up his vacation home to Cairo. He said that he needed to get back on track, to break from the drinking and the women, and reconnect with his values.A few days later, Mr. Ibrahim drove him to the airport for the nearly four-hour flight home to spend the holy month of with his family. In Dubai, Mr. Ibrahim said, “There’s work and life and money. There were days when I didn’t have a place to stay, no money, nothing. But I made it as opposed to Egypt where you start at zero and stay at zero.”But if Dubai offers opportunity, it also poses risks.For days after his return to Egypt, Mr. Galal could not get hold of Mr. Ibrahim on the telephone. He had been arrested, charged by the police with trying to steal tons of scrap metal from his construction site. Five days after he was taken in, Mr. Ibrahim was released, but the police kept his passport.“I didn’t do it,” he said. “I am here two and a half years trying to make a life for myself and in two minutes my life is ruined.”In Cairo, Mr. Galal reconnected with his family. He fasted for Ramadan, including giving up during daylight hours. And he went out looking for his friends on the bustling streets of his neighborhood, which is the antithesis of Dubai. It is filled with people, men, women, children, all night long, , chatting, smoking, enjoying the cool night air, the warmth of the neighborhood, and a common culture.Mr. Galal cut and gelled his hair. He got a close shave and bought himself a thick silver link chain to wear around his neck. He looked as if he would fit right in. But he did not feel that way.“My friends are all stuck at a certain limit, that’s as far as they can go,” Mr. Galal said after three weeks at home. “Nothing is new here. Nothing is happening. My friends feel like I changed. They say money changed me.”Mr. Galal and a cousin went out for a night of fun the day before he was scheduled to return to Dubai. They sat on the sidewalk by the Nile where men were . A woman rented them plastic lawn chairs and brought over sweet tea and a drink made from chickpeas. “I want to go back,” he said. “I was living better there. It’s the simple things, sitting at the coffee shop, talking to people, their mentality is different.”He said he broke off his engagement. Marriage in Egypt is usually a practical matter, a necessary step to adulthood, to independence. It is often arranged.A year in Dubai changed his view of marriage. “You are looking for someone to spend your whole future with,” Mr. Galal said.“I want to go back and have fun. My future is there, in Dubai.”'"
"'08-09-22,'0','It was not that long ago that black people in the Deep South could be beaten or killed for seeking the right to vote, talking back to the wrong white man or failing to give way on the sidewalk. People of color who violated these and other proscriptions could be designated “uppity niggers” and subjected to acts of violence and intimidation that were meant to dissuade others from following their examples.The term “uppity” was applied to affluent black people, who sometimes paid a horrific price for owning nicer homes, cars or more successful businesses than whites. Race-based wealth envy was a common trigger for burnings, lynchings and cataclysmic episodes of violence like the Tulsa race riot of 1921, in which a white mob nearly eradicated the prosperous black community of Greenwood.Forms of eloquence and assertiveness that were viewed as laudable among whites were seen as positively mutinous when practiced by people of color. As such, black men and women who looked white people squarely in the eye — and argued with them about things that mattered — were declared a threat to the racial order and persecuted whenever possible.This obsession with black subservience was based in nostalgia for slavery. No sane person would openly express such a sentiment today. But the discomfort with certain forms of black assertiveness is too deeply rooted in the national psyche — and the national language — to just disappear. It has been a persistent theme in the public discourse since Barack Obama became a plausible candidate for the presidency.A blatant example surfaced earlier this month, when a Georgia Republican, Representative Lynn Westmoreland, described the Obamas as “uppity” in response to a reporter’s question. Mr. Westmoreland, who actually stood by the term when given a chance to retreat, later tried to excuse himself by saying that the dictionary definition carried no racial meaning. That seems implausible. Mr. Westmoreland is from the South, where the vernacular meaning of the word has always been clear.'"
"'08-09-22,'0','In a separate interview earlier in the day, Mr. Obama said that despite the huge new government obligation, he would press ahead with his plans to overhaul the health care system to insure more people, make college tuition more affordable, give a tax cut to the middle class and raise taxes on those making over $250,000 a year.“The problem that we have,” Mr. Obama said, “in part has to do with wages and incomes that have been flat. And so homeowners and ordinary families out there have been working very hard, but it’s tough for them to pay the bills and stay afloat with rising gas prices and health care.“So if we don’t address our long-term competitiveness, if we don’t address some of the inequities in the tax code, if we’re not addressing some of the things that weakened the family budget, then we’re not, over the long term, going to solve these larger problems in the financial markets.”Mr. McCain has made speeches and broadcast television commercials recently that highlight Mr. Obama’s ties to former leaders of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the mortgage giants at the center of the financial crisis.Mr. McCain has struck a notably populist tone in addressing the crisis, and in the interview, he set a specific limit on compensation for executives at firms that receive federal assistance. “But the major point,” he said, “is that no C.E.O. of any corporation or business that is bailed out by us, that is rescued by American tax dollars, should receive any more than the highest paid person in the federal government.”Mr. Obama continued to assail the philosophy of excessive deregulation that he said was the root cause of the crisis and made clear that the aftermath should include a new regulatory approach.The deepening financial crisis and the shifting government response to it have challenged both presidential candidates for more than a week, as they struggled to react to a situation that seemed to change each day. In the interviews, they gave some of their most detailed views of the crisis to date.Mr. Obama warned that the bailout should not be a “blank check” and called for tighter regulation of the financial industry, suggesting he would support imposing federal capital requirements on investment firms. He also emphasized that the plan would have to include more relief for homeowners and distressed communities, a demand being made by Democrats in Congress.“Regardless of how we got there,” he said, “we now have a situation where people’s jobs, people’s savings, people’s retirement accounts, their job security, all that is at risk. And so we’ve got to take some firm and decisive steps.”Mr. McCain, like Mr. Obama, said an oversight board should be created to monitor how the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., administers the bailout, which calls for the federal government to take toxic assets off troubled financial firms’ hands.“I respect and admire Secretary Paulson, but as far as I can tell, we’re placing all those responsibilities in the hands of one person,” Mr. McCain said. “I think we need to appoint an oversight board of the most respected people in America, such as maybe Warren Buffett, who’s a Obama supporter; Mitt Romney, Mike Bloomberg, so that there can be some kind of oversight of, instead of just putting all this responsibility on a person who may be gone in four months.”Mr. McCain, who has been trying to distance himself from the Bush administration while proposing to continue many of its economic policies, tried Sunday to strike several bipartisan notes.In a separate interview on “60 Minutes” on CBS, he mentioned that he would like to see Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who is the attorney general of New York, take over as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission from Christopher Cox, whose ouster he has called for.He also said on “60 Minutes” that he would remove the political operation from his White House and put it in the Republican National Committee.The financial crisis and the proposed bailout have become fodder for a heated back and forth in the presidential campaign. Mr. Obama has cast Mr. McCain as a longtime proponent of the kind of deregulation that he says led to the crisis; Mr. McCain has cast Mr. Obama as lacking in the leadership qualities needed in a time of crisis.Mr. Obama offered guarded praise of how Mr. Paulson is handing the crisis. He stopped short of pledging to keep him in place in an Obama administration, but he said that the gravity of the turmoil in the nation’s financial markets was so serious that continuity was important to avert further crisis.“Getting a new person to start juggling those balls is going to be tricky,” Mr. Obama said. “Regardless of who wins the election, the issue of transition to the next administration is going to be very important. And it’s going to have to be executed with a spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation.”'"

"'08-09-22,'0','Still, competing interests were already complicating the negotiations, as Democrats pushed for assistance for distressed homeowners and for oversight authority of the bailout program. Some lawmakers also said they did not want to be rushed into approving extraordinary new powers for the Treasury secretary and the government without full consideration of the consequences.Both presidential nominees, who face the prospect of inheriting an enormous new program, said there had to be more oversight of the Treasury Department than the Bush administration had proposed.Financial companies were already lobbying to broaden the plan. And the Bush administration did indeed widen the scope by allowing the government to buy out assets other than mortgage-related securities as well as making foreign companies eligible for government assistance.Banks and traders also braced themselves for another tumultuous week in the markets. But early signs indicate that investors in Asia were reacting positively to the developments in Washington. Shares in Asia jumped in early trading on Monday morning, as investors took their cues from a rally on Wall Street on Friday. The Nikkei 225 index climbed 2 percent in early trading in Tokyo, and the Kospi index rose 3 percent in Seoul, South Korea.The Standard & Poor’s/Australia Stock Exchange 200 index increased 3.6 percent after markets there opened a half-hour late. The opening was delayed to allow time for further details to be issued regarding a monthlong ban imposed by Australian regulators on all short selling of shares traded on the exchange.Meanwhile, top Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill said on Sunday that they would act swiftly on the administration’s request, but not without setting their own conditions.“Congress will respond to the financial markets crisis by taking action this week in a bipartisan manner that will protect the taxpayers’ interests,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. She added that the administration’s proposal did “not include the necessary safeguards. Democrats believe a responsible solution should include independent oversight, protections for homeowners and constraints on excessive executive compensation.”“We will not simply hand over a $700 billion blank check to Wall Street and hope for a better outcome,” she said.Congressional Republicans, too, put the Bush administration on notice that they would not rubber-stamp the bailout proposal but would insist on a number of changes, including specific protections for taxpayers. Those would include a requirement that any profits from the program be returned to the Treasury.Aides to senior House Republicans said that lawmakers would also demand greater oversight of the program and were proposing a joint select committee, consisting of members of both parties and both chambers of Congress.Top administration officials and senior lawmakers said that the markets could be devastated if Congress and the administration failed to reach agreement on the plan.On Sunday, Mr. Paulson defended the plan and the administration’s decision to expand it to protect foreign companies and authorize even wider latitude to buy assets other than those that were backed by mortgages.Mr. Paulson, a former Wall Street deal maker, also suggested that the administration would have some flexibility in dealing with concerns raised by Congress.Democrats said the plan would need to provide more specific relief for troubled homeowners. They said the program, which the administration proposed to be run by Treasury, would have to be more accountable to Congress. And they said that the plan must restrict the compensation of corporate executives from companies that make use of the program to sell the burdensome securities on their balance sheets to the United States.“We need to offer some assurance to the American taxpayer that Congress is watching,” Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee, told reporters on Sunday. “One of the things that got us into this mess was the lack of accountability and the lack of oversight that was occurring, and I don’t think we want to repeat those mistakes with a program of this magnitude.”Mr. Paulson said he hoped that the government would recoup much of the cost of buying distressed mortgage-related assets. But he did not rule out that the initial cost of the bailout could rise beyond $700 billion, the limit set in the terse proposal sent by the Treasury to Congress on Saturday.“That doesn’t mean we’ll go all the way there, or it doesn’t mean it will stop there and we won’t ask for more,” Mr. Paulson said on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” “What we need is something that is big enough to get the job done. We’ll ask for what we think is a right amount to give us plenty of flexibility.”Representative Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, put forward the Democrats’ proposed changes to the administration’s plan. They would give the Treasury secretary the authority to set “appropriate standards” for compensation of senior executives whose companies sell troubled assets to the government.Under a so-called claw-back provision, the secretary would have the power to force companies to recoup previous payments to executives of companies involved in the program. And Mr. Frank’s plan would give broad authority for the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, to audit and oversee the program.But Mr. Paulson said that he was concerned that imposing limits on the compensation of executives could discourage companies from participating in the program.“If we design it so it’s punitive and so institutions aren’t going to participate, this won’t work the way we need it to work,” Mr. Paulson said on “Fox News Sunday.” “Let’s talk about executive salaries. There have been excesses there. I agree with the American people. Pay should be for performance, not for failure.”But he quickly added: “But we need this system to work, and so we — the reforms need to come afterwards.”Republicans, though troubled by some of the same issues as Democrats, seemed ready to give Mr. Paulson wide latitude.Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, said on ABC: “We don’t need 535 members of Congress adding their best idea. We need to keep it clean, simple, move it through the House and Senate, and get it on the president’s desk.”Even as Ms. Pelosi and other Congressional leaders were pledging to act swiftly and said a deal was probable by the end of the week, some lawmakers said they would not be rushed into approving a plan.“I realize there is considerable pressure for the Congress to adjourn by the end of next week,” Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, wrote in a letter to the Senate leaders of both parties. “But I think we must take the necessary time to conduct hearings, analyze the administration’s proposed legislation, and demonstrate to the American people that any response is thoughtful, thoroughly considered and appropriate.”Mr. Dodd said he expected that Treasury would not be particularly interested in any of the Democratic proposals. But he said he had already warned Mr. Paulson to keep an open mind.“I suggested strongly to him that he leave this door open, or he is going to find himself facing some significant problems,” Mr. Dodd said at a briefing with reporters on Sunday at the Capitol. Mr. Dodd, who met with several of his Democratic colleagues, said that reaching a deal could keep Congress in session past this week, when leaders had hoped to adjourn for the fall elections. “This is of such import that if it takes a little longer to get it right, so be it,” he said.As they plotted an endgame, Democrats said they planned to consider the bailout proposal separately from an economic recovery program that would include new public works spending, aid to states and added unemployment and food-stamp benefits. Congress could consider that plan and a stop-gap funding plan for the federal government before taking up the Treasury proposal later in the week.While House Democrats were the first to propose additional legislative language, Senate Democrats were working aggressively behind the scenes on several provisions that could set off debate among lawmakers and aggressive lobbying by an array of interest groups.Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, has proposed a provision that would grant the government warrants to purchase stock in companies that participate in the bailout plan, so that taxpayers might be able to profit should the firms flourish after selling their bad debts to the government.Several Democratic senators are interested in reviving a provision that was knocked out of legislation last summer to grant bankruptcy judges the authority to modify the terms of mortgages for primary residences. That provision is opposed by the banking, lending and securities industries. But supporters say it would guarantee that lenders enter negotiations to modify loans to struggling homeowners.'"

"'08-09-22,'0','The Treasury Department started a campaign last week to educate Americans about the importance of credit. The campaign was not designed for Wall Street banks, currently awaiting the details on their $700 billion government bailout, but for 18- to 24-year-olds, who are presumably too young to bring the financial system to its knees.The campaign, which includes two videos, two radio spots and an online game in English and Spanish, warns young viewers: “Don’t let your credit put you in a bad place.”To some, the effort might seem a tad late given current events, but those running the project say the timing is just right.“I think that recent events have highlighted the importance of understanding the impact that your financial decisions can have on your life,” said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a Treasury spokesperson.The campaign was mandated in 2003 as part of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. Work began in 2006 when the Treasury teamed up with the Ad Council and Lowe Worldwide, which offered its design services as a free public service. After two years of focus groups, design and production, the group released the project on Sept. 16. The video and audio spots are expected to run in donated airtime over the next four to six weeks.'"
"'08-09-22,'0','There’s nothing like a little “Sounddance” to start the weekend off right or, at least, to put the fever back into Friday night. This Merce Cunningham gem, created in 1975 and performed as part of the Fall for Dance festival at New York City Center, encapsulates a moment in time: not just the year in which it was made, but any moment when tension builds to an awful peak and is released with an emphatic bang.The piece was created after Mr. Cunningham spent nine difficult weeks working with dancers at the Paris Opera Ballet. As the story goes, when he was back in the studio with his own company, he was in the mood to choreograph something with a little more kick. “Sounddance” is practically a missile.The cast of 10 emerges from Mark Lancaster’s golden draped curtain, parted at the center like the opening of a tent. (The dancers exit in the same way.) David Tudor’s percussive score sounds like what you would hear in a video arcade; but perhaps “Sounddance” is the game itself.A serious work, it is also full of sly references to the correctness and regal bearing of classical ballet. When Robert Swinston, a marvel in what was originally Mr. Cunningham’s role, assists a dancer in a pirouette, he does so by pushing her shoulder as offhandedly as if spinning a turnstile. The closer you look at the details, the funnier it becomes.The Friday and Saturday programs each included a pair of vintage solos. “Awassa Astrige/Ostrich,” a 1932 work choreographed by Asadata Dafora, transformed G. D. Harris into a bird of lissome power. And in Jane Dudley’s “Harmonica Breakdown,” from 1938, Sheron Wray, through a series of jarring isolations and strutting walks, did more than react to the blues music to which it was set. She was possessed by it.Unfortunately the same devotion wasn’t true of Xiomara Reyes and Gennadi Saveliev in a pas de deux from Antony Tudor’s “Leaves Are Fading,” on Friday. These American Ballet Theater dancers, lacking spontaneity and any semblance of dynamic phrasing, turned a romantic duet into a bland exercise. Louise Lecavalier, a Montreal dancer, made up for that lack of commitment in an excerpt from Crystal Pite’s “Lone Epic.” The dance was less than stellar: it involved rows of music stands and Ms. Lecavalier turning blank sheets to reveal lines like “What does she really want?” But Ms. Lecavalier was magnetic, exuding both power and a wispy fragility that couldn’t be tarnished by melodramatic choreography.'"
"'08-09-22,'0','“With this kind of fear you can’t do anything,” the hedge fund investor said. “You never have heroes when you get these kinds of violent moves. The heroes only come out when the stock is down and stays down.”While it is too early to know for sure, interviews with industry experts and investors suggest that few hedge funds had the foresight, dexterity and most of all the courage to counter conventional wisdom and go long on financial stocks last week.On the other side of the equation, various large funds — no names have yet surfaced — appear to have been hit hard by betting against financial stocks. Market participants say it was the frantic covering of the short positions by these funds that propelled stocks up late last week.Some funds were already down for the year. One of the main funds for Atticus was down 30 percent through August. Other big funds down for the year include GLG Partners, down close to 15 percent so far this year.In London, some managers have whispered that they may sue the Financial Services Authority, the British regulator, for temporarily outlawing short-selling against financial firms, one of their basic investment tools.But hedge fund investors also say that with many funds nursing negative returns of as much as 30 percent this year, the appetite for taking bold, risky bets and losing everything has waned.“Why would you take the risk of not getting paid 2 and 20 percent next year?” asked one fund executive, referring to the lush pay structure of a 2 percent fee on all money invested and 20 percent of all profit that successful hedge funds award themselves.A hedge fund manager in New York bluntly conveyed the sense of panic that has coursed through Wall Street in recent weeks.“Essentially, work has been like living through a financial version of ‘A Nightmare on Elm Street,’ ” he said. “There’s lots of panic, blood and screaming. You slay the evil monster, and everything is O.K. But then you wake up and there’s lots of panic, blood and screaming. Rinse and repeat.”So while many funds may have been hurt badly by the ban on short selling, it is also true that the size of investments and the amount of leverage used have come down markedly in recent months. These steps may well prevent a large-scale implosion, but they are unlikely to stem investor defections as well as a growing notion that the fat times for hedge funds and their investors are coming to an end.Hedge fund investors are critical of the short-selling ban, saying that it will take liquidity out of the market. Some ask, sarcastically, if a prohibition on buying financial stocks will follow during the next bull market.But it is also worth asking why so few were in a position to benefit from the recovery last week.That is partly a result of an increasing propensity of funds to hunt in large packs. The strategy of betting against financial stocks had been a money winner for so long that few funds seem to have made a countermove.Some point to another factor: The collapses of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers cut close to bone. Many hedge funds had been customers and trading partners of the fallen companies. Several had close friends there, too, which overwhelmed their ability to think with the dispassion that characterizes elite investors.Accepted wisdom in hedge fund enclaves like Greenwich, Conn., and the Mayfair district of London contends that hedge fund operators benefit from volatility because they can use their wits, flexibility and access to borrowed money to take advantage of sharp market dislocations.But what the last week has shown is that some dislocations are too much for even the best minds in finance to capitalize on.Investors say this is because the most violent moves came in the middle of the week, catching many by surprise and laying ruin to carefully cultivated investment strategies. Indeed, the 30 to 40 percent increases for many financial stocks was evidence that the quick change in sentiment — the hint of a bailout fund and the ban on short-selling — caught many hedge funds with short positions, forcing them to become instant buyers.And even many hedge funds that do not short stocks had long ago pared their holdings in financial stocks. They quickly reversed course when they sensed they were moving upward.It is still uncertain whether the Treasury’s bailout plan and the ban on shorting financial stocks will result in a long-term recovery. The financial environment for banks and brokerage firms remains sickly, with past profit generators like trading, underwriting and advising all slumping. A new climate of regulation and increased government participation in the markets will also curtail the freewheeling actions of bankers.“Anyone who borrows short and lends long does not have a friend these days,” said Andy Brown, chief executive of Cedar Rock Capital, a money management firm that does not invest in investment banks because of their use of leverage. “Has that changed? I just don’t know.”'"
"'08-09-22,'0','Whatever entity the Treasury is contemplating to purchase mortgage-backed securities held by financial institutions, the fact that it will directly purchase securities will set an important precedent for creation of a market liquidity provider that can act proactively, not merely reactively, after the damage is done.By acting at the outset of a market panic, a market liquidity provider can profitably invest in securities at a deep discount from the market price and still provide a “floor” to how low the market will drop. Had a market liquidity provider been in existence when the subprime crisis started, the resulting collapse of the credit markets would almost certainly have been restricted in scope and lessened in impact, and we would not now be facing the need to try to save A.I.G. and other institutions.Senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in WashingtonThe Treasury’s new plan for stabilizing the financial system has already made a sharp impression on financial markets and the public consciousness. Yet little has been revealed about how the plan will work.The Resolution Trust Corporation of the early 1990s provides scant guidance on how to proceed. That company was designed to sell assets the government had acquired by honoring deposit insurance at savings and loans. But the objective now is to buy assets. The challenge is picking the best means of doing so. What should the government buy, from whom, in what quantity and at what price?The Treasury plans to purchase mortgage-related debt, which lies at the heart of the crisis. Yet this approach has significant disadvantages.First, mortgage-backed securities and derivatives of these securities are not all alike. Reverse auctions within broad debt classes would be risky, because current holders would try to unload the lowest-quality securities within each class. Relying on the judgment of hired investment firms to pick prices and quantities has the potential for inefficiency, unfairness and abuse.Second, buying troubled debt provides the most help to firms that made the worst investments. Banks that stayed clear of bad debt or cut their losses early would receive little or no gain, while banks with the weakest balance sheets would reap the biggest rewards. Not only is this unfair, it would dampen the impetus for restructuring the financial sector to give a smaller role to institutions and business models that have failed.Third, taxpayers would take on significant risk but see limited potential gain — in contrast with the rescues of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and A.I.G., where taxpayers got large equity stakes.An alternative approach is to make equity investments in a wide range of financial institutions. If the government offered each bank an investment equal to a given percent of its market value in exchange for a corresponding equity stake, the problems I listed above would be avoided. And because the government would be a minority shareholder, it would not directly manage or control these banks. This approach raises its own concerns that would need to be addressed, but it is a more promising starting point.Political leaders recognize that more than improvisation is needed to cope with the collapse of the housing market and the financial market crisis in its wake. Before they turn to the details of draft legislation, however, they had better settle on what they are trying to accomplish.Helping households in distress is a retail business, requiring decisions on a mortgage-by-mortgage basis. Similarly, negotiating with individual financial firms about their mortgage holdings takes time and infrastructure. Such negotiations put the government at a decided disadvantage because the other side in the transactions has more information about each asset.In both cases, politicians will have trouble establishing boundaries for assistance. While about one in 15 households with mortgages is now late in making payments, many more have suffered wealth losses. Builders, too, are in distress. And there are tens of thousands of financial institutions in the country, almost all of which have some impaired loans on their books.The unpleasant reality is that time is short, resources are stretched and many of the nation’s urgent needs are unmet. Because government funds are not unlimited, legislation should focus on the immediate problem of the strains in financial markets.Providing aid to large financial firms is distasteful, especially when remembering their excesses and the time when their managers were considered masters of the universe. But those firms hold the larger economy hostage. As long as they are unwilling to support market functioning and make new loans, spending will sag and asset prices will slide.The Congress should authorize the Treasury to purchase asset-backed securities in the secondary market and mortgages through auctions. For assets where it might not have all the information it needs, the Treasury could demand a slice of equity in the selling firm as well. As has been the case since its inception, the Federal Reserve can act as fiscal agent, making some of the purchases directly and supervising outside managers where special expertise is needed.The election calendar narrows the window of action and provides reason to keep the draft legislation simple. The assets acquired this year will certainly not be sold before a new administration and Congress are in power. Thus, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to make decisions on what to do with those mortgage assets.'"
"'08-09-22,'0','While Mr. Paulson has agreed with that argument, the Bush administration is also leaning on foreign governments to pitch in with bailout programs of their own as needed. “We have a global financial system and we are talking very aggressively with other countries around the world, and encouraging them to do similar things, and I believe a number of them will,” Mr. Paulson said on Sunday.The request is expected to be discussed during a conference call among Group of 7 finance ministries scheduled for Sunday evening, a European official said.Allowing foreign banks to participate in the federal rescue package has not yet drawn widespread scrutiny in Congress, where a number of lawmakers, including Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, have acknowledged that millions of American citizens do business with UBS, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and many other foreign-based banks in the United States.But a number of lawmakers are wary that such an extension may worsen what could ultimately turn out to be a trillion-dollar bailout for Wall Street.“I’m skeptical of the bailout, the whole bill is only a couple of pages long,” said Representative Scott Garrett, Republican of New Jersey, who is a member of the House Financial Services Committee. As for the participation of foreign banks, Mr. Garrett said: “I have a concern with it, they probably should be treated differently, but Congress is really not getting any say.”Christopher Whalen, a managing partner at Institutional Risk Analytics, said that Mr. Paulson needed to justify why a wider bailout was in the national interest.“Can you imagine the Congress floating a bailout for Deutsche Bank or UBS? It is the responsibility of the German or Swiss government,” he said. “We shouldn’t be bailing them out.”While politicians in the United States may emphasize the benefits for banks based overseas, the definition of what is a European or American bank has blurred in recent years with the growth of global giants like HSBC, Barclays and Deutsche Bank.Deutsche Bank, for example, became a major player in the United States with its acquisition of Bankers Trust in 2001. It has written down more than $11 billion in investments linked to the subprime crisis.Barclays, meanwhile, is on course to buy a significant portion of the North American operations of Lehman Brothers, the 158-year-old firm that filed for bankruptcy protection last week, helping to set off the global financial panic that forced Washington to act.Gaining access to the relief was a top priority for European foreign financial institutions with banking operations in the United States, according to officials in industry and government.They argued that the reputation of Wall Street and the United States government would suffer immensely if properly licensed foreign banks in the United States were shut out of the system.“Who would open a bank again in the United States?” asked one executive of a major European bank who has been following the discussions.At the same time, it was unclear how much European governments would bow to the Treasury Department’s encouragement to set up national programs to deal with their own vast mortgage problems. Real estate markets in Britain, Spain and Ireland have been particularly hard-hit as their own housing market bubbles — which grew in tandem with America’s — have collapsed.Other governments have struggled to get budget deficits under control in the last few years. The German government, for example, has discouraged talk of a stimulus package, and British officials said Sunday that they were not working on a plan like that of the United States.Robert Kelly, chief executive of the Bank of New York Mellon, said the central bankers around the world would probably be scrutinizing the American bailout proposal. “I would expect every finance minister is looking closely at what is happening in the United States, trying to hypothesize what the impact will be, and is thinking about the tools the Fed and Treasury have used,” he said. “I would not be surprised, and probably expect, some of those tools to be used in Europe as well.”If the plan is approved in Congress and is signed into law, the benefits would be large for European banks with licensed operations in the United States, which incurred major losses from mortgage-linked securities.UBS, the Swiss giant, has been among the hardest-hit institutions in the world; both its chairman and chief executive left amid more than $40 billion in write-downs. Even so, it still retains roughly $20 billion more in potential exposure to the troubled American housing market.If a battle does develop in Congress over foreign participation, UBS, among others, is poised to make just these arguments. Officials at the Zurich-based giant point out the bank employs more than 30,000 Americans, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and owns two broker-dealers registered under United States laws, UBS Securities and UBS Financial Services, better known to Americans as the former Paine Webber unit.“These are Americans who work in New York,” said one executive who requested anonymity because the American plan was still in development. “And they are working for a bank that was incorporated in the United States.” One senior Wall Street executive said he believed that the proposal would apply to other institutions with regulated American entities. Credit Suisse, for example, includes the old First Boston Corporation, though that name was dropped years ago. He said the biggest issue being debated was what securities would be included in the proposal, and how the actual mechanism to buy them would work.In Asia, the plan to purchase distressed assets drew little reaction over the weekend. Asian banks generally have not invested significant assets in American mortgage-backed securities.The bigger question in Asia, bankers said, lies in how the American legislation will affect HSBC, the large British-based bank with significant operations in Asia. The bank’s American subsidiary was a large buyer of mortgages over the last decade, and kept many of these mortgages on its books instead of trying to repackage and resell them as mortgage-backed securities.Richard Lindsay, a spokesman for HSBC, said that senior management was still evaluating the situation and said it was a “positive step forward but it won’t solve the problems of an overleveraged industry.”'"
"'08-09-22,'0','As a Catholic, I will not base my vote on the single issue of abortion. There are other issues, like reducing poverty and improving access to health care, that my faith teaches me are important. Also, I do not believe that a vote for either candidate is going to make much difference in the abortion fight.The abortion issue is going to be determined at the state level, and not by what is done or not done in Washington. If Roe v. Wade is overturned, it would still be up to the states to decide how much to restrict abortion.And there is not enough support in the country and in Congress for passage of a constitutional amendment restricting abortion. Robert HanlonSarah Palin is anti-abortion; she is not pro-life. The Catholic Church’s definition of pro-life is respect for life “from the moment of conception until death.” This stance does not support capital punishment; Ms. Palin does support capital punishment.Merely overturning Roe v. Wade will not stop abortions — just as an alcoholic will not stop drinking merely by mandate.Tunneling our voting into a one-issue choice not only debilitates our freedom to vote, but also disregards the other issues that need serious surgery.My foolish fellow Democrats have found a sure-fire formula for losing presidential elections: wholeheartedly support abortion rights, thereby driving more and more Catholics out of the Democratic Party.This exodus guarantees that Republicans win the White House. It looks as if it is happening again this year. When will the Democrats ever learn?The writer served in the Rhode Island Senate, where he was Democratic majority leader, and is the author of “Can a Catholic Be a Democrat?”I am a pro-life Catholic. I believe that life begins at conception and that ending it at any stage is murder.Each election season, abortion is viewed by many Catholics as a reason to support the Republican, and some believe that voting for a candidate who supports abortion rights to be as grave as the sin itself.The American people have suffered morally under the leadership of President Bush. The war in Iraq has cost thousands of lives, and we have turned our backs on the neediest of our people. Greed has become a virtue and war a symbol of patriotism.When we walk into the voting booth, we must not be fooled into thinking that a candidate’s views on abortion are the only factor. If we do, we are not only ignoring the example of Jesus; we are also enabling the Republican policies that have caused so much despair to continue. Mary Giordano'"
"'08-09-22,'0','“In the last couple weeks, you could smell the fear in New York,” said Martin Sorrell, chief executive at the WPP Group, which owns agencies like Grey, JWT and Ogilvy & Mather, as “institutions that were regarded as invincible have gone down or had to be bailed out.”“The scale and the speed of all that have shaken people’s confidence,” he added, and it could affect attitudes “for the rest of the year going into next year.”The advertising industry, including giants WPP, has typically used layoffs or other cutbacks to get through tough times. No one is announcing widespread dismissals at the moment, but throughout 2008 — a bumpy year even before the Wall Street crisis — there have been layoffs at agencies around the country.“The volatility in the financial markets is clearly creating uncertainty for both marketers and consumers,” said Michael I. Roth, chief executive at the Interpublic Group of Companies, which owns agencies like Draft FCB, McCann Erickson and R/GA.“This will require us to focus even more closely on helping our clients navigate through this environment,” Mr. Roth said, “and at the same time managing our business efficiently.”The biggest challenge, executives say, is trying to keep up with the stunning economic and financial events and the resulting mood swings, as evidenced by the roller-coaster ride from the despair of Wednesday to the euphoria of Friday. All that makes it difficult to determine how to best persuade shoppers to open their wallets.“Right now, there are nothing but question marks,” said David Sklaver, president at KSL Media, a media planning and buying agency.“Every time you think all the shoes have dropped on Wall Street, another one drops,” he added. “There are more shoes in this closet than Imelda Marcos’s.”The result is that “we have to batten down the hatches for the near term,” Mr. Sklaver said. “For every client, it’s constantly trying to understand who their best customer is, and building a fence around that customer, treating that customer better than ever before.”One lesson learned of late, according to Mr. Sklaver, is that advertisers and the media can no longer “treat the wealthy as a mass market” — that is, expect robust growth to continue indefinitely in sales of high-end products like luxury goods at upscale stores.“Premium products were unassailable,” Mr. Sklaver said, but the trouble on Wall Street suggests that “they’re not enough to support the economy.”The decline in sales of expensive items has been one factor contributing to a slowdown in demand this year for commercial time and advertising space, even with the stimulation of the so-called quadrennial effect of the Summer Olympics and the presidential election.For instance, the Nielsen Monitor-Plus division of the Nielsen Company reported last week that ad spending in the first half of 2008 fell 1.4 percent compared with the same period a year ago. The laggards included ads in national magazines, down 3.1 percent; national newspapers, down 8.1 percent; and spot radio, down 10.1 percent.“The health of the advertising economy depends on the health and vigor of consumer spending,” said Jon Swallen, senior vice president for research at TNS Media Intelligence, a unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres that will announce its data for the first half on Tuesday.“To the extent the financial mess forestalls a general economic recovery and makes consumers feel antsy,” Mr. Swallen said, “a recovery in ad spending is being pushed farther out into the future.”Another reason ad spending may decline is the shake-up in the ranks of the financial marketers. Although companies like Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch are not major advertisers, the extent of changes, including potential mergers and consolidations, among those that are “could in the long term mean less money spent,” Mr. Swallen said.For some, that is also the case in the short term. For example, A.I.G. decided to discontinue its brand and corporate ads, which carry the theme “The strength to be there” — a message clearly thrown into question by the federal government’s bailout of the insurer.The A.I.G. business units are still advertising products like auto insurance, said Charlie Armstrong, senior director for advertising and global branding at A.I.G., adding that for the A.I.G. brand “we are actively exploring messages and communications that would be appropriate for this environment.”Still, New York Life is not the only financial marketer to increase its advertising presence.An ad for Rockefeller & Company promises “Responsible and stable wealth management through turbulent times.”An ad for Wachovia Securities asks investors to “Think long term,” adding: After 120 years, it’s second nature to us.”And an ad for AXA Equitable says, “in these chaotic times, there is a financial services company dedicated to redefining commitment.”The AXA ads, which began running on Tuesday, were developed over the last few weeks. “The important thing is to reassure people,” said Barbara Goodstein, executive vice president for marketing, that although “it’s scary out there, we are a company that’s financially stable.”“That’s why we’re visible,” she added. “We’re comfortable being vocal at a time like this.”It is a smart strategy for those financial institutions that are stable, said David Haigh, chief executive at Brand Finance, a brand consulting company.“When everyone’s reeling is the time for strong banks to talk,” Mr. Haigh said. “You want to know you’re with a bank that’s not going to go bust on you.”Analysts note that many financial advertisers had started shrinking their budgets a year ago, when the problems with bad debt began roiling Wall Street. As a result, many media companies have already absorbed some of the blows.“The financial ad category, when you look at the numbers, has been under pressure for a year,” said Vivek Shah, president of the Fortune Money Group at Time Inc., part of Time Warner. Ad spending, he added, has been “a leading indicator, not a lagging indicator.”The magazines under Mr. Shah have adjusted their approaches, he said, to attract more advertisers in categories like technology.Many of the most troubled companies were not large advertisers, however, because they sought corporate clients rather than consumers. Lehman Brothers spent only $259,000 to buy ads in the first quarter, according to TNS Media Intelligence, and Merrill Lynch spent $4.9 million. By comparison, TNS figures show that Bank of America spent $134.3 million in the same period.It is unclear what the ad plans are for the Merrill Lynch brand after the Bank of America acquisition goes through; the brand name is to be retained on several units.“It’s too soon to talk about any of those types of decisions,” said Joseph L. Goode, a spokesman for Bank of America. If the last week did not bring horrible news for media companies, neither did it bring good news. Financial advertisers made up 21 percent of the advertisers at national newspapers in 2007, according to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company of TNS Media Intelligence data. And they accounted for 20 percent of Internet display advertising in 2007.“The financial sector is a radically restructuring sector,” said Chris Rohrs, president at the Television Bureau of Advertising, who is also keeping a wary eye on automotive and retail, two other big ad categories for local TV stations.The strengths of those categories “are entirely about confidence and the availability of credit,” Mr. Rohrs said. “We’ve had no confidence and a shutdown of credit.”Even before last week, the bureau had forecast that revenue for TV spots in 2009 would decline by 2 to 5 percent compared with 2008.Likewise, Mr. Sorrell of WPP had previously forecast that next year would be a difficult one for the advertising economy. “What happened in the last few days will make life a little tougher,” he said, “but not much tougher than we thought it would be anyway.”'"
"'08-09-22,'0','The Bratz dolls, a frequent target of those who bemoan the hyper-sexualization of young girls, have taken another hit.Scholastic Inc., the children’s publisher, will no longer include chapter books based on the overtly sexy Bratz dolls in any of its school book clubs or fairs this year — and an advocacy group is taking credit for the decision.The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, based in Boston, said that Scholastic’s move followed an 18-month fight to purge book club fliers that go home with students and are distributed at school book fairs of titles like “Lil’ Bratz: Dancin’ Divas” and “Lil’ Bratz: Catwalk Cuties.” Scholastic has also stopped offering spinoff products, like a Bratz computer game and designer stencil kit, in its book clubs and fairs.Susan Linn, director of the campaign, said the group’s members had sent 5,000 e-mail messages to Scholastic protesting the highly sexualized images in the Bratz books and products. “When schools send these book club fliers home with children,” Ms. Linn said, “the message is that ‘We think these are fine and are good for your child.’ ”Scholastic, which generates roughly a third of its revenue from the book clubs and fairs, said its decision to withdraw the Bratz books was influenced as much by dwindling sales as it was by the campaign’s push. Judy Newman, president of Scholastic Book Clubs, said she also solicited the opinions of editors, teachers and librarians to help choose the titles included in the book clubs and fairs.'"

"'08-09-23,'0','It goes on to say, “Any funds expended for actions authorized by this Act, including the payment of administrative expenses, shall be deemed appropriated at the time of such expenditure.”Slowly but surely, as new versions of the bill are making the rounds in Washington, some legislators are pressing to include new language to give them at least a modicum of oversight. Democrats have complained that the bill gives the Treasury Department “a blank check” — and they’re right.But given the rush to push the bill through, even if Congress cobbles together some oversight language, it will almost surely be inadequate. Joshua Rosner, a managing director at Graham Fisher & Company, says TARP should stand for “Total Abdication of Responsibility to the Public.” He says it is “a clear abdication of all Congressional oversight and fiscal authorities to a secretary of Treasury that has bungled this crisis from the beginning.”He argues that the bill grants “greater powers to the secretary of the Treasury than even the president enjoys.”The bigger issue is that the bill effectively creates protections not just for the Treasury, but for the executives on Wall Street who created this near Armageddon. Mr. Rosner says that the draft bill “prevents judicial review that could allow the protection of decisions that create false marks, hide prior marks, or could be used to prevent civil or criminal prosecution in situations where a management knowingly provided false marks that aided the growth of this crisis of confidence.”False marks — using mark-to-market accounting to hide the true value of security, rather than disclose it honestly — has a lot to do with why Jeffrey Skilling, the former Enron chief executive, is in jail.It is absolutely true, of course, that Mr. Paulson needed to do something. By Thursday afternoon, less than 48 hours after the bailout of the American International Group, the financial system was near meltdown. The mere rumor that Mr. Paulson and the Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke were devising a big bailout fund cause the stock market to soar.In truth, I’m not sure I agree with Mr. Rosner’s assessment of Mr. Paulson’s job performance. I think he is one of the most competent Treasury secretaries we’ve ever had, and it is hard to imagine anyone else handling this crisis any better. His predecessors, who lacked his grounding in the world of high finance, would most likely have been like deer in headlights.And when Mr. Paulson says, as he did on all the talk shows on Sunday, “I hate the fact that we have to do it, but it’s better than the alternative,” I believe him. (It would have looked better, of course, if he had come up with this plan before it looked as if his former firm, Goldman Sachs, was in jeopardy.)But the question on the table now is whether the government’s latest response to this crisis — the way it has been constructed, and frankly, the way it is being crammed down everyone’s throat at the eleventh hour — is the right approach. Already the market has its doubts; just look at its performance on Monday.Let put aside the bill’s most offensive aspect — the raw power it gives the Treasury Department, and the lack of oversight it provides — and take a closer look at the practicalities. First off, there is nothing in the bill that will prevent these problems from happening again. The bill doesn’t address adding greater transparency in investments in subprime loans and securities and credit derivatives, which led directly to the debacles at Lehman and A.I.G. The bill does nothing to rein in the credit-default swap market, which has turned out to be the weapon of financial mass destruction that Warren Buffett always said it was.Nor are the Democrats going to help matters with their own changes. It is all well and good that they hope to use the bill to restrain executive compensation, and add stipulations to help people in danger of losing their homes. But nothing the Democrats have suggested so far tackles the core issues of oversight, transparency or regulation.Of course, the sickest part is that Wall Street is lining up at the trough for a piece of the action, lobbying to run some of the $700 billion fund — and take huge fees — for their own mess.However the bailout is structured, no matter what safeguards are put in place, it is likely to be a conflicted mess. How can we possibly trust that the price the government agrees to buy the securities will be fair?And then there is the jockeying among the banks so they can sell their absolute worst stuff to the government — even loans that have nothing to do with mortgages — and change the rules in the process. The Financial Services Roundtable, which represents big financial services companies, wrote an e-mail message to members on Sunday suggesting, laughably, that “the government bid for the assets should not count as a mark-to-market value for accounting purposes.”In other words, if the government drives a hard bargain — as it should — the banks don’t have to take write-downs based on the price the feds pay to take junk off their balance sheets.Watching Wall Street double-dip makes even some in the industry’s top tier cringe.“Maybe I should move to Russia,” one titan of finance said to me. “It’s obscene, the whole thing. I’m embarrassed for myself.”Actually, I’ve got a better suggestion: Venezuela.On Friday last week, Hugo Chávez, the Socialist president of Venezuela, gave a speech in Caracas where, according to Reuters, he said, “The United States has spent $900 billion, four times what the Venezuela produces in a year, to try to boost the troubled finance system and housing market.”Gloating, he added: “They have criticized me, especially in the United States, for nationalizing a great company, CANTV, that didn’t even cost $1.5 billion.”'"
"'08-09-23,'0','The vast majority of subprime mortgages — 90 percent or more, by some estimates — are inside giant pools, or trusts, which have in turn sold bonds with different levels of seniority to institutional investors around the world.Even if the government acquires hundreds of billions of dollars worth of mortgage-backed securities, finance experts say, the Treasury Department would be unlikely to acquire all the bonds tied to a particular mortgage pool. And if the government did not own all those bonds, it might not have the power to demand changes in the underlying mortgages.“We are literally spending hundreds of billions of dollars on subsidies for financial institutions,” said Christopher Mayer, a professor of real estate finance and vice dean at the Columbia School of Business. “This won’t do anything to help the housing market. This plan is about buying mortgage-backed securities, not mortgages, and there is a big difference.”Amanda D. Darwin, a partner at the law firm of Nixon Peabody who specializes in both bankruptcy and securities law, said the Treasury Department was likely to become bogged down in legal problems if it tried any relief more radical than the cautious framework adopted earlier this year by the American Securitization Forum, an industry group.“In order to modify loans beyond that framework, you have to have the consent of 100 percent of the holders of the affected securities,” Ms. Darwin said. And some of those investors, especially those holding senior securities that are shielded from many of the losses, may not want to sell out or make concessions.Because of that problem, House and Senate Democrats are also demanding that the final bill change the bankruptcy law to give troubled homeowners more bargaining power with their lenders.Proposals put forward by Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate banking committee, would allow bankruptcy judges to reduce a person’s loan amount or interest rate in much the way that bankruptcy judges decide how much money most other creditors receive.Under current law, bankruptcy courts have long been prohibited from touching the terms of mortgages on a person’s primary residence.Community advocates and consumer groups have argued for months that changing the law would cut through the tangle of legal conflicts involving most mortgages and give borrowers a big increase in their bargaining power with lenders.“That is by orders of magnitude the best thing that can be done to keep people in their homes,” said Eric Stein, senior vice president of the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit group based in North Carolina.On Monday, 30 community and consumer groups from around the country sent an open letter to lawmakers to press their case.“It is an illusion to assume that bailing out financial institutions is the same thing as providing relief to foreclosure-plagued American homeowners,” said the groups, which included the Consumers Union, the National Council of La Raza and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. “The only way to make sure that relief is achieved is to give Main Street Americans what they need: Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief.”But Mr. Paulson and the Bush administration remain firmly opposed to the proposal, known informally as a “cram-down,” saying it would frighten even more investors away from the mortgage market.The banking and securities industries, meanwhile, are fighting the change with all their might, as they did when it came up with the housing bill that was adopted in July.“Authorizing write-downs of mortgages by bankruptcy judges will increase the risks of mortgage lending at a time when the market is already struggling, and this will harm consumers,” wrote Floyd E. Stoner, a top lobbyist for the American Banking Association, in a statement on Monday.'"

"'08-09-23,'0','Even as the giants of Wall Street fall, a corps of small investment banks is hoping to carve a lucrative niche in the new financial landscape.The companies Jefferies & Company, Lazard and Evercore Partners compete with Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs to provide services like merger and acquisition advice to companies.In many ways, these small and midsize firms look like the Wall Street of old, before firms took on large amounts of leverage — or borrowed money — and began trading aggressively. The small firms have run into less trouble during the downturn because they did not become tangled in the mortgage mess.But even as they benefit from some of the turmoil, executives at the smaller banks are quick to say they feel bad for their larger peers.“I don’t take any comfort from the pain that the rest of the industry is feeling,” said Stephen S. Crawford, a former co-president of Morgan Stanley who along with others founded a boutique advisory firm in 2006 called Centerview Partners.It will be many months before the winners and losers of this cycle emerge. But industry analysts say that smaller companies may benefit as the larger players consolidate. The smaller firms may be more appealing places for top workers in the industry and may prove more nimble in their advice.“The goliaths will be so enormous that they won’t be able to provide the agility, the nimbleness and the elite service that the boutiques can do,” said Roger C. Altman, chief executive of Evercore.'"
"'08-09-23,'0','Investors seeking safety showed a preference for commodities like gold, moving away from Treasury bills. The moves implied that investors considered traditional hedges like precious metals to be more reliable than debt issued by the government, which could face a spiraling debt from the bailout plan.“The unknowns still seem to be ruling,” said Ryan Detrick, a strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. And Tom Bentz, an energy analyst at BNP Paribas, said, “What can I say? Every market is just out of control right now.”The concerns on Monday were centered on Washington, where President Bush urged Congress to pass the bailout package by the end of the week. The proposed legislation would provide sweeping powers to the Treasury Department to buy bad assets from financial firms.But Democrats have started questioning the plan, particularly the broad authority it seeks to confer on the Treasury. Some lawmakers said they wanted to include limits on executive compensation at financial firms and support for middle-class homeowners as part of the legislation.The administration and some Republican lawmakers warned about the consequences of a protracted political battle that could delay the plan. Questions also remained about who would place a value on the bad assets and whether taxpayers would ultimately be able to profit from the enterprise.Wall Street, meanwhile, remained in flux. With so much riding on the outcome of the political maneuvering this week, investors were wary of putting money into financial companies before having a more clear sense of the outcome. Shares of Bank of America, Citigroup and Wachovia all fell.Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 7 percent, and Morgan Stanley rose slightly after reports that Japan’s largest bank, the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, planned to buy a large stake in the bank.“We’ve seen such dramatic changes in the financial landscape in recent days, it’s understandable why there’s caution in the market,” said Martin van Vliet, an economist at the ING Group in Amsterdam.A ban on short-selling of financial stocks, or betting that their prices will fall, was enacted on Friday by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and several giants of the industry were added on Monday to the list of protected companies, including General Electric and General Motors.Shares of Microsoft rose after the company said it would increase its dividend and buy back up to $40 billion in shares.On the commodity markets, oil led the surge; in recent days it has reversed weeks of decline. Oil prices had been falling from their record set this summer as slowing economic growth hurt oil consumption. After spending more than six months above $100 a barrel, the price had fallen to $91.50 a barrel on Sept. 16. But the relief appeared to have been short-lived.Some experts said that the record on Monday, with a market that spiked as much as $25 a barrel at one point in a frantic last hour of trading, was an anomaly caused by thin trading and the fact that contracts to deliver oil in October expired at the end of the day.Trading is often more volatile when a contract is scheduled to expire because traders rush to cover their positions. The contracts traded on Monday represented less than 5 percent of those traded a week ago.“This is not speculation, but quite the contrary, it’s actually a lack of liquidity,” said Roger Diwan, a managing partner at PFC Energy in Washington. “It’s a fluke.”The New York Mercantile Exchange briefly halted electronic trading after prices breached the $10 daily limit, but trading resumed a short time later after the limit was increased to $20.The spike in commodity prices came amid a heated debate over the effects of market deregulation and financial speculation on commodities. Stepping ahead of any potential criticism, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it was “closely monitoring” the oil price movement.The commission’s “enforcement staff will scour today’s trading activity to determine whether anyone engaged in illegal manipulative activity,” Stephen J. Obie, the acting director of that division, said in a statement. “No one should be trying to game our nation’s commodity futures markets.”The benchmark 10-year Treasury bill was down 6/32, at 101 11/32, and the yield, which moves opposite its price, was 3.84 percent, up from 3.81 percent late Friday.Some investors said they were heartened by the steps the government took last week, although they cautioned that the crisis had not passed. “What has happened is a step in the right direction, and it feels like we’re at the beginning of the end of the crisis,” Mr. van Vliet said. “But it’s going to be a long road.”Following are the results of the auction on Monday of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:'"
"'08-09-23,'0','The announcements also leave the industry looking similar to its framework in the 1930s, before the Glass-Steagall Act separated investment banking from commercial banking. Morgan Stanley moved quickly into the new era on Monday, announcing plans to sell up to a 20 percent stake in itself to the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan’s largest commercial bank, for about $8 billion.Mitsubishi has $1.1 trillion in bank deposits, which will help bolster Morgan’s stability of financing. Morgan Stanley had $36 billion in bank deposits as of Aug. 31 and also said it planned to add more by offering new retail banking services to clients and by making acquisitions.Goldman Sachs, whose former chairman, Henry M. Paulson Jr., has in his present role of Treasury secretary commandeered the current rescue of America’s troubled financial system, is also expected to increase its deposit base.Private equity money might also come to the rescue, after the Federal Reserve on Monday announced changes to rules that would allow these firms and other minority investors to own up to 33 percent of a bank’s equity up from 25 percent, as long as their voting block was less than 15 percent of shares. And these investors can for the first time openly influence decisions at the banks in which they invest.Investors reacted more positively to Morgan Stanley’s shift on Monday, pushing the bank’s shares down 12 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $27.09 after being in free fall last week. Shares of Goldman fell $9.02, or 7 percent, to $120.78, a move analysts attributed to the bank not announcing any new capital infusion.Lucas Van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, said the bank had no immediate plans to raise more capital, although it could do so to finance the acquisition of assets it viewed as attractive.Both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs already took customer deposits. Goldman, which will become the fourth-largest bank holding company, has $20 billion in deposits spread between the United States and Europe. The bank plans to move assets from other businesses, including its current lending business, giving it $150 billion in deposits. It also plans to widen its business through acquisitions and by attracting more high net-worth investing clients.Both banks may have to shed some assets to come into compliance with the rules that govern bank holding companies. For instance, they may have to sell commodity production facilities like power plants that they have owned in the past. But they will have up to five years to dispose of the assets and may be able to keep them in private equity subsidiaries.If Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were voracious in the world of investment banking, their focus on commercial banking could introduce new competition for existing commercial banks like Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, as well as smaller regional banks who will have to contend with two new giants on their doorstep.The new face of investment banking also threatens to eat away at the industry’s appeal among workers. The record bonuses of recent years at Wall Street firms look to be a thing of the past as firms like Goldman and Morgan Stanley lower their leverage and ability to produce stunning profits in areas like proprietary trading.In addition to slim bonuses this year, the value of workers’ savings in company stocks has plummeted at nearly every company on Wall Street. Commercial bank stocks do not tend to soar upward as fast as investment banking stocks and workers at the fallen investment banks are now worried their new parent companies’ structures will slow the rise of their stocks.Analysts said the real test for both firms would come if markets improved and opportunities to pump up profits returned.“There is no way to argue that they are going to be as profitable as they were before this,” said Meredith Whitney, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer. “There is a tremendous amount of regulatory scrutiny, micromanaging and red tape, and rightly so, that is part of the process in relation to taking in retail deposits. These guys will have a full-time highly involved chaperone in all of their activities.”Even before Wall Street was rocked by the current crisis, both firms had been reducing their reliance on borrowed money, or leverage, to drive returns in highly profitable areas like proprietary trading. But they were doing so in an environment where credit markets remained frozen, where there was much less opportunity to make big profits by taking huge risks.As early as March, both firms had also begun to examine the possibility of transforming themselves, preparing a large filing required to be submitted to the Fed to request bank holding company status.At the same time, executives publicly maintained there was no need to diversify their business toward commercial banking. As recently as last Tuesday, when Goldman Sachs announced a third-quarter profit of $845 million, David Viniar, the bank’s chief financial officer, said in an interview that he did not believe Goldman needed to change its current structure. “We believe this is not about the model,” he said. “This is about performance.”Colm Kelleher, Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer, also said recently that becoming a traditional bank holding company could be problematic because there would be new constraints on the way Morgan Stanley could deploy customer deposits to finance its other businesses.But the final decisions were essentially forced over the weekend as investors grew increasingly skeptical that either Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley could continue to function as an independent investment banks — something competitors including Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch could not achieve. Hedge funds also started moving balances away from both banks, a shift that might also have spurred the change in status, according to analysts.According to Mr. Hayes, after resisting change, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley realized they would ultimately be subject to greater regulatory oversight no matter what they did. With the global financial system on a precipice, the firms appear to have decided it made more sense to embrace the benefits and protections of being a more traditional bank, including permanent access to borrowing from the Fed and more stable funding bases of customer deposits.The firms will also be able to pledge a wider range of collateral to borrow from the Fed than they could as investment banks.“Goldman and Morgan went to the Fed and said ‘we want to be regulated by you?’ ” said Richard Portes, a professor of economics at the London Business School and president of the Center for Economic Policy Research. “Give me a break. They knew they’d have to accept increased regulation and lower levels of leverage. Given that, why not have the security that goes with it?”Executive at both banks said they were already in compliance with capital requirements imposed on bank holding companies. Goldman said it ended the third quarter with a Tier One capital ratio, a measure of equity against risk-weighed assets, of 11.6 percent, above the 6 percent required to be considered a “well capitalized” bank by Fed standards. Morgan Stanley had a Tier One ratio of 12.7 percent. Those figures are based on new international capital standards still being phased in by United States commercial banks.'"
"'08-09-23,'0','For Mr. McCain, who has sometimes struggled to connect with voters on the economy, the crisis offered a chance to strike a populist tone and buck an unpopular administration. Speaking to a largely Irish-American audience here, Mr. McCain called again for sharply curtailing payouts to the executives of firms that get taxpayer support, a step the administration has warned could limit participation in the program.“We can’t have taxpayers footing the bill for bloated golden parachutes like we see in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy,” Mr. McCain said. “My friends, the top executives are asking for $2.5 billion in bonuses after they ran the company into the ground.”Aides to Mr. McCain seemed to hold out the possibility that he could wind up opposing the bailout, though they said it was too soon to tell. “I think at this hour it’s a hypothetical question based on a package that doesn’t yet exist, as it is being put together,” Steve Schmidt, who runs day-to-day operations of the campaign, said in a conference call Monday morning with reporters.Rick Davis, Mr. McCain’s campaign manager, said on the same call that Mr. McCain was troubled by a provision being sought by the administration that would give the Treasury secretary near-total power, immune from the review of courts or agencies, to administer the bailout.Mr. Obama, in Green Bay, signaled his preference that Democrats and Republicans reach a bailout agreement swiftly — he twice said “this week” — but also called for greater oversight.Mr. Obama said he would bar members of an Obama administration from working on regulations or contracts that affected their former employers for two years. He also said he would press Congress to open up committee negotiations over the budget to the public, and he proposed spotlighting tax breaks for corporations on a Web site.He also proposed cutting federal spending on contractors by at least 10 percent, saying the government contracting system was rife with abuses and poor oversight, and estimated savings of $40 billion a year.If both Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain seemed to have found some common ground — both have said they want more oversight and restrictions on payments to executives whose firms are helped, and both have spoken vaguely about the importance that the plan helps homeowners — they have also drawn clear lines of political battle as the financial crisis has deepened.Mr. McCain has tried to portray Mr. Obama as lacking in leadership qualities, and Mr. Obama has sought to portray Mr. McCain as a longtime champion of the kind of deregulation that he said had led to the current crisis.“He’s trying to make up for 26 years in 26 hours, he’s flipping so fast,” Mr. Obama said to laughter from the crowd in Green Bay. “But with 42 days left, he’s had a sudden change of heart — an election-time conversion.”'"
"'08-09-23,'0','Had the Yankees not sent out the phonies, they could have done what was right for that time slot: pay tribute to Ruth. It is the House That Ruth Built, yet the Yankees seem reluctant to honor him. It is not enough that his daughter Julia Ruth Stevens threw out the first pitch. That was commendable and lovely. But 20 minutes devoted to the (nick)namesake of the soon-to-be-razed stadium is appropriate and overdue.It should have happened earlier this season. It should have happened Sunday night. The next available time will be at Closing Ceremony II, in November.You have to wonder about those internal meetings, at which the Yankees’ brass discussed how to handle Torre and Roger Clemens. Torre did nothing to deserve being omitted from the ceremony, and Clemens is in the midst of a scandal, despite never being announced as testing positive for banned performance-enhancing drugs.“A lot of great Yankees weren’t mentioned,” said Jason Zillo, a Yankees spokesman. “There was no slight intended. Perhaps in hindsight, they should have been mentioned.”Orlando Hernández, John Wetteland and Jesse Barfield (!?!) were mentioned, and Clemens should have been. The sight of the phony Stengel, Joe McCarthy and Miller Huggins marching on to the field was reason alone to cite Torre, even if the flesh-and-blood St. Joe was at work across the country. And with an old gent who looked exactly like Ralph Houk in the Yankees’ dugout Sunday night, he and Yogi Berra (but not the Stadium worker/skippers) could have made up a managerial category.The introductions of the Yankees’ storied retirees gave tingles, but we’ve felt that at Old-Timers’ Days and when all those Hall of Famers took their positions at the All-Star Game. YES’s camera work framed the most poignant moment of the night. David Mantle, who looks so much like his father, Mickey, and whose family has endured so much loss, was seen from a camera behind him, beckoning to Bobby Murcer’s family — his widow, Kay, and his children, Tori and Todd — as they walked toward him.There were only minor differences between ESPN’s and YES’s coverage, but ESPN had the advantage of carrying the game and of having Berra and Whitey Ford in the booth.Jon Miller and Joe Morgan asked softball questions of the old teammates, but they were incapable of giving the expected answers. When asked if Ford was the best pitcher in Yankees history, Berra said, “Not bad.” (Yogi nearly cursed at one point.) Ford recalled meeting Berra and Bobby Brown in 1946, before they were famous and nicknames were all that was needed. Ford remembered the scout Paul Krichell saying, “Larry, this is Eddie Ford and this is Bobby Brown.”ESPN generously invited Michael Kay, the YES broadcaster, to call part of the game, recalling the moribund tradition of home-team voices joining World Series crews. Kay is an ESPN Radio host, and he and John Sterling read the pregame introductions (which could have been pared by cutting the bios of some players).The celebration that began with mock Yankees ended with real ones trotting around the field, thanking fans. As moving as that gesture was, it wasn’t original. Cal Ripken Jr. did it when he played his 2,131st consecutive game to break the record of Lou Gehrig — who was represented Sunday by a worker making believe he was the Iron Horse.'"
"'08-09-23,'0','When Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Tsvangirai met on Thursday, Mr. Tsvangirai said, he proposed that their parties, the governing ZANU-PF and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, equally divide the most critical ministries, with, for example, Mr. Mugabe’s party retaining the army and the opposition taking the police. Given the broken economy, Mr. Tsvangirai said he believed that the opposition should pick the head of the Finance Ministry, but Mr. Mugabe did not agree.“They wanted everything, all the key ministries,” Mr. Tsvangirai said.There are signs that Mr. Mugabe, known as a canny, ruthless survivor of challenges to his authority, may be resisting genuine power-sharing. The question is whether he is still guided by the slogan he used during this year’s disputed election, still visible on posters: “This is the final battle for total control.”Mr. Mugabe left Harare on Friday to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York with an entourage that included his wife and son, but not Mr. Tsvangirai, who is supposed to become his partner in governing. Mr. Tsvangirai acknowledged that the authorities had yet to provide him with a passport some three months after he ran out of pages for new visa stamps, though he hopes they will soon.When informed that the American ambassador, James D. McGee, had said the United States had issued visas for 54 people in Mr. Mugabe’s entourage, Mr. Tsvangirai let out a long whistle of amazement.In a country where about a third of the people will be hungry and in need of food aid by next month, Eddie Cross, an official in the opposition party, was less circumspect. In a letter posted on a Zimbabwe blog, Mr. Cross wrote that Mr. Mugabe, oblivious to his people’s suffering, had simply packed his bags and departed with his entourage, “taking with them a pile of U.S. dollars to spend on 10 days of luxury and completely unproductive personal extravagance.”More worrisome to analysts here was a vituperative column on Saturday in the state-owned newspaper, The Herald. Journalists and politicians here widely assume that the author, who used the pen name Nathaniel Manheru, was George Charamba, Mr. Mugabe’s spokesman.The column said the power-sharing agreement had no legal force and might “collapse any day.” It said the deal gave the president the power to appoint ministers after consulting the prime minister and others. “He does not have to adopt their views,” the columnist wrote.But Mr. Tsvangirai said that what most disturbed him was language in the column that he said promoted hatred. It described his celebratory supporters gathering as their leaders “were further swelling their already distended stomachs.” The writer mocked the opposition for its euphoria over the prospect that Mr. Tsvangirai might become prime minister as the agreement itself specified.After an election season in which thousands of opposition supporters were beaten in state-sponsored attacks and more than 100 killed, opposition officials said they found another comment chilling. The columnist wrote that the deal’s provision for an independent audit of farms given out in an often violent land reform program “is sure to draw blood redder than the setting sun.”Mr. Tsvangirai was careful to say that he did not believe that the author spoke for Mr. Mugabe.Nonetheless, he added: “If what he has printed in the paper is the attitude of ZANU-PF, we might as well review our position. If that is the spirit in which we go into this marriage, it has finished before it has started.”Mr. Tsvangirai said he regretted that ministries were not divided between the parties before he and Mr. Mugabe signed their deal, but he said he had Mr. Mbeki’s assurances that the matter would be quickly resolved.Mr. Mbeki, however, may not be around to finish the job. Tomaz A. Salomao, executive secretary of the Southern African Development Community, which named Mr. Mbeki mediator, said Monday that the organization would not know if he would continue in that role until it was formally informed by South Africa.The opposition has long mistrusted Mr. Mbeki, believing he was an ally of Mr. Mugabe’s and hoping his likely successor, Jacob Zuma, backed by trade unions that have rallied behind Mr. Tsvangirai, might be more effective in pushing its cause.But in the end it was Mr. Mbeki who fashioned the deal that Mr. Tsvangirai signed. And it was Mr. Mbeki, attacked at home for a flawed legacy, who had much to gain by bringing Zimbabwe’s crisis to a peaceful end. But now with the political turmoil in South Africa, the question is whether it will be too distracted to attend to Zimbabwe’s problems.“There is no one within S.A.D.C. of Mbeki’s stature to engage the issues and knock heads together,” said Iden Wetherell, senior editor at The Independent, a newspaper in Harare. “I can’t see Zuma, with his complete absence of diplomatic experience and lack of familiarity with Zimbabwe’s crisis, playing the same role.”Mr. Tsvangirai said he believed that Mr. Mugabe would ultimately agree to a fair division of ministries and that regional leaders would help make that happen. “I’m very hopeful that the deal will come through and that we can start the process of rebuilding the country,” he said.A large card displayed in Mr. Tsvangirai’s study said, “I wish a long life to my enemies so they may see all my successes.” Mr. Mugabe has certainly had a long life, but whether he will live to see Mr. Tsvangirai wield real power has yet to be settled.'"
"'08-09-23,'0','There are substantive reasons for this discomfort, not least concerns that Mr. Paulson will pay too much, thus subsidizing giant financial institutions. Many economists argue that taxpayers ought to get more than avoidance of the apocalypse for their dollars: they ought to get an ownership stake in the companies on the receiving end.But an underlying source of doubt about the bailout stems from who is asking for it. The rescue is being sold as a must-have emergency measure by an administration with a controversial record when it comes to asking Congress for special authority in time of duress.“This administration is asking for a $700 billion blank check to be put in the hands of Henry Paulson, a guy who totally missed this, and has been wrong about almost everything,” said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. “It’s almost amazing they can do this with a straight face. There is clearly skepticism and anger at the idea that we’d give this money to these guys, no questions asked.”Mr. Paulson has argued that the powers he seeks are necessary to chase away the wolf howling at the door: a potentially swift shredding of the American financial system. That would be catastrophic for everyone, he argues, not only banks, but also ordinary Americans who depend on their finances to buy homes and cars, and to pay for college.Some are suspicious of Mr. Paulson’s characterizations, finding in his warnings and demands for extraordinary powers a parallel with the way the Bush administration gained authority for the war in Iraq. Then, the White House suggested that mushroom clouds could accompany Congress’s failure to act. This time, it is financial Armageddon supposedly on the doorstep.“This is scare tactics to try to do something that’s in the private but not the public interest,” said Allan Meltzer, a former economic adviser to President Reagan, and an expert on monetary policy at the Carnegie Mellon Tepper School of Business. “It’s terrible.”In part, Mr. Paulson’s credibility has been dented by his pronouncements in previous weeks that the crisis was already contained. Some suggest this was a well-intentioned effort to stem panic. But the aftermath complicates his quest for the bailout.“If you view your public statements as an instrument of policy, people don’t believe you anymore,” said Vincent R. Reinhart, a former Federal Reserve economist and now a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.The biggest point of contention is over whether and how taxpayers would benefit if the bailout succeeded in righting the financial system, sending banking stocks upward.In Mr. Paulson’s plan, the Treasury would have the right to buy as much as $700 billion worth of troubled investments, with the taxpayer recouping the proceeds when those investments were sold over coming years. But many economists — Mr. Elmendorf among them — argue that taxpayers should get more out of the deal, securing stock in the banks that make use of the bailout. The government could then sell off that stock at a profit when conditions improve. A similar approach was used successfully in Sweden in the early 1990s when its financial system melted down.Others argue that any bailout must pinch the people who have run the companies now needing rescue, along with their shareholders, addressing the unseemly reality that executives have amassed beach houses and fat bank accounts while taxpayers are now stuck with the bill for their reckless ways.“It absolutely has to be punitive,” Mr. Baker said. “If they sell us the junk, then we own the company. This isn’t a way to make these companies and their executives rich. This should be about keeping them in business so the financial system doesn’t collapse.”Other questions center on how to value what the Treasury aims to purchase — an issue that goes to the heart of the crisis itself.The financial system got to its dangerous perch by betting extravagantly on real estate. When housing prices began plummeting and borrowers stopped making payments, financial institutions found themselves with huge inventories of bad loans. Not simple loans, but complex investments created by pooling millions of mortgages together and then slicing them into pieces. These were the investments that Wall Street bought, sold and borrowed against in cooking up the money it poured into housing.The trouble is that these investments are so intertwined and complex that no one seems able to figure out what they are worth. So no one has been willing to buy them. This is why banks have been in lockdown mode: with mystery enshrouding both the value of their assets and their future losses, banks have held tight to their remaining dollars, depriving the economy of capital.Now, the Treasury aims to clear the fog by buying up these investments. But their value is as mysterious as ever.“There’s a tendency for people to think these are stocks and bonds and you know what the price is,” said Bruce Bartlett, a former White House economist under President Reagan. “The problem is people are operating in a world in which nobody knows what the hell is going on. There’s some naïve assumptions about how this would function.”If Mr. Paulson pays the market rate — whatever that is — that presumably would not be enough to persuade banks to sell. Otherwise, they would have sold already. For the plan to work, Treasury has to pay a premium.“It’s a straight subsidy to financial institutions,” said Martin Baily, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration, and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “You’re essentially giving them money.”Mr. Baily favors the basics of the Paulson plan, albeit with some mechanism that would give the government a slice of any resulting profits. And yet he remains troubled by the dearth of information combined with the abundance of zeroes in the bailout request.“I’d like a clearer statement of what we were afraid was going to happen that requires $700 billion,” Mr. Baily said. “Maybe they don’t want to talk about it because it would scare everybody, but it’s a bit much to ask.”'"
"'08-09-23,'0','Despite the progress, the rancor in Congress ratcheted up the pressure on Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, the architects of the proposal to let financial institutions, including some foreign firms, pass their most distressed assets to the United States Treasury.Both are scheduled to testify before the Senate banking committee on Tuesday morning, where they must now sell the bailout plan to dubious lawmakers and to an increasingly angry public. They will also appear before the House Financial Services committee on Wednesday afternoon.“I am concerned that Treasury’s proposal is neither workable nor comprehensive despite its enormous price tag,” Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, said in a statement. “It would be foolish to waste massive sums of taxpayer funds testing an idea that has been hastily crafted.”While Congressional leaders in both chambers said they were confident that they could reach a quick deal, it was also clear that Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke would face rough questioning and that initial support for the bailout had begun to fray. Some Democrats said they simply did not trust the president, and drew a parallel to Mr. Bush’s request for authority to wage war in Iraq.Some conservative Republicans also expressed outrage, echoing scornful comments by Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, and Lou Dobbs, the CNN anchor, among other right-leaning critics.Treasury officials brushed off the protests from influential Republicans like Mr. Shelby and said they were confident that Republican leaders could bring their members along. “We are making progress and have confidence that a plan will pass by the end of this week,” said Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for Mr. Paulson.The financial markets, however, reacted badly to the wrangling in Washington, with the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling 372 points.President Bush urged Congress on Monday to act fast. “Americans are watching to see if Democrats and Republicans, the Congress and the White House, can come together to solve this problem with the urgency it warrants,” he said in a statement. “The whole world is watching to see if we can act quickly to shore up our markets.”The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said Democrats were prepared to do so. “Democrats in the Senate aren’t going to drag our feet,” he said in a speech on the Senate floor. “We’ll respond with the urgency of action that this situation demands, but after eight years of fiscal dereliction of duty, it’s time for accountability.”“Should we resolve the issue in one day?” he asked. “I think not.”Republican leaders who support the administration’s plan warned the Democrats on Monday to exercise restraint and not slow the bailout package, even as they prepared for an aggressive internal campaign to rally Republican support.“When there’s a fire in your kitchen threatening to burn down your home, you don’t want someone stopping the firefighters on the way and demanding they hand out smoke detectors first or lecturing you about the hazards of keeping paint in the basement,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said in a speech on the Senate floor. “You want them to put out the fire before it burns down your home and everything you’ve saved for your whole life.”Mr. McConnell added: “The same is true of our current economic situation. We know that there is a serious threat to our economy, and we know that we must take action to try and head off a serious blow to Main Street.”House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, after a meeting with party leaders on Monday evening, said she, too, remained committed to getting a bill to the president as quickly as possible.But powerful lawmakers in both parties said they would not be rushed into granting Mr. Bush’s request.“I walked down LaSalle Street on Friday, a great street in Chicago lined with banks and big office buildings,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat. “A lot of people came up and said ‘hi.’ But a lot of them came up and said: ‘Are you really going to do this? $700 billion bailing out the banks? And I said: ‘I don’t know. At the end of the day, I just don’t know.’ ”Mr. Durbin, in a speech on the Senate floor, angrily recalled that the administration had similarly requested swift approval of its plan to attack Iraq. “Just as we should have asked more questions about weapons of mass destruction six years ago before we found ourselves in this war,” Mr. Durbin said, “we need to ask questions today about where this is leading.”Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California who leads the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said: “The taxpayer is being asked to risk billions to protect the bonuses of investment bankers.”The skepticism was equally palpable at the other end of the ideological spectrum.“This is going way too fast,” said Representative Mike Pence, Republican of Indiana and a conservative leader who said constituents he met this weekend were flabbergasted at the plan. “The American people don’t want Congress to make haste with the financial recovery legislation; they want us to make sense.”And Mr. Shelby, of the banking committee, said: “Congress must immediately undertake a comprehensive, public examination of the problem and alternative solutions rather than swiftly pass the current plan with minimal changes or discussion. We owe the American taxpayer no less.”Mr. Gingrich, the former House speaker, said he expected Republican lawmakers to oppose the plan in increasing numbers. “I think this is going to be a much bigger fight than he expected,” Mr. Gingrich said, referring to President Bush.In a sign of how complicated the negotiations over specific provisions of the bailout could become, Senator Mel Martinez, Republican of Florida, and a member of the banking committee, said that he would strongly support limiting the pay of executives whose firms seek government aid. But Mr. Martinez said he would oppose any effort to change the bankruptcy laws.In his prepared testimony, Mr. Paulson sought to underscore the huge risks to everyday Americans. “The market turmoil we are experiencing today poses great risk to U.S. taxpayers,” Mr. Paulson plans to testify. “When the financial system doesn’t work as it should, Americans’ personal savings, and the ability of consumers and business to finance spending, investment and job creation are threatened.”Mr. Bernanke, in his remarks, will implore the Congress to act. “Despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and other agencies, global financial markets remain under extraordinary stress,” he says in his remarks. “Action by the Congress is urgently required to stabilize the situation and avert what otherwise could be very serious consequences for our financial markets and for our economy.”Early on Monday, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, and chairman of the banking committee, introduced a 44-page draft bill that his staff pulled together on Sunday incorporating many priorities of Senate Democrats — a hefty counterproposal to the administration’s initial three page proposal.Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, and chairman of the Financial Services Committee, who had already submitted a series of demands to the Treasury, worked Monday to revise his version of the legislation to reflect various agreements with the administration on oversight and other issues.Officials said that the administration was also prepared to adopt conflict-of-interest rules for any private firms that are hired to help the Treasury manage the bailout program. Some lawmakers were worried that such firms might also own assets that could grow in value depending on how the rescue plan was run.Officials said there was also a deal to mandate that the government develop a plan to prevent foreclosures by renegotiating any mortgages that it purchases.Because the markets are eager for a final deal and because Congress is trying to adjourn for the fall elections, lawmakers are bypassing the normal committee process and working toward an agreement in hopes of votes in both chambers within days.And some lawmakers said it could be done. “We are convinced that inaction could be a disaster,” said Senator Robert Bennett, Republican of Utah. “We don’t believe that inaction is an option, so therefore we are going to do whatever we can to make sure that the action that is taken is as responsible and well thought-out as possible.”'"

The company said that it would continue to provide swimwear for colleges and sell to traditional retail customers, but that it would not compete against companies like Speedo for the world’s top swimmers. Nike said it made a “strategic decision as part of the company’s long-term growth plan.” At the Beijing Olympics, Speedo stole the spotlight with its LZR Racer suit. According to Speedo, 72 of the 77 world records set since the release of the suit in February have been by swimmers wearing LZR Racers — including Michael Phelps.'"
"'08-09-23,'0','Ms. Browne has received many thank-you cards recently, including two from clients whom she said she dissuaded from leaving their jobs 18 months ago for higher paying positions at Bear Stearns. “This was way before the rumblings of its demise,” she said. Bear Stearns, facing potential bankruptcy, was bought by JPMorgan Chase & Company in the spring and many of its workers lost their jobs.For the past several years, Ms. Browne has been big on gold as an investment. “An image comes into my head after someone asks me a question,” Ms. Browne explained. She recalled advising a client who had lost a lot of money but was able to earn it back by following her advice. “All I could see when I looked at him was gold bars, gold jewelry,” she said.In an apartment in the East Village, opposite Tompkins Square Park, another psychic, Rosanna Schaffer-Shaw, a former belly dancer, offers her insights under the name Fahrusha, which she translates from Arabic to mean butterfly or moth. “I prefer butterfly,” said Ms. Schaffer-Shaw, who specializes in tarot card reading and palmistry, as well as photograph interpretation and communicating with animals.“People are concerned about their jobs,” said Ms. Schaffer-Shaw, sitting in her brightly painted pink room devoted to readings, where she charges $150 per session. On a shelf were a couple of crystal balls, candles and a feather. “I hear more questions about jobs lasting even if the person is not in the financial sector,” she said.On a recent afternoon, Ms. Schaffer-Shaw advised three clients, all of whom requested that they be identified by a single initial, some because they worried that their turning to a psychic might cause problems at work.Mr. S was an artist who said he hoped to reap a windfall from the stronger market for contemporary art. Ms. Schaffer-Shaw told him, “In the past, you have been neglectful of the business aspects of your career.” Mr. S laughed and replied, “Have I ever,” as Ms. Schaffer-Shaw conjured up the names of Manhattan galleries that might be interested in his artwork.She pointed a lavender-painted fingernail to two tarot cards, the Six and the Nine of Pentacles: “This card says you are worried about your finances. You won’t want to spend money on luxury items. You also will not be able to be as generous to others as you would like.” She advised against buying stock in financial firms and urged him to consider investing in utilities or water purification systems.Ms. E, who is planning a business venture with another client of Ms. Schaffer-Shaw’s, a Chinese investment banker, asked questions about the Shanghai economy, where the two plan to open a frozen yogurt company. She wanted to know whether the media stock she had bought on the Chinese market would go up after its recent loss, and even what flavors and toppings her company should offer.Then there was Mr. P, who until recently held an executive position at a major financial firm at the center of the mortgage meltdown. “I don’t really know these companies,” Ms. Schaffer-Shaw admitted. “But I meditate on them, throw some cards on them. I always tell my clients there are no guarantees.”Mr. P appeared skittish sitting in an office chair across from Ms. Schaffer-Shaw. “I’ve used her in a number of situations, and she’s been remarkably accurate,” he said, explaining that he worries about medical coverage for his family. “Currently, I’m caught up in the chaotic financial situation. I am very concerned about my next move in regards to my personal portfolio.”Mr. P posed his first question: “Should I discontinue my relationship with my employer?” (He had been offered another position at the same firm.) Ms. Schaffer-Shaw laid out three cards. “Probably not,” she said. More questions: “Should I move to Puerto Rico?” “Should I write a book about what I know?” “Is there any possibility I will be in jail in five years?” “Is the information I know sufficient to protect me?” “Should I retire?”Sensing his anxiety, Ms. Schaffer-Shaw pointed to the cards and exclaimed, “You got the Ace of Happiness!” After Mr. P left, she said that while she was always straightforward about what she reads in the tarot cards, she tried to couch negative prognostications in positive terms and make clear to her clients the role free will plays in their lives. “When I see things are dismal, I feel compelled to make things better,” she said. “I tell people the truth, but I try to tell the truth on the upside. With an extraordinary will, a person can change their future.”'"
"'08-09-23,'0','Eager to project confidence in turbulent markets, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Nike announced plans separately on Monday to buy back a combined $53 billion of their companies’ stock, a move that could benefit shareholders and attract new investors.Microsoft said it would buy back $40 billion of its shares and raise its quarterly dividend by 2 cents, to 13 cents a share. Hewlett-Packard will repurchase $8 billion in shares, and Nike said it would buy back $5 billion.Repurchasing shares allows companies to reduce the number of shares available to the public. This causes the company’s earnings-per-share ratio, a common metric for financial performance, to rise, making the company appear more attractive.Buying back shares uses cash that could otherwise be invested in new products, innovation, marketing or other parts of the company meant to increase revenue. But it often leads to a rise in stock prices, which puts more money in the pocket of shareholders and company employees and executives whose compensation includes stock options.Stock prices, however, do not always increase. Both Hewlett and Nike are in the midst of a previous round of stock buybacks; at the end of July, Hewlett still had $3 billion left in a repurchasing plan announced in November 2007. During that period, the company’s stock lost about 13 percent of its value.'"
"'08-09-23,'0','The McCain campaign lashed out at The New York Times on Monday, accusing it of dropping its journalistic standards and being “150 percent in the tank” for Senator Barack Obama.In a conference call with reporters, Steve Schmidt, Senator John McCain’s senior campaign adviser, was asked about an article in The Times on Monday reporting that Mr. McCain’s campaign manager, Rick Davis, had been paid nearly $2 million by Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac to head a group devoted to defend the mortgage giants against the imposition of stricter regulations.Asked about the article, Mr. Davis, who was on the call, said the group’s sole function was to promote home ownership. But Mr. Schmidt criticized The Times for its coverage.“Whatever the New York Times once was, it is today not by any standard a journalistic organization,” Mr. Schmidt said. He added, “This is an organization that is completely, totally, 150 percent in the tank for the Democratic candidate, which is their prerogative to be.”He added, “Everything that is read in The New York Times that attacks this campaign should be evaluated by the American people from that perspective.”Bill Keller, executive editor of The Times, responded in a statement: “The New York Times is committed to covering the candidates fully, fairly and aggressively. It’s our job to ask hard questions, fact-check their statements and their advertising, examine their programs, positions, biographies and advisers. Candidates and their campaign operatives are not always comfortable with that level of scrutiny, but it’s what our readers expect and deserve.”'"
"'08-09-23,'0','The owners of an exotic animal park and one of its board members have been charged with evidence tampering for allegedly trying to cover up a tiger attack on a volunteer. The owners of Wesa-A-Geh-Ya in Warren County, Kenneth and Sandra Smith, and the board member, Roy Elder, initially led the sheriff’s department to believe that a pit bull attacked the volunteer, Jacob Barr, who had part of his leg amputated after the Aug. 3 mauling. Mr. Elder and Ms. Smith are accused of lying to investigators by saying a dog attacked Mr. Barr. Mr. Smith, who shot and killed the tiger, is accused of participating in a cover-up by moving its body to a different location. Ms. Smith said she had misled investigators because she feared that the park’s animals would be euthanized if the authorities learned the truth.'"
"'08-09-23,'0','The trial is being held a few blocks from the Atlanta courthouse where the first two people were killed. The prosecution sought to establish a connection for jurors between the room where they sat and the courtroom where Mr. Nichols killed a judge and stenographer.Kellie Hill, the lead prosecutor, played a chilling recording from the day of the killings. On the tape, the normal sounds of courtroom proceedings are shattered by gunshots and then a lawyer wailing: “Help me! Somebody help me!”Ms. Hill, no relation to Mr. Hill, the defense lawyer, personalized the four victims: Judge Roland Barnes of Superior Court as “a down-to-earth guy” who wore blue jeans under his robe; Julie Ann Brandau, the stenographer, as a single mother who baked cookies for colleagues; Deputy Hoyt Teasley as a hero who pursued Mr. Nichols without a bulletproof jacket; and David Wilhelm, an immigration official, as an innocent bystander.Defense lawyers focused on Mr. Nichols’s mental condition. Mr. Hill called the crimes “terrible, almost unspeakable,” but argued that Mr. Nichols was “swallowed whole” by thoughts of rebellion and self-grandeur.“These delusions were real for Mr. Nichols,” Mr. Hill said. “He believed in them the way that you believe ice is cold, night follows day.”One juror tried to quit the case on Monday, citing emotional, mental and dental problems, which were not explained. Judge James G. Bodiford of Superior Court ordered him to remain in the courtroom as a nonvoting juror, watching the case but not deliberating. It took nine weeks to select the jury of eight women and four men from 240 people questioned. The county has spent nearly $1 million on the case, and families of two victims have received $10.3 million in compensation from the county.“Nothing like this case has ever happened in Georgia before,” said Michael Mears, an Atlanta defense lawyer. “I think the expenses reflect that.”The original judge in the Nichols trial, Hilton M. Fuller Jr., resigned in January after telling a reporter for The New Yorker of Mr. Nichols that “everyone in the world knows he did it.”Before arguments began, Judge Bodiford rejected a defense request to postpone the trial and allow further review of the case’s 600 witnesses and 50,000 documents.“There’s got to be a deadline,” Judge Bodiford said, “I would think as much for Mr. Nichols as for the state.”'"
"'08-09-23,'0','“The absence of regulatory oversight is the principal cause of the Wall Street meltdown we are currently witnessing,” the governor said in a statement. “While I applaud the recent federal intervention to stabilize the market — and thus our entire economy — it is important we also take the next step as a nation by regulating areas of the market which have previously lacked appropriate oversight.”In an interview Monday, Mr. Paterson added that credit-default swaps were “the real problem with A.I.G.”“When we peeled back the onion, we found out that A.I.G. had so many credit-default swaps that we couldn’t calculate how much money they probably had wasted,” he said.Last week, Mr. Paterson’s administration allowed A.I.G. to borrow $20 billion from its own subsidiaries to help bolster its capital, not long before the federal government announced an $85 billion bailout. The credit crisis is expected to weigh heavily on New York, which derives a fifth of its tax revenue from Wall Street.Officials at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department had no immediate comment on the governor’s plan, or on his call for federal regulation. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, is scheduled to testify before Congress on Tuesday, and credit-default swaps are likely to be on the agenda.The governor said the state’s insurance department would begin regulating credit-default swaps as insurance products in cases where the buyer of the swap also owns the underlying bond it is meant to back.In those cases, only licensed insurers will be able to issue credit-default swaps. New guidelines will also increase minimum capital requirements and the reserves that financial institutions must maintain.Rules will also be aimed at preventing financial institutions from insuring too many bonds from a single source and will consider a number of different factors, including who originates the bonds and who services the debt.The Paterson administration said it would also limit insurers in guaranteeing collateralized debt obligations.Eric R. Dinallo, the New York State insurance superintendent, said that “the severity of this crisis was substantially increased by what the government chose not to regulate, principally credit-default swaps.”“We are providing an appropriate way for those with an insurable interest to protect themselves,” he said “and we are going to ensure that whoever sells them that protection is solvent, in other words, can actually pay the claims.”He added: “We will urge the federal government that there should be some sort of national regulatory system that manages credit-default swaps.”Tomasz Piskorski, an assistant professor of finance and economics at the Columbia Business School, said, “It’s a good idea to bring some light to this market, to impose some rules, some transparency and some standardization of the contracts and increase the likelihood that these contracts will be honored.”Mr. Piskorski said he did not favor many types of regulation, including the recent ban on some short-selling, but added that “this is one instance where it would be good to get some involvement of the federal authorities to draft some good rules.”Until recently, credit-default swap was a term little known beyond Wall Street. Mr. Paterson conceded as much during a meeting on Monday with editors and reporters of The New York Times.“I didn’t even know what a credit-default swap was until I read about it in The Economist about six months ago,” he said, adding, “I thought they should be regulated by the gaming industry, because it’s gambling.”'"
"'08-09-23,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — A San Francisco Superior Court judge sentenced a woman to 15 years to life in prison on Monday for her role in an infamous fatal dog mauling.The sentence came a month after the judge, Charlotte W. Woolard, reinstated a second-degree murder conviction against the woman, Marjorie Knoller, stemming from the 2001 attack that killed Ms. Knoller’s neighbor Diane Whipple. Ms. Whipple, a 33-year-old lacrosse coach, was attacked in the hallway of her building in January 2001 by Ms. Knoller’s two 120-pound dogs and bitten more than 75 times.A second-degree murder conviction against Ms. Knoller was thrown out in 2002 by the original trial judge, who said the evidence did not support the charge. She was sentenced instead to four years in prison for involuntary manslaughter and released on parole in 2004.But on Monday, Judge Woolard, who took over the case earlier this year, imposed the new sentence, which was hailed by Kamala D. Harris, the San Francisco district attorney. “This defendant is now facing the appropriate punishment,” Ms. Harris said.The mauling attracted widespread attention and was moved to Los Angeles in search of an unbiased jury.Ms. Knoller asserted that she had tried to protect her neighbor from the dogs, a powerful breed called Presa Canario. But prosecutors convinced a jury that Ms. Knoller was both aware of the dogs’ violent potential and blithe to other people’s safety. Ms. Knoller’s husband, Robert Noel, who was not present at the attack, was also convicted of involuntary manslaughter.'"
"'08-09-23,'0','Those who watched his debate performances during the long primary season say he improved markedly from a fairly shaky start but never really mastered the form.“During the course of 18 months, he learned to give shorter, crisper answers,” said Howard Wolfson, a top adviser to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton who helped prepare her for the two dozen debates she had with Mr. Obama and other Democratic candidates. “I think his command of facts, figures and anecdotes got consistently stronger.”One of Mr. Obama’s worst moments came in the first Democratic debate, in South Carolina in April 2007. The candidates were asked how they would respond to a new series of terrorist attacks.Mrs. Clinton gave a short answer, ending, “Let’s focus on those who have attacked us and do everything we can to destroy them.”But Mr. Obama gave a rambling reply on emergency response, intelligence flaws and the importance of engaging “the international community.” He had to ask for a second chance to answer the question in order to say he would go after the terrorists.Two months later he was on the defensive over a question of meeting without preconditions with the leaders of hostile states. He said that he would do so and that he disagreed with the Bush administration’s approach of not engaging with Iran, Syria, Cuba and North Korea. His rivals cited this as evidence of his naïveté in foreign affairs.Perhaps Mr. Obama’s single worst debate moment came early this January in New Hampshire, where Mrs. Clinton was asked why some people found her less likable than some of her rivals. She adopted a hurt tone and said of Mr. Obama: “He’s very likable, I agree with that. But I don’t think I’m that bad.”Mr. Obama looked at her and said coldly, “You’re likable enough.”In part because of a sympathy backlash, Mrs. Clinton went on to win the New Hampshire primary, keeping her candidacy alive.At a debate two weeks later, Mr. Obama apologized for the remark.From then on, Mr. Obama’s performances improved. At a debate in late January, Mr. Obama initiated a sharp exchange with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, criticizing her for sitting on Wal-Mart’s board while he was working as a community organizer in Chicago. But he seemed uncomfortable with the exchange and a few minutes later lightened a tense moment with his answer to a question about whether Bill Clinton had been the first “black president.”“I would have to investigate more Bill’s dancing abilities and some of this other stuff,” he said with a smile, “before I accurately judged whether in fact he was a brother.”And, though he focused largely on his Democratic rivals during most of the primary campaign, he said of Mr. McCain at a Democratic debate in January, “Somewhere along the line the Straight Talk Express lost some wheels.”In February, when Mrs. Clinton tried to goad him over his borrowing some speech lines, mockingly referring to “change you can Xerox,” he brushed off the swipe as part of the “silly season in politics.”By the final debate of the primary season, on April 16 in Philadelphia, Mr. Obama was both more polished and at times exasperated by the process. He was subjected to repeated severe questioning that night about the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., his association with William Ayers, a former member of the Weather Underground, and his refusal then to wear a flag pin. He endured the grilling, looking testy at times, but also won some points for empathy by recounting the stories of people he had met along the campaign trail, including a man in Latrobe, Pa., “who lost his job and was trying to figure out where he was going to get the gas money to go find a job.”Mr. Obama has been involved in high-stakes political debates since his first, unsuccessful race for Congress in 2000, when he took on a popular incumbent, Representative Bobby L. Rush of Illinois.In the sole televised debate of that campaign, he aggressively attacked Mr. Rush until the moderator cut him off. Mr. Rush dismissed his challenger as an upstart with no record to run on.“Just what’s he done?” Mr. Rush said, according to an account in “Obama: From Promise to Power,” by David Mendell. “I mean, what’s he done?”A deflated Mr. Obama went on to lose the election by 30 percentage points.In 2004, Mr. Obama was running for the Senate against Alan Keyes, a glib talk show host whom Republicans had imported from Maryland to oppose him after more credible candidates were disqualified by personal scandal.Mr. Obama’s aloofness and windiness were on display in a debate against Mr. Keyes, but he was able to cut through the verbal clutter on occasion to deliver a biting response to him.“Your logic was not that complicated,” Mr. Obama said to end one exchange on homosexuality and incest. “It’s just wrong.”On another occasion, Mr. Keyes asserted that Jesus would not vote for Mr. Obama because of his support for abortion rights. Mr. Obama replied that if he had a chance to consult with Jesus, he would not ask him about a Senate race.“I’d want to know if I was going up or down,” he said. “There’s all sorts of questions that I’d be interested in.”'"
"'08-09-23,'0','He showcased it most triumphantly last October in a debate in Orlando, Fla. The moderator noted that while Mr. McCain had strongly supported the troop surge in Iraq, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the likely Democratic nominee, wanted to pull the troops out. Mr. McCain was asked whether the surge was a winning issue for Republicans in 2008. With a quick nod to the troops, Mr. McCain, characteristically, hijacked the question and skipped to pork-barrel spending, his favorite bête noire.“In case you missed it, a few days ago, Senator Clinton tried to spend $1 million on the Woodstock Concert Museum,” Mr. McCain said slyly. “Now, my friends, I wasn’t there,” he continued, letting it sink in why he had missed that ’60s be-in.“I’m sure it was a cultural and pharmaceutical event,” he deadpanned, pausing again to stoke the culture wars. “I was tied up at the time.” The audience roared with approval and rose to its feet for an extended ovation. It was an overwhelming display of affirmation almost unheard of in a debate format.Most of Mr. McCain’s moments on the debate stage are rarely that dramatic, but they are not without flair. He uses short, active verbs that project strength, and he can connect with audiences on a visceral level using down-to-earth language. He was one of 10 Republicans on stage when the primary debates began in May 2007, but he managed to stand out with one vivid remark. Saying he would do “whatever is necessary” to capture Osama bin Laden, he declared, “I’ll follow him to the gates of hell.”But that debate also showed that Mr. McCain’s performances could be uneven. He stumbled over some words. He looked confused at several junctures and was slow on the draw, retrieving his time on occasion to amend earlier answers. At one point, Mr. McCain seemed surprised by a question about whether he believed in evolution. Yes, he said. But when some of his rivals said they did not, Mr. McCain went back. “I believe in evolution,” he said. “But I also believe, when I hike the Grand Canyon and see it at sunset, that the hand of God is there also.”When the topic strays from foreign policy, Mr. McCain’s interest can fade and he can lapse into his stump speech.“McCain’s major weakness is looking wooden, and when he’s out of his comfort zone, his sound bites become weaker and his evasions of questions become more obvious,” said David Lanoue, a political scientist at the University of Alabama and an expert in presidential debates.What lasts from a review of Mr. McCain’s national debates — 21 this primary season and more than seven in 2000 that included George W. Bush — is that he relishes direct confrontation. He presents himself as the authority on the broad themes of war and peace, life and death. And depending on his level of contempt for his opponent, he can drip with condescension, even as he sits calmly with his hands folded in front of him, smiling.“I told you once before, Alan, and I’m sorry I have to tell you again,” Mr. McCain said to Alan Keyes, a Republican presidential candidate, in 2000. “I’ve seen enough killing in my life, a lot more than you have. I know, I know, how valuable and precious human life is.”Drawing Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, into a trap in the CNN/YouTube debate last November, Mr. McCain said, “Well, Governor, I’m astonished that you haven’t found out what waterboarding is.” Mr. Romney said he did know, prompting Mr. McCain to express further astonishment that Mr. Romney would not call it torture.But in that debate, it was Representative Ron Paul of Texas, an opponent of the war in Iraq, who was the object of Mr. McCain’s most righteous fury. “I want to tell you that that kind of isolationism, sir, is what caused World War II,” Mr. McCain declared, as he doubled back from a question about taxes. After some boos, he continued, “We allowed Hitler to come to power with that kind of attitude of isolationism and appeasement.”David S. Birdsell, who specializes in political communication and presidential debates at Baruch College, said Mr. McCain could be “irascible and pugnacious and clearly stoked by personal animosity.” It will be a challenge for him to keep that side in check, Mr. Birdsell said, especially toward Mr. Obama, who is 25 years Mr. McCain’s junior and who Mr. McCain believes has not paid his dues.“Can McCain restrain himself?” Mr. Birdsell asked. “And will Obama have the ability to place the pinpricks at the right moment to elicit that negative, slashing, awkwardly grinning McCain?”'"
"'08-09-23,'0','Last week, the Association of Corporate Travel Executives surveyed members’ travel expectations. Roughly a third said they expected to spend less on travel next year, while another third said they expected to spend about the same. The rest expect to spend more because basic costs are going up.Some companies are reducing travel, mostly in areas like corporate meetings and trips for training. But for many in the growing ranks of independent contractors, including consultants and sales representatives, being on the road is an imperative. And corporate travel that generates revenue appears to be continuing strongly.In June, a survey by Orbitz for Business and Business Traveler Magazine reported that “while many business travelers are, in fact, traveling differently, they aren’t necessarily cutting back, as more than half (60 percent) say they are conducting as much if not more business travel in 2008, compared with 2007.” That continues to hold true, said Jim Cohn, a spokesman for Orbitz.As business travelers grapple with tougher times on the road, companies planning travel budgets for next year are perplexed. American Express Business Travel had scheduled the release of its 2009 Global Business Travel Forecast on Tuesday. But Herve Sedky, the division’s vice president and general manager, decided late last week to postpone the forecast to gain time to evaluate ramifications on travel of the troubles on Wall Street and other fast-moving trends.Some assumptions even of two weeks ago may be fluid today, Mr. Sedky said. “The events of the last week could actually increase travel” beyond forecasts, as companies suddenly feel pressure to find new markets, he said.Meanwhile, companies’ “scrutiny on travel has increased dramatically,” he added. That means an even stronger emphasis on complying with corporate travel policies, often laxly enforced in the past, that require employees to use preferred airlines and hotels because of negotiated discounts. Companies are also working more closely with travel management firms to “educate travelers” about things like “maximizing the trip,” he said. “How many clients can you actually see when you’re in that city?”Companies are putting in place new travel management technology “that allows people to know when they’re not doing what they’re supposed to be doing” in following corporate travel policies, he said.In past cost-cutting crusades, some business travelers have pushed back, insisting on at least a certain reasonable level of comfort and convenience on the road, even if costs have to be more closely watched. It remains to be seen whether they will be able to do that this time.Your thoughts, and your accounts of current experiences, are welcomed for a follow-up column, this time from the business traveler’s perspective.'"
"'08-09-23,'0','The increase — which would essentially eliminate a popular 7 percent tax cut included in this year’s budget — would appear in quarterly bills sent out in December. It would increase taxes by an average of $308 to $358 annually for residents of co-ops or condominiums in buildings with 11 or more units.For owners of one- to three-family homes, the average tax bill would go up $226 next year, according to the city’s Independent Budget Office.The mayor has previously said the property tax would probably be raised, but city officials said they had hoped that any increase would occur in the 2010 fiscal year, which begins in July.Even before last week’s Wall Street crisis, the Bloomberg administration was predicting a budget deficit in the 2010 fiscal year of $2.3 billion.“If you take a look at what has happened over the last couple of weeks and what is likely to happen to our economy, that may not be the size of the deficit,” Mr. Bloomberg said on Monday, referring to the projected gap. “It may be greater than that.The revenues from raising the property tax in January could give the city a running start next year in tackling rising labor, health care and other costs, he said.“It would bring us a whole other year’s revenue and mitigate the problems that we are going to have coming up with a balanced budget for fiscal 2010,” he added. “I didn’t say that is what we would propose or do. But it is one of the suggestions.”Mr. Bloomberg would need the help of the City Council to increase taxes, hardly a sure bet, especially since there will be citywide elections in November 2009. But he expressed confidence.“I don’t think that this will be contentious, or at least very contentious, even though it will be a difficult time because I think the City Council really does understand that we are living in a different world than we did a very short period ago,” he said. “New York City has an awful lot going for it. We want to make sure that we don’t jeopardize or reduce or remove all our advantages.”As if to underscore the seriousness of the situation, Mr. Bloomberg said that while he sat next to Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, for a full inning at the final game at Yankee Stadium on Sunday night, “The economy was the only thing we talked about.”When asked on Monday during a press conference at City Hall about the possibility of higher taxes, Ms. Quinn offered an equivocal response.“It is too early today, a week ahead after the collapse of Lehman, to say exactly what we are going or are not going to do, as it relates to services or revenues,” she said. “No decisions have been made. That said, obviously these are the most serious times, and in the most serious times, you don’t have the luxury of ruling anything out.”Meanwhile, in a phone interview on Monday, City Councilman David I. Weprin, a Queens Democrat who is chairman of the Council’s Finance Committee, said: “I don’t think you’re going to see the Council shouting out for a midyear change, but if the mayor does propose it, it’s something we have to look at differently than we did in June.”Mr. Bloomberg is certainly no stranger to taking aggressive action on taxes. In 2002 , also in the middle of a fiscal year, he proposed raising property taxes for the first time in a decade, by 18.5 percent. He won that battle, but his approval ratings suffered.In 2007, with the city on better financial footing, he and the City Council agreed to a 7 percent tax cut for homeowners. But this year, in May, as the national economic downturn began to take its toll, Mr. Bloomberg said that he doubted that the city would be able to continue the tax cut beyond July 2009.The prospect of higher property taxes can hardly be welcome news for residents reeling from skyrocketing fuel costs and a weakening housing market.Perhaps to soften people up for a tax hike, the mayor has referred to the need to find new revenue sources at least three times in the last week, most recently during his radio address on Friday.One thing that Mr. Bloomberg seemed reluctant to embrace, however, was eliminating a separate $400 property tax rebate. The property tax and the rebates are linked under a state law, though the law could be changed to keep the $400 rebate in place. Eliminating the rebates would not make much of a dent in the deficit.“That’s not a particularly great solution to the problem,” Mr. Bloomberg said.'"
"'08-09-23,'0','Some in Albany took Mr. McCain’s interest in Mr. Cuomo as tribute, including a few who have previously expressed interest in the post Mr. Cuomo currently holds.“Even a broken clock is right twice a day,” said Michael N. Gianaris, the Democratic assemblyman who ran against Mr. Cuomo for the attorney general’s job in 2006. “John McCain usually gets it wrong, but knowing Andrew for 15 years, I am sure he is flattered — and more importantly, that his heart is in continuing to serve the people of New York, where we are glad to have him.”Others also said they think Mr. Cuomo should stay where he is, although for different reasons. Alexander F. Treadwell, a former state Republican chairman now running for Congress, supports Mr. McCain for president. He says Mr. Cuomo bears some portion of the blame for the mortgage collapse, which he argues stemmed in part from Mr. Cuomo’s efforts to expand home ownership while secretary of the federal Housing and Urban Development Department, a point disputed by Mr. Cuomo’s camp.“They were sloppy when he was leading HUD,” Mr. Treadwell said. “I think he’d be absolutely the wrong person to head S.E.C.”Peter Feldman, a spokesman for Mr. McCain, said the senator’s interest in Mr. Cuomo had been inspired by Mr. Cuomo’s own investigations of Wall Street, including a new investigation into short-selling during the recent market upheaval.“Andrew Cuomo has distinguished himself by going after wrongdoing on Wall Street — that’s exactly the kind of bulldog we need at the S.E.C. to fight for American investors and taxpayers,” Mr. Feldman said in a statement.It was not clear, however, just how serious Mr. McCain was. Though Mr. Cuomo had some opportunity to work with Republicans on legislation during the 1990s, when the Republicans controlled Congress and he was the HUD secretary in the Clinton administration, Mr. McCain and Mr. Cuomo do not appear to have spoken since Mr. Cuomo left the Beltway.Mr. Feldman also said Mr. McCain had made no decisions about whom he might ask to serve in his administration if he won. The current chairman of the S.E.C., Christopher Cox, is a Republican who Mr. McCain has said should be ousted.Mr. Cuomo has generally been the kind of politician to revel in gossip about his future prospects. He ran for governor in 2002, losing in the Democratic primary, and has done little to quash speculation that he remains interested in that office, among others.Mr. Cuomo’s camp did not appear eager to fan the flames on Monday, however. A spokesman, Alex Detrick, said it would be inappropriate to comment about an S.E.C. posting, given Mr. Cuomo’s continuing investigations into Wall Street, which he has sometimes conducted in concert and sometimes in competition with the commission.Mr. Cuomo’s father, the former governor Mario M. Cuomo, said Mr. McCain’s camp “must have done some polling or something to see what is the national view here, so it suggests good things about Andrew, frankly.”In venturing his son’s name for the S.E.C. job, Mr. Cuomo added, the Arizona senator had “demonstrated more good judgment than I had given him credit for.”'"
"'08-09-23,'0','Almost seven million pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with hookworm, the parasite that lives in the intestine and causes anemia, according to a study released last week by the journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases.That amounts to a quarter to a third of all pregnant women on the subcontinent, said the authors, who reviewed 105 studies and databases to make their estimate.Severe anemia — a low red-blood-cell count — is a major contributor to deaths of mothers during pregnancy and to low birth weights, which contribute to deaths of newborns.Maternal anemia is common in Africa. It has many causes, including poor diet, malaria and genetics; some can be avoided with iron supplements, mosquito nets and the like.It is unclear exactly how important hookworms are as a factor in deaths. For that reason, world health authorities have been reluctant to make deworming drugs part of regular maternal care, for fear that they might affect the fetus.But because heavy hookworm loads are associated with low hemoglobin levels in pregnant women, the authors, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Sabin Vaccine Institute and the World Bank, believe such drugs will do more good than harm. They argue for further studies with drugs.'"
"'08-09-23,'0','Last year, Marriott introduced a cocktail program at its Renaissance hotels featuring signature drinks like the “A Star is Born” martini served at its Hollywood property — made with Grey Goose vodka, Cointreau, pineapple juice, cranberry juice and Champagne.Meanwhile, the company’s Marriott chain has been training bartenders in the art of mixing cocktails made with fresh juices, fruit and herbs, which means muddling raspberries and blueberries, or crushing mint leaves for the perfect mojito.At both chains, nonalcoholic drinks are getting equal attention, with options like the “Dri Tai,” a variation on the Mai Tai made with nonalcoholic Triple Sec, almond syrup, fresh lemon, orange and pineapple juice, simple syrup and a splash of cola (to mimic the rum in the alcoholic version). It is served in a glass tiki mug and garnished with a pineapple wedge — details that make a club soda seem dull by comparison.“There are a lot of people who are on the fence about how much alcohol is appropriate,” Mr. Von Ertfelda said. “If you have to have a clear head for that 8:30 a.m. meeting or conference call, it’s nice to have a nonalcoholic option that tastes just as good as its alcoholic twin.”The new drink lineup also means more revenue for Marriott, which charges $5 to $8 for these fancy nonalcoholic drinks and $6 to $16 for alcoholic cocktails. Properties that have adopted the new programs have increased beverage revenue in the double digits, which may help offset an overall slowdown in the hospitality business. Last week, PricewaterhouseCoopers forecast an anemic 0.4 percent growth in revenue per available room for 2008, versus 5.7 percent last year.The mixologist Dale DeGroff, author of “The Craft of the Cocktail” (Clarkson Potter, 2002), worked with Marriott to develop its cocktail program, but found challenges with putting in place on a broader corporate scale techniques he honed at places like the Rainbow Room in New York City.“I’m a missionary for fresh juice,” he said. But he discovered that hotel chains have to deal with factors like union rules and purchasing procedures that favor bottled juices in bulk containers, so he held a taste test for some Marriott employees.“These guys all tasted fresh fruit drinks against what came out of their soda gun — they were astounded,” Mr. DeGroff said. “Who wants to drink artificial stuff when you can have the real deal?”He maintains drinks made with fresh fruit are not necessarily more expensive to serve because the flavor is so concentrated that less juice is needed than with a bottled liquid or mixer.That is an important factor for hotels, particularly since beverage revenue has declined to 5 percent of total hotel revenue over the past decade, compared with the 1980s when it was 8 to 10 percent.“It tapered off in the ’90s as people either became more health-conscious or drinking-and-driving-conscious, and it’s just sort of plateaued since then,” said Robert Mandelbaum, a director with PKF Hospitality Research.Another chain that has refreshed its cocktail menu is Hilton Hotels & Resorts, which joined with the mixologist Tony Abou-Ganim to design a new selection of drinks.Starwood’s trend-setting W brand, which introduced its first signature cocktail, an apple martini, 10 years ago, continues to update its drink menu every season. The theme this fall is “East meets West,” and will include cocktails like a litchi Manhattan and an Asian pear mojito.Cocktails aren’t the only part of the bar menu that is getting a makeover. Last year, Four Points by Sheraton appointed a chief beer officer — Scott Kerkmans — who has been busy putting in a “best brews” program throughout the chain to offer guests a selection of local, regional and imported craft beers.“It’s not only our hotel guests but the public in general that’s trading up in terms of their beverage choices,” Mr. Kerkmans said. The program also includes “tasting flights,” which allow guests to try a few ounces of several different beers, and will soon introduce food and beer pairings.“We’re trying to figure out the best flavors of popcorn to go with different beers,” he said, describing one of the items on his to-do list.All this activity by the chains means that bars at boutique hotels have to up the ante with their offerings. Some are clearly responding to the challenge.Earlier this year, the May Fair Bar at the May Fair Hotel in London introduced a selection of martini, Champagne and whiskey flights paired with exotic tapas. The Champagne flight, for instance, is paired with tapas featuring ingredients like pomegranate jelly, Champagne granite and haloumi cheese fritters.But the Champagne flight costs £35, the equivalent of $64, and with the global economy in turmoil, hotel guests might be looking for something simpler: a cheap, stiff drink.'"
"'08-09-23,'0','The Europeans rely on the distance of the race, the difficulty of the course and the strength of their teams to forge the gaps between riders. The pushing and bumping that is expected and accepted in American racing can make a rider an outcast in Europe.In Europe, the roads are sinuous, undulating and crowded with parked cars, spectators, and traffic islands. The races, some more than a century old, have become classics, their courses changed only by development and urbanization.Some courses have become nationals treasures. The poor state of some cobbled roads is protected to keep some races as difficult as they were decades ago. Mountain passes in the Alps and the Pyrenees are spotted with signs and monuments to cyclists who achieved heroics, or even faced death, on their slopes.In Missouri, our tires hummed on the fresh pavement. We flew along and seemed to be showing the spectators something new, perhaps, even odd, yet intriguing.The European teams come to the United States to race for their sponsors, who want to boost their exposure here, or to fill a hole in the calendar to maintain their riders’ fitness. For many European cyclists, it is their first trip to the United States. They shop for clothes and electronics, try new foods, are shocked by the size of a coffee and try to become accustomed to the different lifestyle and way of racing.Their performance often is not what it was in Europe, as motivations are different and their focus is slightly blurred by the contrast. At home in Europe, they are the focal point. The spectators grab at them, their families come out to watch, their names are painted on the roads and signs are posted encouraging them to pedal faster, to win.In Missouri, the American teams and riders are the idols.At the start and at the finish line of American races, announcers animate the crowd, cuing them with their thundering voices about whom to cheer for and when, while also explaining the race and what is happening.In Europe, the spectators know what to expect. They know the champions, and they understand how the race will unfold, the way a baseball fan at Fenway Park knows the players at each position, their statistics and their potential.The American crowd is still learning about cycling, but it still seems to love the show. As we raced through the agrarian countryside, the small communities were decorated with stars and stripes. The marching bands and cheerleaders on the sidewalks enriched the ambiance with their schoolmates screaming encouragement as we sped past. Fireworks exploded as the race became a community festival.The competition became a showdown between the two top American international teams: Garmin Chipotle and the team for which I ride, Columbia. Garmin’s Christian Vande Velde — who finished fifth at this year’s Tour de France — won the overall classification, and we dominated the stages. The racing was aggressive and relentless as each team rode to show its dominance — a rivalry among squads for the American spotlight.Off our bikes and in the hotels, both teams were friendly. But at the race, the rivalry became fierce as both teams used intelligent tactics and strength to try to defeat the other.My father raced his bicycle in Buffalo in the 1960s and ’70s. He knew all of the serious cyclists on the East Coast and in Canada. Their group was small, tight and made up primarily of foreigners. Drivers yelled obscenities at the cyclists while they were training, and the races were club events with a few wives, girlfriends and mothers standing at the roadside cheering. Cycling was a fringe sport few Americans understood.As it has with a good baguette, a nice bottle of wine or an espresso, our culture is slowly learning to love and understand cycling.'"
"'08-09-23,'0','A “Saturday Night Live” sketch satirizing Senator John McCain was composed with assistance from Al Franken the former “SNL” writer and performer and current Democratic candidate for the Senate from Minnesota, the Web site Politico.com reported. The skit, which opened the show on Saturday night, was written by Seth Meyers, the show’s head writer, but had been spawned by a conversation between Mr. Franken and Lorne Michaels, the executive producer, who suggested the idea to Mr. Meyers. “Al has been friends with Lorne Michaels for over 30 years, and Lorne thought Al’s personal experience was funny enough for a ‘SNL’ skit,” Colleen Murray, a spokeswoman for Mr. Franken, wrote in a statement published on Politico.com. “Sure, Al keeps in touch with old friends, but unless the skit is about nonferrous mining on Minnesota’s Iron Range, Al’s not in the business of developing skits anymore.”'"
"'08-09-23,'0','BAGHDAD — Royal Dutch Shell, one of the world’s biggest oil companies, completed a multibillion-dollar natural gas deal with the Iraqi government on Monday and said it had established an office in Baghdad — the first foreign petroleum giant to do so since Iraq nationalized its oil industry more than three decades ago.The company described its decision to open an office here as a milestone that partly reflected the vast improvement in Iraq’s stability compared with conditions during the worst years of the war. But in a sobering reminder of the underlying dangers of doing business here, the company would not disclose the location of its office, and the senior Shell official who announced the gas deal was accompanied by a phalanx of armed guards.“We are ready to establish a presence,” the official, Linda Cook, executive director of the company’s gas and power unit, said during a news conference in Baghdad’s heavily guarded Green Zone.Ms. Cook, who oversaw the signing of the gas deal with the Iraqi government, appeared with Iraq’s oil minister, Hussain al-Shahristani.The joint venture — to recapture gas that now goes to waste during oil extraction in Basra, in southern Iraq — is the company’s official return to Iraq after 36 years. Shell, along with the predecessors to BP, Exxon Mobil and Total, was among the original partners in the Iraq Petroleum Company before the companies lost their concessions to nationalization as Saddam Hussein rose in the 1970s.'"
"'08-09-23,'0','“If I go into a bank,” said Bo Lundgren, who was Sweden’s minister for fiscal and financial affairs at the time, “I’d rather get equity so that there is some upside for the taxpayer.”Sweden spent 4 percent of its gross domestic product, or 65 billion kronor, the equivalent of $11.7 billion at the time, or $18.3 billion in today’s dollars, to rescue ailing banks. That is slightly less, proportionate to the national economy, than the $700 billion, or roughly 5 percent of gross domestic product, that the Bush administration estimates its own move will cost in the United States.But the final cost to Sweden ended up being less than 2 percent of its G.D.P. Some officials say they believe it was closer to zero, depending on how certain rates of return are calculated.The tumultuous events of the last few weeks have produced a lot of tight-lipped nods in Stockholm. Mr. Lundgren even made the rounds in New York in early September, explaining what the country did in the early 1990s.A few American commentators have proposed that the United States government extract equity from banks as a price for their rescue. But it does not seem to be under serious consideration yet in the Bush administration or Congress.The reason is not quite clear. The government has already swapped its sovereign guarantee for equity in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance institutions, and the American International Group, the global insurance giant.Putting taxpayers on the hook without anything in return could be a mistake, said Urban Backstrom, a senior Swedish finance ministry official at the time. “The public will not support a plan if you leave the former shareholders with anything,” he said.The Swedish crisis had strikingly similar origins to the American one, and its neighbors, Norway and Finland, were hobbled to the point of needing a government bailout to escape the morass as well.Financial deregulation in the 1980s fed a frenzy of real estate lending by Sweden’s banks, which did not worry enough about whether the value of their collateral might evaporate in tougher times.Property prices imploded. The bubble deflated fast in 1991 and 1992. A vain effort to defend Sweden’s currency, the krona, caused overnight interest rates to spike at one point to 500 percent. The Swedish economy contracted for two consecutive years after a long expansion, and unemployment, at 3 percent in 1990, quadrupled in three years.After a series of bank failures and ad hoc solutions, the moment of truth arrived in September 1992, when the government of Prime Minister Carl Bildt decided it was time to clear the decks.Standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the opposition center-left, Mr. Bildt’s conservative government announced that the Swedish state would guarantee all bank deposits and creditors of the nation’s 114 banks. Sweden formed a new agency to supervise institutions that needed recapitalization, and another that sold off the assets, mainly real estate, that the banks held as collateral.Sweden told its banks to write down their losses promptly before coming to the state for recapitalization. Facing its own problem later in the decade, Japan made the mistake of dragging this process out, delaying a solution for years.Then came the imperative to bleed shareholders first. Mr. Lundgren recalls a conversation with Peter Wallenberg, at the time chairman of SEB, Sweden’s largest bank. Mr. Wallenberg, the scion of the country’s most famous family and steward of large chunks of its economy, heard that there would be no sacred cows.The Wallenbergs turned around and arranged a recapitalization on their own, obviating the need for a bailout. SEB turned a profit the following year, 1993.“For every krona we put into the bank, we wanted the same influence,” Mr. Lundgren said. “That ensured that we did not have to go into certain banks at all.”By the end of the crisis, the Swedish government had seized a vast portion of the banking sector, and the agency had mostly fulfilled its hard-nosed mandate to drain share capital before injecting cash. When markets stabilized, the Swedish state then reaped the benefits by taking the banks public again.More money may yet come into official coffers. The government still owns 19.9 percent of Nordea, a Stockholm bank that was fully nationalized and is now a highly regarded giant in Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea region.The politics of Sweden’s crisis management were similarly tough-minded, though much quieter.Soon after the plan was announced, the Swedish government found that international confidence returned more quickly than expected, easing pressure on its currency and bringing money back into the country. The center-left opposition, while wary that the government might yet let the banks off the hook, made its points about penalizing shareholders privately.“The only thing that held back an avalanche was the hope that the system was holding,” said Leif Pagrotzky, a senior member of the opposition at the time. “In public we stuck together 100 percent, but we fought behind the scenes.”'"

"'08-09-24,'0','This 30-second advertisement for Senator Barack Obama, titled “Promise,” began running last week in battleground states across the country.THE SCRIPT Mr. Obama says, “I’m Barack Obama, and I approve this message.” Over the sound of morose piano chords, a female narrator begins: “A broken economy. Failing banks. Unstable markets. Families struggling. To protect us in retirement, Social Security has never been more important. But John McCain has voted three times in favor of privatizing Social Security. McCain says, ‘I campaigned in support of President Bush’s proposal.’ Cutting benefits in half. Risking Social Security on the stock market. The Bush-McCain privatization plan. Can you really afford more of the same?”THE SCREEN The spot opens with an image of Mr. Obama and his running mate, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., followed by a headline from The Wall Street Journal, “Crisis on Wall Street.” Another headline, this time from The Washington Post, follows, proclaiming that the “Dow Dives 500 Points on Banking Turmoil,” while images of frenzied Wall Street traders are shown in the background. Then the spot shows a video of a gray-haired couple walking together, smiling, with trees in the background, only to cut abruptly to an elderly woman alone, looking somberly into the camera. At the first mention of Mr. McCain’s name, he appears side by side with President Bush. Then the two are seen emerging from the White House and, finally, standing together in the Rose Garden.ACCURACY Since this spot began running, the Obama campaign has been accused of “scare tactics” from the McCain campaign and criticized as falsely stating Mr. McCain’s position on Social Security benefits. The Web site FactCheck.org focused on the advertisement’s claim that a 2005 proposal from Mr. Bush would cut Social Security benefits in half, calling it a “rank misrepresentation.” In fact, Mr. Bush’s proposal did call for cuts to Social Security benefits, but the cuts would be imposed gradually on future retirees, not those currently receiving benefits, and would affect the highest earners the most. According to a report by Jason Furman, who is now an economic adviser to Mr. Obama, the average worker retiring in 2075 would receive benefits 28 percent lower, not half what they would receive under the current plan.SCORECARD The Obama campaign has taken Mr. McCain to task for peddling false information in his advertising, but the fact-checks on this spot have revealed that the Obama campaign is, in this case, guilty of the same offense. Yet this spot is consistent with Mr. Obama’s attempt to link Mr. McCain to Mr. Bush whenever possible, and the tactic could be effective among voters who remain disillusioned with the last seven years.'"

"'08-09-24,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — Google and T-Mobile unveiled their answer to the iPhone on Tuesday, pulling the wraps off a slick mobile device that combines a touch screen and a keyboard and is aimed at putting the Internet in the pockets of millions of cellphone users.The T-Mobile G1, which will be available in the United States on Oct. 22, is the first mobile phone to be powered by Google’s Android operating system. It represents a milestone in Google’s efforts to extend its dominance of the PC-based Internet to mobile phones and further loosen the control that wireless carriers have over what consumers can do with their phones.Analysts said that the G1 did not represent the kind of revolutionary change in design and function that Apple introduced last year with the iPhone. But the G1 is likely to further accelerate two trends that will have a lasting impact on the wireless industry: the growing use of the Internet on the go, and the ability of consumers to customize their phones with their favorite functions.“I am not sure people are going to be lining up at stores for this device,” said Rajeev Chand, an analyst with Rutberg & Company. “The iPhone was a game changer from a consumer perspective. The Google phone may be more of game changer from an industry perspective.”The G1, which is made by the Taiwanese electronics maker HTC, has a large color touch screen that slides out to expose a full keyboard. It also has a 3-megapixel camera, G.P.S. navigation, Wi-Fi access and an Internet browser. It will sell for $179, or $20 less than the iPhone, with a two-year voice and data plan.“This is as good a computer as you had a few years ago,” said Google’s co-founder Larry Page, who along with co-founder Sergey Brin arrived on Rollerblades at the New York stage where Google and T-Mobile held a news conference to unveil the G1.'"

"'08-09-24,'0','Everything else — reducing executive pay on Wall Street, changing the bankruptcy laws, somehow slowing the descent of home prices — is either a detail or a distraction.Over the last few days, Congress has done a pretty good job of identifying the biggest weaknesses in the Paulson plan, like its vagueness. But as was obvious at Tuesday’s much-watched hearing, members of Congress have also been spending a fair amount of time on sideshows.Usually, it would be easy enough to dismiss these sideshows as the inevitable gear-grinding of democracy. This is an extraordinary time, though. The credit markets are nearly dysfunctional, leaving the economy at risk of falling into a downturn unlike any most of us have lived through, and the government is about to commit billions of dollars after only a week of political debate. There’s no time to waste.The first thing to understand is that a bailout plan doesn’t have to cost anywhere close to $700 billion, so long as it’s designed well. The $700 billion number that you see everywhere is an estimate of how much the government would spend to buy deteriorating assets now held by banks. Eventually, the government will turn around and sell these assets, for a price almost certain to be greater than zero. So this $700 billion is very different from $700 billion spent on a war or on Medicare.“Much of the discussion of the cost of the bailouts is getting it wrong,” David Colander, an economist at Middlebury College, says. “What matters is what price they buy the assets for and the price they sell them for. That’s where the real action is.”Figuring out how much to pay for the assets is the first problem. The drop in house prices and rise in foreclosures have made it clear that these securities are worth considerably less than banks expected. But there is enormous uncertainty about how much less.Based on the underlying fundamentals (like the current foreclosure rate and the one forecast for the future), many of the securities appear to be worth something on the order of 75 percent of their original value. But thanks to the fear now gripping the market — not necessarily an irrational fear, given that most forecasts have proven far too sunny over the last year — very, very few of those securities are trading hands. Among those that have, the sales price has been roughly 25 percent of the value.Which price is the government going to pay? As Mr. Colander puts it, that’s where the action is.It clearly shouldn’t pay 75 cents on the dollar, or anything close to it. That would mean the Treasury Department — which, in the end, is really you and me — was assuming nearly all the risk. But it probably can’t pay 25 cents. That might fail to fix the credit markets, because it would do relatively little to improve financial firms’ balance sheets. Firms might then remain unwilling to lend money to businesses and households, which is the whole problem the bailout is meant to solve.The most obvious solution is to pay more than 25 cents on the dollar and then demand something in return for the premium — namely, a stake in any firm that participates in the bailout. Congressional Democrats have been pushing for such a provision this week, and it’s one of the most important things they have done.The government would then be accomplishing three things at once. First, it would take possession of the bad assets now causing a panic on Wall Street. Second, it would inject cash into the financial system and help shore up firms’ balance sheets (which some economists think is actually a bigger problem than the bad assets). And, third, it would go a long way toward minimizing the ultimate cost to taxpayers.Why? The more that the government overpays for the assets, the larger the subsidy it’s providing to Wall Street — and the more it is pushing up the share prices of Wall Street firms. As Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, notes, the equity stakes allow the government to recapture some of the subsidy down the road. It’s a self-correcting mechanism.Some details of a bailout will have to remain vague, in part so that Treasury officials have the flexibility to respond to an obviously fluid situation. But Congress can still do a lot this week to make sure the final cost is a lot closer to, say, $100 billion than $700 billion.Instead of a laserlike focus on the big issues, though, Congress has been devoting a good chunk of energy to secondary matters. Some of the proposals, like changing bankruptcy rules to help some homeowners avoid foreclosure, are perfectly reasonable but just won’t do much to cure the credit markets. Others may not even meet that standard.One of the fashionable ideas of the week, supported by both Democratic leaders in Congress and John McCain, is to limit the pay of top executives at any Wall Street firm that sells assets to the government. In effect, this is an attempt to tell Wall Street how to split up a government subsidy among its various employees and shareholders.Personally, I couldn’t care less how much of the subsidy goes to Wall Street’s chief executives and how much goes to Wall Street’s shareholders. I care about the size of the subsidy that we taxpayers are paying. And in a frenzied week, any time spent on talking about C.E.O. pay is time not spent on designing the toughest possible bailout package. I found it telling that the relentlessly pro-business United States Chamber of Commerce has saidThe efforts to punish executives and help Main Street are based on a worthy instinct — to address not just the crisis but also larger problems like inequality. The best way to solve those problems, though, is to make sure the government spends as little possible on an effective bailout.A few hundred billion dollars saved today will leave a few hundred billion tomorrow to spend on a better health care system, a saner energy policy and a healthier economy.'"
"'08-09-24,'0','FREELAND, Mich. — With pressure mounting on Congress to pass a $700 billion bailout of financial firms, Senator John McCain struck a more urgent tone Tuesday on the need to act quickly, but he and Senator Barack Obama insisted on conditions that had to be met in the final plan.“Further inaction is simply not an option,” Mr. McCain said at a hastily called news conference, his first in six weeks, in Freeland, Mich., a suburb of Saginaw. “We must pass legislation to address this crisis. If we don’t, credit will dry up, with devastating consequences for our economy. People will no longer be able to buy homes and their life savings will be at stake. Businesses will not have enough money to pay their employees.”Conservatives in Congress have raised mounting alarms about the costs of the plan, but lawmakers are facing pleas from the White House to act swiftly to prevent economic calamity.Mr. Obama, at his own swiftly assembled news conference in Clearwater, Fla., was more critical than Mr. McCain of the bailout plan, and in both his tone and remarks sought to come across as the leader of the opposition party at a time of national crisis. Although he was in large part reiterating the concerns that Congressional Democrats have been expressing to reporters and at hearings in Washington, his goal was to encompass the various Democratic messages in one voice that would be a counterweight to the Republican position coming from the Bush administration.“The president’s stubborn inflexibility is both unacceptable and disturbingly familiar,” Mr. Obama said, referring to Mr. Bush’s comments in recent days that Congress approve the administration’s bailout plan as presented. “This is not the time for my way or the highway.”Mr. Obama added: “It is wholly unreasonable to expect American taxpayers would or should hand this administration, or any administration, a $700 billion blank check with absolutely no oversight. The American people have every right to certain protections and assurances from Washington.”'"
"'08-09-24,'0','When Nathan Tyrone Mitchell, a resident of Santa Monica, showed up to hand over the panels, the police greeted him with handcuffs.Mr. Mitchell, who was charged with possession of stolen property, has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Charles Stoddard, said that his client had bought the panels from someone on Craigslist and then tried to resell them on eBay for a profit. “Our contention is that Mr. Mitchell is just an innocent purchaser who kind of got caught up in this thing,” Mr. Stoddard said.In Contra Costa County, detectives accustomed to handling thefts of copper began to notice solar panels going missing in the last six months, according to Jimmy Lee, a spokesman for the county sheriff’s office.This summer, an officer on patrol became suspicious when he spotted a man trying to sell solar panels to a home builder who had advertised on Craigslist that he was seeking panels. The officer confiscated the panels and, after detectives found that they matched panels stolen from a school, a California man was charged. Mr. Lee says that law enforcement agencies are investigating about a half-dozen other solar-panel thefts in his area.“We were surprised and kind of caught off guard” by the solar thefts, said Mr. Lee, who recommends people engrave their driver’s license numbers onto their panels for better identification.For Tom McCalmont, president of Regrid Power, a solar installation business near San Jose, the problem hit home in late June. His own headquarters was struck by thieves, who took more than $30,000 worth of panels from the roof.The panels were disassembled expertly, he said, leading him to suspect that someone in the solar industry had done it. He urges clients to install video cameras and alarms for their solar arrays, and likens his own revamped security system to Fort Knox.“This is the crime of the future,” Mr. McCalmont said.After suffering a solar theft, some victims find unusual ways to protect their property. Ms. Hoffman, of Desert Hot Springs, could not sleep for several weeks during the string of thefts from her roof.One night, she waited beside a nearby building and watched her house in an attempt to catch the thieves, causing a suspicious neighbor to call the police. She vows that if she ever catches the culprits, “they’re not going to leave walking” — especially if she feels threatened.So far, with the losses still modest, homeowners’ insurance is processing the claims with little resistance. Ms. Hoffman’s insurer, State Farm, is paying $95,000 to replace her entire system. She plans to install an alarm, and possibly a video camera.Not far from Ms. Hoffman, in the town of Palm Desert, Jim and Shayna Powell were devastated after thieves took 19 of their solar panels in June, causing their electricity bill to shoot from $3 to $300 just when they needed air-conditioning the most. “Of all the times of year to steal the panels,” Mr. Powell said in frustration.Beyond California, solar-power markets are comparatively small, so thefts are still rare — but they are spreading. In the last 18 months, Oregon’s highway department has lost a few panels used to power portable traffic message boards.In Minnesota, the Sauk River Watershed District has lost at least eight small panels, worth $250 each, in the last few years, according to Melissa Roelike, who coordinates the water quality monitoring program there.In response, the district has taken steps to protect the panels, including putting them in trees and atop poles. Thieves promptly stole one such panel.“Obviously, hoisting them 20 feet in the air on a metal pipe does not work,” Ms. Roelike said.In Europe, where the solar industry is well-established, thievery is entrenched, and measures to ward it off have become standard, including alarm systems and hard-to-unscrew panels.But in the United States, installers are just coming to grips with the need for alarms, video cameras and indelible engraving of serial numbers. Some people fancy simpler solutions.Ken Martin Jr. lost 58 panels, which will cost $75,000 to replace, this spring from the roof of a half-empty office building in Santa Rosa, Calif., that he owns. He is considering slapping paint on some parts of his remaining panels — bright pink paint.“At least if someone comes across them and they’re painted, they’ll know that’s my color,” he said.'"
"'08-09-24,'0','The bailout “is not necessarily going to have a positive effect on our clients,” said Gordon Grieve, a partner with Piper Alderman, a law firm representing Wingecarribee Shire Council and 20 other local Australian governments holding tainted United States mortgage investments.Some financial analysts say that Washington’s actions seem to be focused on making sure that the most sophisticated borrowers, not the least sophisticated, are helped. “What happens to the local council?” said Kevin Davis, director of the Melbourne Center for Financial Studies.Investors like Wingecarribee Shire may never see any aid from the bailout package, experts say, though money that is tied up in failed investments could inhibit their ability to build roads, swimming pools or “whatever is needed” in the future, Mr. Grieve said.It’s a different story for large Australian banks, which have also been hit by the United States mortgage troubles. It is not clear now how the bailout will treat foreign banks, but those with United States subsidiaries are expected to be bailed out.“We’re certainly supportive of this global action,” said Brandon Phillips, spokesman for National Australia Bank, about the bailout plan, which is still being formulated.In July, National Australia Bank took a provision of 1 billion Australian dollars, or $850 million, to cover losses related to United States mortgage-backed investments. Analysts said last week they expected the bank to take an additional charge of 500 million to 1 billion Australian dollars.While National Australia’s presence in the United States is small, the bank is “certainly involved in making sure its interests are represented,” Mr. Phillips said. It may help that the bank owns Great Western Bancorporation, a 100-office community bank in the United States that it bought this year.Lobbyists for giant financial institutions have poured into Washington in recent days, supporting wealthy clients like American and foreign banks and fund managers. Meanwhile, tiny debt holders like Australia’s local councils have no representation in Washington, though they are eager to participate.“We’re happy to hold talks with any entities or governments which have a proposal which would shore up and safeguard our investments,” said Les Finn, director of corporate services for Parkes Shire Council, another local government with exposure to the soured mortgage assets.Parkes, an agricultural and mining center with a population of 15,000, has some 14 million Australian dollars of its investment portfolio, about one-third of the total, invested in collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.’s, Mr. Finn said.Many Australian entities invested in C.D.O.’s, on the advice of Grange Securities, a brokerage firm bought by Lehman Brothers in early 2007.“They were all told by Lehman that the investments were secure and that they were liquid,” Mr. Grieve said. These top-rated securities quickly plummeted in value as the home loans that backed them went bad.Wingecarribee filed a suit against Lehman Brothers in Australia last year, accusing the company of “deceptive and misleading” conduct when it sold the products. Lehman has denied the accusations.No one can say where that suit stands after Lehman declared bankruptcy this month — big bondholders and creditors generally go to the front of the line in a corporate bankruptcy, and smaller parties are forced to the back.The implications of Lehman’s collapse “are far from clear,” Mike Hyde, Wingecarribee Shire Council’s general manager, said last week.For Wingecarribee and other small fry, all they can do is sit and wait, advisers say.Maybe it is not surprising, then, that sentiment against foreign banks is sweeping Australia. “Carpetbaggers Cost Councils Millions,” proclaimed The Australian, a daily national newspaper owned by the News Corporation, last week.The solution for Australia’s local councils might be a United States-style bailout plan of their own. “If things do get worse, maybe the federal government will look at a rescue package” in Australia, said Mr. Finn of Parkes Shire.'"
"'08-09-24,'0','A Freddie Mac spokeswoman said the company would not comment.Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for the McCain campaign, did not dispute the payments to Mr. Davis’s firm. But she said that Mr. Davis had stopped taking a salary from the firm by the end of 2006 and that his work did not affect Mr. McCain.“Senator McCain’s positions on policy matters are based upon what he believes to be in the public interest,” Ms. Hazelbaker said in a written statement.The disclosure comes at a time when Mr. McCain and his Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama, are sparring over ties to lobbyists and special interests, seeking political advantage in a campaign being reshaped by the financial crisis and the plan to bail out investment firms.Mr. McCain’s campaign has been attacking Mr. Obama for ties to former officials of the mortgage giants, both of which have a long history of cultivating Democratic and Republican allies alike to fend off efforts to restrict their activities. Mr. McCain has been running a television advertisement suggesting that Mr. Obama takes advice on housing issues from Franklin D. Raines, former chief executive of Fannie Mae, a contention denied by Mr. Raines and the Obama campaign.Freddie Mac’s payments of roughly $500,000 to Davis Manafort, the people familiar with the arrangement said, began in late 2005, immediately after Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae disbanded an advocacy coalition that they had set up and hired Mr. Davis to run.From 2000 to the end of 2005, Mr. Davis received nearly $2 million as president of the coalition, the Homeownership Alliance, which the companies created to help them oppose new regulations and protect their status as federally chartered companies with implicit government backing. That status let them borrow cheaply, helping to fuel rapid growth but also their increased purchases of the risky mortgage securities that proved to be their downfall.The payments that Mr. Davis received for leading the Homeownership Alliance were reported in Monday’s issue of The New York Times. On Sunday, in an interview with CNBC and The Times, Mr. McCain responded to a question about that tie between Mr. Davis and the two mortgage companies by saying that he “has had nothing to do with it since, and I’ll be glad to have his record examined by anybody who wants to look at it.”Such assertions, along with McCain campaign television advertisements tying Mr. Obama to former Fannie Mae chiefs, have riled current and former officials of the two companies and provoked them to volunteer rebuttals.The two people with direct knowledge of Freddie Mac’s post-2005 contract with Mr. Davis spoke on condition of anonymity. Four outside consultants — three Democrats and a Republican, also speaking on condition of anonymity — said the arrangement was widely known among people involved in Freddie Mac’s efforts to influence policy makers.As president of the Homeownership Alliance, Mr. Davis received $30,000 to $35,000 a month. He, along with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have characterized the alliance as a coalition of many housing industry and consumer groups to promote homeownership, but numerous current and former officials at both companies say the companies created and bankrolled the operation to combat efforts by competitors to rein in their business. The companies dissolved the group at the end of 2005 as part of cost-cutting in the wake of accounting scandals and, at Freddie Mac, a lobbying scandal that forced out its top Republican lobbyist.On Monday, the McCain campaign attacked The Times for its account of those payments to Mr. Davis, saying the paper was “150 percent in the tank” for Mr. Obama. Mr. Davis said that he had worked not for the two companies but for the advocacy group, which included other organizations as well and, he said, was focused only on promoting homeownership.After the Homeownership Alliance was dissolved, Mr. Davis asked to stay on a retainer, the people familiar with the deal said. Hollis McLoughlin, who was chief of staff to Richard F. Syron, Freddie Mac’s chief executive, arranged for a new contract with Davis Manafort at the reduced rate of $15,000 a month, they said.Mr. Syron lost his job in the government takeover this month. Mr. McLoughlin, who through a spokeswoman declined to comment, was a chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady in the administration of the first President Bush and has longstanding Republican ties.Mr. Davis’s firm was hired as a consultant, not a lobbyist. Davis Manafort in recent years has filed federal lobbying reports for a number of companies, but not Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae.The only thing that Freddie Mac officials could recall Mr. Davis’s doing for the company was speaking at the October 2006 pre-election forum, attended by midlevel and senior executives who contributed to Freddie PAC, the company’s political action committee.An electronic invitation to those employees, read to The Times by a Freddie Mac official, said, “Please join us for political food for thought” with Paul Begala, a longtime Democratic consultant, “and Rick Davis, former 2000 presidential campaign manager and current adviser to Senator John McCain.” Mr. Begala, who was also a paid consultant to Freddie Mac until this month, confirmed that the event had taken place.Several top McCain campaign officials have ties to either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. So do at least two McCain advisers outside the campaign. The lobbying firm of William E. Timmons Sr., the Republican whom Mr. McCain has enlisted to plan his transition to the White House, earned nearly $3 million from Freddie Mac from 2000 until its seizure, federal lobbying records show. Mr. Timmons is the founder of Timmons & Company, one of Washington’s best-known lobbying shops. The payments to the firm were first reported Tuesday by Bloomberg News.And Mark Buse, chief of staff at Mr. McCain’s Senate office, is also a Freddie Mac alumnus. He and his former lobbying employer, ML Strategies, registered to lobby for the company in July 2003, and had received $460,000 by the time the association ended after 2004.Mr. McCain and his advisers have argued that whatever connections Mr. Davis and other campaign officials have had to the mortgage giants, the senator has been an advocate of reforming them.And they have suggested that Mr. Obama is linked to the companies through donations from their employees and ties to former officials there. Those officials include James A. Johnson, another former chief executive of Fannie Mae, who headed Mr. Obama’s vice-presidential search team until stepping aside after coming under criticism for having received a mortgage on preferential terms from the Countrywide Financial Corporation.Since his campaign for the Senate, in 2004, Mr. Obama has received about $126,000 in contributions from employees of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while Mr. McCain has received about $22,000 over the last decade, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.'"
"'08-09-24,'0',', a former Wall Street executive as well as a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said pay curbs on executives whose firms take part in the bailout were essential for Congressional approval and were reasonable.The finance industry, Mr. Levitt added, will continue to offer handsome salaries for the successful, though not as high as in the boom years. “The golden egg has disappeared,” he said.Scott A. Shay, chairman of , which holds no high-risk securities, called a limit on executive pay for firms participating in the bailout only fair.“If that doesn’t happen, you are effectively advantaging the institutions that made those risky bets at taxpayers’ cost,” Mr. Shay said. “What sense does that make?”Across the Atlantic, there is also an appetite for stepping into pay practices in the finance industry. This week, Prime Minister of called “unacceptable” the practice of linking bonus payments to high-risk investments that delivered hefty profits in the short term.His Treasury minister, Alistair Darling, echoed that view by saying that Britain’s main regulator, the Financial Service Authority, should take a hard look at regulating pay.Angry sentiments on the issue in Congress were palpable on Tuesday, when Treasury Secretary and , the chairman, testified before the Senate banking committee.Senator , chairman of the committee, said the “authors of this calamity” should not walk away enriched.The presidential candidates, Senators and , have also called for pay limits.The proposals in Washington are still tentative, and often vague. A Senate draft document calls for a ban on incentive payments that the Treasury deems “inappropriate or excessive” and a “claw-back” provision, requiring executives to give up pay or severance benefits if the firm’s financial results are later shown to be overstated.Other proposals call for a ban on severance payments and allowing large shareholders, with a stake of 3 percent or more, to propose alternative slates of directors. This would be an effort to tackle excessive pay practices by opening up and strengthening corporate governance.Some corporate governance experts say hastily devised compensation curbs in the bailout package would be a mistake and perhaps open the door to unintended consequences.“Clearly, the level of pay at some of the Wall Street firms was appalling, given the performance,” said Charles M. Elson, a corporate governance expert at the . “But the bailout is about saving the economy, while executive pay is a separate, and complex, issue.”In 1993, Mr. Elson noted, Congress limited the tax deductibility of executive salaries to $1 million, unless it could be demonstrated that the extra pay was linked to performance incentives. That move, he said, contributed to the practice in later years of very generous grants of stock options, which helped drive executive pay to new heights.In 2007, the total compensation of chief executives in large American corporations was 275 times that of the salary of the average worker, the , a liberal research organization, estimates. In the late 1970s, chief executive pay was 35 times that of the average American worker.Wall Street has been the top tier of the corporate pay range, with executives earning eight-figure salaries. Its bonus system, which rewards short-term trading profits, has been singled out as an incentive for Wall Street executives to expand their highly profitable business in exotic securities and ignore the risks.“This financial crisis is a direct result of the compensation practices at these Wall Street firms,” said Paul Hodgson, a senior analyst at the Corporate Library, a governance research group.One possible answer, compensation analysts and economists say, would be to stretch out payments for several years, encouraging executives to pursue the long-term health and stability of the firms they head.“I’m of a free-market, conservative bent, but I am sympathetic to some reshaping of executive pay on Wall Street,” said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard. “For sure, I would consider very long-term payouts, up to 10 years out.”Whether Congress acts on executive pay or not, Wall Street pay levels are destined to come under pressure, said Michael Karp, chief executive of the Options Group, an executive search firm. The fallout from the financial crisis and the consolidation in the industry, he said, inevitably mean that more people will be competing for fewer jobs, dragging down salaries.“Of course, superstars will always get paid,” Mr. Karp said. “But they won’t be the way they used to be.”'"
"'08-09-24,'0','A number of public officials and the founders of Google assembled at Grand Central Terminal on Tuesday to announce the start of New York’s version of Google Transit, an online feature that they said would transform the experience of navigating New York City’s transit system, the nation’s busiest.“It is a very complicated transit system, and it just got less complicated today with the advent of Google Maps for transit,” Gov. David A. Paterson said, noting that the subway system opened with 9.1 miles of lines in 1904, and that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority now serves a territory of 5,000 square miles.The array of public officials present reflected Google’s economic might, particularly at a time when Wall Street’s convulsions have left the city and state economy reeling. Not only did the governor and leaders of the transportation authority attend the Grand Central news conference, but so, too, did Deputy Mayor Edward Skyler, representing the Bloomberg administration, and officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and of New Jersey Transit.“It just gives me great personal pleasure to be able to help even in a tiny way this fantastic public transportation system,” Sergey Brin, one of Google’s founders, said at the news conference. The company’s other founder, Larry Page, said he even hoped the tool would “help congestion, help the economy over all.”Google has already presented online maps for several transit systems around the world, and several New York companies have provided similar services, like Hopstop.com, but the new Google tool has support from public officials.'"
"'08-09-24,'0','The coordination of European financial supervision has gradually improved, analysts said. For example, regulators meet periodically in committees to advise the European Commission on drafting rules.But the kind of bailout under way in the United States would be difficult in Europe. Rescuing even one major bank operating across borders would require a political will and coordination that might be lacking.There is also a patchwork of regulators in the United States. But the two primary bodies — the Federal Reserve and the Treasury — were able to move quickly and jointly to create the $700 billion rescue plan, which needs Congressional approval.In Europe, the opaque nature of rules in different countries concerning the insolvency of financial institutions is causing particular unease.A European directive calls for the home country’s jurisdiction to take the lead and equal treatment of creditors within the organization. But laws governing failed banks differ markedly from country to country, with some favoring debtors and others, creditors. Also, there is no common definition of bank insolvency and no common rule to determine when a bank should be closed.Central bankers and supervisors in Europe periodically hold crisis simulation exercises. But analysts expressed doubts about whether they would be able to exchange accurate and timely information on each bank’s risk profile to contain a crisis promptly.“Look at how fast the U.S. had to move” to bail out the insurance giant the American International Group and to decide to let the investment bank Lehman Brothers collapse, Mr. Portes said.“There’s a big distinction between liquidity and solvency,” he added. “It’s very hard to tell whether an institution is illiquid or insolvent. If it’s insolvent, it’s down to the taxpayer, but which taxpayer is liable in the case of a cross-border bank?”In April, European finance ministers took a first step by signing a memorandum of understanding that bound national authorities to favor private-sector rescues where possible, and that urged them to decide in advance who would foot the bill for banks that operate in more than one country if state bailouts were required.The document, which came into effect in June, called on countries to consider creating “cross-border stability groups,” building on existing supervisory networks. These, for example, operate between Belgium and the Netherlands to monitor cross-border banks.Charlie McCreevy, the European internal market commissioner, is expected to go further next week and propose greater coordination of national regulators to deal with cross-border banking crises.The commissioner “is producing a number of concrete regulatory proposals to improve the rules for financial institutions dealing on a cross-border basis,” his spokesman, Oliver Drewes, said.While banking integration in Europe has proceeded at a relatively slow pace, there have been several cross-border deals. Banco Santander of Spain, for example, owns the British mortgage lenders Alliance & Leicester and Abbey National, and has consumer finance operations in a number of countries. UniCredit of Italy now owns HVB of Germany and Bank Austria. In October, Royal Bank of Scotland led a European consortium to buy ABN Amro of the Netherlands.When Northern Rock, which operated almost exclusively in Britain and almost collapsed after its financing dried up, was nationalized, it was relatively simple, notwithstanding some concerns about state aid expressed by the European Commission.The German government, working through a state-owned bank, managed the insolvency and eventual sale of IKB Deutsche Industriebank.In many countries, the central bank takes a leadership role when a financial crisis occurs because, as the issuer of money and the conduit of lending to banks in money markets, it can most readily offer emergency financing to the markets or to individual banks.But the European Central Bank’s crisis role is constrained. For political reasons, it is not a “lender of last resort,” a phrase used by economists to describe an institution willing to extend credit when no one else will. In the United States, that role is served by the Federal Reserve.Still, the European Central Bank has proved adept in handling the liquidity issues related to the current crisis, providing large amounts of money for banks to borrow.“If you have a liquidity crisis, the E.C.B. can do the job,” said Graham Bishop, an independent consultant on financial services in Europe, “but when you have a solvency crisis, it falls to governments.”'"
"'08-09-24,'0','One Argument for the BailoutTreasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. says his Troubled Asset Relief Program isn’t a bailout of Wall Street. And of course it shouldn’t be. But even if it were, a number-cruncher might just be able to justify it. States where the financial services industry is most significant have paid far more in federal taxes for years than they have received in government largess, effectively subsidizing other states. The argument would be that it’s payback time.It would hardly win many friends, particularly in an election year, for highly paid investment bankers and their brethren to argue that the average American taxpayer owes them anything. Still, here’s how the case might be made.Among the states with the largest number of Wall Street employees are New York, New Jersey, the hedge fund haven of Connecticut, Massachusetts (fund management), Illinois — home to Chicago’s exchanges — and California, the West Coast base for venture capital and investment.In 2005, the last year for which the Tax Foundation ran the numbers, every dollar taxpayers in these states sent back to Washington was echoed by government spending in their states equivalent to just 74 cents. In total, they handed over some $134 billion more than the Feds spent on them in 2005 alone.Over, say, five years, that would nearly add up to Mr. Paulson’s $700 billion rescue — and some of that money would come from taxpayers in those states anyway.Now, the Treasury boss would doom his idea if he presented this to taxpayers in states like Alaska, Alabama and Mississippi, asking them to dig deep to keep fund managers in their Beacon Hill townhouses and bankers in their Greenwich McMansions. But that logic would be no worse than much of what Washinton dispenses, and he could make a case if he had to.'"
"'08-09-24,'0','“They believe socialism works in a crisis, and I am not prepared to say that,” Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, said after the session.The clear resistance from the Republican side was being noted by Democrats, who as the majority could conceivably muscle the plan through on their own. But they are reluctant to bail out both Wall Street and the Bush administration without significant Republican involvement.“I caution the president that we cannot pass this package without his party’s support,” Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the Democratic whip, warned Tuesday, expressing a sentiment he shared with Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader.“We have a Republican proposal they’ve given us,” Mr. Reid said, “and we now need some Republican votes to help us with this.”But the distress over the bailout and its timing was hardly unique to Republicans as lawmakers in both parties seethed. Here they were, six weeks to the day before already angry voters head to the polls, being told they had the choice to write a $700 billion check or risk dragging the economy down into bread-line, soup-kitchen territory.At the same time, the lawmakers were under siege from angry constituents who had kept current with their own mortgage payments and now wondered why they were suddenly being stuck with the tab for a crisis set off by foreclosures.“Like my colleagues, my phones have been ringing off the hook,” Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, told the two architects of the bailout — Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke — at the banking committee session. “The sentiment from Ohioans about this proposal is universally negative. I count myself among the Ohioans who are angry.”Even backers of the bailout were hardly enthusiastic. “Nobody wants to do this; nobody wants to be involved in this,” said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader. “But I am going to argue that if we do nothing, we are jeopardizing our economy, jobs, people’s retirement security. Congress has to act and we have to act quickly.”Given the circumstances and dire warnings of economic doom, the expectation remained that enough lawmakers would grit their teeth, hold their noses, screw up their courage and back some variation of the administration plan, a proposal Mr. Cheney privately told Republicans was a response to the worst economic situation he had seen.Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House majority leader, said he expected that Congress would do the responsible thing and do it soon — though just how soon remained unclear. “Acting in the near term is important to stabilize the economy and to protect our taxpayers,” Mr. Hoyer said.Those same taxpayers were also pushed front and center by the authors of the proposal as they sought to make the case that the true beneficiaries of the plan were not greedy Wall Street executives but ordinary Americans and their pensions, savings and employers.“I think if this is not done, that there will be significant adverse consequences for the average person in the United States,” Mr. Bernanke said at the Senate hearing.“This is all about the American taxpayer,” Mr. Paulson said. “That’s all we care about.”Judging from the snickers in the audience at that comment, not everyone was convinced. And Mr. Brown, the senator from Ohio, demanded to know whether Wall Street owed Main Street an apology.The economic experts seemed uncertain who would issue that apology, given that Wall Street, in the words of Mr. Bernanke, is an abstraction. But Mr. Paulson conceded the public had a right to be mad.“You know, I share the outrage that people have,” he told Mr. Brown. “It’s embarrassing to look at this. I think it’s embarrassing for the United States of America. There’s a lot of blame to go around, a lot of blame.”'"
"'08-09-24,'0','Martin J. Dickman, the retirement board’s inspector general in Chicago, declined to comment on the raid, except to say, “We’re investigating.”The retirement board is run by three presidential appointees, one representing labor, one representing management and one representing consumers.L.I.R.R. workers file for occupational disability benefits after they retire and can get them if they are unable to perform their regular railroad jobs — even though they might be capable of doing other work. Under retirement board rules, rail employees can pick the doctors who conduct their medical evaluations.“I understand the outrage that has ensued,” Jerome F. Kever, the management member of the railroad board, said in a statement released on Tuesday. “The occupational disability program that exists today under the Railroad Retirement Act too easily permits medical conditions normally associated with aging to be adjudicated as occupationally disabling.”In his statement, Mr. Kever recommended that the board’s policies be changed so that it could solicit medical information about applicants from railroad companies. He also recommended that disabled workers be required to undergo rehabilitation and be subject to mandatory medical reviews once a disability status is granted.Helena E. Williams, the L.I.R.R. president, said on Tuesday that the board “clearly needs to tighten its rules,” but added, “Another key issue is whether the L.I.R.R. belongs in the Railroad Retirement Board system at all.”Ms. Williams said she believed that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the L.I.R.R.’s parent agency, would save millions if the railroad were part of the Social Security system instead, because per capita taxes would be lower.On Tuesday, Michael S. Schwartz, the retirement board’s chairman, released a memorandum dated in August in which he asked the inspector general to “take whatever steps are necessary” to identify any possible problems with disability claims for L.I.R.R. employees. He said his release of the memo showed his early concern about the matter — a concern that arose after he was interviewed by The Times in July.Former employees of the Long Island Rail Road file for disability benefits at a rate three to four times that of the average railroad, records show. Unlike workers at most other railroads, they can often retire on a regular pension as early as age 50, allowing them to supplement that pension with tens of thousands of dollars in annual disability payments.Steven A. Bartholow, general counsel for the retirement board, said it was wrong for The Times to have suggested that the L.I.R.R. retirees receive “very generous benefits.”Mr. Bartholow said retired rail workers nationwide get on average $26,400 annually in disability payments from the retirement board. In 2005, records show, L.I.R.R. retirees got significantly more — about $36,000 a year — because their disability payments are based in part on their higher wages. The retirement board declined to provide a more current figure.'"
"'08-09-24,'0','Meanwhile, Jean-Robert Pitte, France’s pre-eminent food historian and chairman of the group, sampled the rice pudding with Tahitian vanilla and turned nostalgic. “It’s vanilla!” he said. “It’s Grandma! It’s Gauguin!”They do not talk openly of their enemies — the acclaimed foreign chefs like Ferran Adrià of Spain who have challenged the pre-eminence of French cuisine, the fast-food chains that have infiltrated the country.But with the French economy struggling and the cachet of French food and cooking diminishing even in France, this long shot initiative is an effort to capitalize on what has long been a great source of national pride.It was unveiled by President Nicolas Sarkozy himself at France’s annual Agricultural Fair last February, in an offhand announcement that took his ministers by surprise.He said he wanted France to be the first country in the world whose gastronomy would be formally recognized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization known as Unesco.Mr. Sarkozy is by no means a food connoisseur, and even his close confidants confess that he doesn’t much enjoy eating. A teetotaler, he often fakes his way through toasts.But he has been a relentless booster of France, and for him, the initiative seems to be less about taste and more about the creation of new jobs at home and the projection of power abroad.“Agriculture and the jobs that produce it every day are the source of our country’s gastronomic diversity,” he said. “It is an essential element of our heritage.”He added, “We have the best gastronomy in the world.”For decades, Unesco has kept a list of World Heritage Sites — from Machu Picchu and the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Reims to the ancient city of Thebes and the Great Wall of China — which it helps protect and preserve through careful monitoring.Then in 2003, the agency, which is based in Paris, adopted the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage to preserve “oral traditions and expressions” and “performing arts, social practices, rituals and festive events; knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe; traditional craftsmanship.”Today, Unesco recognizes such cultural manifestations as the storytelling of Kyrgyzstan, the sand designs of Vanuatu, the Ugandan craft of making bark cloth, the folk singing known as iso-polyphony in Albania and ox-herding in Costa Rica.France’s European neighbors in some senses are competing against the French proposal. In June, Spain revived its own initiative to win recognition of the health-conscious Mediterranean diet, based on olive oil, fish, grains, fruit, nuts and vegetables; Italy, Greece and Morocco swiftly joined the campaign.In Italy, Coldiretti, the Italian farmers’ association, even argued that Italy’s food heritage is superior to that of France, since the European Union recognizes 166 food specialties from Italy, but only 156 from France.At first blush, Unesco also is less than enthusiastic. Mexico’s application to honor its food traditions was rejected in 2005, even before the convention came into force in 2006.During a roundtable discussion at the first “Gastronomy by the Seine” festival, an international culinary conference in Paris over the summer, Chérif Khaznadar, president of the Unesco group of countries that signed the new convention, was downright dismissive.“There is no category at Unesco for gastronomy,” Mr. Khaznadar said, adding, “I am afraid that the presentation of a dossier on gastronomy will not go any further.”Even inside France, the idea has been ridiculed. Shortly after Mr. Sarkozy made his proposal, François Simon, Le Figaro’s acerbic food critic, wrote that if France wins Unesco status, “Opening the door of a restaurant, making a soufflé rise, shelling an oyster, will become part of cultural activity, like falling asleep at the opera, yawning at the theater or slumping over Joyce’s ‘Ulysses.’ ”To lay the groundwork for a lobbying campaign, the French Senate held hearings over the summer in which chefs, food experts and even specialists in the “arts of the table” testified.The testimony became a repository for both the memories and the dreams of France’s food world.One witness said it could be a way to save the endangered, black-and-white-streaked Coucou of Rennes (a breed of chicken) and the black turnip of Pardailhan. A second quoted the dictum of the 19th-century food writer Brillat-Savarin that “The discovery of a new dish does more for the happiness of the human race than the discovery of a star.”Recommendations were made, including recognition of France’s rich gastronomic literature; improvement in the quality of prepared meals served in schools, hospitals and nursing homes; campaigns to teach children about the joys of eating good food; and encouragement of young people to appreciate the “nobility” of becoming butchers and bakers.“It is not a matter of saying a ‘masterpiece is in danger,’ or of mummifying our culinary arts,” said Senator Catherine Dumas, the head of the Senate committee in charge of the initiative. “We have to show that eating well and appreciating good food is part of the French identity.”She said that while France wants to be first on the list, others certainly could follow. “We are only the pioneers,” she said. “Our move is a humble one.”France will present Unesco with a formal proposal next year. A scholarly study on the subject by Mr. Pitte at the University of Tours in 2004 will help inform it. More than 300 of France’s chefs, including Mr. Savoy, Paul Bocuse, Alain Ducasse, Pierre Troisgros and Michel Guérard have signed a petition of support. The informal group of a half-dozen chefs and experts intends to raise more than $2 million on publicity and lobbying.The French will have to decide how to make their case. They could choose to showcase the creations of certain French chefs. Or they could argue that certain foods, dining rituals and long family meals are vital to French identity.In the most recent issue of the magazine Le Coq Gourmand, a food critic, Périco Légasse, called for the celebration of the farmer, not the chef.“Quality French agriculture is dying,” he wrote, and “our peasants are disappearing, the richness of our soils and the purity of our landscapes are being extinguished.” This is not the time, he added, to celebrate chefs who “jellify” artisanal chicken or “emulsify” a rare crustacean.But some of France’s best-known food producers argue that it will be harder to prove that the diversity of soil, climate and agricultural products that are so identified with local customs somehow come together to form a common, living cultural heritage that should be universally recognized.On a small farm in Carrières-sur-Seine outside of Paris, Joël Thiébault grows 1,500 varieties of fruits and vegetables, many of them destined for the tables of Paris’ most acclaimed chefs.He plants Japanese mizuna next to Italian escarole. He concedes that Americans understand tomatoes better than the French and says Hungary and Bulgaria produce such good peppers because their soil was never ruined by chemicals.He urges his visitors to bite into his fluted Brazilian peppers, whose seeds were a gift from Pascal Barbot, a chef who won three Michelin stars.For him, the glory of French gastronomy is in the ever-changing creativity of French chefs, and he is unsure that such a phenomenon can be codified.“We are not frozen in time,” said Mr. Thiébault, as he caresses the purple skin of a Kyoto eggplant no bigger than a golf ball. “The taste, the quality of food in the 19th century, in the 20th century is not the same as it is today. Taste is at times very ephemeral.“Often chefs say to me, ‘I want the taste of my grandmother’s tomatoes.’ It’s impossible. That was a moment in their lives that cannot be recaptured.”'"
"'08-09-24,'0','Under skeptical questioning in the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and the chairman, , gave no ground in defense of their $700 billion proposal to bail out the financial system.They also gave little reason to believe that their proposal would protect taxpayers from huge losses. Instead, they said that any eventual loss would be less than the losses that Americans would endure if lending froze up, as it did briefly last week in the panicked aftermath of the failure of and the near-death of the .The candor is appreciated, but it is not a good enough answer for Congress or the American people. Rather than rushing to approve the $700 billion bailout, lawmakers need to examine alternatives. They should look for one that ideally would let taxpayers share in the gains from any postbailout revival, along with the bankers and private investors who will make money if the bailout succeeds. Several ideas have been advanced that Congress should examine.Prominent among them is a plan to make a direct investment of taxpayer dollars into financial firms, rather than buying up their bad assets. With that money, the firms could absorb the losses that they are bound to take as their investments go sour and avert failure and panic. Once the firms begin to recover, taxpayers would earn a return. Such equity investments are risky, however, and careful analysis is needed to show if they would be riskier than what the administration has proposed.Another proposal, advanced by Senator , would buy up bad assets, as proposed by the administration, but would give the government the option to acquire stock in the firms receiving help. The danger is that private investors, fearful of seeing their ownership stakes diluted if the government becomes a shareholder, might be reluctant to invest money. That would deprive the firms of investments they need to recover.'"
"'08-09-24,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — An alliance of seven Western states and four Canadian provinces unveiled a blueprint on Tuesday for the most far-reaching effort in North America to curb emissions linked to climate change.The draft of the proposal by the alliance, the Western Climate Initiative, is intended to achieve a 15 percent cut in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2020. It cuts emissions from industries across the economy and from transportation and housing; a plan being put into effect by 10 northeastern states covers only the electric utility industry.But for all the breadth of the group’s plan, it also reflects the affected industries’ ability to win significant concessions to ease their entry into a new system, under which, for the first time, they must pay for emissions of heat-trapping gases, like carbon dioxide.The draft plan, which will not take effect until 2012, sets a mandatory cap on greenhouse-gas emissions that would rachet down year by year. The industries covered, like electric utilities or petroleum refiners, would be granted allowances and would have to use one allowance to cover every metric ton of heat-trapping gases they emit.Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican, said in a statement, “We’re sending a strong message to our federal governments that states and provinces are moving forward in the absence of federal action, and we’re setting the stage for national programs that are just as aggressive.”'"
"'08-09-24,'0','A Freddie Mac spokeswoman said the company would not comment.Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for the McCain campaign, did not dispute the payments to Mr. Davis’s firm. But she said that Mr. Davis had stopped taking a salary from his firm by the end of 2006 and that his work did not affect Mr. McCain.“Senator McCain’s positions on policy matters are based upon what he believes to be in the public interest,” Ms. Hazelbaker said in a written statement.The revelations come at a time when Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama are sparring over ties to lobbyists and special interests and seeking political advantage in a campaign being reshaped by the financial crisis and the plan to bail out investment firms.Mr. McCain’s campaign has been attacking Senator Barack Obama, his Democratic rival, for ties to former officials of the mortgage lenders, both of which have long histories of cultivating allies in the two parties to fend off efforts to restrict their activities. Mr. McCain has been running a television commercial suggesting that Mr. Obama takes advice on housing issues from Franklin D. Raines, former chief executive of Fannie Mae, a contention flatly denied by Mr. Raines and the Obama campaign.Freddie Mac’s roughly $500,000 in payments to Davis & Manafort began immediately after Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae in late 2005 disbanded an advocacy coalition that they had set up and hired Mr. Davis to run, the people familiar with the arrangement said.From 2000 to the end of 2005, Mr. Davis had received nearly $2 million as president of the coalition, the Homeownership Alliance, which the companies created to help them oppose new regulations and protect their status as federally chartered companies with implicit government backing. That status let them borrow cheaply, helping to fuel rapid growth but also their increased purchases of the risky mortgage securities that were their downfall.On Sunday, in an interview with CNBC and The New York Times, Mr. McCain responded to a question about Mr. Davis’s role in the advocacy group through 2005 by saying that his campaign manager “has had nothing to do with it since, and I’ll be glad to have his record examined by anybody who wants to look at it.”Such assertions, along with McCain campaign television ads tying Mr. Obama to former Fannie Mae chiefs, have riled current and former officials of the two companies and provoked them to volunteer rebuttals. The two officials with direct knowledge of Freddie Mac’s post-2005 contract with Mr. Davis spoke on condition of anonymity. Four other outside consultants, three Democrats and a Republican also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the arrangement was widely known among people involved in Freddie Mac’s lobbying efforts.As president of the Homeownership Alliance, Mr. Davis got $30,000 to $35,000 a month. Mr. Davis, along with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have characterized the alliance as a coalition of many housing industry and consumer groups to promote homeownership, but numerous current and former officials at both companies say the two mortgage companies created and bankrolled the operation to combat efforts by competitors to rein in their business. They dissolved the group at the end of 2005 as part of cost-cutting in the wake of accounting scandals and, at Freddie Mac, a lobbying scandal that forced out its former top Republican lobbyist.On Monday, the McCain campaign accused The New York Times of bias for reporting the payments to Mr. Davis for the alliance work from the mortgage giants. Mr. Davis said that he had worked not for the two companies but for the advocacy group, which included other nonprofit organization as well, and was focused only on promoting homeownership.After the Homeownership Alliance was dissolved, Mr. Davis asked to stay on a retainer, the people familiar with the deal said. Hollis McLoughlin, who was chief of staff to Richard F. Syron, Freddie Mac’s chief executive, arranged for a new contract with Davis & Manafort, at the reduced rate of $15,000 a month, they said. Mr. Syron lost his job in the government takeover this month. Mr. McLoughlin, who through a spokeswoman declined to comment, was a former chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady in the first President Bush’s administration, and has longstanding Republican ties.Mr. Davis was hired as a consultant, not a lobbyist, the officials said. Davis & Manafort in recent years has filed federal lobbying reports for a number of companies but not Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae.Later in 2006, Mr. Davis was working on Mr. McCain’s emerging presidential campaign, as chief financial officer. The only thing that Freddie Mac officials could recall Mr. Davis doing for the company was the October 2006 pre-election forum with mid-level and senior executives who contribute to Freddie PAC, the company’s political action committee.An electronic invitation to the employees, read by an official to the New York Times, said “Please join us for political food for thought” with Paul Begala, a longtime Democratic consultant, “and Rick Davis, former 2000 presidential campaign manager and current advisor to Senator John McCain.” Mr. Begala, who also was a paid consultant to Freddie Mac until this month, confirmed that the event took place.At least two other people associated with Mr. McCain have ties to either Freddie Mac. The lobbying firm of the Republican that Mr. McCain has enlisted to plan his transition to the White House should he be elected, William Timmons Sr., earned nearly $3 million from Freddie Mac between 2000 and its seizure, federal lobbying records show. Mr. Timmons is founder of Timmons & Co., one of Washington’s best-known lobbying shops. The payments were first reported by Bloomberg News.Mark Buse, Mr. McCain’s chief of staff for his Senate office, also is a Freddie Mac alumnus. He and his former lobbying employer, ML Strategies, registered to lobby for the company in July 2003, and received $460,000 before the association ended after 2004.Mr. McCain and his advisers have argued that whatever connections Mr. Davis and other McCain campaign officials have had to the mortgage giants, Mr. McCain in the Senate has been an advocate for reforming them. And they have suggested that Mr. Obama is linked to the companies through donations from their employees ties to former officials there, including James Johnson, another former chief executive of Fannie Mae who was the head of Mr. Obama’s vice presidential search team until stepping aside after coming under criticism for getting a mortgage on favorable terms.Since his first campaign for the Senate in 2004, Senator Obama has received about $126,000 in contributions from employees of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while Senator McCain, over the last decade, has received about $22,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.'"
"'08-09-24,'0','Congress must not settle for token “compromises” about executive compensation and homeowner mortgage relief, while allowing this clause to stand.For this middle-class citizen who lives within my means, without unmanageable debt, the angry posturing of lawmakers does nothing to appease my sickness at this foreseeable calamity.As early as 2005, Paul Krugman warned us of the housing bubble and the attendant effects of a housing collapse on the economy. That my tax dollars will inevitably help pay historic sums for inexcusable excesses in which I played no discernible part is infuriating. When I add the billions wasted by an inept president on unnecessary wars, tax cuts for the richest, and on and on, I feel completely defeated.When both Paul Krugman and William Kristol (columns, Sept. 22) agree that something is wrong, they must be right!They are right that it’s fundamentally wrong to borrow $700 billion or more from our children and grandchildren, without their consent, to bail out grown-up financiers and investors.Excluding the worst victims, those who were preyed upon by unscrupulous mortgage lenders, is even worse.The Bush administration’s response is awfully similar to its handling of other financial crises: the federal budget, energy and financing the Iraq war. It is to borrow now and dump the days of reckoning on future administrations and generations. With luck, Congress will this time avoid the same shame.The writer, a Democrat, is a former United States senator from Minnesota.David Brooks announces that after liberalism and conservatism we are entering an era of Progressive Corporatism (“The Establishment Lives!,” column, Sept. 23). If so, it would be nothing new.In the 1930s, during the Roosevelt administration, Corporate America recognized its interest in a government that invested in the economic infrastructure of America. Once again, it took a financial meltdown to remind it that government provides the capital for health, science, education, transportation, and yes, regulation that unfettered markets fail to provide on their own. Once again, the pendulum swings from profits to prudence.The writer is an associate professor, Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy, University at Albany.The decision to spend almost a trillion dollars of the taxpayers’ money should not be made in a week. There should be a debate between Senator Barack Obama and Senator John McCain dedicated solely to this fiscal crisis. No two-minute sound bites. No moderator controlling the discussion. Give each of them time to outline a plan (say, 15 to 20 minutes) and then let them ask each other questions.Because of the supposed urgency of the situation, announce the debate this week and hold it next week. To give them time to prepare and consult with their advisers, reschedule the debate this Friday to a later date.Omitting relief for homeowners from the proposed bailout plan would be like creating a post-Katrina program to provide relief for New Orleans lenders, but not the people displaced.Many homeowners need temporary relief to stay in their homes and prevent the neighborhood-destabilizing effects of foreclosures and short sales. Congress could provide such relief at no direct cost to the taxpayers by temporarily permitting homeowners to choose to defer a percentage of their monthly mortgage payments until loan maturity.Reducing foreclosures and desperation sales would also help stabilize the real estate market and reduce the cost of the bailout.After working a combined total of about 60 years in public schools and thinking that we had made wise investments in real estate, we have seen those investments fall precipitously. Millions of Americans like us have been made victims of financial markets that have not been subject to even a modicum of regulation.We have no idea whether or not the real estate we own will ever rebound, and are alarmed that the federal government would even consider a huge bailout plan for financial institutions without guarantees that those who have squandered the nation’s wealth will not be held accountable.'"
"'08-09-24,'0','Energy assessment is particularly appealing to homeowners who want to lower their bills and help the environment at the same time. According to the United States Green Building Council, buildings account for 40 percent of the nation’s energy consumption, with half of that from housing.Although large corporations have long used energy auditors, their services have become affordable enough for the residential market in the past few years as equipment prices have fallen.“The cameras that were once $25,000 are now $3,000,” said Tom Scanlon, a vice president of the thermography division of FLIR Systems, a company in Portland, Ore., that makes infrared cameras. He said that sales of thermal cameras for use in home audits had gone from zero to about 10 percent of the total in the last 18 months.The cameras are similar to digital cameras in that they have a sensor chip that captures an image and displays it on an L.C.D. screen. But instead of capturing visible light, the thermographic sensors detect light on the infrared wavelength, measuring relative temperature differences. Cold shows as dark blue or purple, and heat as orange, yellow or white. The images can reveal a number of problems — not only leaks, but water damage behind walls, resistance in electrical wiring and the presence of insects or rodents.Often the results are surprising.“We go into big McMansions with the two-story atriums, and find out they are only insulated up to seven feet,” said Nick Gromicko, founder of the International Association of Home Inspectors. “That’s a problem, because all of the heat is at the top.”The price drop in thermal imaging cameras has proved a boon to home inspectors. “It’s the first tool we have brought in that the consumer has clamored for,” Mr. Gromicko said. The inspectors group, which used to charge members $3,000 for training to become certified in the use of the cameras, now offers the service free to members. He predicts that the technology will become commonplace.Many energy auditing companies not only conduct assessments but also provide detailed recommendations, as well as lists of approved contractors who can do what is sometimes specialized work.The main value for Mr. Kravitz was that the audit guided him to “do things in the right order” to correct the problems in his house, he said. First was sealing air leaks that the thermal camera discovered in the roof, basement and kitchen. Next was sealing ducts, which were leaking air into walls and ceilings. “Those two things made a huge impact on the comfort of the house,” he said. Finally, he replaced the heating and air-conditioning system with a smaller, more efficient model. “My electric bill for August was half what it was last year, and a third of the year before that,” he said.But consumers should choose a service carefully, experts say.“If you are not trained and familiar with home inspections, you can make some very serious mistakes,” said Jim Seffrin, director of the Infraspection Institute, a company in Burlington, N.J., specializing in infrared training and certification. His company charges home and building inspectors $995 for a basic course in thermography. He said that untrained thermographers could misread shadows as water leaks, leading to expensive and unnecessary repairs.At the moment, perhaps the biggest hurdle is getting the word out about residential energy assessments. Mr. Kravitz found TerraLogos only after he approached a heating and air-conditioning company about a new unit. He was told that he was “starting at the wrong place, that I should get an energy audit, and I didn’t know that such things existed,” he said.1000 2008-09-24 LONDON — A day after acquiring the Asian-Pacific unit of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank Nomura of Japan agreed to take over some of the bank’s European and Middle Eastern operations as well.Nomura agreed on Tuesday to acquire Lehman’s investment banking and equities operations in the two regions for a “nominal” price, Sadeq Sayeed, senior adviser to Nomura’s management, said in a media conference call. He declined to give more details on the price but added that Nomura was not taking on any of Lehman’s assets or liabilities.“This opportunity to acquire the business lines of Lehman in Asia and Europe was extraordinarily appetizing because we liked the culture that Lehman has built,” Mr. Sayeed said. “When we saw that opportunity, we moved.”Nomura is among a growing number of financial services companies to seize the opportunity to gain market share by buying some businesses from distressed rivals. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan’s biggest bank, plans to buy 20 percent of Morgan Stanley and Barclays of Britain agreed to buy Lehman’s American investment banking unit last week.The acquisition of the European and Middle Eastern units is subject to regulatory approvals and a number of conditions, including guarantees that the businesses remain operational to ensure a smooth transfer.1001 2008-09-24 The question is how much positive energy Nadal will have left after winning his fourth straight French Open, his first Wimbledon, his first Olympic gold medal and all but wrapping up the year-end No. 1 ranking.Winning the Davis Cup would not be the same sort of novelty. Nadal has already won it, helping to lead Spain over the United States when he beat Andy Roddick on clay in the final in 2004 in Seville.On Sunday, with Roddick trying the same light-brigade tactics of rushing the net whenever possible, Nadal beat him again on clay to clinch Spain’s semifinal victory in Madrid’s Las Ventas bullring. But even in lopsided triumph, there were small alarm bells ringing along with the ever-so-Spanish cheers of “olé” and “toreros.” While training on Saturday, Nadal felt a strain in a buttocks muscle and decided to play on Sunday only after reviewing the results of a magnetic resonance imaging exam.For a young man who has never been as healthy or successful in the second half of the season, it was a reminder that he needed to be reasonable in the two months between now and the Nov. 21 start of the Davis Cup final.“I’m going to make one more push in November to arrive in good shape for the final and to do a good Masters Cup,” Nadal said.For now, he plans to play only three tournaments the rest of the year: the Masters Series event in Madrid, Oct. 13-19; the Masters Series event in Paris, Oct. 27-Nov. 2; and the Masters Cup in Shanghai, Nov. 10-16.For the second time in three months, Nadal will then have to make a quick and brutal turnaround from China to the Americas for a major tennis moment. Last month, he tried and failed to conquer the jet lag and fatigue to win the United States Open after winning the gold medal in Beijing.In November, he could have as little as three days to recover before having to face Del Potro or David Nalbandian and thousands of screaming Argentines in a different hemisphere and on a different continent.The concern, of course, is not so much what happens to Nadal in Argentina, where the final is likely to be played in the capital, Buenos Aires. The concern is what will happen to Nadal in 2009 after all this late-season effort and travel.Men’s tennis has a fine thing going with Nadal and Roger Federer engaged in a classic rivalry, Novak Djokovic capable of beating either one of them and the young Scotsman Andy Murray in hot pursuit. What a pity it would be if benighted scheduling ended up killing some of the buzz, but then it is important to note that the top players themselves have lobbied for tighter turnaround times for Davis Cup.Their argument is that the customary week of separation between a major event and a Davis Cup round is essentially a lost week. The top men, led by James Blake of the United States, have made it clear that they want to play Davis Cup in the week immediately after important individual tournaments. So it will be for this final, and so it will be for much of 2009, when the Davis Cup quarterfinals follow Wimbledon, and the Cup semifinals follow the United States Open.But Nadal may not be the only jet-lagged man in Buenos Aires in November. Del Potro has been on quite a roll, winning four tournaments and reaching the quarterfinals of the United States Open. In just a season, he has matured from a gangly, 6-foot-5 raw talent to a fitter, more polished multisurface threat. Against Andreev and Nikolay Davydenko, whom he also beat in the Davis Cup semifinals, he was an offensive and defensive marvel. He covered the corners with his big wing span and used his leverage to slap big serves and winners.No surprise then that he is now 10th in the 2008 points standings and has a good chance of being among the eight qualifiers for the Masters Cup in Shanghai.Perhaps he and Nadal can charter a flight to Buenos Aires together.1002 2008-09-24 Federal regulators have subpoenaed recent trading records from several Nymex traders as part of a widening investigation into the sharp rise in oil prices on Monday.The subpoenas are part of an examination announced by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Monday, soon after the price for an expiring futures contract on the Nymex surged in the last hour of trading, according to people briefed on the continuing investigation.In that announcement, Walter Lukken, the agency’s acting chairman, said investigators were closely monitoring the price move, which came as the financial markets were struggling to recover from the upheaval of the previous week.Later on Monday, Mr. Lukken was briefed on the episode by Craig Donohue, the chief executive of the CME Group, which owns the Nymex, according to people who were involved in those arrangements.The investigation is aimed at detecting any attempt to illegally manipulate the settlement price for the Nymex crude oil futures contract for October delivery, said Stephen J. Obie, acting director of the commission’s enforcement division.1003 2008-09-24 There were the typical glittery trappings to this opening night. Celebrities and dignitaries could be spotted arriving on the red carpet and wandering the aisles, including Helen Mirren, Barbara Cook, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and Henry and Nancy Kissinger. But to give a populist reach to the gala, the performance was broadcast live to a network of high-definition movie houses in some 500 theaters in North America and Argentina. Hundreds more saw the performance on simulcast screens set up in nearby Fordham Plaza (since Lincoln Center Plaza is closed for reconstruction) and in Times Square.Ms. Fleming had clearly wanted her special night and hoped to make it enjoyably luxurious. Still, she had serious artistic goals. Hearing her in three works of such contrasting styles did not make for the most cogent operatic experience. But it was a challenging feat to bring off. She gave her all and, for the most part, sang beautifully.In Act II of “La Traviata,” when we find Violetta living in an airy country home near Paris with her smitten lover, Alfredo, Ms. Fleming, from her first phrases, sang with supple phrasing and found a distinctive vocal coloring — earthy, tremulous, clarion — to match the dramatic and musical moment. As is her way, she took a boldly expressive approach to dynamics, which is not to all tastes. Still, I have seldom heard the music sung with such rhythmic honesty.The tenor Ramón Vargas was an impassioned Alfredo. But the baritone Thomas Hampson was disappointing as Alfredo’s patriarchal father, Germont. His singing, though powerful and burnished, was too often blunt and bellowed. He made a stiff-backed father, so determined to extricate his son from this scandalous affair that he seemed impervious to the personal dignity of Ms. Fleming’s vulnerable Violetta.In the second scene of Act II, when the story moves to the soiree at the Paris home of the wealthy Flora, another Met audience was made to endure Franco Zeffirelli’s garish sets, exceeded in their tasteless extravagance only by the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. Still, James Levine conducted a taut, exciting performance, so nimble and bracing that it reminded me of the classic Toscanini recording.Marco Armiliato conducted Act III of “Manon,” in the highly stylized, handsome production by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle. The act begins at an outdoor fair in Paris, a scene crowded with festive people: vendors, acrobats and more. As the coquettish and fatally superficial young Manon, Ms. Fleming played things to the hilt, tossing off the florid and coyly alluring melodies, soaking up the adulation of the crowd. But she was at her best in the second scene. Learning that the disconsolate lover she abandoned, the Chevalier des Grieux, is about to take vows as a priest, she tracks him down at the Chapel St. Sulpice and lures him back during an intense and unrelenting duet. Mr. Vargas, as des Grieux, was again in ardent form.But the highlight of the program was the final 20-minute scene, nearly a soliloquy, from Strauss’s final opera, “Capriccio.” This opera is a breezy yet profound dialectical drama that explores an aesthetic question: Is the music more important than the words in song?The debate is embodied in the opera’s love triangle, with a composer and a poet competing for the affection of the widowed Countess, who in this final scene must decide how the opera her suitors are jointly writing should end: in effect, choosing between them.As the Countess facing the question, Ms. Fleming lovingly shaped the arching, infectious phrases and showed this keenly perceptive character going through bouts of confusion, girlish ardor, flattered vanity and world-weary resignation.She looked glamorous in the black dress and Art Deco-styled cape that Mr. Galliano designed for her. At least I think the style was Art Deco. Fashion is not my thing.

Financial bookmakers forecast that the decline would carry over to European markets, which also fell Monday.While the United States government’s proposed $700 billion bailout package has been welcomed by financial markets world-wide, investors in Asia are skeptical that it will be enough to stave off underlying economic problems in America.“The real question for Asian markets will be if the United States slows considerably and exports slow,” said Nikhilesh Bhattacharyya, an associate economist with Moody’s Economy.com in Sydney. Right now, many investors in Asia still have a “wait and see” approach on the bailout, and are trading by “over-reacting to the latest headlines and news,” Mr. Bhattacharyya said.Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASK 200 Index fell 1.93 percent by early afternoon trading Tuesday, after gaining over 8 percent in the previous two days. Despite a 30 day ban on all short-selling, some financial stocks continued to drop sharply in Australia. Shares of Macquarie Group, the country’s largest securities firm, were trading down by 4.47 percent Tuesday afternoon, and shares of National Australia Bank were down 2.51 percent.By early afternoon Tuesday, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 2.68 percent, Singapore’s Straits Times index was down 1.82 percent and China’s CSI Index dropped 2.58 percent, after rising to a two-week high Monday on a Beijing rescue plan to salvage stock prices. India’s Bombay Stock Exchange index fell 1 percent by midday, while markets in Taiwan, Korea and Vietnam were up slightly.Financial stocks were not the only companies hit: Shares in Singapore Telecommunications, one of South Asia’s largest communications companies, were down 1.72 percent in Singapore, while shares of airline Cathay Pacific Airways were down 1.36 percent in Hong Kong. Hong Kong was preparing for a hurricane Tuesday afternoon.1005 2008-09-24 MEANS--David , advertising executive, died peacefully on September 21, 2008.

(Video: NBC)1028 2008-09-25 “I’m not very happy about it,” said Martin Finkel, 78, a medical professor, on Wednesday afternoon as he enjoyed coffee and a bagel at a sidewalk table out front. “But it’s not going to make a difference in terms of purchasing at the store.”At the checkout counter, a loyal customer in her 60s said that the prices Eli’s owner, Eli Zabar, charged “are so out of whack already I can’t believe he’s doing this. It’s a big joke.”Mr. Zabar, whose greenness quotient is such that he uses the excess heat from his bakery a few blocks away to warm his rooftop greenhouses, said that joking was the last thing on his mind.“I could have easily just raised prices in the store — which we do all the time anyway,” he said.“But I’m making a statement here. This is to make my customers aware of the differences of running a food business, as opposed to any other kind of business. The infrastructure that powers a supermarket is huge — the perishability, yada yada yada. The ice that keeps the fish fresh. It takes a lot of energy to roast coffee.”Fair enough. But another customer, Larry Sands, wondered: “One point eight percent seems substantial. I’d like to know what that reflects in terms of their actual increase in costs.”Therein lies the true brilliance of Mr. Zabar’s pricing scheme.“It’s a very arbitrary number,” he said. “One point eight percent doesn’t begin to cover all the energy costs that have increased over the past three years. I purposely picked that as a controversial number to begin the dialogue.” The dialogue so far, he said, has consisted largely of elderly customers complaining to him and his staff.Given all this, Mr. Zabar decided, seemingly as he was being interviewed on Wednesday, that the surcharge was voluntary. In fact, he said, he may soon scrap it altogether.“That my staff have to be here to defend some philosophical position of the boss seems now, to me, wrong,” he said. “It’s an expenditure of time and energy on the part of everybody in the store. I don’t know how much heat we can take.”Too bad he can’t harness it to roast his coffee beans.1029 2008-09-25 “We need leadership, not a photo op,” a statement issued by Mr. Reid said.But Republicans, eager for political cover from Mr. McCain on a bailout proposal that members of both parties see as deeply unpopular in the country, embraced his return. “The threats to Americans, and their homes, savings and retirements, is not a partisan problem, and it won’t be fixed with a partisan approach,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, who called Mr. McCain’s attempt to help forge a deal an “outstanding idea.”Explaining his decision to reject Mr. McCain’s call to postpone their debate in Oxford, Miss., Mr. Obama cited the gravity of the nation’s financial crisis.“It is my belief that this is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who, in approximately 40 days, will be responsible for dealing with this mess,” Mr. Obama said. “It is going to be part of the president’s job to deal with more than one thing at once.”Mr. McCain’s decision seeking to postpone the first debate was yet another unpredictable, daring step taken by his campaign over the last month: its selection of Gov. Sarah Palin as a vice-presidential candidate shook up the race in late August, and days later the campaign stripped down the first day of the Republican National Convention because of the threat of Hurricane Gustav.In the midst of the confusion, officials with the Commission on Presidential Debates said that they were moving forward with the debate and that talks with the McCain campaign throughout the day had not persuaded them on Mr. McCain’s position. “We believe the public will be well served by having all of the debates go forward as scheduled,” the commission said.The meeting with Mr. Bush on Thursday was precipitated by a call from Mr. McCain, who cast his request as a matter of urgent national priority. “Following Sept. 11, our national leaders came together at a time of crisis,” he told a small group of reporters, while reading the brief statement from a teleprompter, in a small ballroom at the Hilton New York hotel. “We must show that kind of patriotism now.”Wednesday night, the two candidates issued the joint statement that Mr. Obama had requested, calling for bipartisan unity to solve the crisis.“Now is a time to come together Democrats and Republicans in a spirit of cooperation for the sake of the American people,” the statement said. “The plan that has been submitted to Congress by the Bush administration is flawed, but the effort to protect the American economy must not fail.”Mr. McCain made his decision to try to delay the debate as he has been struggling to find his political footing on the financial crisis and a number of recent polls showed that more Americans trust Mr. Obama to handle the economy than Mr. McCain. Mr. McCain’s campaign manager, Rick Davis, has also come under scrutiny this week because of his ties to Freddie Mac, one of the mortgage giants at the heart of the credit crisis.Mr. Reid’s opposition to Mr. McCain’s return was described as disingenuous by Mr. McCain’s advisers, who only hours earlier had said Mr. McCain was returning to Washington in part as a response to Mr. Reid. “Senator Reid last night made clear in his view that it was up to John McCain to provide leadership on this matter,” Steve Schmidt, a senior McCain campaign adviser, told reporters on Wednesday afternoon.The debate on Friday was to focus on Mr. McCain’s perceived strength, foreign policy. Mr. McCain had not planned to devote large blocks of time to debate practice as did Mr. Obama, who was holing up with a tight circle of advisers at a hotel in Clearwater, Fla., on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday to prepare. Mr. McCain had a preparatory session on Wednesday afternoon at the Morgan Library in Manhattan, but advisers said it had been interrupted by his decision, announced immediately afterward, to suspend his campaign.Democrats were withering in their reaction to Mr. McCain’s decision.“Now that we are on the verge of making a deal, John McCain airdrops himself in to help us make a deal,” said Representative Barney Frank, of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. “Frankly, we are going to have to interrupt a negotiating session tomorrow between Democrats and Republicans on a bill where I think we are getting pretty close to troop down to the White House for a photo op.”“What, does McCain think the Senate will still be working at 9 p.m. Friday?” Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania said in an interview, referring to the scheduled start time of the debate. “I think this is all political.”Throughout the day, Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama were locked in an unusual back-and-forth about the bailout and Mr. McCain’s decision to suspend his campaign. The exchange started with a morning telephone call from Mr. Obama to Mr. McCain to ask whether Mr. McCain would issue a joint statement on the government bailout plan. But Mr. McCain was not available to take the call, and the two did not connect until six hours later, about 2:30 p.m.At that point, they had what the McCain campaign described as a 10-minute phone call, but the substance of it remained in dispute between the two campaigns. Mr. Schmidt of the McCain campaign said Mr. McCain told Mr. Obama that he was going to suspend his campaign and return to Washington and that he had called Mr. Bush to ask that he convene a meeting on the crisis.But Mr. Obama was left with the impression from the conversation that Mr. McCain was “mulling over” suspending the debate as an option, not a final decision.“Apparently, this was something that, you know, he was more decisive about in his own mind,” Mr. Obama told reporters.Mr. Obama conceded being taken by surprise by the afternoon announcement from Mr. McCain, which Obama aides said occurred about 10 minutes after the phone conversation between the two men.Mr. Obama stopped short of suggesting that Mr. McCain was playing politics by calling for a delay in their first presidential debate, and he continued with the same low-key tone he has employed throughout the financial crisis. But Mr. Obama did say with a glint of humor that both he and Mr. McCain were capable of engaging in the debate and negotiations in Congress at the same time.“If it turns out that we need to be in Washington, we’ve both got big planes — we’ve painted our slogans on the sides of them,” Mr. Obama said. “They can get us from Washington, D.C., to Mississippi fairly quickly.”Two members of the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonpartisan group that has sponsored the debates since 1988, said Wednesday that they were pursuing a strategy of trying to force Mr. McCain’s hand by having the full commission release a strongly worded statement saying the debate would go forward as planned.The commission members noted that past debates had been held during moments of crisis, like as the attack on the destroyer Cole during the 2000 debates, and said they believed both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama could follow through on their commitment to participate in Friday night’s debate while exercising their duties as senators.“Our role is not to play referee on their involvement in or concern about the bailout talks, but to hold a debate that all sides have agreed to,” said one commission member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because members had agreed not to speak beyond the commission statement released Wednesday. “At this point, we see no reason to cancel the debate.”1030 2008-09-25 For days the two candidates had been offering general principles and distancing themselves in similar ways from the proposal that the Bush administration had put on the table. But if their substantive approaches were not very different, their tones were, with Mr. McCain sounding increasingly populist and Mr. Obama more technocratic.That in turn had stoked the fears of Congressional Republicans. Many worried that they were being asked to go out on a limb for an unpopular incumbent president, only to risk being chastised for doing so by their party’s presidential nominee should he come out against whatever plan was eventually adopted, leaving them exposed to a backlash from voters.In that sense, Mr. McCain’s move Wednesday was welcome news to Republicans on Capitol Hill.Democrats in Congress have been more united in their willingness to go along with a plan if they can win most of the concessions they are seeking from the administration. But they, too, looked to their nominee for guidance. Many were reluctant to tie Mr. Obama’s hands by authorizing a lame-duck administration to spend money he hoped to use to expand access to health care, foster research for renewable energy and cut taxes for the middle class.After Mr. McCain got out ahead of him Wednesday by publicly committing himself to help find a solution, Mr. Obama remained cautious, suggesting that he would not necessarily rush back to or plunge into the negotiations himself. Still, Mr. McCain’s tactic focused attention on the two of them as the political leaders with the most power to get a deal completed.So after trying to float above the issue, both men found themselves holding perhaps more sway than they would have cared to over the fate of a financial-crisis solution that may offer no good answers, only less bad ones.Now Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama are each feeling their way in a confused environment where the politics are almost as tangled as the complicated that have snarled the financial sector. The two candidates are being tested in real time, with real consequences, as lawmakers look to them for cues as they seek to balance their impulses to strike populist notes of defiance against the bailout with the need to adopt a solution that may or may not work but that could certainly alienate voters.“I guess I wouldn’t want to be in either of their shoes,” said , a former Treasury Department economist who has worked for Republican presidents but has been a severe critic of President Bush.The candidates had been inching forward almost daily toward engaging in the bailout. Mr. McCain struck a negative tone Monday in Scranton, Pa., warning that “we won’t solve a problem caused by poor oversight with a plan that has no oversight.” On Tuesday he continued to press for changes to the proposal, but sounded a more urgent note that something must be done, declaring in that “further inaction is simply not an option.” By Wednesday afternoon, he had announced that he would suspend his campaign to try to forge consensus on the rescue.Mr. Obama, too, went from offering broad critiques of the proposal, and general outlines for changes, to calling Mr. McCain on Wednesday with the idea that they could present a united front on the issue, laying out the areas of common ground on a way forward. (Both have called for greater oversight and for assurances that taxpayer dollars not be used to enrich executives, among other provisions.)Now the question is who will be seen as politicizing the issue, and who will come across as more presidential: Mr. McCain, with his decision to suspend campaigning and his striking call to delay the first of the debates, or Mr. Obama, with his warning that presidents must be able to multitask and that a dramatic return to Washington would “infuse Capitol Hill with presidential politics.”1031 2008-09-25 Around the country, Republican and Democratic voters are rising up in outright opposition to the White House plan or, at the very least, to express concern that it is being pushed through Congress in haste.Lawmakers, in turn, are agonizing over what to do. Mrs. Miller said she had been “trying to be very deliberative about it,” listening to administration officials like Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., consulting with bankers from her district and independent experts. She sounded torn Wednesday, saying she was looking for guidance from Republican leaders and hoping they would come together with their Democratic counterparts on a bipartisan plan.“I would say it’s the most concerned I’ve been since I’ve been in Congress,” said the congresswoman, a former Michigan secretary of state who won her House seat in 2002. “I appreciate all of the input that I’m getting from my constituents, but I’m just not reacting to that — I can’t until I understand it better and feel comfortable with my vote. And I’m not sure how I’m going to be voting yet.”Meanwhile, the complaints keep coming, and several Congressional offices agreed to share them with reporters, though only on condition that the senders’ names not be published, for privacy reasons.Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, has received nearly 17,000 e-mail messages, nearly all opposed to the bailout, her office said. More than 2,000 constituents called Ms. Boxer’s California office on Tuesday alone; just 40 favored the bailout. Her Washington office received 918 calls. Just one supported the rescue plan.Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said he had been getting 2,000 e-mail messages and telephone calls a day, roughly 95 percent opposed. When Senator Bernard Sanders, the Vermont independent who votes with Democrats, posted a petition on his Web site asking Mr. Paulson to require that taxpayers receive an equity stake in the bailed-out companies, more than 20,000 people signed.“We certainly have never brought in 20,000 names in a day and a half,” Mr. Sanders said, sounding astonished. “For us, that’s off the wall.”It is much the same on the Republican side. Aides to Senator Jim Bunning, a Kentucky Republican who has called the bailout plan “un-American,” said the senator had received more constituent reaction to the bailout plan than to any issue since the immigration debate.Representative Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois, said he had not seen such an outpouring since President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1999.Constituent communications, of course, are no shock to lawmakers, especially since the age of e-mail messages and automated “robo-calls” make it possible for voters to vent en masse. But members of Congress say reaction to the bailout does not appear orchestrated or coordinated, but rather individual expressions that come from the grass roots and run across the philosophical spectrum.War opponents, for instance, are telling lawmakers that they are tired of an administration that, in Mr. McDermott’s words, has “cried wolf” and played “the fear card” too many times by leading the nation into war in Iraq to find nonexistent weapons of mass destruction and curbing civil rights in the name of pursuing terrorists.“The last time that Congress hurriedly passed legislation that the administration presented as ‘urgent’ we got the Patriot Act, with its mix of necessary reforms and onerous civil rights abuses,” one of Senator Brown’s constituents wrote. “Do not fall into this trap again.”Others, invoking the Bush administration’s efforts to expand executive authority, are irate over the idea that one person — Mr. Paulson, and then his successor — would control so much taxpayer money. “So many people have said to me, ‘This is a democracy; this isn’t a dictatorship,’ ” Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said.Fiscal conservatives, on the other hand, see the White House abandoning core principles, marching down a treacherous road toward government intervention in the markets. “We are turning into a socialist country,” one voter warned an aide to Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico. “Let the markets work.”But in the end, from the right or the left, lawmakers say the message is the same: Slow down, catch your breath and do not make any rash decisions, no matter what the White House says.“This is too serious a problem for the administration to expect us to just rubber-stamp a $700 billion proposal and rush to get out of town,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. “That’s something my constituents definitely won’t tolerate.”1032 2008-09-25 It was the first time in Mr. Bush’s presidency that he delivered a prime-time speech devoted exclusively to the economy. It came at a time when deep public unease about shaky financial markets and the demise of Wall Street icons such as Lehman Brothers has been coupled with skepticism and anger directed at a government bailout that could become the most expensive in American history.The administration’s plan seeks to restore liquidity to the market and restore the economy by buying up distressed securities, many of them tied to mortgages, from struggling financial firms.The address capped a fast-moving and chaotic day, in Washington, on the presidential campaign trail and on Wall Street.On Capitol Hill, delicate negotiations between Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Congressional leaders were complicated by resistance from rank-and-file lawmakers, who were fielding torrents of complaints from constituents furious that their tax money was going to be spent to clean up a mess created by high-paid financial executives.On Wall Street, financial markets continued to struggle. The cost of borrowing for banks, businesses and consumers shot up and investors rushed to safe havens like Treasury bills — a reminder that credit markets, which had recovered somewhat after Mr. Paulson announced the broad outlines of the bailout plan last week, remain under severe stress, with many investors still skittish.Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee, said a deal could come together as early as Thursday. “Working in a bipartisan manner, we have made progress,” the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Representative John A. Boehner, the Republican leader, said in a joint statement.“We agree that key changes should be made to the administration’s proposal. It must include basic good-government principles, including rigorous and independent oversight, strong executive compensation standards and protections for taxpayers.”Mr. Bush used his speech to signal that he was willing to address lawmakers’ concerns, including fears that tax dollars will be used to pay Wall Street executives and that the plan would put too much authority in the hands of the Treasury secretary without sufficient oversight.“Any rescue plan should also be designed to ensure that taxpayers are protected,” Mr. Bush said. “It should welcome the participation of financial institutions, large and small. It should make certain that failed executives do not receive a windfall from your tax dollars. It should establish a bipartisan board to oversee the plan’s implementation. And it should be enacted as soon as possible.”The speech came after the White House, under pressure from Republican lawmakers, opened an aggressive effort to portray the financial rescue package as crucial not just to stabilize Wall Street but to protect the livelihoods of all Americans.But the White House gave careful thought to the timing; aides to Mr. Bush said they did not want to appear to have the president forcing a solution on Congress.On Capitol Hill, Mr. Paulson, facing a second day of questioning by lawmakers, this time before the House Financial Services Committee, tried to focus as much on Main Street as Wall Street.“This entire proposal is about benefiting the American people because today’s fragile financial system puts their economic well being at risk,” Mr. Paulson said. Without action, he added: “Americans’ personal savings and the ability of consumers and business to finance spending, investment and job creation are threatened.”But it was the comments of Mr. Paulson, a former chief of Goldman Sachs, about limiting the pay of executives that signaled the biggest shift in the White House position and the urgency that the administration has placed in winning Congressional approval as quickly as possible.“The American people are angry about executive compensation, and rightly so,” he said. “No one understands pay for failure.”Officials said the legislation would almost certainly include a ban on so-called golden parachutes, the generous severance packages that many executives receive on their way out the door, for firms that seek government help. The measure also is likely to include a mechanism for firms to recover any bonus or incentive pay based on corporate earnings or other results that later turn out to have been overstated.Democrats were also working to include tax provisions that would cap the amount of an executive’s salary that a company could deduct to $400,000 — the amount earned by the president.At the same time, Congressional Democrats said they were prepared to drop one of their most contentious demands: new authority for bankruptcy judges to modify the terms of first mortgages. That provision was heavily opposed by Senate Republicans.In addition, Democrats also are leaning toward authorizing the entire $700 billion that Mr. Paulson is seeking but disbursing a smaller amount, perhaps only $150 billion, to start the program, with future funds dependent on how well it is working.Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the lead negotiator for Congressional Democrats, said they also planned to insert a tax break to aid community banks that have suffered steep losses on preferred stock that they own in the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.That change is in addition to others that already have been accepted by Mr. Paulson that would create an independent oversight board and require the government to do more to prevent foreclosures.1033 2008-09-25 A top city official warned on Wednesday that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was putting its relations with City Hall at risk by deciding to make official city vehicles, including fire trucks and police cruisers, pay tolls to cross the authority’s bridges and tunnels.Despite the warning from the official, Mark Page, the city budget director, the authority’s board decided to go ahead with the new charges by an unusually close vote of 7 to 6. Among those voting against the measure were Mr. Page and the three other mayoral appointees on the board.The move, which also applies to state and county agencies and even some volunteer fire departments, reverses a longstanding policy of giving many public agencies free E-ZPass tags. It is expected to bring the authority an additional $10 million in yearly revenue.Mr. Page cited a series of potentially divisive financial issues that were yet to be worked out between the city and the authority and said there might be unanticipated costs.“I think that the bookkeeping management, argument and ill will arising from this proposal is going to be more expensive, in terms of the likelihood of coming together on the extremely serious issues that face all of us, than it’s worth,” Mr. Page said, during a lengthy discussion of the E-ZPass change at the board’s monthly meeting.1034 2008-09-25 The Japanese have used bamboo to make functional containers like baskets and flower vases for centuries, but it was not until the 1950s that bamboo artists started making purely sculptural pieces. “New Bamboo: Contemporary Japanese Masters,” an exhibition of about 90 of those sculptures, opens Oct. 4 at the Japan Society.It “shows how a traditional craft can rapidly transform itself using the sculptural qualities inherit in the ancient weaving process,” said Joe Earle, the director of the Japan Society Gallery and the curator of the show. “The new forms are as unexpected as they are beautiful.”They include both airy and dense shapes, many of which recall natural forms like flames or waves. The 34-inch-tall “Knot III” (2006), left, by Honma Hideaki, was made with a mat weave bamboo edged in rattan strips.The show, which runs through Jan. 11, is at 333 East 47th Street (First Avenue).

(AP) — Profit at Nike, the athletic shoe and apparel company, fell 10 percent in the first quarter because a one-time gain in the year-earlier period did not recur, the company said Wednesday.Sales rose, however, with help from international operations.The company said its net income decreased to $510.5 million, or $1.03 a share, from $569.7 million, or $1.12 a share, a year earlier. But the 2007 quarter included a special item that increased earnings by 20 cents a share. If adjusted for the benefit, net income would have grown 10 percent.Revenue jumped 17 percent, to $5.43 billion. Changes in currency exchange rates increased revenue by 7 percentage points during the quarter.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, on average, had expected earnings of 92 cents a share on sales of $5.19 billion.1038 2008-09-25 Business confidence dropped in Germany, France and Italy in September, surveys showed, adding to fears that the euro zone is sinking into recession as the effects of financial turmoil in the United States spread across the Atlantic. The Ifo Institute’s closely watched indicator of German business confidence fell for a fourth month, to hit its lowest level since May 2005, when economic woes forced former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder to call early elections. Other surveys showed Italian corporate sentiment mired at record lows last seen after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. French business morale plunged to its worst level in more than five years. Germany, France and Italy have the biggest economies in the 15-nation euro zone, together making up about two-thirds of its total gross domestic product.1039 2008-09-25 Re “Talks on Bailout Plan Advance, Despite Anger and Skeptics in Congress” (front page, Sept. 23):Not only is Congress angry, we the people are angry. The problem we have is trust. We do not trust the current administration.We must wait until the next administration, only four months from now, to resolve this issue. Either of the two candidates will be more trusted, and the economy will wait. Bob SteenWhy do all the proposed solutions to the credit crunch involve injecting cash into the Wall Street end of the economy? Surely we can make time (before borrowing $700 billion) to consider potential solutions that inject cash into the Main Street end of the economy.A program to ease the credit crunch by providing financial assistance and counseling to people with unmanageable debt could be as or more effective than handing over reams of cash to Wall Street. Richard L. EichholzI find it ironic that the Treasury Department can propose a three-page, $700 billion bailout of our entire economy, yet my mortgage application contained at least 15 pages of financial, employment and personal information.Is it too much for the American taxpayer to ask for a few more details in a $700 billion rescue plan than I provided to obtain my home mortgage?And Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, are asking for a Congressional vote in less than one week. It took me six weeks to get my home mortgage approved.I agree that Congress should not rush into approving a $700 billion bailout of the financial system (“An Inadequate Case for the Bailout,” editorial, Sept. 24), but rather needs “to examine alternatives.”I also agree that Congress should work on a solution “with appropriate speed.” To that end, Congress should cancel its planned adjournment at the end of this week and stay in session until its work on this crisis is completed. Members can thereby demonstrate by their actions (rather than their rhetoric) why they should be re-elected.I agree with Bob Herbert that everyone should sit back and take a second look at the bailout structure being proposed.It seems to me that the approach is all backward: the plan of Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. is meant to stem the cascading defaults in derivatives and similar securities whose complexity no one fully understands and whose total dollar amount is still a mystery.But if everything is somehow tied one way or the other to the original subprime loans, whose amounts and terms can be ascertained, then why does not the government simply guarantee those loans so there will be no defaults to set off the myriad triggers of the financial doomsday machine Wall Street created?Granted, it would be bailing out a bunch of poor people who should have known better, but at the same time it will be bailing out a bunch of rich bankers who probably did know better, so no one can claim unfairness. And, in the end, people get to keep their homes, living the American dream while also reducing the foreclosure sales that are causing declines in real estate values for all homeowners.Moreover, the stock markets will then stabilize, preserving trillions of dollars in wealth accumulation. So the taxpayers foot the bill, but they also benefit.The writer is a partner of M & A International (Brussels), which advises companies and private equity firms on acquisitions in Europe.I must say that I was initially happy to hear what I thought was a silver lining in this economic crisis: curbing Wall Street executives’ ridiculous, exorbitant pay checks.As someone who is dedicating my life to the nonprofit field, I am constantly appalled to hear of the multimillion-dollar bonuses these execs receive around Christmastime. I am lucky to receive a coffee mug as a gift (which I appreciate greatly).To read that Wall Street lobbyists are scared that pay restrictions “would sap incentives to hard work and innovation, and hurt the financial sector and the American economy,” is almost comical. I have a hard time feeling sympathy for someone who might have to sell one of five luxury homes.And call me crazy, but I work hard and try to be innovative (with limited resources), even though I don’t have a tremendous financial incentive. Maybe it’s time for Wall Street to learn what a healthy work ethic is.

The new booth, where Broadway and Seventh Avenue intersect 46th Street, is made of fiberglass and has an amphitheater-style staircase, with 27 slip-resistant steps that will be able to seat more than 500 hot-chocolate-sipping bargain hunters who are after half-price tickets to “Mary Poppins” or “Avenue Q.”1041 2008-09-25 While aides to both sides said a statement was in the works, it was overtaken by a series of behind-the-scenes maneuvers between the rival campaigns. Advisers to Mr. Obama said they were taken by surprise at Mr. McCain’s call to postpone the debate and suspend his campaign.The proposed $700 billion bailout package has met with deep skepticism from Democrats and Republicans alike this week. Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama — both under pressure to signal what they would do — have said that they favored taking some kind of action though warned that significant changes to the proposed measure were needed.In announcing that he was going to stop campaigning, Mr McCain said that “it has become clear that no consensus has developed to support the Administration’s proposal. I do not believe that the plan on the table will pass as it currently stands, and we are running out of time.”Republicans, in particular, have been skeptical of the package, and are looking to Mr. McCain, now the party’s de facto leader, for leadership.Mr. McCain said that after speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative in New York on Thursday, he would return to Washington to work on the bailout package.Although Mr. McCain was the first to emerge on Wednesday afternoon and announce a change in campaign plans, Mr. Obama began the exchange with his Republican rival on Wednesday morning.“At 8:30 this morning, Senator Obama called Senator McCain to ask him if he would join in issuing a joint statement outlining their shared principles and conditions for the Treasury proposal and urging Congress and the White House to act in a bipartisan manner to pass such a proposal,” said Bill Burton, the spokesman for the Obama campaign.“At 2:30 this afternoon,” he added, “Senator McCain returned Senator Obama’s call and agreed to join him in issuing such a statement.” Some Democrats reacted skeptically to Mr. McCain’s surprise announcement, charging that it seemed like a political ploy to try to gain the confidence of voters concerned about the economy.“What, does McCain think the Senate will still be working at 9 p.m. Friday?” Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania said in an interview, referring to the scheduled start time of the debate. “I think this is all political — I wish McCain had shown the same concern when he didn’t show up in the Senate to vote on the extension of the renewable energy tax credit.”Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who is leading House Democrats in negotiating the bailout deal with the administration, was dismissive of Senator McCain’s announcement. “It’s the longest Hail Mary pass in the history of either football or Marys,” Mr. Frank told a group of reporters outside the House chamber.But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, quickly went to the Senate floor and declared Mr. McCain’s proposal ""an outstanding idea.""“The threats to Americans, and their homes, savings and retirements, is not a partisan problem and it won’t be fixed with a partisan approach,” Mr. McConnell said. “Americans want to know that their home values and college funds and retirement accounts are safe. In other words, that the problems on Wall Street are not going to spread to Main Street. So I appreciate my colleague’s proposal and I hope that it is given serious consideration.”The Commission on Presidential Debates and the University of Mississippi said they both were going forward with the preparation for the debate.“We are ready to host the debate, and we expect the debate to occur as planned,” according to a statement issued by the university. “At present, the university has received no notification of any change in the timing or venue of the debate.”It is not the first time this year that Mr. McCain has sought to suspend the campaign. When the Republicans gathered in St. Paul at the beginning of the month, Mr. McCain suspended the first day of the party’s national convention because of concerns about Hurricane Gustav, which was bearing down on the Gulf.Nor is it the first surprise to come from the McCain campaign. Earlier this month, the Arizona Republican stunned the political world by selecting Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his vice presidential running mate.Both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama have said that action must be taken to bring the economy out of a tailspin, but have urged greater oversight built into the proposal, to monitor how the Treasury Department plans to use taxpayer money to take distressed assets off the hands of failing financial firms, as well as guarantees that taxpayer money is not used to enrich Wall Street executives.Mr. McCain made the call after spending more than an hour preparing for Friday’s debate at the Morgan Library and Museum — which, by coincidence, is where J. Pierpont Morgan bailed the country out of the great financial panic of 1907 by locking the leading bankers of the day in his library and forcing them to come up with a rescue plan.Speaking to a small pool of reporters at his hotel in midtown Manhattan, Mr. McCain read his statement from a Teleprompter, and took no questions.He also canceled a planned appearance on “Late Night With David Letterman.”Mr. McCain has sometimes sent mixed signals about the bailout package. He struck a negative tone Monday in Scranton, Pa., warning, “We won’t solve a problem caused by poor oversight with a plan that has no oversight.”On Tuesday he continued to press for changes to the proposal, but sounded a more urgent note that something must be done, declaring in Michigan that “further inaction is simply not an option.”The fiscal crisis has put both candidates in a tremendously uncomfortable position — torn between an unpopular plan to use $700 billion in taxpayer funds to bail out Wall Street firms, or to risk what the Bush administration warns would be a widening financial crisis that could wipe out the savings of retirees, make it difficult to secure mortgages or college loans, and send the economy into a downward spiral.1042 2008-09-25 But maneuvering is becoming a lot harder these days. After breathing an initial sigh of relief when the Treasury plan was first announced, credit markets are again showing signs of stress.Mr. Gross pointed it out on Tuesday morning, standing on Pimco’s trading floor as Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, and Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, testified before a Senate committee.“Today’s the worst day yet and nobody knows it,” he said. “Everybody is squirreling away cash. Even the big banks are refusing to lend money.”Bid-ask spreads on bonds in almost every sector of the debt markets stretched to a full point or more. “It’s not a pretty situation today, much worse than last week,” Mr. Gross said.“Those who just look at the stock market wouldn’t know it,” he added, because the Dow Jones industrial average was down only 126 points at the time. “But the credit markets are doing a pretty good job of freezing up.”Despite his proposal to offer his talents, gratis, some investment managers say the government should be wary of giving authority for the auction of mortgage securities to anyone in the private sector, particularly someone with as dominant a position in the bond market as Mr. Gross.Luis Maizel, a senior managing director of LM Capital Group in San Diego, said the government should instead turn to someone like a former official of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which is now defunct, or the Federal Reserve.“They should start with somebody who doesn’t have a conflict,” Mr. Maizel said. “Bill Gross is a good friend of mine, but if you put this in Bill’s hands, Pimco is going to come out great and I don’t know that the government will.”Mr. Gross says that all he wants in return for helping the Treasury Department is for Pimco “to be recognized for the way we’ve seen this crisis coming, and for the way we’ve talked about what’s required.”For more than a year, Mr. Gross, whose investment expertise has earned him a net worth estimated at more than $1 billion, according to Forbes, has indeed played the role of the financial markets’ Cassandra. Beginning in July 2007, he warned that the subprime mortgage crisis would become far worse before it would improve.Other sectors of the financial markets, he predicted, also could seize up if the Federal Reserve and the Treasury did not do something to help keep the markets liquid.But Mr. Gross and Pimco also attracted criticism when it became clear that the Pimco Total Return fund earned more than $1.7 billion on the day the federal government bailed out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Mr. Gross had been advocating such a move for more than a year, at the same time that he was moving more than 60 percent of his fund’s assets into government-agency bonds. The shift in investment strategy began in earnest shortly after Pimco hired Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, as an adviser last year.Mr. Gross said there was nothing wrong with that advocacy because Pimco had no official role in formulating the plan to rescue Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.“We had a role on CNBC,” he said, “in that every time we were asked, or I guess every time that The New York Times would call, they would say, ‘What are you doing?’ and we would say: ‘Well, we want safe, agency-guaranteed mortgages. We don’t want to take a lot of risks in subprime space.’ ”With the current liquidity crisis touching virtually every sector, any firm in a position to advise the Treasury on its rescue plan would have potential conflicts of interest, Mr. Gross said. “There’s fewer of them here than anywhere else,” he added. “Simply because we saw the crisis coming and we don’t have much of this paper.”The calm of the Pimco trading floor is perhaps a reflection of that reality. Even in the midst of the Wall Street tumult, it is less cacophonous pit than library, the low murmur of conversation among portfolio managers drowned out only by the clacking keyboards.Mr. Gross, a lanky 64-year-old who practices yoga and sometimes speaks so softly that colleagues lean toward him, drifted around the room on Tuesday, an unknotted pale blue Hermès tie draped around his neck, his gray and brown hair extending down over his ears, reminiscent more of the 1970s than today.Pimco’s headquarters sit on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. On a clear day, the view extends westward beyond Catalina Island, which sparkles like a jewel in the midday sun.The windows on the Pimco trading floor, where Mr. Gross spends most of his time, however, face in the opposite direction — toward Wall Street and Washington, two arenas where Mr. Gross and his firm carry outsize influence.Mr. Gross, who talks regularly with Mr. Paulson, believes the bailout plan should grant broader relief for homeowners and others weighed down by unmanageable debt. He says foreign banks should be allowed to take part in the program, but he argues against any measures that would try to restrict executive compensation — a move that Mr. Paulson tentatively backed Wednesday.“I don’t even know if it’s legal,” Mr. Gross said of attempts to limit executive pay. “And so I think that complicates the situation. That’s not to defend those that are making big checks, but I don’t think it should be attached to this.”Mr. Gross is also skeptical of proposals to have the Treasury take ownership stakes in banks that sell troubled assets to the government.Buying a pool of subprime mortgages is not like buying part of a company, he said. The Treasury would own something — the mortgages themselves, which, if it pays the right amount for those loans, could earn it a yearly return of 12 to 13 percent when they are resolved.“All the capital gains will accrue to the Treasury,” he said. “There’s tons of equity here. It’s just that it’s very difficult for American taxpayers to understand.”The key, of course, is price, which is where an adviser to the Treasury would come in. Mr. Gross says much of the opposition to the plan stems from a misunderstanding that the Treasury would buy troubled mortgage bonds at face value.On the contrary, Mr. Gross said, he would advise the Treasury to pay closer to 60 or 65 cents on the dollar for the mortgage bonds.“If the price is right, the Treasury’s going to make money,” Mr. Gross said. “They made money on Chrysler. They can make money on this,” he said, referring to the federal bailout of the carmaker in 1979 and 1980.Still, when asked how he saw the broader economy here and abroad over the next year, Mr. Gross responded simply, “Not pretty.”“There will definitely be a prolonged period of either slow growth or recession for 12 to 18 to 24 months,” he said. “We’re not going to get out of this easily or scot-free. It’s just gone too far to now turn around quickly and to move into a positive growth mode.”In the meantime, a surge in regulation of the financial sector will be unleashed, probably an inevitable result of the problems and rescues of recent months.“Twelve to 24 months down the road, all of these high-flying investment banks and banks will be reregulated and downsized,” Mr. Gross said. “They won’t become arms of the government, but they will be supervised and held on a tight leash.”The greater regulation should draw investors back to the market and away from what seems to be their current financial strategy — stuffing their cash in mattresses.Even Mr. Gross admits that he has been, at times, reluctant to commit.“We were offered this morning a six-month sizable piece of Morgan Stanley,” he said on Tuesday. “Here’s the surviving investment bank that just last night got equitized or bailed out by a Japanese bank. We were offered a sizable piece of a six-month Morgan Stanley obligation at a yield of 25 percent, O.K.?”Pimco did not buy the bonds, “because we thought we could get it even cheaper,” Mr. Gross said, adding that thinking of that kind was at the heart of today’s market paralysis.“That’s where the fear builds in and makes for totally illiquid markets,” he said. “Where no one trusts anybody; no one trusts any price.”1043 2008-09-25 With the structure of the rescue still in doubt, and a protracted political battle brewing over its fate, worries are building in the credit markets.Investors took little solace from the news late Tuesday that Warren E. Buffett, the noted investor, had agreed to invest $5 billion in the investment bank Goldman Sachs.Several crucial barometers pointed toward renewed stress in the credit markets. The one-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor, rose nearly a fifth of a percentage point, to 3.43 percent, its highest since January.The difference between Treasury bills and a three-month Libor jumped to nearly 3 percentage points, from 2.5 on Tuesday, signaling deep unease among investors.In the stock market, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index seesawed up and down most of the day and closed down 2.35 points, to 1,185.87 points. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 29 points, to 10,825.17. The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.35 points, to 2,155.68.To some investors, the markets’ skeptical reaction to the news out of Washington and from Goldman Sachs appears to be part of a pattern that was set with the near collapse of Bear Stearns. Investors cheer initially, hoping government intervention will help, but after further thought realize that the nation’s economic and financial troubles will not be resolved easily.“There are a lot of qualms about it,” Martin Fridson, chief executive of Fridson Investment Advisors, said about the Treasury proposal to buy troubled assets. “The same questions still hang over us, which is what is this stuff worth?”A report released on Wednesday showed that the housing market, where many of the financial problems originated, remains weak. Sales of previously owned homes fell 2.2 percent in August, to a 4.91 million annual rate, down from 5.02 million in July, according to the National Association of Realtors. But there were a few signs of improvement, the number of homes for sale fell 7 percent, to 4.26 million.For financial firms it was another tough day. The cost to insure Goldman’s corporate debt dropped immediately after Mr. Buffett’s announcement, but climbed higher throughout the day, according to Credit Derivatives Research. By the end of the afternoon, insurance protection on Goldman Sachs debt was slightly more expensive to buy than it was on Tuesday, a sign that even the aura of Mr. Buffett was not enough to fully placate the fears of investors.The cost of protecting against a default by Morgan Stanley, the other investment bank that this week agreed to become a bank holding company, surged toward the record highs of last week.A big source of stress in the credit market appears to be coming from money market funds, the traditionally ultra-safe short-term investment vehicles. Over the last week, retail and institutional investors have been moving hundreds of billions of dollars from prime money market funds to government funds, because they are worried about potential losses after the net asset value of one large fund fell below $1 a share.That has forced many money market fund managers to sell debts issued by corporations, known as commercial paper, and go into Treasury bills, creating a scramble for government-backed debt and severely reducing demand for corporate debt.“When the money markets are attacked as they were, that is to me, and a lot of other people, a sign that there is a sense of panic out there,” said Milton J. Ezrati, senior economist and market strategist at Lord Abbett & Company, an investment firm in Jersey City.At the end of last week, the Federal Reserve and Treasury announced several measures to ease the strain on money market funds and reassure investors that their money was protected. Those moves appear to have helped. The outflow of money from prime money market funds has slowed significantly in recent days, according to iMoneyNet, a research firm. But analysts said that fund managers are keeping more cash on hand in case redemptions pick up again.The benchmark 10-year Treasury bill was down 3/32, to 101 17/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 3.81 percent, up from 3.8 percent late Tuesday.Following are the results of Wednesday’s Treasury auction of two-year notes and seven-day cash management bills.1044 2008-09-25 MEANS--David , advertising executive, died peacefully on September 21, 2008.

Meanwhile Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson, to my mind a far more charismatic duo, flash badges and guns and quarrel about jurisdiction.So far, so good. The principals are a bit confused about what’s happening to them, and so is the audience, but that’s as it should be. Are Jerry and Rachel, who have been receiving menacing phone calls from a mysterious woman with an accentless, affectless voice, patsies in a terrorist conspiracy?It seems that way, but then again, why would a terrorist organization with the capacity to hack into cellphone lines, construction cranes, city buses and security cameras need to mess with stressed-out ordinary citizens? Maybe it’s not terrorism at all but some kind of government conspiracy. Or maybe ...I won’t spoil what the makers of “Eagle Eye” (including four credited screenwriters) surely regard as an ingenious plot twist. There’s no point. By the time you learn what’s really going on, you will no longer care. You will instead most likely be occupied in the sleep-delaying exercise of listing all the simpler, better movies this one resembles and in whose company it might have belonged.1081 2008-09-26 John Harwood of The New York Times and CNBC discusses two gambles Senator John McCain took in recent days to regain campaign momentum.1082 2008-09-26 King Norodom Sihamoni of Cambodia has pardoned his half brother, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was convicted last year of embezzling $3.6 million from his own political party, Funcinpec, by selling the party’s headquarters. Prince Ranariddh was co-prime minister until he was ousted in a coup in 1997 by Hun Sen, the other co-prime minister, who is now prime minister. The pardon allows Prince Ranariddh to return home from Malaysia, where he has been living to avoid an 18-month prison term. He now heads a new party, the Norodom Ranariddh Party, which won two seats in this year’s parliamentary election. King Sihamoni and Prince Ranariddh are sons of Norodom Sihanouk, who retired as king in 2004.1083 2008-09-26 He voted against opportunist bills like the pork-laden energy package and the prescription drug plan. He led a crusade against and the sleaze-meisters in his own party and exposed corrupt Pentagon contracts.I could fill this column with his accomplishments during this period, and not even mention the insights. At a defense conference in , I saw him diagnose and confront Russian hegemony. Week after week, I saw him dissent from colleagues as their party lost its way.Some people who cover the campaign seem to have no knowledge of anything but the campaign, but I can’t get these events — which were real and required the constant application of judgment, honor and courage — out of my head.Do I wish he was running a different campaign? Yes.It’s not that he has changed his political personality that bothers me. I’ve come to accept that in this media-circus environment, you simply cannot run for president as a candid, normal person.Nor is it, primarily, the dishonest ads he is running. My friends in the Obama cheering section get huffy about them, while filtering from their consciousness all the dishonest ads Obama has run — the demagogic DHL ad, the insulting computer ad, the cynical ad, the misleading Social Security ad and so on. If one candidate has sunk lower than the other at this point, I’ve lost track.No, what disappoints me about the McCain campaign is it has no central argument. I had hoped that he would create a grand narrative explaining how the is fundamentally unprepared for the 21st century and how McCain’s worldview is different.McCain has not made that sort of all-encompassing argument, so his proposals don’t add up to more than the sum of their parts. Without a groundbreaking argument about why he is different, he’s had to rely on tactical gimmicks to stay afloat. He has no frame to organize his response when financial and other crises pop up.He has no overarching argument in part because of his Senate training and the tendency to take issues on one at a time — in part, because of the foolish decision to run a traditional right-left campaign against Obama and, in part, because McCain has never really resolved the contradiction between the Barry Goldwater and Teddy Roosevelt sides of his worldview. One day he’s a small-government Western conservative; the next he’s a Bull Moose progressive. The two don’t add up — as we’ve seen in his uneven reaction to the financial crisis.Nonetheless, when people try to tell me that the McCain on the campaign trail is the real McCain and the one who came before was fake, I just say, baloney. I saw him. A half-century of evidence is there.If McCain is elected, he will retain his instinct for the hard challenge. With that Greatest Generation style of his, he will run the least partisan administration in recent times. He is not a sophisticated conceptual thinker, but he is a good judge of character. He is not an organized administrator, but he has become a practiced legislative craftsman. He is, above all — and this is completely impossible to convey in the midst of a campaign — a serious man prone to serious things.Amid the stupidity of this season, it seemed worth stepping back to recall the fundamentals — about McCain today and Obama on some other day in the near future.1084 2008-09-26 When Congressional leaders and Senators and , the two major party presidential candidates, trooped to the White House on Thursday afternoon, most signs pointed toward a bipartisan agreement on a grand compromise that could be accepted by all sides and signed into law by the weekend. It was intended to pump billions of dollars into the financial system, restoring liquidity and keeping credit flowing to businesses and consumers.“We’re in a serious economic crisis,” Mr. Bush told reporters as the meeting began shortly before 4 p.m. in the Cabinet Room, adding, “My hope is we can reach an agreement very shortly.”But once the doors closed, the smooth-talking House Republican leader, of , surprised many in the room by declaring that his caucus could not support the plan to allow the government to buy distressed mortgage assets from ailing financial companies.Mr. Boehner pressed an alternative that involved a smaller role for the government, and Mr. McCain, whose support of the deal is critical if fellow Republicans are to sign on, declined to take a stand.The talks broke up in angry recriminations, according to accounts provided by a participant and others who were briefed on the session, and were followed by dueling news conferences and interviews rife with partisan finger-pointing.Friday morning, on ’s “The Early Show,” Representative of , the lead Democratic negotiator, said the bailout had been derailed by internal Republican politics.“I didn’t know I was going to be the referee for an internal ideological civil war,” Mr. Frank said, according to The A.P.Thursday, in the Roosevelt Room after the session, the Treasury secretary, , literally bent down on one knee as he pleaded with , the House Speaker, not to “blow it up” by withdrawing her party’s support for the package over what Ms. Pelosi derided as a Republican betrayal.“I didn’t know you were Catholic,” Ms. Pelosi said, a wry reference to Mr. Paulson’s kneeling, according to someone who observed the exchange. She went on: “It’s not me blowing this up, it’s the Republicans.”It was the very outcome the White House had said it intended to avoid, with partisan presidential politics appearing to trample what had been exceedingly delicate Congressional negotiations.Senator , Democrat of and chairman of the Senate banking committee, denounced the session as “a rescue plan for John McCain,” and proclaimed it a waste of precious hours that could have been spent negotiating.But a top aide to Mr. Boehner said it was Democrats who had done the political posturing. The aide, Kevin Smith, said Republicans revolted, in part, because they were chafing at what they saw as an attempt by Democrats to jam through an agreement on the bailout early Thursday and deny Mr. McCain an opportunity to participate in the agreement.The day seemed to hold promise as it began. On Wednesday night, Mr. Bush had delivered a prime-time televised address to the nation, warning that ”our country could experience a long and painful recession” if lawmakers did not act quickly to pass a huge Wall Street bailout plan.After spending Thursday morning behind closed doors, senior lawmakers from both parties emerged shortly before 1 p.m. in the ornate painted corridors on the first floor of the Capitol to herald their agreement on the broad outlines of a deal.They said the legislation, which would authorize unprecedented government intervention to buy distressed debt from private firms, would include limits on pay packages for executives of some firms that seek assistance and a mechanism for the government to take an equity stake in some of the firms, so taxpayers have a chance to profit if the bailout plan works.“I now expect we will indeed have a plan that can pass the House, pass the Senate, be signed by the president, and bring a sense of certainty to this crisis that is still roiling in the markets,” said , Republican of , a member of the banking committee.He made a point of describing that meeting as free of political maneuvering. “It was one of the most productive sessions in that regard that I have participated in since I have been in the Senate,” Mr. Bennett said.But a few blocks away, a senior House Republican lawmaker was at a luncheon with reporters, saying his caucus would never go along with the deal. This Republican said Representative Eric Cantor of , the chief deputy whip, was circulating an alternative course that would rely on government-backed insurance, not taxpayer-financed purchase of mortgage assets.He said the recalcitrant Republicans were calculating that Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of , would not want to leave her caucus politically exposed in an election season by passing a bailout bill without rank-and-file Republican support.“You can have all the meetings you want,” this Republican said, referring to the White House session with Mr. Bush, the presidential candidates and Congressional leaders, still hours away. “It comes to the floor and the votes aren’t there. It won’t pass.”House Republicans have spent days expressing their unease about a huge government intervention, which they regard as a step down the path to socialism.Mr. Smith, the aide to Mr. Boehner, said the leader had directed a group of Republicans a few days ago to see whether they could come up with alternatives that relied less on tax funds in providing the rescue package; that led to Mr. Cantor’s mortgage-insurance approach. He said Mr. Boehner thought Mr. Cantor’s idea should be taken into consideration in the talks.At 4 p.m., Mr. Bush convened his meeting at the White House; Mr. McCain had already met with House Republicans to hear their concerns. He later said on ABC that he had known going into the White House that “there never was a deal,” but he kept that sentiment to himself.The meeting opened with Mr. Paulson, the chief architect of the bailout plan, “giving a status report on the condition of the market,” Tony Fratto, Mr. Bush’s deputy press secretary, said. Mr. Fratto said Mr. Paulson warned in particular of the tightening of credit markets overnight, adding, “that is something very much on his mind.”Mr. McCain was at one end of the long conference table, Mr. Obama at the other, with the president and senior Congressional leaders between them. Participants said Mr. Obama peppered Mr. Paulson with questions, while Mr. McCain said little. Outside the West Wing, a huge crowd of reporters gathered in the driveway, anxiously awaiting an appearance by either presidential candidate, with expectations running high.Instead, the first politician to emerge was Senator of , the senior Republican on the banking committee, waving a sheet of paper that he said detailed his own concerns. “The agreement,” Mr. Shelby declared, ”is obviously no agreement.”Friday morning, on the CBS morning program, Mr. Shelby said, “Basically, I believe the Paulson proposal is badly structured.”“It does nothing basically for the stressed mortgage payer,” he said, according to The A.P.The House Republicans’ revolt shocked Democrats; the Senate majority leader, of , said later that he was under the impression that Mr. Boehner had been a strong advocate for moving forward with the Paulson plan.Mr. Frank, who attended the White House meeting, was shocked as well. “We were ready to make a deal,” Mr. Frank said later.At 8 p.m., an exasperated Mr. Frank walked back to the Rules Committee room on the second floor of the Senate side of the Capitol, with a pack of reporters on his heels. He was headed for another late-night meeting with Mr. Paulson and many other lawmakers to see whether they could restart the negotiations — and ward off a Friday morning bloodbath in the markets.Ms. Pelosi told reporters that she was open to considering ideas proposed by the House Republicans. And Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama both said they held out hope that a deal could be reached soon.At the White House, Mr. Bush was holding fast to the approach that Mr. Paulson has championed.“In case there’s any confusion,” Mr. Fratto, the deputy press secretary, wrote in an e-mail message. “The president supports the core of Secretary Paulson’s plan.”1085 2008-09-26 The situation was evolving so rapidly that it was all but impossible to judge the political implications; with the government under intense pressure to avoid another breach in confidence in the global financial markets, it was possible that a deal could be struck without further reshaping the campaign and that Mr. McCain could still be able to claim a role in a positive outcome.Still, as a matter of political appearances, the day’s events succeeded most of all in raising questions about precisely why Mr. McCain had called for postponing the first debate and returned to Washington to focus on the bailout plan, and what his own views were about what should be done. Those political appearances are a key consideration for Mr. McCain less than six weeks from Election Day and at a time when some polls suggest he is losing ground against Mr. Obama, especially on handling the economy.The substance of the financial crisis aside, it was already proving a tough stretch for Mr. McCain. Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, his running mate, struggled through questions about her foreign policy credentials during an interview with CBS News. Mr. McCain was lampooned on television by David Letterman.Mr. Obama might not have fared much better. He had come to Washington only reluctantly, opening himself to criticism by Republicans that he was putting his election bid ahead of the need to resolve the Wall Street crisis, and prompting concern among Democrats that his reaction to the events was simply too measured, considering the stakes.Still, by nightfall, the day provided the younger and less experienced Mr. Obama an opportunity to, in effect, shift roles with Mr. McCain. For a moment, at least, it was Mr. Obama presenting himself as the old hand at consensus building, and as the real face of bipartisan politics.“What I’ve found, and I think it was confirmed today, is that when you inject presidential politics into delicate negotiations, it’s not necessarily as helpful as it needs to be,” Mr. Obama told reporters Thursday evening. “Just because there is a lot of glare of the spotlight, there’s the potential for posturing or suspicions.”“When you’re not worrying about who’s getting credit, or who’s getting blamed, then things tend to move forward a little more constructively,” he said.At the very least, Mr. McCain’s actions have shaken up the campaign and the negotiations over the bailout package. It has put him at center stage, permitted him to present himself as putting his country ahead of his campaign — a recurring theme of his candidacy — and put him on deck to, if not help orchestrate a deal, at least be associated with one.But Mr. McCain is certainly seeing the risks of making such a direct intervention. He now finds himself in the middle of an ideological war that pits conservative Republicans, loath to spending so much taxpayer money on Wall Street, against the Bush White House, which, with the support of Democrats and a sizable number of Republicans, sees a bailout package as essential to averting a potential economic disaster.While there is no doubt a middle ground, at the moment Mr. McCain finds himself between conservatives that he needs to keep on his side for the election, a group that while long wary of him had rallied to his side after his choice of Ms. Palin as his running mate, or being identified with the failure to complete a plan.Mr. McCain’s actions have put into doubt what was shaping up as a critical moment in the campaign: the first presidential debate, scheduled for Friday night in Mississippi. In suspending his campaign, Mr. McCain declared that he would not attend the debate unless a deal was worked out. That threat drew considerable criticism on Thursday, from Mr. Obama’s camp, as well as newspaper editorial boards. And as the day went on, Mr. McCain dropped a hint that the ultimatum was not as ironclad as he once said it was.The debate on Friday night would appear to play to Mr. McCain’s strengths: Its subject, by the agreement of the two campaigns and the debate commission, is supposed to be national security and foreign affairs. But the debate’s moderator, Jim Lehrer, said Thursday that he did not feel constrained to stick to those two topics, considering what has been going on in the country the past two weeks.“I am not restrained from asking questions about the financial crisis,” Mr. Lehrer said in an e-mail message. “Stay tuned!”One way or another, it could be in Mr. McCain’s interest to get this issue behind him. A New York Times/CBS News poll released Thursday found new evidence that the deteriorating economic environment was helping Mr. Obama. Voters who said the economy was the key issue for them were far more likely to support Mr. Obama. And 64 percent of voters expressed confidence in Mr. Obama’s ability to make the right decision on the economy, compared with 55 percent who said they were confident in Mr. McCain’s ability, according to the poll.In a finding suggesting the difficult terrain Mr. McCain needs to navigate as Congress considers the Wall Street bailout 52 percent of respondents said Mr. McCain cares more about protecting the interests of large corporations, compared with 32 percent who said that he cared most about protecting the interests of ordinary people. By contrast, 16 percent of respondents said that Mr. Obama was more concerned with protecting the interests of large corporations, compared with 70 percent said he was more concerned about ordinary people.The survey found that Mr. Obama was supported by 47 percent of registered voters, compared with 42 percent for Mr. McCain; essentially the same as a Times/CBS News poll found last week, when Mr. Obama had 48 percent compared with 43 percent for Mr. McCain. The poll, of 936 adults, of whom 844 are registered voters, was taken from Sunday through Wednesday.Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama both left the tense hourlong session at the White House through side doors, to avoid waiting reporters. Mr. McCain did a round of interviews timed on the network evening news, using the opportunity to say again and again that he understood the severity of the crisis and believed it would be resolved.“Again, I hate to be so repetitious — I am confident we’ll reach an agreement,” he told ABC News. “We have to.”1086 2008-09-26 A much criticized Spanish-language television advertisement wrongly links the views of Mr. McCain, who was a champion of the sweeping immigration overhaul pushed by Mr. Bush, to those of Rush Limbaugh, a harsh critic of the approach, and, frequently, of Mr. McCain.The advertisement implies Mr. Limbaugh is one of Mr. McCain’s “Republican friends,” and quotes Mr. Limbaugh as calling Mexicans “stupid and unqualified.” Mr. Limbaugh has written that his quotes were taken out of context and that he was mocking the views of others.In all, Mr. Obama has released at least five commercials that have been criticized as misleading or untruthful against Mr. McCain’s positions in the past two weeks. Mr. Obama drew complaints from many of the independent fact-checking groups and editorial writers who just two weeks ago were criticizing Mr. McCain for producing a large share of this year’s untruthful spots (“Pants on Fire,” the fact-checking Web site PolitiFact.com wrote of Mr. Obama’s advertisement invoking Mr. Limbaugh; “False!” FactCheck.org said of his commercial on Social Security.)Some Democrats expressed concern that Mr. Obama, in stretching the truth in some of his advertisements, was putting at risk the “above politics” persona he has tried to cultivate.“I do think there is a risk,” said Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic strategist. “The risk is that they seem to be different, that the appeal for Obama is ‘it’s not the same old politics.’ ”Nevertheless, Mr. Trippi described the advertisements as “an eye for an eye.”And other Democrats shrugged off the questionable advertisements, saying they were relieved Mr. Obama was responding to continuing, frequently misleading assaults from Mr. McCain. They did not distinguish between advertisements that are tough on Mr. McCain and those that are misleading.Some Democrats argued that Mr. Obama had yet to produce spots along the lines of two from Mr. McCain that drew criticism two weeks ago: One that wrongly asserted Mr. Obama supported comprehensive sex education for kindergartners and another, created only for the Internet, that incorrectly asserted that Mr. Obama had been referring to Ms. Palin when he said of Mr. McCain’s new message of change, “You can put lipstick on a pig; it’s still a pig.”“All’s fair in love, war and politics,” said Chris Lehane, a Democratic strategist who was Vice President Al Gore’s press secretary in 2000. “Given the fact that the other side has come after him for quite some time, he has every right to fight back, and I think people understand that.”Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Mr. Obama, said the campaign stood by its advertisements.“Our ads discuss serious differences on critical issues like stem cell research, Social Security and energy policy,” Mr. Vietor said. “John McCain’s ads are about Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, and have been called some of the most frivolous and dishonest ads in campaign history.”Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for Mr. McCain, said, “It’s bad enough that Barack Obama fictionalizes his own record, but it is a disgrace that he lies about John McCain’s.”The disputed spots from Mr. Obama coincide with a significantly increased advertising push by his campaign and the Democratic National Committee that has taken a decidedly negative tone in the past few weeks, perhaps reflecting the natural progression of a tight campaign. CMAG, a group that tracks political advertising, said Thursday that the $10 million Mr. Obama had spent over the previous week on advertisements represented a nearly $4 million increase from the week before.The increased advertising push has been accompanied by a campaign by the Democratic National Committee featuring an emotional advertisement shown on African-American-oriented programs meant to encourage blacks to register to vote. It opens with violent images from the civil rights era of black marchers being attacked with power hoses and the words, “Thousands died so you could vote,” the advertisement states. The advertisement was not publicly announced by the party.Some of the advertisements that have drawn criticism were similarly started without fanfare. Mr. Obama’s campaign did not announce it was running its new radio spot that said Mr. McCain “has stood in the way, he’s opposed stem cell research.” That ad concluded, “John McCain doesn’t understand that medical research benefiting millions shouldn’t be held hostage by the political views of a few.”The radio advertisement correctly asserts that Mr. McCain’s running mate, Ms. Palin, is against the use of federal funds for stem cell research. But since 2001, Mr. McCain has consistently supported the financing. Last year, he voted for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, which Mr. Bush vetoed, and in 2004 signed a letter to the president with 57 other senators, urging him to change his policy on stem cell research.The campaign has said Ms. Palin will defer to Mr. McCain on the matter should they win the White House.As backup for the advertisement’s implication that Mr. McCain is against stem cell research financing, Mr. Vietor of the Obama campaign pointed to a recent report in The Los Angeles Times that Mr. McCain had told evangelical leaders he was open to learning more about their concerns, though the article stated, “McCain did not offer any indication he would change his mind.”The stem cell advertisement hit the airwaves around the same time Mr. Obama released his Spanish-language commercial about Mr. Limbaugh. Bill Adair, the editor of PolitiFact, the fact-checking Web site of The St. Petersburg Times and Congressional Quarterly, said that until last week, the McCain campaign was more frequently guilty of including the most egregious falsehoods in its advertisements.But the advertisement with Mr. Limbaugh, he said, prompted PolitiFact to deliver its worst rating, “Pants on Fire,” to Mr. Obama for the first time (as opposed to six times for Mr. McCain). The “Pants on Fire” rating is defined as, “not just false, but ridiculously false,” Mr. Adair said.“I think the Obama campaign in the last two weeks has been very aggressive with its advertising,” Mr. Adair said. “And ads like the stem cell ad and the Spanish-language ad are just not accurate.”Mr. Obama has been previously challenged over falsehoods or misleading statements in his advertisements. For instance, the campaign has frequently been criticized for implying that Mr. McCain has singled out “big oil” as the sole recipient of his broad, corporate tax cut. Mr. Obama does it again in his latest spot, in which the announcer says he “does support tax breaks for one source of energy: Oil Companies.”Mr. Vietor defended the ad, saying it was accurate and had not said the oil companies would be “the only” recipients of Mr. McCain's proposed corporate tax break.1087 2008-09-26 “There are a number of countries where you can get quite worried if capital flows stop,” said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London. “When you look at their high current-account deficits, Central and Eastern Europe seem particularly vulnerable.”A second category of countries are those who export oil or other commodities, and are vulnerable to a decline in prices — something that economists said would happen if the crisis hobbled growth. Oil plunged last week as Wall Street teetered, but it bounced back as hope rose for a bailout.“If the world economy does experience something like a global recession next year, those countries will be at risk,” said Michael Mussa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.There are more than 20 countries with current-account deficits that exceed 5 percent of their economic output, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said, putting them in what the fund considers the endangered category.Mr. Strauss-Kahn declined to name names, but outside economists listed Bulgaria, Estonia, Romania and Turkey as among the red flags in Europe. In Africa, they said, South Africa and Nigeria were worrisome; and in Latin America, Venezuela and Ecuador.The list, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said, does not include the four largest emerging-market countries — China, Russia, Brazil and India — which are running healthy trade surpluses or have hundreds of billions in foreign exchange reserves, though Russia is vulnerable to a drop in oil prices.Western Europe, economists say, is unlikely to be seriously affected, despite having banks that hold mortgage-related assets. This has made European officials reluctant to heed the Treasury Department’s call for them to undertake their own efforts to bolster the financial system.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has resisted efforts by Congress to make foreign banks ineligible for the plan. But administration officials said they planned to set priorities on which ones to help, based on whether their governments were willing to help with the cleanup process.Two of the most threatened countries lie on Europe’s eastern frontier: Bulgaria and Romania, which have racked up high current account deficits and are running overheated economies.“These countries have been growing too fast or borrowing too much,” said Peter Akos Bod, a former president of the Hungarian central bank. “Should there be a sudden stop in capital, they would be in deep trouble.”Latin America is a perennial source of worry, given its history of troubled fiscal policy. For the moment, several countries, notably Venezuela, are benefiting from the soaring price of oil.But if oil and other commodities were to decline, said John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute who specializes in the region, “South America would be less comfortably placed.”Mr. Strauss-Kahn said he recognized that the monetary fund would be largely a bystander in this crisis, given that the problems began in the United States and remain largely a domestic banking issue.But he said the fund could play a role in giving advice. Among its suggestions: rather than buy distressed mortgage-related securities from banks, the Treasury should swap them for bonds, which Mr. Strauss-Kahn said would be cheaper and leave some of the risk with the banks.Mr. Strauss-Kahn said he also planned to confront one of the most politically charged issues at the fund: strengthening its pressure on China to allow its currency, the renminbi, to rise.Critics in the Bush administration and Congress say the fund has not pushed China hard enough on its currency. Mr. Strauss-Kahn acknowledged the difficulty of being tougher, given the politics of the fund.The fund’s last multilateral consultation, to discuss global imbalances, was held in 2006. It included China, Japan, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Mr. Strauss-Kahn did not say which countries would be invited to take part this time, though other officials said it would probably include those countries and emerging markets like Brazil and Russia.1088 2008-09-26 “The crisis isn’t over, and the consequences will be serious,” he said.“Like everywhere else in the world, the French are scared. Scared for their savings, scared for their jobs, scared for their purchasing power.”The main threat to the economy, he said, is fear, and it can be conquered only by telling the truth. He called again for a conference of world leaders before year-end to address the underlying reasons for the crisis.“We’ve just passed two fingers from catastrophe,” he said. “Self-regulation, to fix all problems, is over. Laissez-faire is over.”Mr. Sarkozy emphasized that he was deeply engaged in trying to manage the crisis and would pursue his main economic reforms. Those include a shrinking of the large state sector, eliminating 30,600 jobs next year and streamlining local government, and allowing more workers, despite the 35-hour week, to get overtime pay without significantly higher taxes.But his speech, while long on rhetoric about the abuses of capitalism, was short on specifics, especially on regulating and improving the global system.The French are already anxious about their purchasing power falling behind inflation and are convinced that America’s economic problems will worsen their own financial status.Already, forecasts for French economic growth for next year have been cut in half to about 1 percent, and slower growth will inevitably mean lower tax revenue and a higher budget deficit.In the budget he is scheduled to deliver on Friday, Mr. Sarkozy is expected to announce a freeze on government spending and a retreat from promises to balance the budget by 2012 — a target that was already two years behind a European Union goal for member countries.The public deficit is expected to reach 2.7 percent of gross domestic product this year, and economists worry that without harsher spending cuts, France will exceed the 3 percent limit of the European Union next year. But the high deficit leaves Mr. Sarkozy little maneuvering room to avert a slowdown, especially since the European Central Bank, which controls the euro currency, sees its main mission as controlling inflation.French business confidence fell in September to its lowest level since mid-2003, according to Insee, the statistics office.On Thursday, Laurence Parisot, head of the main French business lobby, Medef, said that “the financial crisis, which came from the Unites States, is something extremely serious — it is a Sept. 11 of finance.”This financial crisis “could provoke a very dangerous economic crisis,” she said, risking a serious recession.Still, France has so far been reasonably well insulated from the American crisis, in large part because French banks are still heavily retail, mortgages normally require significant down payments and French regulations do not allow subprime mortgages.1089 2008-09-26 Both sides have said they are willing to return to discussions, but neither the company nor the union has been willing to budge from the positions they took before the walkout.Boeing, which offered workers an 11 percent pay increase over three years, wants to retain flexibility to send work to outside companies and to use nonunion workers in certain capacities inside its plants.The machinists, meanwhile, want a 13 percent pay increase and have demanded that Boeing bring back more of the workers who lost their jobs at the beginning of the decade, when half its orders were canceled by airlines after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.Boeing, whose machinist jobs dipped below 19,000, recalled machinists as its order books filled up. The union wants the company to hire 5,000 to 6,000 more machinists.Under union rules, striking machinists become eligible for $150 a week in strike pay once the walkout enters its third week. In addition to the checks, the union has been holding fund-raising barbecues, meant to bolster morale and help workers who have begun to file unemployment claims.The union, which struck Boeing for 24 days in 2005, has a $140 million strike fund, which could last for up to six months.The average Boeing machinist earns about $56,000 a year and receives an additional $10,200 a year in overtime, according to the company. When the value of health care and benefits are included, Boeing’s annual compensation for each machinist is about $91,500.In its most recent e-mail message to members on Thursday, the union stressed the machinists were not alone in facing down the company. “Our fight is similar to ones facing other aerospace workers throughout the world,” the e-mail message read.The message included a link to a video showing a union leader at Airbus, Boeing’s European competitor, expressing solidarity with the striking machinists. Airbus workers have staged their own series of strikes this year, snarling production at the company, which, like Boeing, is aiming to cut costs.Last Friday, as many as 300 workers from one small union walked off the job for two hours in Toulouse, France, to protest a restructuring that will eliminate 10,000 jobs across the company.Work on Airbus assembly lines was disrupted three times in as many weeks in February and March last year, as more than 33,000 demonstrators protested job cuts.Boeing and Airbus have been scurrying to build planes as they face volatile oil prices, slowing economies and a potential shakeout among Wall Street companies that finance aviation sales.Both have several years’ worth of orders for their planes, but each company has experienced delays in building important new aircraft.In Boeing’s case, the strike may threaten the first test flight later this year of the Boeing 787, a long-range aircraft for which the company has received nearly 900 orders.Nicknamed the Dreamliner, the plane is more than a year behind schedule. All Nippon Airways, the plane’s first customer, said Thursday that it would receive its first 787 next August. It originally expected the plane last May.Airbus, meanwhile, has suffered from production interruptions on its giant plane, the A380. The strike in Toulouse threatened to interrupt a hand-off ceremony last Friday.European Aeronautic Defense and Space, the parent of Airbus, also said Thursday that it had indefinitely postponed the first flight of its A400M military transport plane because of a problem with its engines.1090 2008-09-26 DETROIT — The Police Department here shut down its crime laboratory on Thursday after an audit uncovered serious errors in numerous cases. The audit said sloppy work had probably resulted in wrongful convictions, and officials expect a wave of appeals in cases that the laboratory processed.The interim mayor, Kenneth V. Cockrel Jr., and the new police chief, James Barren, ordered the laboratory closed; Mr. Cockrel called the audit’s conclusions “shocking and appalling.” Pending and future cases will be sent to the Michigan State Police, which operates seven laboratories.Officials from the Detroit Police Department, the Wayne County prosecutor’s office and the State Police will try to determine whether the errors resulted in guilty verdicts against innocent people.“We do not want any of our activities to result in someone being imprisoned that doesn’t belong there,” the Wayne County prosecutor, Kym L. Worthy, said at a news conference with Mr. Cockrel and Mr. Barren. Ms. Worthy said the mistakes also might have let violent criminals remain at large.David E. Balash, a retired State Police official who consults on firearms cases, said the audit’s findings could lead to payouts of hundreds of millions of dollars in lawsuits.1091 2008-09-26 The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, an effort by 10 Northeastern states to combat climate change, held its first auction of pollution rights on Thursday.The program caps the amount of carbon dioxide that power plants can emit, forcing utilities to buy allowances to pollute. Not all utilities participated in the auction. The prices and number of allowances sold will not be known until Monday.Critics have charged the program will have little benefit in the near term, because the emissions cap is too generous. New York, New Jersey, Delaware and New Hampshire did not issue allowances in this first quarterly auction but will participate in the future.Seven Western states and four Canadian provinces have outlined a global warming plan. Participants on both coasts hope to prod Congress into passing a national trading system.1092 2008-09-26 SHANGHAI — A lion cub and two baby orangutans have developed kidney stones at a zoo near Shanghai, making them the latest victims of China’s tainted milk crisis.The three animals had been nursed with milk powder for more than a year, said Zhang Xu, a veterinarian with the Hangzhou Zhangxu Animal Hospital.The orangutans and lion cub at the Hangzhou Safari Park near Shanghai were found to have kidney stones Wednesday after concerned officials sent them to Dr. Zhang for a checkup.The milk powder was made by the Sanlu Group, which is at the center of the tainted milk scandal. The industrial chemical melamine has been found in a growing range of Chinese-made dairy products, and it has been blamed for sickening 54,000 infants in China and killing four.“The milk powder crisis made us very worried about the health situation of baby animals,” Ju Lijia, the park’s public affairs manager, said by phone on Wednesday. “We stopped feeding with Sanlu after it was found to be tainted.”Officials at the Beijing Zoo and zoos in the other major cities of Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xian said they had no cases of animals sickened from milk powder. An official at the world’s most famous panda sanctuary, the Wolong Nature Reserve, said the baby pandas there were not fed milk formula.1093 2008-09-26 City and Port Authority officials were reluctant to discuss the latest proposal because it is still subject to negotiations, as well as approval by authority commissioners. But local politicians and members of the community board that includes ground zero embraced the news.“We are working around the clock until Oct. 2 on a report that brings certainty to the schedule and budget for the whole site, including the memorial, and a path forward to completing each project as quickly as possible,” said Christopher O. Ward, the authority’s executive director. “No final decisions have been made or will be made until that report.”A spokesman for Mayor Bloomberg, Andrew Brent, said, “We’ve come a long way, thanks to the efforts of Chris Ward and Tony Coscia,” who is chairman of the Port Authority. “But there are significant issues that need to be resolved. There are 2 years and 11 months until the 10th anniversary — and we need both a plan and a guarantee that the memorial will be open by that time. That’s the city’s priority, and we will continue to work with the port to develop a plan that can achieve it.”Alan J. Gerson, a city councilman whose district includes ground zero, said he welcomed the news that the authority had come up with a way to complete the memorial by 2011, a deadline, he said, that “can and must be met.”“Given the history, any deadline announced by the port, or any other level of government, is going to be met with a healthy degree of skepticism,” Mr. Gerson said. “That’s one reason why we’ve proposed hiring an independent auditor general to monitor all the projects downtown.”According to half a dozen executives involved in the discussions, the authority’s plan would enable it to complete all the ground-level elements of the memorial and provide public access. The museum, which would be underground, would not be completed until a year later. The cost of the transit hub, which would be completed in May 2014, is expected to grow to about $3 billion, from its current budget of $2.5 billion.The proposal to meet the 2011 deadline was made possible in part by a modification of the design for the transit hub mezzanine, a column-free space that will lie directly under part of the memorial plaza. With the help of the architect Santiago Calatrava, the authority would insert four to six columns to hold up a platform on which the memorial plaza would be built, while the mezzanine was constructed below. The plan would retain Mr. Calatrava’s grand vision for the undulating ceiling and clean expanse of the mezzanine and the dramatic birdlike design of the main building, or oculus, at street level.“I’m very pleased,” said Julie Menin, chairwoman of Community Board 1. “Otherwise, significant projects on the site would’ve been delayed.”The rebuilding of ground zero has been hampered by competing political agendas, long delays, swelling costs and calamities, like the 2007 blaze at the former Deutsche Bank tower in which two firefighters died. The building was severely damaged in the 2001 attack and is still being dismantled.George E. Pataki, who tied his legacy as governor to the rebuilding effort, was eager to show progress, but unrealistic deadlines and budgets were often announced before full designs or construction drawings had been produced, officials say. The Bloomberg administration’s focus has waxed and waned over the years.In March 2007, state and city officials received an internal report indicating that many projects downtown could be delayed by as much as five years, although the Port Authority largely dismissed the findings.In June, Governor Paterson asked the Port Authority, which owns the land at the site, to assess the overall effort and publish an unvarnished report on its findings. The authority’s new executive director, Mr. Ward, acknowledged that the authority faced “significant delays and cost overruns.”Mr. Ward organized a committee that identified what he called 15 fundamental issues — including the seemingly endless deconstruction of the former Deutsche Bank building, the restoration of Greenwich Street and the design for a bomb-screening center for tour buses and delivery trucks — that had to be resolved before a realistic schedule could be devised.Perhaps none of the 26 separate projects at ground zero is more fraught with emotion and politics than the memorial, which will cover the western half of the site. Like most of the projects, the memorial is inextricably linked to the adjacent $2.5 billion PATH train station and transit hub now under construction.1094 2008-09-26 Heading into the first scheduled presidential debate, Senator John McCain is seen by voters as more capable on national security and more knowledgeable about foreign policy, the focus of the debate, than is Senator Barack Obama, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.But discussion at the debate is sure to turn to the pressing problems posed by the faltering economy and on that score, Mr. Obama outpaces Mr. McCain.By a margin of 23 points, voters were more likely to say Mr. McCain was very knowledgeable about world affairs than they were about Mr. Obama, and 21 points more apt to say it was very likely Mr. McCain would be an effective commander in chief. Voters were also much more likely to express confidence in Mr. McCain’s ability to protect the country from a terrorist attack.Mr. Obama, though, has made some gains in recent weeks on other foreign policy measures. He now runs closer to Mr. McCain in trust over how he would handle foreign policy issues in general, after trailing by 11 points in August. Most voters polled said they thought Mr. McCain would continue President Bush’s foreign policies — a score on which Mr. Bush is broadly unpopular.Mr. Obama also runs close with Mr. McCain in confidence levels about how he would handle the war in Iraq. And he is still viewed as the candidate more likely to improve the image of the United States abroad, something that voters polled said was important for the next president to do.Both candidates will have some work to do at the debate — scheduled for Friday, though questions remain about whether it will take place then — to ease voters’ concerns about how they would approach an international problem. Neither candidate garners confidence from a majority of voters in his ability to handle an international crisis.1095 2008-09-26 Yet as many observers have pointed out, Stone’s building occupied a crucial niche in the city’s architectural memory. Its vague evocation of opulent Venetian motifs was a brazen attack on the prevailing Modernist orthodoxy. That the challenge came from one of the Modern movement’s foremost practitioners in New York only sharpened the sting.By contrast, Mr. Cloepfil’s redesign is part of a long-term effort to clean up Columbus Circle’s once-gritty image, with mixed results. The chiseled towers of the Time Warner Center, completed in 2003 just to the west along the circle, look great in the skyline, but they are planted atop a dismally generic urban shopping mall. The renovation of Columbus Circle, on the other hand, was a nice surprise: a deadening traffic island has been transformed into a grand public space encircled by fountains and benches.Sadly, the Museum of Arts and Design will only reinforce the suspicion that city officials are more intent on sanitizing the city for jittery tourists and business interests than safeguarding the public realm.Mr. Cloepfil retained the form of the building, with its gently concave facade, but wrapped it in a new skin of glazed terra-cotta tiles. A single incision cuts up and across the facade as if it were unzipped.The architectural challenge was to reshape the building’s identity without ripping out its soul. But seen from across Columbus Circle by daylight, the new exterior looks sterile. The scale and site of the building, a modest structure on a tiny piece of land surrounded by gargantuan towers, demanded something bold; Mr. Cloepfil’s tendency is toward the precious.At ground level, for example, he decided to keep all of Stone’s original so-called lollipop columns except one and wrapped the entire base in glass. As a result, the columns look meek and lifeless, as if they had been embalmed.Above, the thousands of terra-cotta tiles have an attractive candy-coated gloss, especially at dusk, when they glitter in the reflected light. But their diminutive size makes them seem slightly fussy and out of place.The cut is a more confident gesture — until it reaches the top, where it dissolves into a band of windows. (In Mr. Cloepfil’s defense, he says he demurred at creating this vast expanse of glass, but the museum insisted on it.)The disappointments continue inside, where Mr. Cloepfil demonstrates his practical skills, but none of the virtuosity — a feel for materials and structure, for the play of light across surfaces — that can elevate a design from mundane concerns into the lofty realm of art.Mr. Cloepfil cleans up the convoluted circulation route through the building, for instance, which allows him to create more generous spaces within a limited floor plate. He removed two emergency staircases that had been tucked into the building’s back corners, replacing them with a single stairway behind the elevator core. He also carved windows into the northeast and northwest corners of the gallery floors. The windows allow light into the galleries without sacrificing wall space, provide gorgeous views up Broadway and out over Central Park and allow the galleries to breathe, an effect that is a bit like loosening a corset.But the critical strategy here is the incision, which runs across the gallery floors and ceilings as well as up the exterior facade. The power of this idea arises from its violence. If its relentless logic holds, it will have a destabilizing effect on the viewer, as if the very structure that holds the building together is being cut away.Yet Mr. Cloepfil undermines this gesture through the carelessness of his detailing. At the point where the incision turns from the wall and cuts across the ceiling, for example, a section of drywall is left at the corner; the result reads as two separate slots of glass instead of a continuous cut through the building.Similarly, narrow strips of wood separate the glass channels that run across the gallery floors from the window frames, which makes the incisions feel decorative rather than like a clean surgical cut.These are not minor details. They are critical to how ideas are conveyed; when used effectively, the impact is visceral and immediate. The mind doesn’t take time to interpret, step by step, the architect’s intention. This is what separates pedestrian work from serious architecture.You can’t help but think of Gordon Matta-Clark, who famously carved up abandoned New York buildings with a power saw in the 1970s. His works, though considered art, were often a harsh commentary on his era, a reflection on the disintegration of the fragile social fabric that bound the city together. Yet by cutting structures apart and allowing the light to flow in, he was also illuminating dark, forbidden corners, exposing their beauty and fragility.In Mr. Cloepfil’s hands, the same gesture is mild and timid. Harsh edges have been smoothed over. We’re left with an image of a New York that has been scrubbed of any real meaning.1096 2008-09-26 FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — Over the course of eight N.F.L. seasons, David Barrett played in 120 games and logged 75 starts, all at cornerback. So when the Jets’ coaches approached Barrett before the start of training camp and said they wanted him to play safety, he did not know whether to take them seriously.“I thought they were kidding around,” he said Thursday.Barrett had never played safety — not in four distinguished seasons at Arkansas and not with the Cardinals or the Jets, the two N.F.L. teams for which he has played. But this has been a year filled with change for Barrett, who accepted a pay cut and the position switch for the chance to play another season with the Jets.Although cornerbacks regularly become safeties later in their careers, that did not make Barrett’s adjustment any easier. He frequently went to the starting safeties, Eric Smith and Kerry Rhodes, and asked them for advice. He studied his new position. He played there a bit this preseason.“It felt a little awkward,” Barrett said. “It felt a little weird. I wasn’t used to doing it. I’m used to being out there, on an island, just me and the wide receiver. I’m used to getting the call from the safety. Now, I’m the person giving it.”That is the biggest difference, making calls instead of receiving them. Safeties are responsible for reading opposing offenses and moving teammates into the positions best suited to defend.Cornerback Darrelle Revis said the players in the Jets secondary routinely learned the other positions. But knowing what a safety does and actually doing it proved to be a challenge for Barrett.1097 2008-09-26 BRUSSELS — European Union lawmakers proposed tougher-than-expected emissions goals for carmakers on Thursday, dealing a blow to the German automobile industry.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany had led political efforts to modify the plan, put forward by the European Commission, which penalized makers of larger and heavier vehicles, like Daimler and Porsche.Such cars produce higher levels of emissions than smaller models.Automobile manufacturers have also waged an intense lobbying effort to win more time to adapt to stricter emissions standards.The bill would be the first legally binding carbon emission standard ever for new cars in Europe.On Thursday, the Environment Committee of the European Parliament backed important elements of the original proposal drafted by the commission. The vote angered the car industry, which accused the committee of jeopardizing European jobs and manufacturing.“This is bad news for Europe, especially with the overall economic circumstances deteriorating already,” said Ivan Hodac, the secretary general of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, which represents carmakers like BMW, Renault and Volvo. “The European car industry calls on legislators to refrain from threatening the future of car production in Europe.”The measures await approval from the Parliament, which could vote in mid-November, and from European governments, which have called for a decision by the end of the year.1098 2008-09-26 In 2007, the European Union imported from China about 19,500 tons of confectionary products, including pastries, cake and cookies, and about 1,250 tons of chocolate and other prepared foods containing cocoa.“Children who consume both biscuits and chocolate could potentially exceed the T.D.I. by up to more than three times,” the European Food Safety Authority said Thursday, referring to the tolerable daily intake of melamine that the agency regards as safe. Levels above that could result in , Ian Palombi, a spokesman for the agency, said in a telephone interview.In , the European Commission was trying to assess the extent of the risk. “The problem is with the composite food products, which can be imported, even if they contain milk powder from China,” said Nina Papadoulaki, a spokeswoman for the commission. She said the Commission did not know how many companies sell snacks in Europe that were manufactured in China or included ingredients from China.She said that member states and food companies in the European Union had been asked to test products for melamine in the past 10 days and so far had not detected a problem, although the testing was continuing.In the United States, some consumer groups called for stricter regulation as well.“It is now clear that China has exported dairy products like powdered milk and milk protein products around the globe and we know that some of them came to the United States,” said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food and Water Watch. “It is time for the F.D.A. to take this issue seriously and stop the import of dairy products from China until this situation is under control.”The United States has imported two million pounds of a milk protein called casein this year, along with other powdered milk proteins that are used as ingredients in many processed foods, according to figures from the . This includes 293,000 pounds that were imported in July. The Food and Drug Administration did not immediately return calls for comment on Thursday.Melamine is a chemical used in plastic manufacturing that can be added to foods to artificially increase their protein content in testing. Its presence was detected in pet foods originating from China last year.Even if present in foods in Europe, milk powder contaminated with melamine is not likely to cause the kind of public health disaster that is occurring among Chinese infants. In China, babies drank contaminated milk powder as their sole source of for weeks if not months, and a handful have died.Because the harm caused by melamine is related to someone’s weight, it is far less harmful to older children and not likely to be dangerous for adults. Also, for children and adults in Europe, melamine-contaminated milk powder is one small component of a broader diet. The toxic effects of melamine are cumulative, creating kidney stones that can in severe cases lead to . Still, children who eat very large quantities of sweets could be at risk.This week, a number of countries and companies that had previously removed Chinese dairy products from supermarket shelves have started removing snack foods containing milk powder as well. On Thursday, members of the Philippine Association of Supermarkets removed Chinese food products with milk ingredients.In an increasingly globalized food economy, manufacturers use raw ingredients from all over the world, often making it difficult to track the origins.For example, , the maker of Oreo cookies, recently moved one of its large cookie factories from to China. But Claire Regan, a spokeswoman for the company, said that most of the products Kraft made in China were distributed within China, although a limited number were exported. Most do not contain milk products from China, she said, and, when they do, the levels of such ingredients are very low. The Oreo product line does not contain milk ingredients from China, Ms. Regan said.1099 2008-09-26 But a spokesman for the Pakistani Army, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said Pakistani forces fired warning shots at the American aircraft after they crossed into Pakistan’s territory in the area of Saidgai, in the Ghulam Khan region of North Waziristan. “On this, the helicopters returned fire and flew back,” General Abbas said.Local residents said that one of the two helicopters had entered inside Pakistan territory by about a mile, while the other hovered on the Afghan side of the border.“When our forces fired warning shots, we were a little scared of a possible retaliatory fire from the helicopters,” said one of the residents, Hajji Said Rehman Gorbaz. “But we were happy to see the helicopter flying back into Afghanistan. We were happy that our forces fired at the helicopter.”Pakistan’s president, Asif Ali Zardari, said Thursday that his nation’s military had fired only flares at the helicopters, seeming to draw a distinction with warning “shots,” which usually refers to bullets or other ordnance that could more seriously damage the helicopters.“They are flares,” Mr. Zardari said as he sat down to meet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at the United Nations. He said the flares would alert the pilots that they had crossed the border, which he said is rugged and poorly marked.Ms. Rice agreed that the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan was “very, very unclear.”But the encounter drew immediate protest from Pentagon officials in Washington. “The flight path of the helicopters at no point took them over Pakistan,” a Pentagon spokesman, Bryan Whitman, told reporters.Mr. Whitman said United States and NATO military officials were speaking to their Pakistani counterparts to determine what happened and to ensure there was no repeat, adding, “The Pakistanis have to provide us with a better understanding of why this took place.”General Abbas, the Pakistani spokesman, said the clash had been reported to NATO headquarters in Kabul and was under investigation by both Pakistani and NATO officials.Military officials and diplomats said the exchange of fire showed there was a risk of a much more serious, and lethal, misunderstanding along the border.Pakistani civilian leaders have denounced an incursion by American Special Operations forces into Pakistan on Sept. 3, which was authorized under orders given by President Bush in July, and the Pakistani Army has vowed to defend its border. The United States says it has to stop attacks on troops in Afghanistan by Al Qaeda and Taliban militants based in Pakistan.“We will not tolerate any act against our sovereignty and integrity in the name of the war against terrorism,” Pakistan’s prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, told reporters on Wednesday.The latest clash on Thursday comes after a week of claims by Pakistani intelligence officials that American helicopters had strayed across the border from Pakistan, and that an American remotely piloted surveillance aircraft had crashed, apparently because of a mechanical failure, in Pakistani territory.American officials denied these claims, saying they were being manufactured by Pakistani officials in response to rising anti-American sentiment in Pakistan after the increased American activities in the border area.Earlier this week, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates defended the recent raid by Special Operations forces as essential to defend American and other allied troops battling militants in Afghanistan.1100 2008-09-26 Mr. McCain and his Democratic opponent, Senator , left the White House by a side entrance without commenting. The initial silence of the presidential candidates reinforced the impression that thorny issues still need to be addressed.Shortly afterward, Mr. Obama said in an interview on CNN that he was confident that a deal would be reached “eventually,” but he said, “I think there’s still some work that needs to be done.”Mr. McCain said he, too, was optimistic, at least in the long run. “I am confident that we will reach an agreement that gets a majority of my colleagues on my side of the aisle as well as a majority on the other side,” he said on .The impression that much remains to be done was reinforced by Mr. Dodd’s comments. After saying he still hoped for a deal, the senator said it was important to take “whatever time it takes” to arrive at a good arrangement, since the effects will be felt for “years and years to come.”It has become abundantly clear, that members of Congress are hearing from their constituents, many of whom are furious about the proposed rescue.Democrats said that Senate and House Democrats and Senate Republicans and the White House were ready to hammer out a deal, but that House Republicans balked.“We were ready to make a deal,” said Representative , Democrat of , who attended the meeting and was standing next to House Speaker as Mr. Paulson Jr. asked for more time.“The House Republicans now tell us we’re not for this, we have got something else,” Mr. Frank said.He complained that the new House Republican counter-proposal included ideas about private mortgage insurance and a cut in the capital gains tax that Mr. Paulson had already testified would not work.Mr. Frank blamed a “troika” of conservative House Republicans — Jeb Hensarling of , Paul Ryan of , and Eric Cantor of — for pushing the alternative proposal.Earlier Thursday, House and Senate negotiators said they had reached a deal on a rescue, authorizing unprecedented government intervention to buy distressed debt in a move to prevent what President Bush warned could be a widespread economic collapse.Republicans and Democrats said that the legislation would include limits on the pay packages for executives of some firms that seek assistance and a mechanism for the government to take an equity stake in some of the firms, so taxpayers have a chance to profit if the bailout plan works.The announcement that lawmakers had reached an accord came on a day of high political theater at the Capitol and at the White House — in a drama whose ending may be quite unpredictable, it seemed after the late-afternoon White House meeting broke up.“We’re in a serious economic crisis,” Mr. Bush told reporters as the meeting began, shortly before 4 p.m. in the Cabinet Room of the White House, adding, “This meeting is an attempt to move the process forward. My hope is we can reach an agreement very shortly.”Mr. McCain was seated at one end of a long conference table, Mr. Obama at the other, with the president and congressional leaders between them. Neither spoke, though Mr. McCain smiled broadly as reporters shouted questions that went unanswered by Mr. Bush.The president, in a prime-time televised speech on Wednesday night, appealed to the nation — and to reluctant lawmakers — to support the plan.After the address, the drafting effort continued through the night on both sides of Capitol Hill — with pizza on the House side, and Thai food in the Senate. (Negotiations between the House and the Senate can be nearly as complicated as negotiations between Democrats and Republicans.)But even as Congressional leaders shook hands on an agreement, House Republicans warned that opposition was building.Conservative Republicans, in particular, have said that such a huge government intervention violated their free market principles.A senior Republican lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to undermine the party leadership, said there was a “violent reaction” among House Republicans to the Paulson plan. He said backers of the alternative, one of several that have been proposed in the House, are calculating that they can force the negotiators to accept it as part of a larger deal.1101 2008-09-26 The three taikonauts — the Chinese term for astronauts — plan to run tests in space and launch a small satellite monitoring station. They are carrying traditional Chinese medicine on board, in case of sickness, and their diet includes shredded pork sautéed with garlic and grilled beef with spicy sauce.One astronaut is wearing what the state-run news media has dubbed “the most complicated, advanced and expensive suit in the world,” a $4.4 million space suit designed and produced in China. The spacecraft was launched by what the Chinese space agency calls the Long March II-F carrier rocket, which took the spacecraft into a low orbit, about 210 miles above Earth. The mission, which is being covered extensively in the Chinese media, is another milestone for a country that got a late start in space exploration but is now aggressively launching commercial satellites, putting humans in space and even shooting down aging satellites.“They have joined a very exclusive club; only the U.S. and Russians are members,” said Roger D. Launius, a senior curator and expert on space history at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, referring generally to China’s space program. “It’s a great start, even though it’s nowhere near what the Russians and the U.S. have accomplished with space flight.”Russia and the United States conducted their first spacewalks in 1965, and in 1969 the United States became the first country to put a person on the moon.But Michael D. Griffin, the administrator of NASA, has repeatedly warned that despite the head start by other nations, the Chinese program is moving swiftly and could overtake American efforts to return to the moon by 2020. In testimony to the Senate last year, Mr. Griffin said it was likely that “China will be able to put people on the Moon before we will be able to get back.” He added: “I admire what they have done, but I am concerned that it will leave the United States in its wake.”The Chinese government also hopes the national space program will aid the nation economically by helping to create technological breakthroughs that may someday be applied to computers or other digital equipment.India and Japan are now aggressively developing their own space programs, creating some competition in Asia for space flight, and the Europeans have joined forces to explore space.But China says its space program is speeding along, often with Chinese technology, helping establish the country as a technological power and bringing another dose of pride to the nation after the Olympic Games in Beijing this summer.Because spaceflight requires large booster rockets and other sophisticated technology that often has military applications, national space programs are often veiled in secrecy, and cooperation among nations is complicated.Indeed, on Wednesday, the F.B.I. arrested a Chinese-born physicist in Newport News, Va., on charges of illegally exporting space launching technical data and services to China beginning in January 2003. The physicist, Shu Quan-Sheng, 68, was born in China but was a naturalized American citizen. He has a doctorate in physics.Mr. Shu was also accused of offering bribes to Chinese government officials in exchange for a business contract, according to an F.B.I. statement.1102 2008-09-26 “This is the engine room of the U.S. economy,” Mr. Marta said. “It’s not very sexy, it’s kind of esoteric, nobody ever pays attention to it, but that’s what’s breaking.”On Thursday, this was the type of critical short-term financing — including markets for commercial paper, municipal bonds and overnight bank loans — that was gumming up.Banks, apparently stocking up amid the worst financial crisis in decades, were reluctant to lend cash, sending interest rates soaring.The three-month Libor rate, a benchmark gauge that measures how much banks charge one another for overnight loans, jumped the most in one day in nearly a decade, reaching 3.77 percent.The TED spread, which tracks the difference between how much banks pay for a three-month loan versus the Treasury, has tripled this month, and widened again on Thursday to a near-record high.“There continues to be extraordinary hoarding of cash,” Mr. Marta said. “There are still a lot of things broken in the markets.”Investors did seem slightly more confident about moving their money out of ultra-safe short-term Treasury notes; for days, they had been willing to accept minuscule returns in exchange for a safer bet than stocks or corporate bonds.On Thursday, the yield on the two-year Treasury note rose to 2.19 percent, up 0.22 percent. The yield on the one-month Treasury bill rose to 0.1 percent, although this remained near last week’s lows. Fear was much less pronounced in the stock market, where investors seemed to place their bets with an eye toward the imminent passage of the bailout plan.The broad Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 2 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average, which measures stock prices of 30 companies, rose nearly 200 points to close at 11,022.06. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.4 percent.Shares of Goldman Sachs gained 1.9 percent; Morgan Stanley was up 9.3 percent. The cost to insure both companies’ debt declined, although the cost for Morgan Stanley remained near the highs of last week.The stock market made gains despite three grim government reports on the economy. Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods fell 4.5 percent in August, a sign that businesses were reluctant to make major investments, and the Labor Department said the number of new applications for jobless benefits rose by 32,000 last week to a seven-year high.Sales of new homes fell again last month, even as prices continued to decline. Sales were off 11.5 percent from July, and median prices were 6.2 percent lower than a year ago.Stocks also shook off a pessimistic report from the General Electric Corporation, which said on Thursday morning that it expected to earn less money this year than it had originally forecast. The company also froze its dividend payments and suspended a stock repurchasing program.Markets in Europe ended higher after a quiet start. The FTSE 100 in London and the DAX index in Frankfurt each gained 2 percent; the CAC 40 in Paris ended 2.7 percent higher.Following are the results of Thursday’s auction of 34-day cash management bills and five-year notes:1103 2008-09-26 WEISS--Emil R. , died Tuesday, September 16, 2008 at age 76 in New York City.

But Obama really more than held his own.“John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007,” he said. “You talk about the surge. The war started in 2003. And at the time, when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong.” Although this is a very old argument, it sounded remarkably fresh, like revisiting semiforgotten territory.McCain stumbled over the name of the president of Iran and misstated the name of the new leader of . This would, under normal circumstances, be less than nothing. But the first presidential debate is meant to be an event so fraught with meaning that combat to the death pales in comparison. Every word matters!This campaign has been so chock full of excitement, however, that the debate lost some of its normal most-important-moment-in-history sheen. The real tension, after all, had been getting McCain there in the first place. A simple trip to turned into a saga featuring many, many rapidly changing story lines:* No debate unless Congress passes a financial rescue bill!* No debate unless Congress has a plan to pass a financial rescue bill.* Oh, what the heck.After all that, when the wandering debater finally showed up Friday night, he just looked like a smallish, grayish, slightly grumpy guy with a grizzly obsession.To be fair, it had been a very long week for McCain, what with ruling out the debate, ruling in the debate and returning to a Senate from which he has been AWOL so long that it’s believed his desk is now being used to store janitorial supplies.He raced there in answer to the crisis call, after a brief detour to New York to deliver a desperately needed speech on fossil fuels at the Clinton Global Initiative. He could not have sounded more filled with passion about service and country and the need for his leadership. Then he joined President Bush, Obama and members of Congress in a White House meeting that his campaign had orchestrated, where he sat in near-silence as a bipartisan consensus fell apart.One thing we now know for sure. Electing John McCain would be God’s gift to the profession of journalism. A story a minute.Imagine what would happen if a new beetle infested the corn crop during the first year of a McCain administration. On Monday, we spray. On Tuesday, we firebomb. On Wednesday, the president marches barefoot through the prairie in a show of support for Iowa farmers. On Thursday, the White House reveals that Wiley Flum, a postal worker from Willimantic, Conn., has been named the new beetle eradication czar. McCain says that Flum had shown “the instincts of a maverick reformer” in personally buying a box of roach motels and scattering them around the post office locker room. “I can’t wait to introduce Wiley to those beetles in Iowa,” the president adds.On Friday, McCain announces he’s canceling the weekend until Congress makes the beetles go away.Barack Obama would just round up a whole roomful of experts and come up with a plan. Yawn.1116 2008-09-27 Worldwide emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from fuel burning and cement production increased by 3.5 percent per year from 2000 to 2007, nearly four times the growth rate in the 1990s, according to a new report. The rapid rise is being driven primarily by economic growth in developing countries, which now produce more greenhouse gas than industrialized countries. The report was produced by the Global Carbon Project and is available online at globalcarbonproject.org. In a worrisome trend, the authors of the report said, the capacity of oceans, forests and other “sinks” to sop up carbon dioxide has not kept pace with the increase in emissions.1117 2008-09-27 The season premiere of “Grey’s Anatomy” vaulted ABC to No. 1 in the ratings on Thursday, averaging 18.3 million viewers, according to Nielsen’s estimates. Those numbers are down from the show’s fourth-season debut a year ago, which drew 20.9 million. ABC’s “Ugly Betty” premiere came up shorter at 8 (9.8 million), down by more than a million from last year’s debut. CBS ranked second on the night with the two-hour premiere of “Survivor: Gabon,” the 17th edition of the series. It drew the lowest ratings on record for the start of a new “Survivor” series, attracting 12.9 million viewers. On NBC, hourlong premieres of “My Name Is Earl” and “The Office” drew 6.4 million and 9.2 million, respectively. The 15th-season debut of NBC’s “ER” earned just 7.9 million viewers.1118 2008-09-27 He’s played Pepperland, Penny Lane and the Magical Mystery Tour, but Paul McCartney had never performed in Israel. Until now: on Thursday night, Mr. McCartney, 66, gave a concert in Tel Aviv for an estimated crowd of 40,000 fans and slightly fewer security guards. (Mr. McCartney was unswayed by threats of violence that the concert, held in honor of the 60th anniversary of Israel, had attracted, telling the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, “I do what I think, and I have many friends who support Israel.”) In 1965 the Israeli government banned the Beatles from performing for fear that that they would have a “negative influence” on the country’s youth. That ban was lifted this year.1119 2008-09-27 Since being elected to the House in 2002, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, has loudly called for cutting spending and taxes — not surprising for a protégé of former Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, who was Mr. Hensarling’s professor at Texas A&M University.During his first term in the House, Mr. Hensarling, who represents part of Dallas and some of its suburbs, co-founded the “Washington Waste Watchers,” which sought to eradicate abuse, fraud and waste in government. Mr. Hensarling has also proposed a constitutional amendment that would limit the growth in federal spending to the rate of economic growth.He says the sponsors of pet projects added to appropriation bills should be publicly identified, to make members think twice before submitting requests. Now the chairman of the Republican Study Committee — a group he has called the “keeper of the conservative flame” — Mr. Hensarling, 51, urged Republicans to return to their conservative roots after they lost the House and Senate in 2006.“Like mosquitoes in a nudist colony,” he said after the 2006 elections, “Republicans will have more than enough opportunities to show the voters we deserve our conservative brand back.”Now finishing his fourth term in the House, Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, is widely seen as a rising star both among conservatives and in the Republican Party. His name was one of those floated as a potential running mate for Senator John McCain.1120 2008-09-27 Smithfield Foods, the world’s biggest pork processor, said it would be in compliance with all its financial covenants through at least April after its shares plunged to a seven-year low in New York trading. “The company has no significant debt payments due until late into calendar 2009,” Smithfield said in a statement. The company’s shares dropped earlier Friday on concerns it might not meet its debt covenants. Shares on Friday fell 21 percent, to $13.98, before closing at $17.11, a loss of 3 percent. Last month, Smithfield reported its first quarterly loss in 10 years as rising grain prices increased the cost of feeding hogs and turkeys.1121 2008-09-27 The McClatchy Company said it had amended a credit agreement with its lenders, something that would help the newspaper publisher avoid defaulting on its debt. The agreement covers $1.18 billion in debt, much of which stems from McClatchy’s purchase of Knight Ridder in 2006. It is the latest in a series of moves by McClatchy, which publishes papers including The Sacramento Bee and The Miami Herald, to cut costs and strengthen its financial position as it deals with a severe downturn in advertising revenue. The credit agreement says that McClatchy can increase its ratio of debt to cash flow to 6.25 times through the quarter ending in December 2008. That covenant stands at 5 times cash flow now, a spokeswoman said.1122 2008-09-27 Just as they were trying to reassert themselves as a party of fiscal restraint, President Bush, on his way out the White House door, was asking them to sign off of on a $700 billion bailout built on taxpayer dollars, with very few questions allowed.“You were being asked to choose between financial meltdown on the one hand and taxpayer bankruptcy and the road to socialism on the other and you were told do it in 24 hours,” Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, head of the conservative group, said. “It was just never going to happen.”As they dig in against the White House, House Republicans are drawing strength and encouragement from outside critics of the bailout, like former Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Club for Growth, a conservative economic group known for financing primary challenges against apostate Republicans.Richard Viguerie, the longtime conservative leader, on Friday heralded House Republicans for guarding against “this total cave-in by President Bush and the Senate Republicans.”The resistance caps two years of frustration among House Republicans after losing the majority in 2006. They believe they have suffered serious mistreatment at the hands of the Democrats and that they have been marginalized in legislative negotiations since they, unlike their Senate counterparts, do not have the procedural weapons to force their way to the negotiating table.They also complain that Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has been too quick to bargain mainly with Democrats, led by the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, and Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, not only on this plan but on the stimulus proposal earlier this year, a subsequent housing bill and other economic measures.The Monday e-mail message, which led to a statement of principles that many other conservatives embraced, became their manifesto. By Thursday, a legislative alternative was circulating, one centered on federal insurance for mortgage assets combined with tax cuts on investment gains. When Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, put that alternative on the table at the White House on Thursday afternoon, a verbal brawl broke out, scuttling a grand compromise and forcing negotiators back to the table.With the blessing of Mr. Boehner, the plan was promoted by a troika made up of Mr. Hensarling along with Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, a major fund-raiser and a rising star in the Republican ranks, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who is seen as one of the sharpest economic minds in the Republican conference.The legislative alternative, combined with anger at their vastly reduced power on Capitol Hill and fueled by an internal power struggle , has made House Republicans suddenly relevant again. They have become the chief impediment to speedy approval of a bailout plan, because Democrats say they will not push one through on their own.It represents a risky approach, raising the prospect that Republicans could be blamed if the bailout collapses and the markets plunge. But they could also claim victory if some of their plan is incorporated into the final product and it generates Republican support — still a large question mark as negotiations continued. Democrats and the Treasury Department both say the Republican plan is flawed and unworkable.Recognizing the prospect that a failure could be attributed to them, Republicans took pains Friday to make it clear they recognized some government intervention was necessary, just not the sort sought by the White House. And Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the No. 2 House Republican, was tapped to serve as an official emissary to the negotiations.Mr. Cantor acknowledged, “People want to see a deal made, no question about it.”Yet, at the same time, it was becoming quite obvious that some House Republicans no longer saw themselves as an extension of the Bush White House.For example, in advance of the president’s speech Wednesday, Representative Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan, a member of the Republican leadership, sent out this statement expressing his pique: “Who’s giving the Republican response?”The revolt surprised many because the Republican leadership of the House and Senate initially appeared to be solidly in Mr. Paulson’s corner. Participants at last week’s meeting between the leadership and administration economic advisers said Mr. Boehner was among those most willing to endorse a drastic intervention, a position he emphasized in a later television interview, calling for speedy action.But he began rolling back as the negotiations moved ahead and was adamant, after the Thursday announcement of a deal in principle, that there was no deal he had blessed. By Thursday night, he had moved behind the Republican alternative, demanding it get a hearing.Aides to Mr. Boehner said he was motivated partly by what he saw as a political effort by Democrats to seal a deal before Senator John McCain, the party’s presidential candidate, could have a say in talks when he arrived Thursday.On Friday, when House Republicans met to review the state of play, Mr. Boehner received a standing ovation at the Republican meeting in tribute to his decision to balk at the plan.“Republicans say they believe they stand to be rewarded for forcing closer review of the bailout. They say Democrats can always pass the Treasury plan on their own.“If Democrats believe the only plan that will save the economy is the Paulson plan, they have the power and the moral responsibility to go ahead and pass it,” said Mr. Hensarling. “They don’t have to have Republican votes to get it done.”1123 2008-09-27 “This was an intentional strategy,” said another close adviser, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut. “This was his plan, that he wanted to be a bridge builder here and not to come in and dictate a solution of the way to solve this. There was some cheap criticism of him for not speaking more at the White House, or offering a specific proposal, but that is exactly what he wanted to do.”Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, who had been negotiating for the House Republicans but was not authorized to make a deal, said that he called Mr. McCain this week to complain that the White House and Congressional Democrats were cutting House Republicans out of the deal. He said Mr. McCain asked if he could be helpful, and he told Mr. McCain that he could.“His greatest contribution,” Mr. Bachus said, “was returning to Washington and standing up for Republicans who were refusing to be stampeded.”Mr. McCain’s advisers cast his role on Friday as a supportive, essential presence to Republicans who were enraged by what they considered their harsh treatment at the White House on Thursday afternoon, and the dismissive attitude of their Republican colleagues in the Senate. They also tried to push back against a narrative that emerged Thursday, which portrayed Mr. McCain as injecting partisan politics into delicate dealmaking, and replace it with the image of a presidential candidate who stopped a bad deal from going through.“Basically, what he saw happening is that the Senate kind of wrote off the House in terms of being able to make them a partner, and that was a mistake,” Mr. Graham said. “The most constructive thing I think John did to get this thing on track is that he went over to the House twice and said: ‘Guys, I’ve heard your concerns and you know what? I think a lot of them are legitimate.’ ”But many House Republicans remain deeply skeptical of Mr. McCain, and it is not clear whether he would have had the clout to change any minds in the Republican caucus. One of Mr. McCain’s own advisers said Friday that the financial crisis found the senator working with people who were “not historically his closest friends on Capitol Hill.”Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia, said that “if McCain came out and said, ‘Here’s a deal that I like,’ that would be significant.” But when asked if lawmakers would back a deal just because it had Mr. McCain’s support, Mr. Kingston said: “Not so much. This becomes a vote of conscience. It’s a vote of principle.”As described by Mr. McCain’s advisers, the senator began Friday with phone calls to the Senate leadership, the House leadership, individual Republicans and members of the Bush administration. When he arrived on Capitol Hill a little before 9 a.m., he headed to the office of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. With Mr. McCain were his chief economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, and Mr. Graham.After some 30 minutes, the group went to the office of the House Republican leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, where Mr. McCain told the Republicans opposed to the White House plan that it was important to have a negotiator with real clout representing their interests. Mr. McCain did not mention any names, but later, Mr. Boehner named Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the House whip, as a new chief negotiator.“He was very emphatic about the need for us to pass legislation and to act,” said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the chief deputy whip, who attended the meeting and has been circulating an alternative proposal that would rely on government-backed mortgage insurance. “Frankly, people are very turned off by the $700 billion number, but they do know that we’ve got to do something. So I think the senator is just trying to understand where members are, and to help the process.”Mr. McCain then returned to his own office where, advisers said, he made the decision, between 10 and 10:30 a.m., to fly to Mississippi and participate in the debate against his Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama. The advisers said Mr. McCain had decided that enough progress had been made, for now.But back at the Capitol, some Republicans were hard-pressed to say what, precisely, Mr. McCain had accomplished during his 24-hour stay. Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who is working with Mr. Cantor on the alternative bailout plan, said that he found Mr. McCain did more listening than talking when he met with him on Thursday.“He was in the information-gathering stage,” Mr. Ryan said. Asked what role Mr. McCain was continuing to play, Mr. Ryan looked puzzled. “I think he’s debating,” the congressman said. “Didn’t he go down to Mississippi?”1124 2008-09-27 A Treasury Department panel issued final recommendations on Friday meant to encourage auditing firms to catch corporate fraud before it happens — and to protect them from going under when it does.But the nonbinding recommendations, from the agency’s advisory committee on the auditing profession, did not suggest that auditing firms be insulated from lawsuits stemming from their work for clients who engage in fraudulent activities — a hotly debated issue in the profession.Arthur Andersen, once one of the nation’s largest auditors, went out of business in 2002 after having approved the books of Enron, the energy giant that collapsed because of fraud. Since then, the profession has worried that there are too few large firms left to monitor the books of corporate America. Four large firms, known as the Big Four, now combine auditing and accounting services.The Treasury panel’s final recommendations will be detailed in a full report to be released next week. The 21-member panel was led by Arthur Levitt Jr., a former Federal Reserve chairman, and Donald T. Nicolaisen, a former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission.The final report, based nearly entirely on a recent draft that is publicly available, will say that the panel “considered testimony regarding the variety of potentially catastrophic risks that public company auditing firms face.”1125 2008-09-27 On Thursday, investment-grade loans were trading lower than junk bonds, because investors were selling off their most liquid assets to raise capital. Wachovia, the nation’s fifth-largest bank holding company, suddenly appeared to be in deep trouble: “Wachovia is trading as if it’s going to fail,” Dave Klein, a manager at Credit Derivatives Research, said on Friday. Washington Mutual was seized by the government. The markets may not be as panicked as they were last week, but with every passing day, the situation is getting increasingly dangerous.Or, to put it another way, with every passing day, Congress is fiddling while Rome is burning.Last week, I wrote a column suggesting that the Paulson plan was unlikely to fix the enormous problems facing the financial markets and the country’s faltering economy. I am still not sure it will work — or that it is the best possible solution — but this week, I have a different, more urgent concern.Whatever its imperfections — and despite the possibility it might not work — it needs to be approved, quickly. I’m praying that by the time the markets open on Monday, Congressional leaders will have reached a consensus on the bailout plan. We’re running out of time.I know there is something tremendously galling about the prospect of Americans putting $700 billion — or more — of their tax dollars at risk to come to the aid of banks and investment banks whose reckless behavior has so damaged the country. They gamed the system. They lined their pockets. They made terrible, terrible mistakes. I’m as angry about it as you are.I am also aware that there are lots of smart people who don’t like the bailout plan. On my blog the other day, I posted a letter to the House leadership from more than 200 economists. They complained about what they saw as the plan’s essential unfairness (“The plan is a subsidy to investors at taxpayers’ expense”), its ambiguity (“Neither the mission of the new agency nor its oversight are clear”), and the potential that it might ultimately weaken the very markets it was aimed at saving. The objection of the House Republicans who are currently blocking the plan — namely, that a taxpayer bailout of this magnitude should be avoided if at all possible — also deserves to be taken seriously.Finally, I’ve been hearing a number of interesting ideas that could well turn out to be better than the Paulson plan. One of the most intriguing ones comes from Andrew Feldstein, the chief executive of Blue Mountain Capital Management, a hedge fund that specializes in credit instruments. He proposes that instead of buying bad assets that are crippling the balance sheets of the nation’s banks, the government should establish a “good bank” that would buy only solid assets.By setting up such a bank — Mr. Feldstein envisions having the government put up $300 billion and taking an equity stake, so that taxpayers can profit when it is sold after the crisis passes — the government would make it possible for credit to “again flow to deserving borrowers.” Bad banks might eventually fail — but they would have a place to sell their good assets as they liquidate. Healthier institutions could once again start lending. Taxpayers would face much less risk.If the country had more time, I would argue that we put ideas like that into the sunlight and see if they flower. But we don’t have any more time. Nine days ago, the financial markets were staring into the abyss; the only thing that pulled them back was the news that the Treasury and the Federal Reserve had come up with a bailout plan.And the only thing that has kept them from falling back is the expectation that the plan will be approved quickly. For a while, it looked as if that was exactly what would happen.Mr. Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, spent the early part of the week defending the plan before Congress. While they faced tough questioning, their main point came through: they had to act fast, otherwise the economy would crater.Behind the scenes, Congressional leaders began to hammer out the outline of a deal, with the Democrats insisting on strong oversight for the fund, curbs on executive compensation for institutions that sold off their toxic securities to the government and aid for struggling homeowners, among other things.On Thursday, after an arduous three-hour meeting, it appeared a deal had been struck, but it quickly fell apart after House Republicans — and Senator John McCain — objected to it. That afternoon, I had a short conversation with Representative Barney Frank, the Democrat from Massachusetts who leads the House Financial Services Committee. He was seething.“Spencer was in the meeting with us the whole time,” he said. He was referring to Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, who was representing the House Republicans in the negotiations. “And now here comes John McCain acting like Andy Kaufman — ‘Here I come to save the day.’ Inserting presidential politics into this is just —— ” He stopped suddenly. Whatever word he had in mind he didn’t want to share with a reporter.There is no question that a large part of the reason House Republicans are objecting to the Paulson plan is because of the potential loss of taxpayers’ money.“Putting $700 billion of taxpayers’ money at risk — that’s not something we do every day,” said an aide to the House minority staff (who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for the leadership). Indeed, the proposal offered by Representative John A. Boehner, the House minority leader — to create a government-backed insurance pool to guarantee mortgage-backed securities — is another of those interesting ideas that would deserve merit if there were more time.But it is also true that much of the opposition to the Paulson plan is purely ideological — there are Republicans who believe that the bailout plan is a step toward socialism. And it appears that they would rather see the economy go down the tubes than do something they find ideologically distasteful.And that’s what is so infuriating. Henry Paulson is not what you’d call a socialist — nor is Ben Bernanke or President Bush. They are all holding their noses as they sell this plan. Barney Frank is allied with Mr. Paulson and a president he holds in low esteem because he, too, believes this is a step the country has to take.And so do the markets themselves, which is the most important point of all. Psychology always drives market behavior, and right now, the markets are desperately clinging to the idea that the Paulson plan is the only hope of regaining the confidence of borrowers, lenders and investors. Politics is politics, but the markets are not going to wait forever for a deal to be struck. In fact, I don’t think they are going to wait much past the weekend. No deal, no credit markets. It’s as basic as that.And if that happens, the consequences will be far more pressing than the failure of a Morgan Stanley or a Goldman Sachs. You won’t be able to get a mortgage. Credit card rates will skyrocket. Businesses will be unable to expand and grow. Unemployment will rise.Every part of our economy depends on the credit markets. I know you’ve heard it before, but it bears repeating. If we do not claw our way out of this crisis, the country will face a severe recession.On Friday, the German finance minister, Peer Steinbrück, predicted that America would “lose its superpower status in the global financial system.” He may well turn out to be right, but let’s worry about that later, O.K.?Right now, our elected representatives need to get down to business and agree to pass the Paulson plan. If they don’t, they — and we — will live to regret it.1126 2008-09-27 Partners in the law firm Heller Ehrman will vote over the weekend on whether to disband and shut down a Bay Area institution that had expanded rapidly in recent years, sprinkling offices across the country and in big cities worldwide.A plan to dissolve the firm, which has just under 600 lawyers, was recommended to partners at a meeting on Friday by the firm’s policy committee, and partners are expected to support it.“If the plan is adopted, we will begin the orderly wind-down of our business,” said Matthew L. Larrabee, the firm’s chairman. He added that the firm would not shut down overnight but would try to find jobs at other firms for its lawyers and would continue to represent current clients. “Our clients will be protected,” he said.Mr. Larrabee said the firm’s problems started with a slowdown in litigation activity after several of its cases were settled last year.As corporate America reels from recent turmoil in the financial markets, the fortunes of law firms have been mixed. Business is picking up sharply at firms with active bankruptcy practices, and angry investors are hiring litigators to fight over whatever assets the crisis leaves.1127 2008-09-27 But supporters of the project say opponents are misrepresenting it. They point out that the basics of the proposed land swap have not been significantly altered since well before Ms. Palin took office, in December 2006. Furthermore, while the measure before Congress would give the Department of the Interior the authority to approve the project, no money would be set aside under the current bill and several caveats could delay or stop the project outright.“There is no earmark request here,” said Ms. Murkowski, the bill’s sponsor in the Senate (Representative Don Young, a Republican and the state’s lone Congressional representative, sponsored it in the House). “There is none pending. There hasn’t been any that was asked for.”Ms. Murkowski said Democrats had demanded significant changes, including measures to require more environmental study and to give the interior secretary discretion to determine whether the project was in the “public interest.”Opponents, however, say the bill as they interpret it essentially directs the secretary to find that the proposal is in the public interest. If that were to happen, the road could be financed by the state using money from the federal Highway Trust Fund, instead of an earmark, according to state transportation officials and Ms. Murkowski’s office. The road is not currently in the state transportation financing plan.Versions of the bill have cleared key committees in the House and Senate and await floor votes. However, given the economic bailout plans Congress is considering, the prospect of a measure passing this year “looks grim,” said Bill Wicker, a spokesman for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.If the road is not approved this year, it will not be the first time. In 1998, the Clinton administration opposed the road, being pushed by the Alaska delegation, and instead brokered a $37 million deal to provide a hovercraft across Cold Bay to improve transportation for medical evacuations; the plan also upgraded a medical center in King Cove. But the hovercraft just started operating last year, and residents say weather and high costs make its use unpredictable. The local government also says it costs about $100,000 a month to operate. Opponents of the road, however, say it, too, may be unusable in foul weather and they note that the hovercraft has conducted medical evacuations since it came into use. Residents say the road is a matter of public and economic health.“They say those people over there will be killing all the ducks and ruining the environment and decimating the country,” said Mayor Stanley Mack of the Aleutians East Borough, much of whose population is Native Aleut and Yupik. “Where do you get off saying that? We’ve been out here for 4,000 years, protecting the country.”The Izembek National Wildlife Refuge has long been overshadowed by its northern cousin, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and the fight over building the gravel road has lacked the political tension of the fight over drilling for oil. But environmental groups have also long felt that building a road, on an isthmus between two wildlife-rich lagoons in the refuge, would threaten the welfare of a dwindling caribou herd and hundreds of thousands of migratory birds, including Pacific black brant and the threatened Steller’s eider.The 43,000 acres of state land, plus 18,000 more that a local village corporation run by Alaska Natives has offered as part of the swap, cannot compensate, they say. “We’re talking about quality versus quantity,” Ms. Whittington-Evans said of the Wilderness Society.Critics also note that the designated landing area for the hovercraft in King Cove was placed more than 15 miles away from town, and that the road there follows a course that could easily be extended to Cold Bay.One local official confirmed that the hovercraft access road had been intentionally built with the goal of one day extending it through the refuge.“Yes, this community isn’t backing down from building this road,” said the official, Robert S. Juettner, the administrator for the Aleutians East Borough. “And one day it will succeed.”1128 2008-09-27 The professionals are also in on the joke.On Thursday night, as the nation’s financial system teetered, the comic Colin Quinn took the stage at the Comedy Cellar, a comedy club in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village neighborhood, and riffed on Wall Street greed.“These guys make Andrew Carnegie look like Bono,” said Mr. Quinn, whose routine is often tied to news and politics, recounting his jokes in an interview the next morning. “They make Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette look like Brangelina.”While the Wall Street crisis may not have infected the entire economy yet, it has certainly infected many of the nation’s comics.“It’s slowly creeping up as a topic,” said J. R. Ravitz, the booker at Comic Strip Live, a comedy club on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, of the Wall Street crisis. “As this mess unravels, it’s increasingly becoming a part of the jokes.”The crisis has provided adequate fodder for laughs — even if few of the joke tellers actually understand the intricacies of high finance. “Of course I’m doing it,” Mr. Quinn said. “It’s what we do, baby.” But, he added, “it’s hard to understand it. You need a reality show.”Earlier this year, Warren E. Buffett, who controls Berkshire Hathaway and is America’s best-known investor, played a video of the John Bird and John Fortune skit at his annual shareholder gathering. The skit features a fictional investment banker named George Parr explaining the mortgage crisis as bankers packaging “dodgy debts” and then selling them off as “structured investment vehicles.”Some stand-up comedians report that audiences, perhaps because they have not yet personally been affected by the crisis, are not rolling over in laughter at the finance jokes.“Last weekend I was at Gotham Comedy Club and I was joking about it, and what struck me was that no one seemed upset about it,” said Barry Weintraub, a stand-up comedian known for his riffs on news and politics. “It’s an interesting topic because they are telling us the sky is falling. But I don’t know anyone whose head the sky is falling on.”But what about the jokes, Mr. Weintraub?“The downside is that the government is bailing us out. But the upside is you can write one check for your insurance, for your broker and your mortgage, and you can write it out to George Bush.”Even CNBC is in on the act. On Friday morning, Rick Santelli, an on-air editor who reports from the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade, unleashed a zinger. Or not. “The joke today — McDonalds’ default swaps are now cheaper than America’s default swaps. Our drive-up window gives away more than cheeseburgers on the government balance sheet.”Cafepress, an e-commerce firm that allows users to design images and write phrases, then have them stamped on products like T-shirts, coffee mugs, stickers and buttons, has reported a boom in the sale of bailout-related merchandise.Some favorite phrases at Cafepress: “Laymenoff Brothers”; “Lehman stockholder: will work for food”; “venti bailout, no froth”; and “Merrill Lynched me.”“Until recent weeks, most of the activity was political,” said Amy Maniatis, vice president for marketing at Cafepress. “With the bailout talk, within the last week we’ve seen a huge surge in uploads in socialist references, like, ‘People’s Republic of Wall Street,’ with Paulson at the center.”There is one surprising beneficiary of the Wall Street humor: Sarah Palin, who lately seems to be the butt of fewer jokes as comedians turn elsewhere for material.“It’s stole the thunder from her, no question,” said Chris Mazzilli, a co-owner of the Gotham Comedy Club. “You can’t not talk about it, especially in this city.”Mr. Mazzilli’s partner in the comedy club, incidentally, is a banker at Merrill Lynch. He still has his day job.You can’t make this stuff up.1129 2008-09-27 Mr. Yingling was driving to a corporate planning retreat at the Four Seasons in Georgetown when he heard about the plan on the radio. “I knew that the idea was popping up, but I didn’t think it would be done by fiat,” he said.His staff started calling banking regulators, and learned that they had not been consulted on the proposal, which was prompted by shaken investor confidence in the $3.4 trillion money market fund after one such fund announced its investors would get back less than a dollar for each dollar they put in — an extremely rare occurrence.By noon, he and his staff had sent a detailed letter to the Treasury and Federal Reserve outlining eight points of objection. “We told them that they’ve got a real problem,” he said.Mr. Yingling’s constituents feared that consumers would drain bank deposit savings accounts, which are insured only up to $100,000, and put their cash in money market funds that would soon have unlimited protection.“Our bankers were apoplectic,” he said.Mr. Yingling, in his meetings with federal officials, also conjured up images of runs on banks if Treasury did not change course by the time banks opened their doors on Monday morning.He made his case. Treasury did scale back its proposal so that only investors who had already suffered losses in money market mutual funds would be covered, not those who might lose money in the future.Most financial trade groups are banding together to urge passage of the bill this weekend. But, with so much money on the line, there is also intense jockeying on specific provisions.The United States Chamber of Commerce is pressing Congress to oppose limitations on executive pay and some mortgage modification provisions, while the A.F.L.-C.I.O. called on its members to lobby for them. Trade groups for home builders, credit unions, auto dealers and even agricultural equipment all had extensive campaigns.Mr. Yingling directs his campaign with a small army of lobbyists, and also calls on hundreds of community bankers to make the association’s case to their local members of Congress. Lately, he’s been working from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. He confesses that he has been glued to his BlackBerry at his daughter’s swim practice. And at dinner.Mr. Yingling does seem to be born for the job. His father was a bank lobbyist and chief of staff of the Senate Banking Committee in the 1950s. As a child, Mr. Yingling remembers visiting his father in the same banking committee room where he now meets with lawmakers. Today, Mr. Yingling lobbies Senator Christopher J. Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, just as his father once lobbied Senator Thomas Dodd, father of the current senator.While the association had no hard stand on the merits of the bailout, it did join with other financial institutions on Friday urging its passage. But, for the association, the real lobbying was over a series of issues that it wanted to make sure were included in the final package.And as of Friday night, it appears the association got nearly everything it wanted.The association wanted to make sure that banks were able to participate in the bailout (they are). It wanted packages of whole mortgage loans included in the program, not just securitized pools of mortgages (they are).The group opposed a provision that would have allowed bankruptcy judges to rewrite mortgages, and it appears it will prevail on that front. The association got more favorable tax treatment for banks holding preferred shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks. And it derailed efforts to finance the bailout with a tax on financial institutions.Mr. Yingling is also using the current crisis as a “catalyst,” he said, to urge federal regulators to ease rules over the valuation of bank assets, the so-called mark-to-market provisions. This is not part of the bailout bill, but the crisis has given Mr. Yingling traction on the issue.“We are not doing this with any joy,” said Mr. Yingling. “We are saddened and angry that the country has to be in this position.”Mr. Yingling is not a back-slapper who spends hours socializing with members of Congress. He speaks softly, and makes his case with a battering ram of statistics and facts.“Ed has decades of knowledge of his subject matter,” said John Taylor, chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a Washington group that has often butted up against the bankers association. “He uses quiet influence and he always pulls out a plethora of facts to make his case. But he never oversells.”So far this year, the association has spent $4.5 million on lobbying, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, after having spent $6.2 million the year before.That is in addition to the roughly $2 million it has spent in political contributions in this election cycle. The association also hosts many fund-raising events, like a $1,000-a-ticket fund-raising luncheon last March at Johnny’s Half Shell Blue Room on behalf of Representative Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and a key player in the bailout package.The association, with 400 employees, is known for its “fly-ins,” with bankers from around the country coming to Washington to meet with Mr. Yingling and his staff and then visit with their Congressional delegations. In the past week, delegations from Michigan, South Carolina, Alabama, Virginia and Indiana trooped to the Hill to help make the association’s case. And, also every morning, over 30,000 bankers across the country are blasted with e-mail messages from the association providing them with ammunition to use for op-ed pieces in their local newspapers and as talking points when writing or calling members of Congress.For instance, an e-mail message sent to bankers on the bankruptcy modification proposal said, “Members of Congress need to hear from you. Please take ACTION NOW to express your opposition to bankruptcy cram-down provisions and to implore them to consider the impact of this legislation on community banks.” It concluded: “With your help we can limit the potential for collateral damage.”Mr. Yingling said his main concern now was that a bailout agreement be reached this weekend. “We are getting reports of people coming into our banks, nervous,” he said. “There’s been a shift in the last 24 hours.”There are some things that Mr. Yingling cannot change, of course, no matter how much he would like. One thing that “drives me nuts,” he said, is that the crisis is referred to as a “banking crisis,” even though he argues the problems were caused by Wall Street firms, and not banks.“This is a Wall Street disaster,” said Mr. Yingling. “But everything you pick up, you see the word ‘bank.’ Wall Street caused this problem, not your neighborhood bank.”1130 2008-09-27 The lead Congressional negotiators said they would meet again on Saturday, but staff members, including officials from the Treasury Department, were working into the night, combing through the 102-page draft legislation that had some lawmakers predict at just before 1 p.m. on Thursday that a deal was close at hand.The renewed talks came even as lawmakers were still reeling from Thursday’s high drama at the White House where a meeting between Mr. Bush, Congressional leaders and the two presidential candidates — Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama — broke down in acrimony.Democrats sought to seize advantage after the failed meeting, which Mr. Bush convened after Mr. McCain suspended his campaign and suggested delaying the first presidential debate in Mississippi.“Now that Senator McCain is safely in Mississippi, we can get back to serious work,” said Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee and the lead negotiator for House Democrats in the bailout talks. Mr. Frank predicted a deal by Sunday.House Republicans said that Mr. McCain had saved their caucus from being stampeded in negotiations by Democrats and by the White House. “I believe and my colleagues believe that America is on the edge of an economic crisis,” said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader. “We believe that Congress needs to act and we need to act quickly.”For much of Friday, Wall Street seemed almost numb to the latest developments in Washington, but Mr. Bush’s assurances that a deal was within reach and progress on Capitol Hill helped the Dow Jones industrial average rise 121.07 points, to 11,143.13, while the Nasdaq fell 3.23 points to 2,183.34.On both sides, lawmakers are feeling tremendous pressure. Public opinion polls show the bailout to be deeply unpopular, and even lawmakers who say Congress must act to protect the economy see little political benefit in voting for it.The political climate, combined with the combustible nature of presidential politics, contributed to the remarkable uprising by House Republicans who said on Thursday that they could not support the administration’s plan.They have challenged Democrats, who hold a majority in both chambers of Congress, to approve the rescue package on their own. Democrats said they could not muster enough votes to pass a bill requested by the White House unless Mr. Bush persuades his fellow Republicans to go along.Republicans on Friday sought to contain the disarray that led House members and Mr. McCain to balk at the administration’s plan on Thursday, just hours after some Republican senators said they were very close to a deal on the rescue plan.The purchase by the government of up to $700 billion in troubled assets is the centerpiece of the rescue plan, which seeks to restore liquidity to the markets and keep credit flowing to businesses and consumers.The administration’s original proposal asked for virtually unfettered authority for the Treasury secretary, but Congressional leaders and Mr. Paulson had already agreed to a number of changes, including an independent oversight board; limits on pay for executives of firms that seek government assistance; and a mechanism that would allow taxpayers to profit should the rescue plan help companies prosper in the future.The insurance program promoted by the House Republicans as an alternative to the government buy-up of troubled assets would require financial firms to pay premiums, and House Republicans appeared reluctant to explain on Friday exactly how it would work. A major problem on Wall Street is that many of the firms are short on cash. Even Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, and a main proponent of the insurance idea, conceded that it could only work in conjunction with a direct purchase of troubled debt by the Treasury.In addition to pressing for the insurance package, Republicans also demanded that any profits from the rescue plan be returned to the Treasury, while Democrats want 20 percent of profits used to create affordable housing.House Republicans on Friday installed Roy Blunt of Missouri, the House whip, to replace Spencer Bachus of Alabama as their lead negotiator.The office of Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader from Kentucky, said Senate Republicans would be represented by Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the senior member of the budget committee.As Mr. Paulson and other administration officials sought to get the talks back on track, the administration also stepped up lobbying efforts on and off of Capitol Hill. The Treasury Department encouraged business executives to call lawmakers and urge swift passage of a deal, while the White House said that Vice President Dick Cheney had canceled a campaign trip to New Mexico and Wyoming in order to help negotiate a package.The administration has enlisted chief executives from dozens of the nation’s largest companies to call members of Congress, urging them to settle their differences and pass the bailout plan.Among those who have made calls, according to people involved in the campaign, were Rick Wagoner of General Motors and Harold McGraw III of McGraw-Hill. The chief executives of General Electric, Caterpillar, Dow Chemical and DuPont are also taking part, they said.“Our concern is what’s happening in the credit market,” said John J. Castellani, the president of the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives from about 160 companies.1131 2008-09-27 WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Federal health officials said Friday that they were reviewing a higher rate of deaths among patients treated with a Johnson & Johnson anemia drug in a German study of stroke patients.Sixteen percent of patients who were treated with the drug, Eprex, had died three months after the study began, compared with 9 percent who were given a placebo, the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement.The study was testing whether Eprex could improve brain function in stroke patients, an unapproved use of the drug.The 522 patients were given relatively high doses of Eprex for three days or a placebo. Most were not anemic, the drug agency said.Eprex is known generically as epoetin alfa. Johnson & Johnson also sells epoetin alfa under the name Procrit. Amgen sells a version under the name Epogen.1132 2008-09-27 Start, just for a minute, by giving yourself over to the worse case. The visceral fear here is of dying in the poorhouse, as Richard Schroeder, a certified financial planner with Schroeder, Braxton & Vogt in , N.Y., put it. And his answer to clients who articulate that nightmare is this: the markets will eventually recover.So let’s reel ourselves back from the edge of oblivion. Most of us can take some comfort in the fact that we have time on our sides. Managing our money is a process that unfolds over decades, not days. It’s easy to forget that, when one company after another is falling victim, week after week, and we can track their disintegration on an hourly basis.“The individual needs to go back to that personal road map,” said Sharon Rich, a financial planner with a doctorate from Harvard who studied women, and education. “Where are you right now, where do you want to be and how do you get from here to there?”And then apply that to an investment portfolio. “I think reminding people in this environment of why we’ve chosen the investment strategy that we have is a good thing for those who are a little bit antsy,” said Constance Barber, a certified financial planner with Barber Financial in Natick, Mass., who got her start as a school psychologist. “We’ve usually not set this up because it’s money that you’ll need tomorrow.”Even if we don’t need the money right now, it doesn’t feel good to look at a retirement portfolio and find that it’s down 15 percent from its peak a year ago.“People rely on selective when they’re only looking at losses from the high point that the portfolio reached,” said Victoria Collins, who has a Ph.D. in social psychology from the University of California, Berkeley and has worked as a certified financial planner for more than two decades.This was a point echoed by many people I spoke with this week. On one hand, it’s certainly depressing to be down to $340,000 from $400,000, for instance. The basic math doesn’t help the mood either, given that after a decline of 15 percent, a portfolio needs to gain 17.6 percent just to get back to $400,000 again. “This is real money in people’s lives,” said Ms. Rich, who runs Womoney, a financial planning firm in Belmont, Mass. She noted that some people added up how many years it took them to save the money that just disappeared.We can mimic that mindset if we choose, or we can consider what our balance was, say, a decade ago. Chances are we’ve made a lot of progress since then, if we’ve been saving all along. “There are clients who will say, ‘Yes, it’s down, but look where I started,’ ” said Ms. Barber, the former school psychologist. “ ‘I’m hanging in there, and we’ve come a long way, baby, and it’s O.K. for now.’ ”Next, put down the retirement account statement and consider the credit and debit card bills and the checkbook. Ms. Rich put some clients with job security anxieties through this exercise this week. It isn’t a budgeting drill exactly. “The question is how the way I’m spending reflects my values and what I think is important in the world,” she said.For those of us who pay someone to clean our house, she said, perhaps having a clean house isn’t really that important when we reconsider. Or if we think it’s crucial for our children to experience nature, perhaps a series of day trips can have the same effect as going to the .School costs are an issue here too, Ms. Rich said, and she noted that such reconsideration may mean spending more, not less, on certain items.One tricky part about the last several weeks is confronting all the headlines declaring this the worst since the 1930s. “Most of the individuals that I find who need more handholding are the ones who’ve had some connection with ,” says Ms. Collins, the Ph.D., who is now an executive vice president and principal with Keller Group Investment Management in Irvine, Calif.These people tend to be retirees, who may have had parents who told them stories about living through the 1930s or are old enough to remember it themselves. If they have little or no earning capacity now, they feel especially helpless when they see parts of their portfolios disappearing.“I try to remind them that even they don’t need all of that portfolio today,” she said. “You’re only withdrawing a certain amount.”Ms. Rich suggested that people reach out to someone else to discuss their situation if they don’t have a hybrid financial adviser-shrink to counsel them through the crisis. It could be a peer, a family member, a member of the clergy or staff at a senior center.Even that support network may not be enough to bring the most anxiety-prone among us back from the edge. “For those who cling to doomsday scenarios we can also say, ‘So what?’ ” Mr. Schroeder, the financial planner in Amherst, N.Y., said in an e-mail message. “If the markets go to zero, if the whole system crashes, there is no safe haven, so it doesn’t matter whether you buy Treasuries. The currency will be worthless and there will be chaos in the streets. Your only alternative is to stock up on guns, ammunition and goods that are easily tradable and will become valuable, such as sewing needles, good Scotch, etc.”Now, forget about hoarding sewing supplies and remember that things are much more likely to get better than they are to get that bad.1133 2008-09-27 The hopeful report from the Democrats came after President Bush appealed for urgent action, and lawmakers in both parties said they would continue to press for a swift deal. But all were wrestling with realities imposed by presidential politics and the Congressional elections, which have led some legislators to see little political benefit in voting for the bailout.Both parties were still trying to digest the ramifications of a remarkable uprising led by House Republicans, who said on Thursday that they could not support the administration’s plan. The Republicans have challenged the Democrats, who hold a majority in Congress, to approve the package on their own. But Democrats say they need the White House to persuade reluctant Republicans in Mr. Bush’s party to go along.After Thursday’s high political drama at the White House, Republicans sought to contain the disarray that led House members and Senator , the party’s presidential nominee, to essentially scuttle the administration’s $700 billion bailout plan. While some Republican senators said they were close to a deal, others insisted it was not so.Before flying to for the first , Mr. McCain met on Friday morning at the Capitol with the minority leader, Senator , and with House Republican leaders, who then installed Mr. Blunt of Missouri to replace Spencer Bachus of as their lead negotiator.Mr. McConnell’s office said Senator of , the senior member of the Budget Committee, would represent Senate Republicans, a role that he undertook on Thursday night when Mr. Paulson struggled to keep the plan alive after the contentious meeting at the White House. With Mr. Blunt and Mr. Gregg, the Republicans were relying on senior figures to present a consistent message to Democrats.Democrats sought to seize political advantage, and slammed Mr. McCain for suspending his campaign, and trying to postpone the debate, to return to Washington and help broker a deal, saying he had done more harm than good.“We need the president to respectfully tell Senator McCain to get out of town,” said Senator , Democrat of New York.As Mr. Paulson sought to get the talks back on track, the administration also stepped up lobbying efforts on and off of Capitol Hill. The Treasury Department encouraged business executives to call lawmakers and urge swift passage of a deal, while the White House said that Vice President had canceled a campaign trip to and in order to help negotiate a package.Speaking from the White House, President Bush noted the disagreements among lawmakers about how the rescue should be shaped. “But there is no disagreement,” he said, “that something substantial must be done.”Discussions on a draft bill were continuing, and Senator of , the majority leader, said he was hopeful that with cooperation between Republicans and Democrats, a bill could be done by midnight Friday, and could be voted on Sunday or Monday.Mr. Reid, standing next to Senator , Democrat of and the chairman of the Senate banking committee, said that negotiations had been headed toward a successful conclusion Thursday evening, but that the arrival of the presidential candidates, Mr. McCain and Senator , as well as the failure of House Republican leaders to participate in some discussions, helped to derail them.“The insertion of presidential politics into the process has not been helpful,” Mr. Reid said. “It’s been harmful.” (The McCain committee rejected that interpretation of events, asserting that Mr. McCain’s decision to momentarily suspend his campaign “was made in the hopes that politics could be set aside to address our economic crisis,” and that too many in Washington were playing the “blame game.”)House Republicans leaders said they were only trying to protect taxpayers. “We will not agree to a bill that sell taxpayers’ out to bail out Wall Street,” the House Republican leader, of , said. Fielding questions in a Capitol corridor, the Congressman told the reporters he would not negotiate in front of them because “last time I checked, you didn’t have a vote.”Mr. Boehner, who said Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri would lead House negotiators for his side, disputed the notion that he had sprung a surprise on Thursday by offering alternate bailout ideas.On the contrary, he said, he had been talking with administration officials and Ms. Pelosi about different ways to approach the crisis.Earlier Friday morning, lawmakers staked out their positions on a round of morning television talk shows. Mr. Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said that an agreement depended on House Republicans’ ending their opposition and “dropping this revolt” against the plan proposed by the administration, The Associated Press reported. He described the rival plan as “an ambush.”Senator of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee and a critic of the plan, said the proposal had to change before it would win support of Republicans.1134 2008-09-28 Amid extensive negotiations to pass the record $700 billion financial rescue package, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. spoke with ""60 Minutes"" about the importance of providing federal aid to the nation's troubled banks....1135 2008-09-28 It is Sunday afternoon, and the financial world is on tenterhooks as it awaits signs on whether Congress appears likely to pass a $700 billion rescue package for troubled banks.

Sarah Palin wasn't the onl...1140 2008-09-28 He also said his knowledge of chess had helped him in his career. “I was the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund from 2001 to 2003, and you are involved in a lot of high-stakes negotiations,” he said, “and chess teaches you to think about what the other person is thinking.”He stopped playing competitively in 1980 because he found it too demanding to balance his chess schedule and his studies, and he had to make a choice. “First, I wanted to do something more important with my life,” said Rogoff, who is now 55. “Second, I thought I was traveling too much playing chess. Third, I wanted to have a better social life.”Yet, he said, he is traveling more than ever, and his social life is no better than when he was playing. “I eventually realized it was me,” Rogoff said. “I could have had a perfectly reasonable life in chess.”Rogoff was at one time one of the country’s most promising players. He helped lead the United States to the World Student Team Championship and placed second in the national championship. That finish earned him a spot in the Interzonal Tournament in Biel, Switzerland, in 1976, an important qualifier on the road to the world championship.Although he failed to get past the Interzonal, he said the game he played there against the Czech grandmaster Jan Smejkal was one of his favorites.He said that Smejkal outplayed him in the opening. After 14 ... ed, he could not take the pawn with 15 Qd4 because 15 ... Ng4 wins his queen. White’s pieces soon found themselves on awkward squares, but then Black became overly ambitious, recklessly pushing his kingside pawns forward .Smejkal must have missed the point of 24 c5, freeing up the c4 square for White’s knight. After 26 Nc4, 26 ... Bc1 27 Nd6 Qg6 28 Nc8 Rc8 29 Qc1 would have yielded White a nice advantage.White was better anyway after 30 Qd2, but then Black made a mistake with 30 ... Kh7, putting his king on the wrong diagonal, and Rogoff took advantage of Black’s overloaded queen with 31 d7.Smejkal resigned because he could not stop mate (36 ... Rd7 37 Qh8).Although he said he would consider taking a job in the administration if McCain is elected, Rogoff said: “I really am very happy with what I am doing. For the foreseeable future, I think I want to stay in academics.”Then, echoing Senator McCain’s catchphrase, he added that he was not sure he would fit in at the White House. “I am way too much of a maverick.”1141 2008-09-28 With an opportunity to move into first place, the Chicago White Sox flopped again.Zach Jackson pitched seven strong innings, Asdrúbal Cabrera hit a three-run double against the struggling Javier Vázquez in a six-run fifth and the Cleveland Indians won, 12-6, on Saturday night, keeping host Chicago a half-game behind Minnesota in the American League Central. It was the White Sox’ fifth consecutive loss.“I think the best thing is just to say after 160 games, we still control our own destiny if we win — as hard as that is to say because we don’t look like a winning team right now,” said first baseman Paul Konerko, who homered twice.“We got to try block that out and start as fresh as we can tomorrow.”The Twins can win the division title Sunday with a victory over Kansas City and another White Sox loss to Cleveland.Pitching on three days’ rest, Vázquez (12-16) did not make it out of the fifth.He gave up five hits and seven runs in four and a third innings.Jackson (2-3), acquired from Milwaukee in the C. C. Sabathia trade, allowed three hits, including solo home runs by Jermaine Dye and Konerko.1142 2008-09-28 Florida lost four games last season with Tebow as the starter, mostly because of a poor defense. This one was much different.Tebow was sacked three times, all the result of him holding the ball too long in the pocket. He also overthrew four receivers deep, including two on consecutive plays on the final drive.Maybe even more glaring was his final run.Trailing by 31-30 with about 40 seconds to play and facing fourth down and about 2 feet at the Mississippi 32, the Gators called on Tebow to pick up the first down. Just about everyone at the Swamp — all 90,106 in attendance — had to know Tebow was getting the ball. It was exactly what he wanted, too.But he was hit in the backfield and never made it back to the line of scrimmage.“I thought we’d get it,” Tebow said. “I thought I’d will myself to the first down. We just didn’t do it.”Instead, Snead took a knee a couple of times, running out the clock and setting off a raucous celebration.The Gators could have attempted a 49-yard field goal, which would have won the game. But Mississippi had blocked the potential tying extra point, and Meyer opted to keep the ball in the hands of Tebow, his most trusted player.Tebow’s eyes were red, his voice crackling at times.“I want it to stay in our hearts and keep hurting,” he said. “This will motivate me personally and I believe everybody else, the coaches and the rest of the players, to never let something like this happen again, especially when we feel we’re better than a team and don’t play up to our ability.”Tebow was 24 of 38 passing for 319 yards. He ran 15 times for 7 yards and two scores, a far cry from the 166 yards he had on the ground in Oxford, Miss., last season.The Rebels (3-2, 1-1) were not going to let Tebow beat them. They blitzed on nearly every down and played zone coverage, not allowing anything deep.Snead was 9 of 20 passing for 185 yards, and he made plays when the Rebels needed them. His biggest was an 86-yard touchdown pass to Shay Hodge that put the Rebels ahead, 31-24, with 5 minutes 26 seconds to play.“This will be a turning point of our season,” Snead said.1143 2008-09-28 Perhaps the most surprising aspect of Boise State’s upset at Oregon last Saturday was that the Broncos did it with minimal contributions from tailback Ian Johnson. Part of that was because of how Oregon played: the Ducks boast a stout defensive front and dared Boise to pass. Johnson finished with 40 yards on 19 carries.Two years ago, Johnson led the country with 25 touchdowns and finished second with 142.8 yards a game. But after averaging 6.2 yards a carry in 2006, he had 5.0 yards a carry last season and is averaging 4.9 so far this year. There is a reason for the dip in performance, according to the Boise offensive coordinator, Bryan Harsin.In 2006, Johnson had the luxury of running behind tight end Derek Schouman and left tackle Ryan Clady. The two are now mainstays of N.F.L. teams, Schouman with the Bills and Clady a first-round pick who is starting for Denver. “He’s the same player,” Harsin said of Johnson. “It’s just different up front.”1144 2008-09-28 Most of the passengers who first boarded the bus headed straight for the upper level, lowering their heads as they walked up the narrow stairs. While the height clearance on the first level is 5 feet 11 inches, the upper level’s clearance is only 5 feet 7 inches.Yara Lantigua, a planner for a New York media company, had no trouble making her way to the front seat on the upper level.Ms. Lantigua, who is 5-foot-1, said she got up a little earlier to make sure she caught the bus, which started its run from Huguenot Avenue and Woodrow Road at 7:16 a.m.A wide smile revealed her excitement as the bus rolled along the Staten Island Expressway.“I like sitting in front,” Ms. Lantigua said, putting on her sunglasses. “It makes me feel in control. I like to see the traffic so I don’t get anxious. I like to know what is happening.”The authority has high hopes for the double-decker as a way to save on fuel while moving more people.Such buses, currently the domain of sightseeing tours, were common before the 1950s. The buses came back for a brief period during the 1970s.The new double-decker coach, built and loaned to the transportation authority by the ABC Bus Company of Belgium, is sleek, quiet and powerful. Equipped with a 450-horsepower diesel engine, the $650,000 giant moves effortlessly through New Jersey’s and New York’s highway infrastructure.A typical city bus has about 40 seats. The double-deckers seat 59 on the upper level and 22 on the lower level, where a portion of the rear is taken up by electrical boxes, a storage area, its fuel tank and a bathroom, which is locked during the trial run, and would be removed if the authority decides to buy the buses.Andy Mieles, a 6-foot-tall accountant, tried to open the bathroom door after he carefully made his way down the rear stairs of the bus.He did not need it, he said, but was “just curious.”Most riders gave the bus positive reviews on one trip last week, though a few complained about the low ceilings. Transit advocates also welcomed the trial.“Given the huge increase in ridership, it makes sense to try vehicles that can move more people,” said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group for transit riders.The transportation agency had planned to test the double-decker on two other lines, the M5 and the BxM3, an express route from Yonkers to Manhattan. But the bus would have run into branches on Riverside Drive, which is used by the M5, and on a stretch in Harlem along Fifth Avenue, which is used by the BxM3.Charles Seaton, a spokesman for New York City Transit, said it was unclear whether the bus would be tried on another route during the one-month trial. “I would love to be able to put that bus on Fifth Avenue,” he said.As the bus approached the Lincoln Tunnel last week from Weehawken, N.J., a G.P.S. signal triggered a valve in the coach’s air-suspension system, which lowered the bus by about two inches. That created a slightly more generous four inches of clearance between the roof of the bus and the ceiling of the tunnel.By then, the novelty of the ride had mostly worn off. As is typical on the X17J route, many passengers had nodded off.They began to come to around 9 a.m., rubbing their eyes and stretching their arms as Midtown traffic greeted the double-decker, its height proving no advantage in navigating through blocked intersections and honking taxis.1145 2008-09-28 As factions of the ferociously competitive gambling industry have vied for an edge, they have found it advantageous to cultivate a relationship with Mr. McCain or hire someone who has one, according to an examination based on more than 70 interviews and thousands of pages of documents.Mr. McCain portrays himself as a Washington maverick unswayed by special interests, referring recently to lobbyists as “birds of prey.” Yet in his current campaign, more than 40 fund-raisers and top advisers have lobbied or worked for an array of gambling interests — including tribal and Las Vegas casinos, lottery companies and online poker purveyors.When rules being considered by Congress threatened a California tribe’s planned casino in 2005, Mr. McCain helped spare the tribe. Its lobbyist, who had no prior experience in the gambling industry, had a nearly 20-year friendship with Mr. McCain.In Connecticut that year, when a tribe was looking to open the state’s third casino, staff members on the Indian Affairs Committee provided guidance to lobbyists representing those fighting the casino, e-mail messages and interviews show. The proposed casino, which would have cut into the Pequots’ market share, was opposed by Mr. McCain’s colleagues in Connecticut.Mr. McCain declined to be interviewed. In written answers to questions, his campaign staff said he was “justifiably proud” of his record on regulating Indian gambling. “Senator McCain has taken positions on policy issues because he believed they are in the public interest,” the campaign said.Mr. McCain’s spokesman, Tucker Bounds, would not discuss the senator’s night of gambling at Foxwoods, saying: “Your paper has repeatedly attempted to insinuate impropriety on the part of Senator McCain where none exists — and it reveals that your publication is desperately willing to gamble away what little credibility it still has.”Over his career, Mr. McCain has taken on special interests, like big tobacco, and angered the capital’s powerbrokers by promoting campaign finance reform and pushing to limit gifts that lobbyists can shower on lawmakers. On occasion, he has crossed the gambling industry on issues like regulating slot machines.Perhaps no episode burnished Mr. McCain’s image as a reformer more than his stewardship three years ago of the Congressional investigation into Jack Abramoff, the disgraced Republican Indian gambling lobbyist who became a national symbol of the pay-to-play culture in Washington. The senator’s leadership during the scandal set the stage for the most sweeping overhaul of lobbying laws since Watergate.“I’ve fought lobbyists who stole from Indian tribes,” the senator said in his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination this month.But interviews and records show that lobbyists and political operatives in Mr. McCain’s inner circle played a behind-the-scenes role in bringing Mr. Abramoff’s misdeeds to Mr. McCain’s attention — and then cashed in on the resulting investigation. The senator’s longtime chief political strategist, for example, was paid $100,000 over four months as a consultant to one tribe caught up in the inquiry, records show.Mr. McCain’s campaign said the senator acted solely to protect American Indians, even though the inquiry posed “grave risk to his political interests.”As public opposition to tribal casinos has grown in recent years, Mr. McCain has distanced himself from Indian gambling, Congressional and American Indian officials said.But he has rarely wavered in his loyalty to Las Vegas, where he counts casino executives among his close friends and most prolific fund-raisers. “Beyond just his support for gaming, Nevada supports John McCain because he’s one of us, a Westerner at heart,” said Sig Rogich, a Nevada Republican kingmaker who raised nearly $2 million for Mr. McCain at an event at his home in June.Only six members of Congress have received more money from the gambling industry than Mr. McCain, and five hail from the casino hubs of Nevada and New Jersey, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics dating back to 1989. In the presidential race, Senator Barack Obama has also received money from the industry; Mr. McCain has raised almost twice as much.In May 2007, as Mr. McCain’s presidential bid was floundering, he spent a weekend at the MGM Grand on the Las Vegas strip. A fund-raiser hosted by J. Terrence Lanni, the casino’s top executive and a longtime friend of the senator, raised $400,000 for his campaign. Afterward, Mr. McCain attended a boxing match and hit the craps tables.For much of his adult life, Mr. McCain has gambled as often as once a month, friends and associates said, traveling to Las Vegas for weekend betting marathons. Former senior campaign officials said they worried about Mr. McCain’s patronage of casinos, given the power he wields over the industry. The officials, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity.“We were always concerned about appearances,” one former official said. “If you go around saying that appearances matter, then they matter.”The former official said he would tell Mr. McCain: “Do we really have to go to a casino? I don’t think it’s a good idea. The base doesn’t like it. It doesn’t look good. And good things don’t happen in casinos at midnight.”“You worry too much,” Mr. McCain would respond, the official said.In one of their last conversations, Representative Morris K. Udall, Arizona’s powerful Democrat, whose devotion to American Indian causes was legendary, implored his friend Mr. McCain to carry on his legacy.“Don’t forget the Indians,” Mr. Udall, who died in 1998, told Mr. McCain in a directive that the senator has recounted to others.More than a decade earlier, Mr. Udall had persuaded Mr. McCain to join the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. Mr. McCain, whose home state has the third-highest Indian population, eloquently decried the “grinding poverty” that gripped many reservations.The two men helped write the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 after the Supreme Court found that states had virtually no right to control wagering on reservations. The legislation provided a framework for the oversight and growth of Indian casinos: In 1988, Indian gambling represented less than 1 percent of the nation’s gambling revenues; today it captures more than one third.On the Senate floor after the bill’s passage, Mr. McCain said he personally opposed Indian gambling, but when impoverished communities “are faced with only one option for economic development, and that is to set up gambling on their reservations, then I cannot disapprove.”In 1994, Mr. McCain pushed an amendment that enabled dozens of additional tribes to win federal recognition and open casinos. And in 1998, Mr. McCain fought a Senate effort to rein in the boom.He also voted twice in the last decade to give casinos tax breaks estimated to cost the government more than $326 million over a dozen years.The first tax break benefited the industry in Las Vegas, one of a number of ways Mr. McCain has helped nontribal casinos. Mr. Lanni, the MGM Mirage chief executive, said that an unsuccessful bid by the senator to ban wagering on college sports in Nevada was the only time he could recall Mr. McCain opposing Las Vegas. “I can’t think of any other issue,” Mr. Lanni said.The second tax break helped tribal casinos like Foxwoods and was pushed by Scott Reed, the Pequots’ lobbyist.Mr. McCain had gotten to know Mr. Reed during Senator Bob Dole’s 1996 presidential campaign, which Mr. Reed managed. Four years later, when Mr. McCain ran for president, Mr. Reed recommended he hire his close friend and protégé, Rick Davis, to manage that campaign.During his 2000 primary race against George W. Bush, Mr. McCain promoted his record of helping Indian Country, telling reporters on a campaign swing that he had provided critical support to “the Pequot, now the proud owners of the largest casino in the world.”But Mr. McCain’s record on Indian gambling was fast becoming a difficult issue for him in the primary. Bush supporters like Gov. John Engler of Michigan lambasted Mr. McCain for his “close ties to Indian gambling.”A decade after Mr. McCain co-authored the Indian gambling act, the political tides had turned. Tribal casinos, which were growing at a blazing pace, had become increasingly unpopular around the country for reasons as varied as morality and traffic.Then came the biggest lobbying scandal to shake Washington.At a September 2004 hearing of the Indian Affairs Committee, Mr. McCain described Jack Abramoff as one of the most brazen in a long line of crooks to cheat American Indians. “It began with the sale of Manhattan, and has continued ever since,” he said. “What sets this tale apart, what makes it truly extraordinary, is the extent and degree of the apparent exploitation and deceit.”Over the next two years, Mr. McCain helped uncover a breathtaking lobbying scandal — Mr. Abramoff and a partner bilked six tribes of $66 million — that showcased the senator’s willingness to risk the wrath of his own party to expose wrongdoing. But interviews and documents show that Mr. McCain and a circle of allies — lobbyists, lawyers and senior strategists — also seized on the case for its opportunities.For McCain-connected lobbyists who were rivals of Mr. Abramoff, the scandal presented a chance to crush a competitor. For senior McCain advisers, the inquiry allowed them to collect fees from the very Indians that Mr. Abramoff had ripped off. And the investigation enabled Mr. McCain to confront political enemies who helped defeat him in his 2000 presidential run while polishing his maverick image.The Abramoff saga started in early 2003 when members of two tribes began questioning Mr. Abramoff’s astronomical fees. Over the next year, they leaked information to local newspapers, but it took the hiring of lobbyists who were competitors of Mr. Abramoff to get the attention of Mr. McCain’s committee.Bernie Sprague, who led the effort by one of the tribes, the Saginaw Chippewas in Michigan, hired a Democratic lobbyist who recommended that the tribe retain Scott Reed, the Republican lobbyist, to push for an investigation.Mr. Reed had boasted to other lobbyists of his access to Mr. McCain, three close associates said. Mr. Reed “pretty much had open access to John from 2000 to at least the end of 2006,” one aide said.Lobbyist disclosure forms show that Mr. Reed went to work for the Saginaw Chippewa on Feb. 15, 2004, charging the tribe $56,000 over a year. Mr. Abramoff had tried to steal the Pequots and another tribal client from Mr. Reed, and taking down Mr. Abramoff would eliminate a competitor.Mr. Reed became the chief conduit to Mr. McCain’s committee for billing documents and other information Mr. Sprague was digging up on Mr. Abramoff, Mr. Sprague said, who said Mr. Reed “did a great to service to me.”“He had contacts I did not,” Mr. Sprague said. “Initially, I think that the senator’s office was doing Reed a favor by listening to me.”A few weeks after hiring Mr. Reed, Mr. Sprague received a letter from the senator. “We have met with Scott Reed, who was very helpful on the issue,” Mr. McCain wrote.Information about Mr. Abramoff was also flowing to Mr. McCain’s committee from another tribe, the Coushatta of Louisiana. The source was a consultant named Roy Fletcher, who had been Mr. McCain’s deputy campaign manager in 2000, running his war room in South Carolina.It was in that primary race that two of Mr. Abramoff’s closest associates, Grover Norquist, who runs the nonprofit Americans for Tax Reform, and Ralph Reed, the former director of the Christian Coalition, ran a blistering campaign questioning Mr. McCain’s conservative credentials. The senator and his advisers blamed that attack for Mr. McCain’s loss to Mr. Bush in South Carolina, creating tensions that would resurface in the Abramoff matter.“I was interested in busting” Mr. Abramoff, said Mr. Fletcher, who was eventually hired to represent the tribe. “That was my job. But I was also filled with righteous indignation, I got to tell you.”Mr. Fletcher said he began passing information to John Weaver, Mr. McCain’s chief political strategist, and other staff members in late 2003 or January 2004. Mr. Weaver confirmed the timing.Mr. McCain announced his investigation on Feb. 26, 2004, citing an article on Mr. Abramoff in The Washington Post. He did not mention the action by lobbyists and tribes in the preceding weeks. His campaign said no one in his “innermost circle” brought information to Mr. McCain that prompted the investigation.The senator declared he would not investigate members of Congress, whom Mr. Abramoff had lavished with tribal donations and golf outings to Scotland. But in the course of the investigation, the committee exposed Mr. Abramoff’s dealings with the two men who had helped defeat Mr. McCain in the 2000 primary.The investigation showed that Mr. Norquist’s foundation was used by Mr. Abramoff to launder lobbying fees from tribes. Ralph Reed was found to have accepted $4 million to run bogus antigambling campaigns. And the investigation also highlighted Mr. Abramoff’s efforts to curry favor with the House majority leader at the time, Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, a longtime political foe who had opposed many of Mr. McCain’s legislative priorities.Mr. McCain’s campaign said the senator did not “single out” Ralph Reed or Mr. Norquist, neither of whom were ever charged, and that both men fell within the “scope of the investigation.” The inquiry, which led to guilty pleas by over a dozen individuals, was motivated by a desire to help aggrieved tribes, the campaign said.Inside the investigation, the sense of schadenfreude was palpable, according to several people close to the senator. “It was like hitting pay dirt,” said one associate of Mr. McCain’s who had consulted with the senator’s office on the investigation. “And face it — McCain and Weaver were maniacal about Ralph Reed and Norquist. They were sticking little pins in dolls because those guys had cost him South Carolina.”Down on the Coushattas reservation, bills related to the investigation kept coming. After firing Mr. Abramoff, the tribe hired Kent Hance, a lawyer and former Texas congressman who said he had been friends with Mr. McCain since the 1980s.David Sickey, the tribe’s vice chairman, said he was “dumbfounded” over the bills submitted by Mr. Hance’s firm, Hance Scarborough, which had been hired by Mr. Sickey’s predecessors.“The very thing we were fighting seemed to be happening all over again — these absurd amounts of money being paid,” Mr. Sickey said.Mr. Hance’s firm billed the tribe nearly $1.3 million over 11 months in legal and political consulting fees, records show. But Mr. Sickey said that the billing statements offered only vague explanations for services and that he could not point to any tangible results. Two consultants, for instance, were paid to fight the expansion of gambling in Texas — even though it was unlikely given that the governor there opposed any such prospect, Mr. Sickey said.Mr. Hance and Jay B. Stewart, the firm’s managing partner, defended their team’s work, saying they successfully steered the tribe through a difficult period. “We did an outstanding job for them,” Mr. Hance said. “When we told them our bill was going to be $100,000 a month, they thought we were cheap. Mr. Abramoff had charged them $1 million a month.”The firm’s fees covered the services of Mr. Fletcher, who served as the tribe’s spokesman. Records also show that Mr. Hance had Mr. Weaver — who was serving as Mr. McCain’s chief strategist — put on the tribe’s payroll from February to May 2005.It is not precisely clear what role Mr. Weaver played for his $100,000 fee.Mr. Stewart said Mr. Weaver was hired because “he had a lot of experience with the Senate, especially the new chairman, John McCain.” The Hance firm told the tribe in a letter that Mr. Weaver was hired to provide “representation for the tribe before the U.S. Senate.”But Mr. Weaver never registered to lobby on the issue, and he has another explanation for his work.“The Hance law firm retained me to assist them and their client in developing an aggressive crisis management and communications strategy,” Mr. Weaver said. “At no point was I asked by Kent Hance or anyone associated with him to set up meetings with anyone in or outside of government to discuss this, and if asked I would have summarily declined to do so.”In June 2005, the tribe informed Mr. Hance that his services were no longer needed.After the Abramoff scandal, Mr. McCain stopped taking campaign donations from tribes. Some American Indians were offended, especially since Mr. McCain continued to accept money from the tribes’ lobbyists.Resentment in Indian Country mounted as Mr. McCain, who was preparing for another White House run, singled out the growth in tribal gambling as one of three national issues that were “out of control.” (The others were federal spending and illegal immigration.)Franklin Ducheneaux, an aide to Morris Udall who helped draft the 1988 Indian gambling law, said that position ran contrary to Mr. McCain’s record. “What did he think? That Congress intended for the tribes to be only somewhat successful?” Mr. Ducheneaux said.Mr. McCain began taking a broad look at whether the laws were sufficient to oversee the growing industry. His campaign said that the growth had put “considerable stress” on regulators and Mr. McCain held hearings on whether the federal government needed more oversight power.An opportunity to restrain the industry came in the spring of 2005, when a small tribe in Connecticut set off a political battle. The group, the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation, had won federal recognition in 2004 after producing voluminous documentation tracing its roots.The tribe wanted to build Connecticut’s third casino, which would compete with Foxwoods and another, the Mohegan Sun. Facing public opposition on the proposed casino, members of the Connecticut political establishment — many of whom had received large Pequot and Mohegan campaign donations — swung into action.Connecticut officials claimed that a genealogical review by the Bureau of Indian Affairs was flawed, and that the Schaghticoke was not a tribe.The tribe’s opponents, led by the Washington lobbying firm Barbour Griffith & Rogers, turned to Mr. McCain’s committee. It was a full-circle moment for the senator, who had helped the Pequots gain tribal recognition in the 1980s despite concerns about their legitimacy.Now, Mr. McCain was doing a favor for allies in the Connecticut delegation, including Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a close friend, according to two former Congressional aides. “It was one of those collegial deals,” said one of the aides, who worked for Mr. McCain.Barbour Griffith & Rogers wanted Mr. McCain to hold a hearing that would show that the Bureau of Indian Affairs was “broken,” said Bradley A. Blakeman, who was a lobbyist for the firm at the time.“It was our hope that the hearing would shed light on the fact that the bureau had not followed their rules and had improperly granted recognition to the Schaghticoke,” Mr. Blakeman said. “And that the bureau would revisit the issue and follow their rules.”His staff told a lobbyist for the firm that the Indian Affairs Committee “would love to receive a letter” from the Connecticut governor requesting a hearing, according to an e-mail exchange, and offered “guidance on what the most effective tone and approach” would be in the letter.On May 11, 2005, Mr. McCain held a hearing billed as a general “oversight hearing on federal recognition of Indian tribes.” But nearly all the witnesses were Schaghticoke opponents who portrayed the tribe as imposters.Mr. McCain set the tone: “The role that gaming and its nontribal backers have played in the recognition process has increased perceptions that it is unfair, if not corrupt.”Chief Richard F. Velky of the Schaghticokes found himself facing off against the governor and most of the state’s congressional delegation. “The deck was stacked against us,” Mr. Velky said. “They were given lots of time. I was given five minutes.”He had always believed Mr. McCain “to be an honest and fair man,” Mr. Velky said, “but this didn’t make me feel that good.”Mr. Velky said he felt worse when the e-mail messages between the tribe’s opponents and Mr. McCain’s staff surfaced in a federal lawsuit. “Is there a letter telling me how to address the senator to give me the best shot?” Mr. Velky asked. “No, there is not.”After the hearing, Pablo E. Carrillo, who was Mr. McCain’s chief Abramoff investigator at the time, wrote to a Barbour Griffith & Rogers lobbyist, Brant Imperatore. “Your client’s side definitely got a good hearing record,” Mr. Carillo wrote, adding “you probably have a good sense” on where Mr. McCain “is headed on this.”Cynthia Shaw, a Republican counsel to the committee from 2005 to 2007, said Mr. McCain made decisions based on merit, not special interests. “Everybody got a meeting who asked for one,” Ms. Shaw said, “whether you were represented by counsel or by a lobbyist — or regardless of which lobbyist.”Mr. McCain’s campaign defended the senator’s handling of the Schaghticoke case, saying no staff member acted improperly. The campaign said the session was part of normal committee business and the notion that Mr. McCain was intending to help Congressional colleagues defeat the tribe was “absolutely false.”It added that the senator’s commitment to Indian sovereignty “remains as strong as ever.”Within months of the May 2005 hearing, the Bureau of Indian Affairs took the rare step of rescinding the Schaghticokes’ recognition. A federal court recently rejected the tribe’s claim that the reversal was politically motivated.That spring of 2005, as the Schaghticokes went down to defeat in the East, another tribe in the West squared off against Mr. McCain with its bid to construct a gambling emporium in California. The stakes were similar, but the outcome would be far different.The tribe’s plan to build a casino on a former Navy base just outside San Francisco represented a trend rippling across the country: American Indians seeking to build casinos near population centers, far from their reservations.The practice, known as “off-reservation shopping,” stemmed from the 1988 Indian gambling law, which included exceptions allowing some casinos to be built outside tribal lands. When Mr. McCain began his second stint as chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee three years ago, Las Vegas pressed him to revisit the exceptions he had helped create, according to Sig Rogich, the Republican fund-raiser from Nevada.“We told him this off-reservation shopping had to stop,” Mr. Rogich said. “It was no secret that the gaming industry, as well as many potentially affected communities in other states, voiced opposition to the practice.”In the spring of 2005, Mr. McCain announced he was planning a sweeping overhaul of Indian gambling laws, including limiting off-reservation casinos. His campaign said Las Vegas had nothing to do with it. In a 2005 interview with The Oregonian, Mr. McCain said that if Congress did not act, “soon every Indian tribe is going to have a casino in downtown, metropolitan areas.”Prospects for the proposed California project did not look promising. Then the tribe, the Guidiville Band of Pomo Indians, hired a lobbyist based in Phoenix named Wes Gullett.Mr. Gullett, who had never represented tribes before Congress, had known Mr. McCain since the early 1980s. Mr. Gullett met his wife while they were working in Mr. McCain’s Washington office. He subsequently managed Mr. McCain’s 1992 Senate campaign and served as a top aide to his 2000 presidential campaign. Their friendship went beyond politics. When Mr. McCain’s wife, Cindy, brought two infants in need of medical treatment back to Arizona from Bangladesh, the Gulletts adopted one baby and the McCains the other. The two men also liked to take weekend trips to Las Vegas.Another of Mr. McCain’s close friends, former Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, was a major investor in the Guidivilles’ proposed casino. Mr. Cohen, who did not return calls, was best man at Mr. McCain’s 1980 wedding.Scott Crowell, lawyer for the Guidivilles, said Mr. Gullett was hired to ensure that Mr. McCain’s overhaul of the Indian gambling laws did not harm the tribe.Mr. Gullett said he never talked to Mr. McCain about the legislation. “If you are hired directly to lobby John McCain, you are not going to be effective,” he said. Mr. Gullett said he only helped prepare the testimony of the tribe’s administrator, Walter Gray, who was invited to plead his case before Mr. McCain’s committee in July 2005. Mr. Gullett said he advised Mr. Gray in a series of conference calls.On disclosure forms filed with the Senate, however, Mr. Gullett stated that he was not hired until November, long after Mr. Gray’s testimony. Mr. Gullett said the late filing might have been “a mistake, but it was inadvertent.” Steve Hart, a former lawyer for the Guidivilles, backed up Mr. Gullett’s contention that he had guided Mr. Gray on his July testimony.When asked whether Mr. Gullett had helped him, Mr. Gray responded, “I’ve never met the man and couldn’t tell you anything about him.”On Nov. 18, 2005, when Mr. McCain introduced his promised legislation overhauling the Indian gambling law, he left largely intact a provision that the Guidivilles needed for their casino. Mr. McCain’s campaign declined to answer whether the senator spoke with Mr. Gullett or Mr. Cohen about the project. In the end, Mr. McCain’s bill died, largely because Indian gambling interests fought back. But the Department of Interior picked up where Mr. McCain left off, effectively doing through regulations what he had hoped to accomplish legislatively. Carl Artman, who served as the Interior Department’s assistant secretary of Indian Affairs until May, said Mr. McCain pushed him to rewrite the off-reservation rules. “It became one of my top priorities because Senator McCain made it clear it was one of his top priorities,” he said.The new guidelines were issued on Jan. 4. As a result, the casino applications of 11 tribes were rejected. The Guidivilles were not among them.1146 2008-09-28 Then came Black Wednesday — not for the stock market, which was holding steady in anticipation of Washington action, but for McCain. As the widely accepted narrative has it, his come-to-Jesus moment arrived that morning, when he awoke to discover that had surged ahead by nine percentage points in the Washington Post/ABC News poll. The McCain campaign hastily suited up its own pollster to belittle that finding — only to be drowned out by a fusillade of new polls from Fox News, Marist and CNN/Time, each with numbers closer to Post/ABC than not. Obama was rising most everywhere except the moose strongholds of and .That was not the only bad news raining down on McCain. His camp knew what had in the can from her interview with . The first excerpt was to be broadcast by that night, and it had to be upstaged fast.But even that wasn’t the top political threat McCain faced last week. Bigger still was the mounting evidence of the seamless synergy between his campaign and and , the mortgage monsters at the heart of the housing bust that set off our current calamity. Most of all, it was the fast-moving events on that front that precipitated his panic to roll out his diversionary, over-the-top theatrics on Wednesday.What we were learning — through The , Newsweek and Roll Call — was ugly. Davis Manafort, the lobbying firm owned by McCain’s campaign manager, , had received $15,000 a month from Freddie Mac from late 2005 until last month. This was in addition to the $30,000 a month that Davis was paid from 2000 to 2005 by the so-called Homeownership Alliance, an advocacy organization that he headed and that was financed by Freddie and Fannie to fight regulation.The McCain campaign tried to pre-emptively deflect such revelations by reviving the old Rove trick of accusing your opponent of your own biggest failings. It ran attack ads about Obama’s own links to the mortgage giants. But neither of the former Freddie-Fannie executives vilified in those ads, and James Johnson, had worked at those companies lately or are currently associated with the Obama campaign. (Raines never worked for the campaign at all.) By contrast, Davis is the tip of the Freddie-Fannie-McCain iceberg. McCain’s senior adviser, his campaign’s vice chairman, his Congressional liaison and the reported head of his White House transition team all either made fortunes from recent Freddie-Fannie lobbying or were players in firms that did.By Wednesday, the McCain campaign’s latest tactic for countering this news — attacking the press, especially The Times — was paying diminishing returns. Davis abruptly canceled his scheduled appearance that day at a weekly reporters’ lunch sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor, escaping any further questions by pleading that he had to hit the campaign trail. (He turned up at the “21” Club in New York that night, wining and dining McCain fund-raisers.)It’s then that Angry Old Ironsides McCain suddenly emerged to bark that our financial distress was “the greatest crisis we’ve faced, clearly, since World War II” — even greater than the - conflict, which in August he had called the “first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war.” Campaigns, debates and no doubt ’s nuptials had to be suspended immediately so he could ride to the rescue, with as his Robin.Yet even as he huffed and puffed about being a “leader,” McCain took no action and felt no urgency. As his Congressional colleagues worked tirelessly in Washington, he malingered in New York. He checked out the suffering on Main Street (or perhaps High Street) by conferring with Lady Lynn Forester de , the Hillary-turned-McCain supporter best known for her fabulous digs and her diatribes against Obama’s elitism. McCain also found time to have a well-publicized chat with one of those celebrities he so disdains, Bono, and to give a self-promoting public speech at the Clinton Global Initiative.There was no suspension of his campaign. His surrogates and ads remained on television. bloggers, working the phones, couldn’t find a single McCain campaign office that had gone on hiatus. This “suspension” ruse was an exact replay of McCain’s self-righteous “suspension” of the convention as arrived on . “We will put aside our political hats and put on our American hats,” he declared then, solemnly pledging that conventioneers would help those in need. But as anyone in the Twin Cities could see, the assembled put on their party hats instead, piling into the lobbyists’ bacchanals earlier than scheduled, albeit on the down-low.Much of the press paid lip service to McCain’s new “suspension” as it had to its prototype. In truth, the only campaign activity McCain did drop was a Wednesday evening taping with . Don’t mess with Dave. Picking up where the “The View” left off in speaking truth to power, the uncharacteristically furious host hammered the absent McCain on and off for 40 minutes, repeatedly observing that the cancellation “didn’t smell right.”In a journalistic coup de grâce worthy of “60 Minutes,” Letterman went on to unmask his no-show guest as a liar. McCain had phoned himself that afternoon to say he was “getting on a plane immediately” to deal with the grave situation in Washington, Letterman told the audience. Then he showed video of McCain being touched up by a makeup artist while awaiting an interview by Couric that same evening at another CBS studio in New York.It’s not hard to guess why McCain had blown off Letterman for Couric at the last minute. The McCain campaign’s high about the disastrous Couric-Palin sit-down was skyrocketing as advance excerpts flooded the Internet. By offering his own interview to Couric for the same night, McCain hoped (in vain) to dilute Palin’s primacy on the “CBS Evening News.”Letterman’s most mordant laughs on Wednesday came when he riffed about McCain’s campaign “suspension”: “Do you suspend your campaign? No, because that makes me think maybe there will be other things down the road, like if he’s in the White House, he might just suspend being president. I mean, we’ve got a guy like that now!”That’s no joke. Bush has so little credibility he can govern only through surrogates (Paulson is the new Petraeus). When he spoke about the economic crisis in prime time earlier that same night, he registered as no more than an irritating speed bump en route to “ : Dive of Death.”It’s that utter power vacuum that gave McCain the opening to pull his potentially catastrophic display of economic “leadership” last week. He may be the first presidential candidate in our history to risk wrecking the country even before being voted into the Oval Office.1147 2008-09-28 But that is not the point of this column. The point is, we don’t just need a bailout. We need a buildup. We need to get back to making stuff, based on real engineering not just financial engineering. We need to get back to a world where people are able to realize the American Dream — a house with a yard — because they have built something with their hands, not because they got a “liar loan” from an underregulated bank with no money down and nothing to pay for two years. The American Dream is an aspiration, not an entitlement.When I need reminding of the real foundations of the American Dream, I talk to my Indian-American immigrant friends who have come here to start new companies — friends like K.R. Sridhar, the founder of Bloom Energy. He e-mailed me a pep talk in the midst of this financial crisis — a note about the difference between surviving and thriving.“Infants and the elderly who are disabled obsess about survival,” said Sridhar. “As a nation, if we just focus on survival, the demise of our leadership is imminent. We are thrivers. Thrivers are constantly looking for new opportunities to seize and lead and be No. 1.” That is what America is about.But we have lost focus on that. Our economy is like a car, added Sridhar, and the financial institutions are the transmission system that keeps the wheels turning and the car moving forward. Real production of goods that create absolute value and jobs, though, are the engine.“I cannot help but ponder about how quickly we are ready to act on fixing the transmission, by pumping in almost one trillion dollars in a fortnight,” said Sridhar. “On the other hand, the engine, which is slowly dying, is not even getting an oil change or a tuneup with the same urgency, let alone a trillion dollars to get ourselves a new engine. Just imagine what a trillion-dollar investment would return to the economy, including the ‘transmission,’ if we committed at that level to green jobs and technologies.”Indeed, when this bailout is over, we need the next president — this one is wasted — to launch an E.T., energy technology, revolution with the same urgency as this bailout. Otherwise, all we will have done is bought ourselves a respite, but not a future. The exciting thing about the energy technology revolution is that it spans the whole economy — from green-collar construction jobs to high-tech solar panel designing jobs. It could lift so many boats.In a green economy, we would rely less on credit from foreigners “and more on creativity from Americans,” argued Van Jones, president of Green for All, and author of the forthcoming “The Green Collar Economy.” “It’s time to stop borrowing and start building. America’s No. 1 resource is not oil or mortgages. Our No. 1 resource is our people. Let’s put people back to work — retrofitting and repowering America. ... You can’t base a national economy on credit cards. But you can base it on solar panels, wind turbines, smart biofuels and a massive program to weatherize every building and home in America.”The Bush team says that if this bailout is done right, it should make the government money. Great. Let’s hope so, and let’s commit right now that any bailout profits will be invested in infrastructure — smart transmission grids or mass transit — for a green revolution. Let’s “green the bailout,” as Jones says, and help ensure that the American Dream doesn’t ever shrink back to just that — a dream.1148 2008-09-28 Carrie Melago, the daughter of Linda and Robert Melago of Greensburg, Pa., was married Saturday to Jonathan Lemire, a son of Susan and Robert Lemire of Lowell, Mass., at the Oratory Church of St. Boniface in Brooklyn. The Rev. Joel M. Warden, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony.The bride and the bridegroom are reporters at The New York Daily News, where they met.The bride, 32, is keeping her name. She covers education. She graduated cum laude from the University of Maryland, College Park, and received a master’s degree in American studies from Columbia. Her father retired as a mathematics teacher and the athletic director at Greensburg Salem High School in Greensburg. Her mother retired as a French teacher at Harrold Middle School in Greensburg.The bridegroom, 28, is the deputy police bureau chief and a fire department reporter at The News. He graduated from Columbia. His mother is the coordinator of advising services for students at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. His father is a history teacher at Chelmsford High School in Chelmsford, Mass.1149 2008-09-28 He is the son of Harriet G. Coquin of East Hanover, N.J., and the late Gerald A. Coquin. His father was an electrical engineer at the Bell Labs division of Lucent Technologies in Murray Hill, N.J.The couple met online in October 2006. Ms. King, who had read hundreds of personal profiles over the years, saw something different in Mr. Coquin’s. “There was a lot of kindness, and that’s what moved me,” she said.Mr. Coquin saw something in hers, too: “You can sense hostility in many of the profiles,” he said, adding that he was charmed by the “you + me = a smile” in her entry. “I was looking for a lighthearted person with a sense of humor.”“We were beyond the party lifestyle,” said Mr. Coquin, who also noticed that she liked to cook. “I felt she was ready to seek a serious relationship.”So they met two weeks later over coffee at the Barnes & Noble store in Clark, N.J., a place Ms. King referred to as “first date central.”“I drank so much coffee there while I was dating,” she said.But her date with Mr. Coquin seemed more promising than the others. “It was definitely the strongest, most positive chemistry I had with any man that I dated online,” she said.Mr. Coquin, who was equally impressed by their hour-long encounter, recalled thinking, “O.K., this is the way it should be.”They began dating and within a few months the relationship was serious. Last Thanksgiving was also Ms. King’s birthday. She made dinner for 20 people and one of her wishes as she and some of her young cousins blew out the candles on her cake was, “Oh, please let Ken propose to me by March.”Her wish was granted much sooner than that. A few minutes later it was time to open her presents, and she unwrapped a small box only to find a ring.1150 2008-09-28 Courtney Megan Cahill and Germaine Nicole Gurr-Perez were married Saturday in Provincetown, Mass. Rachel Peters, a Massachusetts justice of the peace, officiated.Ms. Cahill (left), 37, is an associate law professor at Roger Williams University in Bristol, R.I. She graduated from Barnard and received a law degree from Yale as well as a doctorate in comparative literature from Princeton. From 1996 to 1997, Ms. Cahill was a Fulbright fellow studying medieval Italian literature at the University of Florence.She is a daughter of Margaret and Kenneth C. Cahill of North Kingstown, R.I. Her father retired as a program manager at I.B.M. in Armonk, N.Y. Her mother is an administrative assistant at the Narragansett, R.I., laboratory of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.Ms. Gurr-Perez, 29, is an associate in the Providence, R.I., office of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, the New York law firm. She graduated from Simmons College and received a law degree from the University of Michigan.She is the daughter of Olga Peréz-Buffett of Pembroke Pines, Fla., and the stepdaughter of the late Jeffrey R. Buffett. Her mother is a financial services representative in a Coral Gables office of MetLife. Ms. Gurr-Perez’s stepfather was the clinical laboratory manager at Borinquen Health Care Center, a medical clinic in Miami.1151 2008-09-28 The stock market lost ground as investors awaited a financial rescue plan from Washington.In the biggest takeover of an American savings bank in history, Washington Mutual was seized by the government and its assets were sold to JPMorgan Chase. Credit markets tightened and gold and oil rose during the week, with the futures price for oil soaring more than $30 a barrel on Monday, the biggest single-day advance ever. Oil settled on Friday at $106.89 a barrel.For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 245.31 points, or 2.2 percent, to close at 11,143.13. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropped 41.81 points, or 3.3 percent, to close at 1,213.27. The Nasdaq composite index fell 90.56 points, or 4 percent, to close at 2,183.34.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.85 percent, from 3.81 percent.1152 2008-09-28 Mr. Olmert remains interim prime minister while Ms. Livni, narrowly elected by their Kadima Party to replace him, tries to put together a new government. At week’s end, she seemed more likely to succeed than fail. But if 42 days were to pass without a coalition coming together, general elections would follow three months later. And current polls show the right-wing opposition, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, likely to win.That is partly why those who favor compromise and negotiation with the Palestinians are feeling oddly wistful about Mr. Olmert’s departure. They are less sure of Ms. Livni’s intentions and horrified at the prospect of Mr. Netanyahu’s returning to power.A close associate of Mr. Olmert’s said both left and right were overly simplistic in their understandings of his shift. Mr. Olmert, he said, is part of a group of one-time rightists who now seek a negotiated two-state solution largely because of a change in Palestinian attitudes. “He would say that today there is a real partner that seeks reconciliation and peace,” the aide said of Mr. Olmert. “It’s not just I who has changed, but the Palestinians as well.”In truth, Mr. Olmert’s public statements over the past year show a worldview almost indistinguishable from that of Israel’s left — those who have long favored a return of all or nearly all of the territory Israel won in the 1967 war in exchange for promises of peace from Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world.That is the left-right divide in Israel: the more land and power you are willing to yield in the name of peace, the more to the left you are. The view of the right is that Arab promises are empty either because they are unenforceable or insincere or both.Mr. Olmert’s statements have been not only supportive of the left; they have been highly self-critical, asserting that his earlier views, the ones on which he was brought up, were just wrong.“I have known him for many years and we used to have bitter arguments,” remarked Tzaly Reshef, a founder of Peace Now and president of a publishing house. “Lately, when he has talked about his plans for the Palestinians and Syrians, I tell him, ‘You should have come to this conclusion long ago.’ And he says, ‘You are right.’ ”Last December, as his transformation was crystallizing, Mr. Olmert spoke to Parliament to mark the 60th anniversary of the United Nations vote to partition Palestine into two states, one Jewish, the other Arab. He invoked his father, a right-wing revisionist Zionist, who opposed the partition that David Ben-Gurion, the country’s founding prime minister, accepted.“I humbly bow my head in adoration for the man and his memory when I say these things that would probably have caused him to groan, but which I must say: Ben-Gurion was right,” Mr. Olmert said.And this is Mr. Olmert to the newspaper Haaretz around the same time: “If the day comes when the two-state solution collapses and we face a South-African style struggle for equal voting rights (including the Palestinians in the territories), then as soon as that happens the State of Israel is finished.”Even mentioning South Africa in the same breath as Israel is anathema to many, perhaps even most, Israelis and their supporters. As Amos Elon, a leftist Israeli commentator, noted approvingly in The New York Review of Books earlier this year of Mr. Olmert, “He now sounds almost like former President Jimmy Carter in his recent book, ‘Palestine: Peace not Apartheid’ (for which Carter was accused of anti-Semitism).”Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said that in meetings Mr. Olmert often spoke about his journey from the far right and his conclusion that “every day that goes by without a two-state solution is a day wasted.”Israelis on the right are horrified not only by what Mr. Olmert says but by the “seen-the-light” interpretation of the left. They say that what led Mr. Olmert to make a 180-degree political turn was not enlightenment but naked ambition for political survival — the desire for approval from the chattering classes. What the left and the international community see as Mr. Olmert’s pragmatism, the right sees as his desperation.The left, too, has complaints, mostly that he sullied the office of prime minister through greed, but also that despite his fine words about peace and Palestinian suffering, he never did nearly enough to change the situation on the ground.“He hasn’t done anything about removing settlements,” Mr. Reshef of Peace Now said. “While he has become more and more vocal about what should be done, the gap between words and deeds has also grown.”Nahum Barnea, who writes a widely-read political column for the newspaper Yediot Aharonot, said in an interview that Mr. Olmert lost most Israelis when he mishandled the 2006 war against the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah. The anger over his alleged corruption became a proxy for anger over that. And since most Israelis have little faith in the current Palestinian leadership or the likelihood of a peace deal being enforced by it, Mr. Olmert’s embrace of negotiations has been largely dismissed as inconsequential.“There is no doubt that he is going to leave a very dovish legacy, but in politics legacy can be a trap,” Mr. Barnea commented. “It’s an attempt to impose the ideas you failed to implement on your successor. But because of his reputation, Tzipi Livni will try to reject that legacy. She will do her best not to be seen as governing under the shadow of Olmert. And that may end up actually harming his cause.”For his recent admirers on the left, that may, in the end, be the real tragedy of Ehud Olmert.1153 2008-09-28 In “Your Money at Work, Fixing Others’ Mistakes” (Fair Game, Sept. 21), Gretchen Morgenson warned that, in the stampede to solve the credit crisis, banks and financial institutions have powerful lobbyists who seek the best deal for their clients.But that’s not the only problem. When the taxpayer gets stuck with huge losses and the deficit soars, the result may be a dream come true for neoconservatives. With debt rising, they will argue, there will be no way to pay for universal health care, and they will have an excuse to dismantle Social Security and Medicare. Norman MarkGretchen Morgenson refers to the original bailout proposal, or “troubled asset relief program,” as “TARP” for short.I’ll call it the “TRAP,” with inspiration from Melville in “Moby Dick.” Early in the book, in describing a “very dubious-looking” building, he writes: “It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the public; so, entering the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! Thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost choked me, are these the ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah?” Later, he says, “this must be the sign of ‘The Trap.’ ”I’m reluctant to believe that any plan thought up in a week, weekend or day could have the sustaining effect intended. Watch out for tripwires — a country’s at stake. David J. KaplanThe column was on target, but as a “TARPista,” or taxpayer, I take exception to the following statement: “we have no lobbyists, so we get skinned.”We do have lobbyists in Washington; supposedly they are our elected representatives. Unfortunately, it appears that some have decided to represent the interests of the financial industry lobbyists, and not ours.1154 2008-09-28 Days later, federal officials, who had let Lehman die and initially balked at tossing a lifeline to A.I.G., ended up bailing out the insurer for $85 billion.Their message was simple: Lehman was expendable. But if A.I.G. unspooled, so could some of the mightiest enterprises in the world.A Goldman spokesman said in an interview that the firm was never imperiled by A.I.G.’s troubles and that Mr. Blankfein participated in the Fed discussions to safeguard the entire financial system, not his firm’s own interests.Yet an exploration of A.I.G.’s demise and its relationships with firms like Goldman offers important insights into the mystifying, virally connected — and astonishingly fragile — financial world that began to implode in recent weeks.Although America’s housing collapse is often cited as having caused the crisis, the system was vulnerable because of intricate financial contracts known as credit derivatives, which insure debt holders against default. They are fashioned privately and beyond the ken of regulators — sometimes even beyond the understanding of executives peddling them.Originally intended to diminish risk and spread prosperity, these inventions instead magnified the impact of bad mortgages like the ones that felled Bear Stearns and Lehman and now threaten the entire economy.In the case of A.I.G., the virus exploded from a freewheeling little 377-person unit in London, and flourished in a climate of opulent pay, lax oversight and blind faith in financial risk models. It nearly decimated one of the world’s most admired companies, a seemingly sturdy insurer with a trillion-dollar balance sheet, 116,000 employees and operations in 130 countries.“It is beyond shocking that this small operation could blow up the holding company,” said Robert Arvanitis, chief executive of Risk Finance Advisors in Westport, Conn. “They found a quick way to make a fast buck on derivatives based on A.I.G.’s solid credit rating and strong balance sheet. But it all got out of control.”The insurance giant’s London unit was known as A.I.G. Financial Products, or A.I.G.F.P. It was run with almost complete autonomy, and with an iron hand, by Joseph J. Cassano, according to current and former A.I.G. employees.A onetime executive with Drexel Burnham Lambert — the investment bank made famous in the 1980s by the junk bond king Michael R. Milken, who later pleaded guilty to six felony charges — Mr. Cassano helped start the London unit in 1987.The unit became profitable enough that analysts considered Mr. Cassano a dark horse candidate to succeed Maurice R. Greenberg, the longtime chief executive who shaped A.I.G. in his own image until he was ousted amid an accounting scandal three years ago.But last February, Mr. Cassano resigned after the London unit began bleeding money and auditors raised questions about how the unit valued its holdings. By Sept. 15, the unit’s troubles forced a major downgrade in A.I.G.’s debt rating, requiring the company to post roughly $15 billion in additional collateral — which then prompted the federal rescue.Mr. Cassano, 53, lives in a handsome, three-story town house in the Knightsbridge neighborhood of London, just around the corner from Harrods department store on a quiet square with a private garden.He did not respond to interview requests left at his home and with his lawyer. An A.I.G. spokesman also declined to comment.At A.I.G., Mr. Cassano found himself ensconced in a behemoth that had a long and storied history of deftly juggling risks. It insured people and properties against natural disasters and death, offered sophisticated asset management services and did so reliably and with bravado on many continents. Even now, its insurance subsidiaries are financially strong.When Mr. Cassano first waded into the derivatives market, his biggest business was selling so-called plain vanilla products like interest rate swaps. Such swaps allow participants to bet on the direction of interest rates and, in theory, insulate themselves from unforeseen financial events.Ten years ago, a “watershed” moment changed the profile of the derivatives that Mr. Cassano traded, according to a transcript of comments he made at an industry event last year. Derivatives specialists from J. P. Morgan, a leading bank that had many dealings with Mr. Cassano’s unit, came calling with a novel idea.Morgan proposed the following: A.I.G. should try writing insurance on packages of debt known as “collateralized debt obligations.” C.D.O.’s. were pools of loans sliced into tranches and sold to investors based on the credit quality of the underlying securities.The proposal meant that the London unit was essentially agreeing to provide insurance to financial institutions holding C.D.O.’s and other debts in case they defaulted — in much the same way some homeowners are required to buy mortgage insurance to protect lenders in case the borrowers cannot pay back their loans.Under the terms of the insurance derivatives that the London unit underwrote, customers paid a premium to insure their debt for a period of time, usually four or five years, according to the company. Many European banks, for instance, paid A.I.G. to insure bonds that they held in their portfolios.Because the underlying debt securities — mostly corporate issues and a smattering of mortgage securities — carried blue-chip ratings, A.I.G. Financial Products was happy to book income in exchange for providing insurance. After all, Mr. Cassano and his colleagues apparently assumed, they would never have to pay any claims.Since A.I.G. itself was a highly rated company, it did not have to post collateral on the insurance it wrote, analysts said. That made the contracts all the more profitable.These insurance products were known as “credit default swaps,” or C.D.S.’s in Wall Street argot, and the London unit used them to turn itself into a cash register.The unit’s revenue rose to $3.26 billion in 2005 from $737 million in 1999. Operating income at the unit also grew, rising to 17.5 percent of A.I.G.’s overall operating income in 2005, compared with 4.2 percent in 1999.Profit margins on the business were enormous. In 2002, operating income was 44 percent of revenue; in 2005, it reached 83 percent.Mr. Cassano and his colleagues minted tidy fortunes during these high-cotton years. Since 2001, compensation at the small unit ranged from $423 million to $616 million each year, according to corporate filings. That meant that on average each person in the unit made more than $1 million a year.In fact, compensation expenses took a large percentage of the unit’s revenue. In lean years it was 33 percent; in fatter ones 46 percent. Over all, A.I.G. Financial Products paid its employees $3.56 billion during the last seven years.The London unit’s reach was also vast. While clients and counterparties remain closely guarded secrets in the derivatives trade, Mr. Cassano talked publicly about how proud he was of his customer list.At the 2007 conference he noted that his company worked with a “global swath” of top-notch entities that included “banks and investment banks, pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, hedge funds, money managers, high-net-worth individuals, municipalities and sovereigns and supranationals.”Of course, as this intricate skein expanded over the years, it meant that the participants were linked to one another by contracts that existed for the most part inside the financial world’s version of a black box.Goldman Sachs was a member of A.I.G.’s derivatives club, according to people familiar with the operation. It was a customer of A.I.G.’s credit insurance and also acted as an intermediary for trades between A.I.G. and its other clients.Few knew of Goldman’s exposure to A.I.G. When the insurer’s flameout became public, David A. Viniar, Goldman’s chief financial officer, assured analysts on Sept. 16 that his firm’s exposure was “immaterial,” a view that the company reiterated in an interview.Later that same day, the government announced its two-year, $85 billion loan to A.I.G., offering it a chance to sell its assets in an orderly fashion and theoretically repay taxpayers for their trouble. The plan saved the insurer’s trading partners but decimated its shareholders.Lucas van Praag, a Goldman spokesman, declined to detail how badly hurt his firm might have been had A.I.G. collapsed two weeks ago. He disputed the calculation that Goldman had $20 billion worth of risk tied to A.I.G., saying the figure failed to account for collateral and hedges that Goldman deployed to reduce its risk.Regarding Mr. Blankfein’s presence at the Fed during talks about an A.I.G. bailout, he said: “I think it would be a mistake to read into it that he was there because of our own interests. We were engaged because of the implications to the entire system.”Mr. van Praag declined to comment on what communications, if any, took place between Mr. Blankfein and the Treasury secretary, Mr. Paulson, during the bailout discussions.A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment about the A.I.G. rescue and Goldman’s role. The government recently allowed Goldman to change its regulatory status to help bolster its finances amid the market turmoil.Regardless of Goldman’s exposure, by last year, A.I.G. Financial Products’ portfolio of credit default swaps stood at roughly $500 billion. It was generating as much as $250 million a year in income on insurance premiums, Mr. Cassano told investors.Because it was not an insurance company, A.I.G. Financial Products did not have to report to state insurance regulators. But for the last four years, the London-based unit’s operations, whose trades were routed through Banque A.I.G., a French institution, were reviewed routinely by an American regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision.A handful of the agency’s officials were always on the scene at an A.I.G. Financial Products branch office in Connecticut, but it is unclear whether they raised any red flags. Their reports are not made public and a spokeswoman would not provide details.For his part, Mr. Cassano apparently was not worried that his unit had taken on more than it could handle. In an August 2007 conference call with analysts, he described the credit default swaps as almost a sure thing.“It is hard to get this message across, but these are very much handpicked,” he assured those on the phone.Just a few months later, however, the credit crisis deepened. A.I.G. Financial Products began to choke on losses — though they were only on paper.In the quarter that ended Sept. 30, 2007, A.I.G. recognized a $352 million unrealized loss on the credit default swap portfolio.Because the London unit was set up as a bank and not an insurer, and because of the way its derivatives contracts were written, it had to put up collateral to its trading partners when the value of the underlying securities they had insured declined. Any obligations that the unit could not pay had to be met by its corporate parent.So began A.I.G.’s downward spiral as it, its clients, its trading partners and other companies were swept into the drowning pool set in motion by the housing downturn.Mortgage foreclosures set off questions about the quality of debts across the entire credit spectrum. When the value of other debts sagged, calls for collateral on the securities issued by the credit default swaps sideswiped A.I.G. Financial Products and its legendary, sprawling parent.Yet throughout much of 2007, the unit maintained that its risk assessments were reliable and its portfolios conservative. Last fall, however, the methods that A.I.G. used to value its derivatives portfolio began to come under fire from trading partners.In February, A.I.G.’s auditors identified problems in the firm’s swaps accounting. Then, three months ago, regulators and federal prosecutors said they were investigating the insurer’s accounting.This was not the first time A.I.G. Financial Products had run afoul of authorities. In 2004, without admitting or denying accusations that it helped clients improperly burnish their financial statements, A.I.G. paid $126 million and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement to settle federal civil and criminal investigations.The settlement was a black mark on A.I.G.’s reputation and, according to analysts, distressed Mr. Greenberg, who still ran the company at the time. Still, as Mr. Cassano later told investors, the case caused A.I.G. to improve its risk management and establish a committee to maintain quality control.“That’s a committee that I sit on, along with many of the senior managers at A.I.G., and we look at a whole variety of transactions that come in to make sure that they are maintaining the quality that we need to,” Mr. Cassano told them. “And so I think the things that have been put in at our level and the things that have been put in at the parent level will ensure that there won’t be any of those kinds of mistakes again.”At the end of A.I.G.’s most recent quarter, the London unit’s losses reached $25 billion.As those losses mounted, and A.I.G.’s once formidable stock price plunged, it became harder for the insurer to survive — imperiling other companies that did business with it and leading it to stun the Federal Reserve gathering two weeks ago with a plea for help.Mr. Greenberg, who has seen the value of his personal A.I.G. holdings decline by more than $5 billion this year, dumped five million shares late last week. A lawyer for Mr. Greenberg did not return a phone call seeking comment.For his part, Mr. Cassano has departed from a company that is a far cry from what it was a year ago when he spoke confidently at the analyst conference.“We’re sitting on a great balance sheet, a strong investment portfolio and a global trading platform where we can take advantage of the market in any variety of places,” he said then. “The question for us is, where in the capital markets can we gain the best opportunity, the best execution for the business acumen that sits in our shop?”1155 2008-09-28 Second, according to what I hear from my betters in the world of finance, the most serious problems are not with the bundles of subprime mortgages themselves — a large but not lethal quantum as far as I can tell — but with derivatives contracts tied to subprime and other dicey debt. These contracts are superficially an attempt to “insure” against risks of default, hence the name “credit-default swaps.” In fact, they are an immense wager — which anyone with lots of money or borrowing ability can enter — about how mortgage-backed bonds, leveraged loan bonds, student loan bonds, credit card bonds and the like will perform.These wagers entail amounts many times larger than the total of subprime loans. In fact, there are roughly $62 trillion in credit-default swap derivatives out there, compared with about $1 trillion of subprime mortgages. These derivatives are “weapons of financial mass destruction,” in the prophetic words of Warren E. Buffett. (Apparently believing that the worst is over, at least for one big investment bank, Mr. Buffett is now investing in Goldman Sachs.)The swaps market has been unregulated. It has been just a lot of people making bets with one another. Some of them made incredibly fortunate payoff wagers against the mortgage bonds, using credit-default swaps as their wagering vehicle. I am not sure who the big winners are, but they are out there, and the gains were big enough to cripple the part of Wall Street on the losing side of the bets.Almost no one (except Mr. Buffett) saw this coming, at least not on this scale. But let’s get back to the man of the hour. Why didn’t Mr. Paulson, the Treasury secretary, see it? He was once the head of Goldman Sachs, an immense player in the swaps world. Didn’t people at Treasury have a clue? If they didn’t, what was going on in their heads? If they did, why didn’t they do something about it a year ago, when saving the world would have been a lot cheaper?If Mr. Paulson and Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, didn’t see this train coming, what else have they missed? What other freight train is barreling down the track at us?All of this would be bad enough. But by far the most terrifying item I read in my morning paper last week was this: Mr. Paulson demanded that Congress forbid judicial review of his decisions on use of the money in the mortgage bailout. This would amount to an abrogation of the Constitution. Not only would his decisions be sacrosanct and above the law, but so would the actions of his pals in the banking world in connection with this bailout.The people whose conduct got us into this catastrophe have not only taken our money, hopes and peace of mind, but they apparently also want a trillion or so more dollars to put into their Wall Street Buddy System Fund. This may be the most dangerous attack on the law in my lifetime. What anarchists even dared consider this plan? Thank heaven that minds more devoted to the Constitution on Capitol Hill are questioning this shocking request.By the way, if we are actually thinking about tossing the Constitution out the window, why not simply annul these credit-default swap contracts? With that done, the incomprehensibly large liability of the banks would cease, and we wouldn’t need this staggering bailout. Shouldn’t we consider making the speculators pay some of the price?WE have survived housing-price corrections before. Why is this one causing so much anguish? It must be the side bets, the credit-default swap bets, multiplying the effect of the housing downturn many times over. Maybe we should just get rid of these exotic bets and start again without them. “Insurance” on market moves is always a bad idea, because it does not tamp down market disruptions but instead greatly magnifies them — as in the disastrous effect of “portfolio insurance” in the 1987 crash.Then there was Mr. Paulson’s insistence that there be no compensation caps for executives of companies being bailed out by the factory workers, the farmers, the schoolteachers and the medical doctors. He told a skeptical Congress on Tuesday that if these caps were put into place, bank executives simply wouldn’t participate in the bailout or sell us suckers their debts. Fine with me. If the banks are in good enough shape so that petulant executives can simply opt out rather than live on a few million a year, maybe we don’t need the bailout at all. Maybe we would be better off if those executives simply bailed out and were replaced by people with more sense and more patriotism.One final little thought bubbles into my mind: Maybe the bailout should not be of the banks at all, but of homeowners themselves. Maybe if we make the government the buyer of last resort of homes, we will stabilize the markets, stabilize the debt associated with the markets and take the gain out of the credit-default swaps for the speculators. Yes, price would be a huge issue, but so it is for Mr. Paulson’s plan for buying debt from banks.Why not? We do it for farmers. Why not for the individual homeowner? Oh, right. Because Treasury secretaries don’t know any of those people.1156 2008-09-28 The administration had initially requested virtually unfettered authority to operate the bailout program. But as they moved toward clinching a deal, both sides appeared to have given up a number of contentious proposals, including a change in the bankruptcy laws sought by some Democrats to give judges the authority to modify the terms of first mortgages.Congressional leaders and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. emerged from behind closed doors to announce the tentative agreement at 12:30 a.m. Sunday, after two days of marathon meetings.“We have made great progress toward a deal, which will work and be effective in the marketplace,” Mr. Paulson said at a news conference in Statuary Hall in the Capitol.In the final hours of negotiations, Democratic lawmakers, including Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois and Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, carried pages of the bill by hand, back and forth, from Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, where the Democrats were encamped, to Mr. Paulson and other Republicans in the offices of Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House minority leader.At the same time, a series of phone calls was taking place, including conversations between Ms. Pelosi and President Bush; between Mr. Paulson and the two presidential candidates, Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama; and between the candidates and top lawmakers.“All of this was done in a way to insulate Main Street and everyday Americans from the crisis on Wall Street,” Ms. Pelosi said at the news conference. “We have to commit it to paper so we can formally agree, but I want to congratulate all of the negotiators for the great work they have done.”In a statement, Tony Fratto, the deputy White House press secretary, said: “We’re pleased with the progress tonight and appreciate the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”A senior administration official who participated in the talks said the deal was effectively done. “I know of no unresolved open issues for principals,” the official said.In announcing a tentative agreement, lawmakers and the administration achieved their goal of sending a reassuring message ahead of Monday’s opening of the Asian financial markets.Lawmakers, especially in the House, are also eager to adjourn and return home for the fall campaign season.Among the last sticking points was an unexpected and bitter fight over how to pay for any losses that taxpayers may experience after distressed debt has been purchased and resold.Democrats had pushed for a fee on securities transactions, essentially a tax on financial firms, saying it was fitting that they contribute to the cost.In the end, lawmakers and the administration opted to leave the decision to the next president, who must present a proposal to Congress to pay for any losses.Officials said they had also agreed to include a proposal by House Republicans that gives the Treasury secretary an additional option of issuing government insurance for troubled financial instruments as a way of reducing the amount of taxpayer money spent up front on the rescue effort.The Treasury would be required to create the insurance program, officials said, but not necessarily to use it. Mr. Paulson had expressed little interest in that plan, and initial cost projections suggested it would be enormously expensive. But final details were not immediately available.Saturday’s intense negotiating effort followed a tumultuous week, including a contentious meeting at the White House with President Bush and the two presidential candidates.That meeting had moments of drama, including a blunt warning by President Bush. “If money isn’t loosened up, this sucker could go down,” he said. It ended with angry recriminations after House Republicans scotched a near-agreement from earlier in the day.Mr. Paulson scrambled to revive the talks, and they resumed almost immediately. Congressional and Treasury staff then worked all of Friday and through the night, ending in the predawn.Mr. Paulson and Congressional leaders stepped in at 3 p.m. Saturday and were in direct negotiations for most of the rest of the night. And immediately after the news conference, staff members began efforts to finalize the language.Even then, their work is hardly over.Congressional leaders who want the bailout to pass with solid bipartisan support had already begun to anxiously court votes, mindful of the difficulty they could face in a high-stakes election year.Public opinion polls show the bailout plan to be deeply unpopular. Conservative Republicans have denounced the plan as an affront to free market capitalism, while some liberal Democrats criticize it as a giveaway to Wall Street.Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the chief negotiator for House Republicans, who have been among the most reluctant to support the plan, expressed some satisfaction but did not commit his members’ support.“We need to look and see where we are on paper tomorrow,” Mr. Blunt said. “We have been talking about how we can make these things work in a way that our conference can come together.”Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the lead negotiator for the House Democrats, said that there was no expectation of making anyone smile.“This was never going to be a bill that was going to make people happy,” he said. “No solution to a problem can be more elegant than the problem itself. We are dealing with a very difficult problem.”“Given the dimensions of the problem, I believe we have done a good job,” he added. “It includes genuine compromises.”Aides described a tense meeting on Saturday afternoon that included Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, shouting at Mr. Paulson about executive pay caps.Outside, stunned tourists visiting the Capitol watched as camera operators shoved one another to get footage of lawmakers talking outside of the meeting room.At one point, when too much information was leaking out, staff members’ BlackBerrys were confiscated and collected in a trash bin.While Congressional Republicans sent only their chief negotiators, Mr. Blunt and Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, at least nine Democrats with competing priorities piled into the meeting, surprising the Republicans but apparently not unsettling them.The centerpiece of the rescue effort remains the plan for the government to buy up to $700 billion in troubled assets from financial firms as a way to free their balance sheets of bad debts and to help restore a healthy flow of credit through the economy.The money will disbursed in parts, with an initial $250 billion to get the rescue effort under way, followed by another $100 billion upon a report by Mr. Bush to Congress.The president could then request the balance of $350 billion at any time. If Congress disapproved, it would have to act within 15 days to deny the Treasury the money.Early in the day, the two presidential nominees were active from the sidelines. Mr. McCain telephoned Congressional Republicans to sound them out, and Mr. Obama got regular updates by phone from Mr. Paulson and top lawmakers.Some lawmakers have made clear that they will not vote for the bailout plan under virtually any terms. “I didn’t want to be in the negotiations because I object to the basic principles of this,” said Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, who would normally be his party’s point man.Pressed about his role, Mr. Shelby replied, “My position is ‘No.’ ”Officials, including Mr. Bush, stepped up efforts to sell the plan to the American public, which, according to opinion polls, is deeply skeptical.“The rescue effort we’re negotiating is not aimed at Wall Street; it is aimed at your street,” Mr. Bush said in his weekly radio address. “There is now widespread agreement on the major principles. We must free up the flow of credit to consumers and businesses by reducing the risk posed by troubled assets.”In a brief speech on the Senate floor, Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said: “It’s not just going to be Wall Street. The chairman of the Federal Reserve has told us if the credit lockup continues, three million to four million Americans will lose their jobs in the next six months.”The ultimate cost of the rescue plan to taxpayers is virtually impossible to know. Because the government would be buying assets of value — potentially worth much more than the government will pay for them — there is even a chance the rescue effort would eventually return a profit.Some Democrats had sought to direct 20 percent of any such profits to help create affordable housing, but Republicans opposed that and demanded that all profits be returned to the Treasury.1157 2008-09-28 The blast on Saturday morning took place near an intersection on the highway leading south to the airport, not far from the Sayyida Zainab shrine. The shrine draws Shiite pilgrims from across the region, including large numbers of Iranians.About half a million Iraqi refugees also live in the densely populated area; most of them fled Iraq after war erupted there in 2003.The bomb detonated close to an office of one of Syria’s highly secretive security services, according to a number of shopkeepers and residents in the area. It destroyed or damaged dozens of cars along the highway, and shrapnel scarred building facades and shattered glass through an entire city block.The area was quickly cordoned off, and reporters who came too close were quickly confronted and ushered away by plainclothes security officers.The interior minister, Gen. Basam Abd al-Majid, told Syrian state television that the people behind the attack were “terrorists” and that investigators were tracking them down, but that “we can’t point the finger at any side.”After the killing in Damascus this year of Imad Mugniyah, a senior military commander of the militant Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah, Syrian authorities implied, but never actually said, that they blamed Israel.The Syrian authorities made similar comments after the killing early last month of Mohammed Suleiman, a senior military officer, in the Syrian port town of Tartous.“These attacks are becoming more frequent, and there are worries that Syria is being targeted by groups from the outside,” said Marwan Kabalan, a political science professor at Damascus University.The bombing comes at a time of intense diplomatic activity for Syria, which has been holding indirect negotiations with Israel on a possible peace deal.Those negotiations, which are currently suspended as Israel completes a political transition following the resignation of Ehud Olmert as prime minister, are widely believed to have caused tensions between Syria and its ally Iran. They are also said to be causing tensions with Hezbollah, which Syria and Iran have helped arm.Any peace deal with Israel would probably require Syria to halt or at least limit its military cooperation with Iran and Hezbollah. After the killing in February of Mr. Mugniyah — one of Israel’s chief targets — there was widespread speculation that Syrian officials may have been involved.Syria has also been reaching out to the West. Early this month, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France visited Damascus, in the first visit to Syria by a Western head of state in five years, after Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, pledged to exchange ambassadors with Lebanon.Relations with the West had soured in 2005 after the killing in Lebanon of Rafik Hariri, a popular former Lebanese prime minister; many blamed Syria for that attack.This month, Mr. Assad issued a warning about the presence of hard-line Sunni Islamists just across the border in northern Lebanon, hinting that they were receiving support from Saudi Arabia. Subsequently, thousands of Syrian troops were deployed near the border with northern Lebanon, in a move that was understood as a related gesture, though Syrian officials said it was to control smuggling.Although Syria has been widely accused in recent years of facilitating the transport of Islamist fighters across its eastern border into Iraq, the Syrian state has a long history of fighting Sunni Arab militants.Many of the militants resent both the secular nature of the Syrian state and the fact that Mr. Assad and much of the ruling elite belong to the Alawite sect of Islam, an offshoot of Shiite Islam viewed as heretical by some Sunni extremists.1158 2008-09-28 David Brooks says that what disappoints him about John McCain’s campaign “is that it has no central argument.”This is not surprising. In Mr. McCain’s 2002 autobiography, “Worth the Fighting For,” he wrote candidly about his run for the presidency in 2000:“I didn’t decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms I believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism. In truth, I wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to become president. ... In truth, I’d had the ambition for a long time.”David Brooks claims that Senator John McCain “is not a sophisticated conceptual thinker, but he is a good judge of character.”Significantly, Mr. Brooks does not even mention Gov. Sarah Palin. Mr. McCain’s selection of her as his running mate, arguably one of the most important decisions he has made while a public figure, says more about his judgment of character and the people he is likely to select for his administration than Mr. Brooks’s rhetorical claims.The writer is a professor of political science at Pepperdine University.It is quite interesting that David Brooks wants John McCain, a man who admits to being “illiterate” when it comes to computers and the Internet, to “create a grand narrative explaining how the United States is fundamentally unprepared for the 21st century.”1159 2008-09-28 Hannah Tinti’s first novel, “The Good Thief,” opens at a Catholic orphanage in New England, where the statue of St. Anthony in the courtyard can’t help the boys recover what they’ve lost. Ren, the book’s hero, is missing not only his family but also his left hand, the skin mysteriously sewn up at the wrist. Passed over for adoption because of the lost hand, Ren begins stealing small objects as recompense.The novel is set in the mid-19th century, with Indians being fought in the West. When Ren is 11, an ex-soldier named Benjamin Nab arrives at St. Anthony’s and chooses Ren from all the other boys. Nab describes to the priests a brutal Indian attack, during which his mother cut off his baby brother’s hand while trying to rescue him. As proof, he produces his parents’ scalps, like holy relics.Ren, who craves a family, believes it all, but Nab turns out to be a liar, a deserter and a con artist. A damaged boy who can induce pity is gold to him. They join Nab’s drunken colleague, Tom, and Ren finds that their surest means of support is robbing graves.Tinti’s New England is not exactly the one we know, and when the three make their way to a town called North Umbrage, things get wild and strange. Ren clings to Nab for survival, while their small band grows to include a resurrected murderer, a towering deaf landlady, a pair of unlucky twins and a dwarf who comes down a chimney at night, like a figure in a fairy tale.North Umbrage, as its name suggests, is a place of darkness and grievance. The former mining town is one enormous graveyard: the mine’s entrance collapsed in an explosion, trapping the men, leaving widows whose husbands are buried beneath their feet. An opportunistic tyrant named McGinty has taken over, running a gang of enforcers called “hat boys” because they wear top hats and porkpies. He’s also built a mousetrap factory and staffed it with a semi-captive labor force of unmarriageable girls.The plot is Dickensian, and so are some of the names, but the style isn’t. Tinti’s prose is straightforward and measured, with none of Dickens’s baroque whimsy. On Ren’s education at the orphanage:“It had been decided that the brothers must give the children some knowledge; at the very least enough language to read the Bible, and enough arithmetic so that the Protestants could not cheat them. Why this task of education was given to Brother Peter the boys did not know, for more often than not he would simply rest his forehead on the table before him and ignore the children completely. Much of what the boys had learned had been transferred from child to child like a disease, and mostly concerned bits of New England history: minutemen and the North Bridge, Giles Corey and Crispus Attucks.”1160 2008-09-28 I have a sneaky feeling Galbraith would take those fighting words as a compliment. He admits this is a “personal” work, since the conservative tide “devalued my Keynesian education, obstructed my career and deprived me and my few comrades on Capitol Hill of purchase on the levers of power.” He mourns the assault on his father’s legacy. (Milton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winning monetarist most responsible for toppling Galbraith from a revered place in the economist’s pantheon, is likened to George Wallace. Yes, that George Wallace.)Touching as his filial devotion is, Galbraith seems to believe we are still living in an economic ecosystem dominated by industrial behemoths — which is to say, the world described in the elder Galbraith’s 1967 masterpiece, “The New Industrial State.” When he observes of C.E.O.’s, citing Veblen, that their “wives and servants are therefore fed and decorated to reflect the stature of their masters,” he is dialing back to the 1950s, or maybe to the ’20s.Still, the gusto with which he repeatedly challenges tired conventions is refreshing. Did inflation really go up in the ’70s because the Fed printed too much money — or as Galbraith says, did big companies, big unions, and OPEC simply have too much pricing power? Does too much employment really lead to inflation, as conservatives tell us — or is the very notion absurd? And if low taxes haven’t promoted savings, Galbraith asks, why not raise them?Galbraith delights in tweaking conservatives, but some of his surest arrows are aimed at liberals, whom he charges with cowering in a “protective crouch.” As a Keynesian, Galbraith does honor to deficit spending; he harpoons liberals for adopting the ideal of balanced budgets just when the right has abandoned it. Budget balancers are “not merely parroting conservatives,” he says; “they are parroting dead conservatives.” And he debunks the liberal approach to trade protection, which is often to insist that developing nations agree to reforms in their home economies. “You cannot impose a wage standard on China or Vietnam,” Galbraith points out. But you can do it at home.Aiming, he says, “to free up the liberal mind,” he fearlessly endorses long since abandoned, and now generally discredited, liberal policies, from price controls to state planning. “You want higher wages?” he asks. “Raise them. You want more and better jobs? Create them.”There is much in this book that strikes me as wrong. Most C.E.O.’s are neither “functionaries” nor are they “idle.” It is not true that the market never ferrets out scandal; Enron was spotted by hedge funds and undone by short-sellers. Hurricane Katrina exposed a failure not of markets but of government. And contrary to Galbraith, economic freedom as interpreted by market proponents is more than just “the freedom to shop.”He writes so well, you have to pinch yourself to remember that, yes, the free market has produced robust growth and central planning has usually failed. Galbraith acknowledges that the United States has mostly enjoyed prosperity in recent years; his glib explanation is that hold-over New Deal institutions (government mortgage agencies, subsidized health care, student loans) have come to the rescue of misguided conservative policies. In other words, if it works, it’s the residue of Franklin Roosevelt and Galbraith’s dad; if it fails, it’s the market’s fault. That seemed preposterous when I first read it; but in the wake of the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when all of Wall Street could be headed for a bailout, one wonders.Galbraith admits neither ambiguity nor doubt; indeed, his prose is absolutist in proportion to the extent to which his assertions are unprovable. For Galbraith, the market as its apostles describe it does not really exist. It is a “vaporous” idea, a “cosmic and ethereal space,” a “negation,” a “nonstate.” Finally, it is “another god that failed.” This is brilliant rhetoric. It is not brilliant economics, but give him his due: He has raised trenchant questions about a system in crisis.1161 2008-09-28 “That chapter — with all those added management costs from a big company — needed to close,” says Mr. Clark. “Our wellness committee was making strides toward healthier eating, but it didn’t mesh with the perspective of corporate America in terms of the types of food purchases, menu selection. We wanted better nutritional choices for kids, and more creative ways to get it to them.”To venture where few big-city lunch programs dare to go — independent and in-house — is dicey indeed. Mr. Clark said that in New Haven, where 80 percent of students qualify for free or subsidized meals, the board of education found it more expedient and non-stigmatizing to feed all students on a government-subsidized universal free lunch program. To obtain reimbursement for those meals — and close the deficit — requires a blizzard of paperwork and a lot of cajoling of parents who may be too anxious or unwilling to divulge the necessary personal information on government forms.On many levels, then, taking back lunch is daunting here. Mr. Cipriano took charge at a pace requiring plenty of 12-hour days. With childhood obesity the No. 1 concern of the district’s Wellness Committee, he set about rethinking cafeteria staples: “You can get chicken nuggets with whole-grain coating, baked instead of fried. If you’re ordering chicken for 20,000, the purveyors will work with you.” He has also replaced chicken patties with “real chicken” — portions cut from whole roasted birds. Today’s menu included a chicken stir fry with zucchini and snow peas. But with three small children of his own, Mr. Cipriano pays heed to pacing — and patience. He will push no parsnip before its time:“Never too much change too fast. We’re feeding kids here. Pizza is a major food group. So you can give them fresh veggies on top, on whole grain crust. And you slip pureed butternut squash into the tomato sauce.”To aid and abet his nutritious subterfuge, he hired a new head chef, Michele DiBacco, who worked with him at Bloomfield. “If I tell her I want mashed potatoes, she won’t order 40 cases of potato buds. We’ll steam red potatoes, skins on, smash them up and season them.”Reviews of new menu items are almost instant. “By lunchtime,” Mr. Clark says. He has been getting e-mail messages from principals (the new chicken nuggets were boffo) and from pleased parents who marvel, “My kids really like it. And I’m not making lunches anymore.”In the massive kitchen, there are soup caldrons almost as big as Smart Cars, freezers with enough square footage to house a family of four. All this state-of-the-art hardware fairly screams “Why not?” But hold on, Mr. Cipriano’s normally placid brow is furrowed. He has spotted a few pallets of white bread sandwich rolls, though he ordered whole grain. The staff is gone for the day but he wants some answers. “Looks like some serious phone calls in the morning,” he said.Being the new kids on the block in terms of buying locally produced food — Yale, University of Connecticut, Wesleyan and the Bloomfield school district are at the head of that class — Mr. Cipriano did have some trouble finding 20,000 fresh state peaches for the second day of school, so he “went regional” with Jersey fruit as well. With an operation this huge, surely he won’t try anything like that local-corn-on-the-cob gambit?“Funny you should ask.” The Dude knows people; in fact, besides his proven ability to balance a budget, his high profile as a generous networker was one of the assets that made Mr. Clark hire him. So six days hence he will take delivery of 6,500 fresh ears of corn, shucked and snapped into half-ear portions. They will have journeyed just 8 miles from Cecarelli Farms in Northford.Out on the kitchen’s loading dock, peering into a steady rain, the two men survey the fleet of clean white trucks that bustle off every morning, the intake area where tractor trailers deposit serious tonnage of chicken, cheese and cereal. Can they pull it off?“We’re trying to change hearts and minds from preschoolers through high school and that takes time. Everything will be easier a year out,” says Mr. Cipriano. “Orders and menus will be in place. And we can start to have fun.”On his roster of future why not’s: “My plan is to have a simple, basic menu district-wide. Then work with schools in ethnic neighborhoods — Latino, Asian, Jamaican — to give those kitchens a neighborhood feel. Everyone will have appealing options.”He sees wooing fresh food converts with tastings prepared by local restaurant stars and samplings of vegetables produced by New Haven gardens, like the one at Barnard School: “Sun Gold cherry tomatoes,” the Dude rhapsodizes. “You pop them in your mouth and they’re so sweet, just fantastic. One little tomato can change a whole generation of kids.”1162 2008-09-28 The conventional symbols for darkness and illumination are reversed in Arnaldur Indridason’s austere Icelandic police procedurals. In this arctic land where the natives “yearned for the cold black of night and the deep winter,” shadows bring understanding, and nothing good comes with the light of day. Inspector Erlendur Sveinsson, the compassionate detective in this remarkable series, draws the curtains against the “relentless May sun” in THE DRAINING LAKE (St. Martin’s Minotaur, $24.95), instinctively blaming its warming rays for drying up Lake Kleifarvatn, where a hydrologist studying the shrinking water levels has turned up a human skeleton with a hole in its skull. (In point of fact, an earthquake opened fissures in the lake bed — suggestive of yet more alarming metaphors.)Were it not for the vintage Soviet radio transmitter found with the bones, the police would be inclined to write off these macabre findings as just another anonymous suicide. “It isn’t considered significant in this country if people disappear,” Erlendur dryly notes. But as someone who watched his only brother swept from sight in a winter storm when they were children, the detective comes naturally to his role as champion of the disappeared and comforter of those who still wait for them. This is a man who, while giving his professional attention to long-forgotten missing persons cases, spends his quiet hours reading accounts of avalanches and other catastrophes that leave no trace of the lives they sweep away.In this book as in Indridason’s previous ones (all translated with grave sensitivity by Bernard Scudder), Erlendur’s effort to reclaim one lost soul opens a broader investigation into a neglected piece of Icelandic history. Here it’s the “weird times” of the cold war, when Iceland was of strategic interest to both the United States, which kept a military base at Keflavik, and the Soviet Union, which had plenty of spies on the ground.Indridason reclaims this historical moment with a parallel narrative line recalling the bitter disillusionment of Icelandic students whose socialist ideals were betrayed when they went to study in East Germany. Once again, Erlendur’s persistent search for something of inestimable value that has long been lost — from one woman’s beloved fiancé to the political innocence of an entire generation — becomes the touchstone for Indridason’s pursuit of the missing chapters of his national heritage.You want cold? You want cheerless? Leave Iceland to its sultry spring and decamp for the Siberian Territory. Stuart M. Kaminsky’s endearing Russian bear of a detective, Chief Inspector Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov, is forced to voyage there in PEOPLE WHO WALK IN DARKNESS (Forge/Tom Doherty, $23.95) when a Canadian geologist is murdered after encountering a ghostly child deep below the earth in a diamond mine.1163 2008-09-28 “As costs rise and public funding falls, we’ve taken a page out of the Department of Social Services playbook and decided to seek remuneration from pet parents who dump their offspring into the system. That’s the only way we can avoid resorting to almost immediate euthanasia.”Don Epstein was playing out their scene exactly as Tess had envisioned, but it was dismaying nonetheless. Mrs. Blossom produced the jargon-laded “authorization form” — again, Tess’s idea, Crow’s execution — and indicated where he was to sign. He scrawled his name, not even bothering to read the presumptive death warrant.“And, of course, we’ll need your wife’s signature,” she said, pointing to a second line.“The people who brought us the dog supplied the breeder’s name, which is how we found you. He says you both signed the contract. Therefore, we need two signatures to proceed.”He was the kind of man who flushed when angry — not red, but a deep, eggplant purple. It would be a nice shade on a shoe, come to think of it, but it didn’t flatter a face. Don Epstein, with his dark hair and heavy beard, looked a little like a werewolf. Mr. Blossom, rest his soul, had been as sweet as the surname he bestowed on her more than 50 years ago.“You can force me to pay for this mutt’s care, but I don’t have the authority to waive custody? That’s insane.”“All I need is your wife’s signature — ”Tess had anticipated this answer too.“Has she left for work? I can always visit her office.”“When do you expect her back?”“I don’t. That is, I don’t know. She’s a, uh, free spirit. Comes and goes as she pleases.”“That’s none of your business.”He slammed the door. A heavy wooden affair, perhaps it couldn’t help closing with such thudding finality. Mrs. Blossom didn’t know architecture, but the house suggested “Italian” to her, with its sand-colored stucco walls and red-tiled roof. It sprawled over an enormous lawn, presumably tended by landscaping crews. Not to stereotype — after all, that’s what people were forever doing to her — but Mr. Epstein looked too . . . blow-dried to be the gardening type. He had a fresh manicure and two gleaming rings. She would jot those details down later. Funny, her memory, which had been growing unreliable, was sharpening since she took this job. Tight, shiny maroon shirt, she added to her mental inventory. A gold bracelet, too, ID style.His taste in houses was better than his taste in jewelry. Even in today’s deflated market, this was a million-dollar home or better, and a million dollars still bought a lot of house in Baltimore City.Instead of walking down the flagstone path to where her car sat at the curb, she wandered toward the garage as if confused. Confusion was an older woman’s prerogative, after all. The garage had small diamond-pane windows that allowed her to peer in. A three-car garage, it held only two vehicles — a BMW S.U.V. and a low-slung Porsche that made her back hurt just looking at it. Imagine getting in and out of such a car. Mr. Epstein was only in his 50s, by her estimation, but he was a big man. She tried to memorize the license plates, a much trickier task. Luckily, one was a vanity tag, although she couldn’t sort out its meaning: MLCRISS.“Midlife crisis!” Tess hooted. “Interesting thing to announce to the world. But where’s the trophy wife that usually comes with the package?”“He says,” Tess scoffed. “What else did you get from your background checks?”Mrs. Blossom read from her notes: “He owns a chain of check-cashing businesses, with five franchises in Baltimore alone.”“Some of those guys are legit, but I bet he’s one of the scummy ones, preying on welfare recipients, making payday loans at exorbitant interest rates. How long has he been married?”“Six months, according to the license. First marriage for her — Carole Massinger Epstein — but not for him. License says he was widowed.”“Not much, but then the Beacon-Light database online only goes back to 1995. He pops up in some stories about check-cashing owners worried about electronic benefits, and that’s that.”“She’s younger, 32 to his 53. But that’s all I’ve been able to find so far.”“The two cars I saw are registered to him, although at an old address in Anne Arundel County. So he doesn’t update things, timely. But her car is newer, bought only three months ago, so it carries the Blythewood address. A BMW convertible, green, according to the registration.”“So, if Mr. Epstein is to be believed,” Tess said, “his wife got into her spanking-new BMW, drove off on a business trip and never mentioned that she lost their new dog. Who would do that?”“He’s not that bad,” Tess said. The still-nameless dog had stopped soiling the crate, although he was still inclined to snap and snarl at almost everyone — with the exception of Tess, whom he seemed to regard as a fellow captive in a most unusual jail. If only he could speak, they might enjoy one of those terrific bonding experiences common to prison movies. “The Dog in the Iron Crate,” “The Kiss of the Greyhound,” “The Pre-eclampsia Redemption.”Mrs. Blossom eyed the crate warily. “You know, I met Mr. Blossom because of a dog. Did I ever tell you that?”“No,” Tess said. “I know you married him less than a month after your first date, but you’ve never mentioned the circumstances.”“I was at the bus stop. I was a student at Notre Dame College, and I honestly thought I might become a nun. I didn’t want to be a nun, but boys didn’t like me much. I had a nice figure, and my skin was clear, but I didn’t know how to talk to boys, so I thought, I’ll be a nun, and then people won’t notice I don’t have boyfriend.” She looked embarrassed by this admission. “I was only 17.”“You don’t have to be 17 to think that way,” Tess assured her.“Anyway, I was at the bus stop on Charles Street. And this stray dog tried to cross the street, which was about the busiest street in Baltimore before all the highways came through. I didn’t think; I just ran into the street after it. This one man, he threw on his brakes, but the man behind him didn’t react fast enough, and he hit the man in front of him. And that man was so angry, and he got out of his car and the two drivers started yelling at each other, then yelling at me — ”“And the man who braked, that was Mr. Blossom?”“No, not him either. Mr. Blossom was standing on the other side of the street, waiting for the northbound bus.”“What does that have to do with the dog or the accident?”“I got so flustered, I ran to the other side of the street. This nice young man — I didn’t know his name yet — said to me, ‘Why don’t you just stay here for a minute or two, and let those two gentlemen work out their problem?’ So I did, and the next thing I knew, his bus had come and gone, and my bus had come and gone, and we walked down to Cold Spring, where there used to be an old-fashioned soda fountain, and we talked and we talked and, well, we never really stopped.”“Really? You were married for more than 50 years and you never ran out of things to say to each other?”“Oh, we learned to be quiet with each other too. But it was always a good quiet. We were never cross with each other.”“Never?” That seemed unfathomable to Tess. Crow was the most easy-going man in the world, and he drove her to distraction several times a week. A long marriage, raising children with someone — it simply wasn’t possible not to get angry or irritable at times. “How did you manage that?”“Whenever I got cross with him, I would think about that girl at the bus stop, how unhappy she was, how she thought no one could ever want to take her on a date, much less love her. It may sound silly, but I figured out that being happy made me happier than being unhappy ever did.”Tess replayed these words in her head — Being happy made me happier than being unhappy. The statement was so nonsensical it was profound.“Do you realize,” Tess said, “that your romance with Mr. Blossom was literally a shaggy-dog story?”Mrs. Blossom looked confused. “But that dog wasn’t shaggy at all. He was a terrier, clipped very close.”“I meant — oh, never mind. Thanks for all your help today.”Left alone with her laptop, Tess glanced out the window at Stony Run Park and sighed. Technology had come so far, so quickly, but it wasn’t far enough. Here, with her laptop balanced on an old-fashioned wicker breakfast tray, she could roam the Internet, finding information that once took hours, even days. Here was the assessment and purchase information on Don Epstein’s Blythewood home, and the old addresses on his vehicle registration allowed her to look up his previous house, which was even more expensive, a $4 million house on Gibson Island. But even as her wireless connection allowed her to collapse time and space, it could never provide the serendipity of legwork she had experienced — first as a reporter, roaming the hallways of courthouses and government buildings, then as an investigator. She couldn’t help wondering if this was part of some conspiracy, if this excess of access was a form of sleight of hand. Look over here, look how much you can find. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. H. L. Mencken despised those who never left the newsroom, calling them the castrati of the craft.Then again, Mencken made up the story that Millard Fillmore installed the first bathtub in the White House, so he was a problematic role model.Still, her confinement — lord, how old-fashioned — unnerved her. She trusted Mrs. Blossom, but no one’s eyes saw exactly what she saw. And while her instincts were far from unerring, they were her instincts. If she had visited Don Epstein, she would have a better sense of the man. Tess was quick to recognize a liar even when she couldn’t pinpoint the lie. But she was stuck here, with an Italian greyhound who moaned incessantly and a taskmaster in amniotic fluid. Lately, she and Crow had taken to calling the baby Fifi La Pew, one of those stupid couples’ jokes that come out of nowhere, only to stick. In fact, Crow was becoming enamored with “Fifi” as a possible name. Tess imagined trying to explain this to her parents. “Here’s your granddaughter, Fifi Monaghan.” It was a toss-up which name would make her conventional mother crazier.The baby would be a Monaghan. Crow, who was almost too evolved, had decided that the child, as a girl, should have Tess’s surname. She could not deny that she was happy about this. Of course, her name was her father’s name. They could use her mother’s “maiden” name — Fifi Weinstein had quite the ring to it — but that was a man’s name, too, in the end. To find a true maiden name, you would have to go back to Lilith, Tess supposed. Poor Lilith, the original first wife, doomed to be forgotten.She glanced again at the copy of the marriage license that Mrs. Blossom left behind. Carole Epstein had been Carole Massinger. Tess plugged the latter into Google, finally scoring a hit on a Web site maintained by a freelance photographer. There was Carole Massinger, in a photograph taken at a wedding. The photo seemed a little fake, stagey, as photos in such settings often do, but it was definitely the woman Tess saw through her binoculars. The hair was different, but she wore a dress of celery green, and brandished — did this woman coordinate everything? — a pale green cocktail. Her smile was broad, genuine. She was toasting the beaming groom and his bride, whom the photographer had helpfully identified as Don and Annette Epstein.Next Week: Tess and her researcher pal discover a string of Epstein wives.1164 2008-09-28 In 1999, Bill Clinton signed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a bank deregulation bill that swept away a Depression-era law known as Glass-Steagall. The new law had such a chorus of bipartisan support that it passed the Senate 90-8. One of the few who raised a cry against it was Byron Dorgan. “I think we will look back in 10 years’ time and say we should not have done this, but we did because we forgot the lessons of the past,” said Dorgan, a populist North Dakota Democratic senator, “and that that which is true in the 1930s is true in 2010.” Today, a few years earlier than he predicted, Dorgan looks prescient. The current financial crisis is frequently called the worst since the Great Depression. And Gramm-Leach-Bliley is often cited as a cause, even by some of its onetime supporters.Yet the criticism is often vague, which means that anyone trying to understand the causal chain — how the end of Glass-Steagall led to the end of Lehman Brothers — will have a hard time doing so. To many banking experts, the reason is simple enough: namely, that the law didn’t really do much to create the current crisis. It is a handy scapegoat, since it’s easily the biggest piece of financial deregulation in recent decades. But one act of deregulation, even a big one, and the absence of other, good regulations aren’t the same thing. The nursemaid of the current crisis isn’t so much what Washington did, in other words, as what it didn’t do.The point of Gramm-Leach-Bliley was to tear down the wall, built by Glass-Steagall, separating banks that did risky investing from those that did basic lending. (The mingling of those two helped create a cascade of bank failures during the Depression.) Thus were born Citigroup, Bank of America and J. P. Morgan Chase, behemoths that owned bank branches, bought and sold stocks and shepherded corporate mergers.But what else do those firms have in common today? They weren’t the ones that imploded, at least not first. While hardly unscathed, some of them are emerging as survivors amidst the wreckage. The first fatalities were firms that didn’t change all that much in the wake of Gramm-Leach-Bliley. Until their dying day, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were both classic investment banks.They got in trouble by making a series of risky new bets while Washington did nothing new to stand in the way. “What you’ve got,” said Robert Barbera, a Wall Street economist, “is a system that has gone wildly beyond the safety nets that were in place.” Financial firms chopped bad mortgages into thousands of little pieces and deluded themselves into thinking that the sum of the parts was safer than the whole.1165 2008-09-28 Architecture is, by definition, site-specific. In some buildings, however, the idea of site transcends the physicality of landscape to engage with the environment on multiple levels — emotional, spiritual, conceptual. For example, the guesthouse that the architect Brad Cloepfil designed for a couple of art collectors in upstate New York doesn’t just sit nicely next to a bubbling brook, in its bucolic, sun-dappled setting. With its articulated steel frame and sleek wood paneling, the 1,200-square-foot house plays off its densely wooded hillside setting, flipping back and forth between shelter and openness, protection and enclosure, inside and out.“We spent a lot of time just reading the landscape,” says Cloepfil, who was commissioned to design not just the guesthouse but also the main house and an art barn. The architect walked around all 350 acres of this hilly, winding property, siting the main house (which is still under construction) first and situating the guesthouse just down the road but completely out of view. The land itself was a big inspiration. “The meadows look almost like they’re carved out of the forest,” Cloepfil says, describing the trees as a “field of black lines against the foliage.”The house’s layout is straightforward: an entry foyer opens up into a living-dining space surrounded by windows; a sliver of a kitchen opens off a long hallway lined with floor-to-ceiling cabinets; and there are two bedrooms, each with its own bathroom. Outside is another story: the living spaces are nestled into a folded steel frame that cantilevers out over the sloping site, becoming both open and yet enclosed. Cloepfil created the geometric frame first, then added walls where he wanted to create rooms. Through all of it, the architect points out, “there’s an ambiguity.”This ambiguity informs the entire project; the dual nature of the building is a subtle expression of the pleasures and travails of being a houseguest. (“Welcome! But don’t stay too long.” “Our house is your house, but really it’s our house.”) Even the concrete bridge to the entrance, by the artist Lawrence Weiner, is inscribed with opaque messages. “It was about using a structure to describe a domain,” Cloepfil says about the house. “You feel the tenuousness of being there.”The house’s position on the site underscores it. From the front, it appears solid and anchored to the hillside, further grounded by a series of mirrored pedestals — the owners’ idea — that reflect the surrounding ferns, which were planted by the landscape architect Michael Van Valkenburgh. (The pedestals add a moment of glamour to the otherwise restrained building.) From another angle, however, the house floats precariously out over the hillside, a big and seemingly impossible cantilever.“It wants to be a place that protects you and holds you,” says Cloepfil, who at the same time wanted the house to dissolve visually. He compares it to a treehouse, which gets you close to nature while sheltering you from it. “It was really thrilling to me to be able to do something that pure, strong, clear and simple,” Cloepfil adds.1166 2008-09-28 I know it’s frustrating when you think you’ve met someone promising, but rehabilitating online frauds is not your job, and hoping that you will, through protracted interaction, will only lead to apoplectic seizures.My husband and I are locked in a friendly but serious disagreement with our adult daughter and son-in-law over the following issue: Two couples have a dinner reservation together at 7:30 p.m. The first couple arrives at 7:20. Is it rude, as our children insist, for the first couple to sit before the second one arrives? Is it also rude for the first couple to order drinks while waiting?The kids assert that doing so makes them — the second couple — feel late, even if they arrive on time.Congratulations, Roberta! You have some mothering to do. Your daughter’s logic is a little loopy: If your being early makes her feel late, does she also feel sick when the doctor gives you a clean bill of health?It’s not at all rude for you to be seated or order drinks. Just remind her sweetly that the world does not, in fact, revolve around her. Once she sees that, she’ll be happy to know you’re comfortable. If that fails, remind her of the many hours you were in labor with her, and tell her you now need to rest.My husband is currently unemployed. We’ll soon be going on a small cruise vacation with fewer than 50 passengers, and the question will undoubtedly come up, “So what do you do for a living?” My husband is already embarrassed. I suggested he say he’s a “house husband,” but he is uncomfortable with that. How do you think he should reply? G.S.On my last vacation, I worked for NASA. And on the one before that, I designed a line of cabana clothing. Sometimes it’s fun to try on new personalities when we’re away from home. But I don’t recommend that approach here. Your husband should be relatively happy with the truth of things, first.I sympathize with his self-consciousness. It’s never easy to put our perceived weaknesses on display — much less in front of new people. And it’s probably not much consolation to know that he has lots of company these days.Your husband may truthfully say he’s self-employed. He is, after all — with all the things he does around the house, as well as searching for a new job. Or he could exclaim, “How about that Sarah Palin!” That’s bound to change the subject. I’ve yet to meet the person who doesn’t need to weigh in about her.1167 2008-09-28 Although Jennifer Egan acknowledges the problem of overdiagnosis of bipolar disorder, it is simply not true, in my opinion, that most experts agree that this condition develops before puberty. In fact, many psychiatrists consider the concept of bipolar children to be a serious mistake — one of many in the history of our specialty. There is no blood test or imaging finding that can confirm this diagnosis, which is entirely based on symptoms. Meanwhile, large numbers of children are being prescribed powerful drugs instead of receiving evidence-based psychological treatment for behavioral disorders.Do children become bipolar because of genes passed down from their parents or because their primary caregivers were psychologically unable to provide them with the type of healthy developmental environment so critical in early life? A closer look at the interplay of the suspected genetic and environmental causes would have been appreciated.As the parent of a child who, despite having wild, aggressive behaviors since the age of 7, was not diagnosed as bipolar unitl she turned 14, I have been tossed, crushed, agitated and broiled throughout my daughter’s life. I appreciated the simple descriptive narrative of Egan’s story. One of the hardships of being a parent of any special-needs child is that what goes on in the home is simply not imaginable to others. One is so isolated.We poorer families have a much harder time navigating the mental-health system. Money certainly would allow better access to quality services like treatment, respite and resources for not only the child but also for the members of the household who are living with this situation.My heart ached for the parents and children in Jennifer Egan’s story. By these accounts, my 17-year-old child would likely be misdiagnosed as bipolar today. His early years of anger, raging and often shocking, violent behavior gave way to a spirited, strong, confident young man who was appropriately treated for severe A.D.H.D. from age 5. He, too, went off to boarding school at age 11. It was the right choice for him (and the brother he tormented).Sometimes what appears a selfish act of self-preservation is in fact the most unselfish of acts we can do for our children. He now lives at home again and is an academically and socially successful student applying to colleges. He no longer has trouble getting play dates.I am a 53-year-old former bipolar kid. As a child, I always knew I was different from other children. Much later in life, I received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and understood my past in perfect perspective.Once the disease is diagnosed, the negative traits of it can be minimized while the strengths associated with the condition may be maximized. My own child and adult experiences have given me a remarkable ability to narrow focus and do very well in creative and business endeavors. I am proud of who I am.1168 2008-09-28 TOLCISS--Minette, died Friday, September 26, 2008.

He said colleges and universities needed to do much more research into how well the tests predict success at their individual institutions.Test prep can work, Mr. Fitzsimmons said, but he noted — and the audience applauded — that there was a difference between test prep that consists of studying on your own and $400-an-hour one-on-one tutoring that starts in the seventh grade.“There is no evidence on what the latter test prep does,” he said. “We know it’s an advantage, but we don’t have enough information.”There has been longstanding debate and concern about the impact of standardized testing on socioeconomically disadvantaged students, and the ballroom erupted in applause when Mr. Fitzsimmons called for an end to the use of “cut scores” to determine who qualifies for National Merit and other scholarships. The practice means that one student is rewarded while excluding another whose SAT score may be only a single point lower, Mr. Fitzsimmons said.What that single point differential fails to take into account, he said, is the context: The two students may have “lived entirely different lives, had entirely different educational opportunities and entirely different access to test prep.”The audience also applauded Mr. Fitzsimmons’s call for U.S. News & World Report to stop using SAT scores as part of its college rankings.“At Harvard we get terrific students, and we turn out terrific students later on,” Mr. Fitzsimmons said. “Is that due to Harvard or is that due to the students to begin with? Who knows? There are fabulous institutions with relatively low test-score averages that are absolutely first rate, that take students from point A to point Z.”He continued, “Educational quality has nothing to do, or very little to do, with actual average SAT scores.”Mr. Fitzsimmons called on colleges and universities to be more transparent about how they use standardized admissions scores, and more collaborative in terms of sharing research on the scores. He suggested that the National Association for College Admission Counseling assume more of a “watchdog role,” fighting against the misuse of standardized test scores. He said that what may be more helpful going forward are more tests based on high-school curriculum.Many college admissions officials who were in the audience praised the study.Jeffrey Brenzel, the dean of admissions at Yale, said the report raised key questions for every college and university: “Are you using the tests in a responsible manner and in the way they were intended? Is your use of the test relevant to your particular institution’s mission? Are there alternatives?”The comment session that followed was lively, with audience members praising the study group’s efforts, but also underscoring what they viewed as the deficiencies of standardized admissions tests.A high school counselor from Chicago talked at length about the “huge economic disparities” that play out in standardized admission testing. She pointed out that while fee waivers are available, many low-income students do not know how the waivers work. Nor, she said, do low-income students know about the College Board’s new “score choice,” which will begin in the spring, and will allow students who take the SAT multiple times to choose which combined scores to submit to colleges, without the colleges’ knowing how many times they have taken the test.“There are kids who walk into the test who don’t have calculators,” she said. “Forget about things we can’t control — like having to take two buses to the test, and it’s cold. I’ve got kids in the Chicago projects who go to some free test prep place, and their scores might go up a point.”An audience member asked Mr. Fitzsimmons and the other college admissions officials on stage if any of them had changed their minds about the SAT and decided to go test-optional as a result of their participation in the study.Steve Syverson, the dean of admissions at Lawrence University in Wisconsin, said dryly, “We’re test optional, and we weren’t persuaded to change.”One by one, the other admissions officers gave variations of the same answer: We’re concerned about the inequities and possible misuses of the test. We’re going to keep studying it and talking about it, but the tests are useful for us, and we’re not going test-optional.Only Jeff Rickey, the dean of admissions at Earlham College in Indiana, gave an answer that implied that change might be possible in his office. The report had given renewed energy to Earlham’s planned comprehensive review of the use of standardized admissions tests, he said. “Stay tuned,” he told the audience. “A year from now we’ll be able to inform you as to whether we’re going test-optional or not.”1207 2008-09-29 Even so, lawmakers on all sides said the bill had been significantly improved from the Bush administration’s original proposal.The final version of the bill included a deal-sealing plan for eventually recouping losses; if the Treasury program to purchase and resell troubled mortgage-backed securities has lost money after five years, the president must submit a plan to Congress to recover those losses from the financial industry. Presumably that plan would involve new fees or taxes, perhaps on securities transactions.“This is a major, major change,” Speaker said on Sunday evening as she declared that negotiations were over and that a House vote was planned for Monday, with Senate action to follow.The deal would also restrict gold-plated farewells for executives of companies that sell devalued assets to the Treasury Department.President Bush called the measure “a very good bill” and praised Congressional leaders. “This plan sends a strong signal to markets around the world that the is serious about restoring confidence and stability to our financial system,” Mr. Bush said in a statement. “Without this , the costs to the American economy could be disastrous.”House Republicans had threatened to scuttle the deal, and proposed a vastly different approach that would have focused on insuring troubled debt rather than buying it. In the end, the insurance proposal was included on top of the purchasing power, but there is no requirement that the Treasury secretary use it, leaving them short of that goal.It is virtually impossible to know the ultimate cost of the rescue plan to taxpayers, but Congressional leaders stressed that it would likely be far less than $700 billion. Because the Treasury will buy assets with the potential to resell them at a higher price, the government might even turn a profit.That provision, pushed by House Democrats, was the last to be agreed to in a high-level series of talks that had top lawmakers and White House economic advisers hustling between offices just off the Capitol Rotunda until midnight on Saturday, scrambling to strike an agreement before Asian markets opened Sunday night.The bill calls for disbursing the money in parts, starting with $250 billion followed by $100 billion at the discretion of the president. The Treasury can request the remaining $350 billion at any time, and Congress must act to deny it if it disapproves.The agreement on a bailout plan was greeted with subdued optimism in early Asian trading on Monday. But shares sank by late Monday morning on renewed worries about the credit crisis, with a decision by to raise lending rates by 0.5 percent in triggering a drop of 2 percent in the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong and 0.9 percent in the Kospi Index in .The stock market in is closed on Monday as Typhoon Jangmi passes over .The dollar also strengthened in and was worth 106.485 yen by midmorning on Monday after trading at 106.01 late Friday in New York. The euro weakened to $1.4506 on Monday from $1.4614 in late New York trading on Friday.Ms. Pelosi, Treasury Secretary and others taking part in the talks announced that they had clinched a tentative deal at 12:30 a.m. Sunday, exhausted and a little giddy after more than seven hours of sparring. There were several tense moments, none more so than when Mr. Paulson, a critical player, suddenly seemed short of breath and possibly ill. He was tired, but fine.Trying to bring around colleagues who remained uncertain of the plan, its architects sounded the alarm about the potential consequences of doing nothing. Senator of , the senior Republican on the Budget Committee and the lead Senate negotiator, raised the prospect of an economic catastrophe.“If we don’t pass it, we shouldn’t be a Congress,” Mr. Gregg said.Both major presidential candidates, Senator of , the Republican nominee, and Senator , the Democratic candidate, gave guarded endorsements of the bailout plan. Both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama had dipped into the negotiations during a contentious White House meeting on Thursday.On Sunday evening, both parties convened closed-door sessions in the House to review the plan, and conservative House Republicans remained a potential impediment.But the party leadership was circulating information aimed at refuting some of the main criticisms of the bailout, indicating they were poised to support it. “I am encouraging every member of our conference whose conscience will allow them to support this bill,” said Representative of , the Republican leader.A series of business-oriented trade associations with influence with Republicans also began weighing in on behalf of the plan.The United States Chamber of Commerce issued a statement on Sunday night that said it “believes the legislation contains the necessary elements to successfully remove the uncertainty and stem the turmoil that has plagued financial markets in recent weeks.”Members of the conservative rank and file remained unconvinced.“While it creates a gimmicky $700 billion installment plan, attempts to improve transparency, and has new provisions cloaked as taxpayer protections, its net effect is still a huge bailout of the financial sector that will snuff out the free market system,” said Representative Connie Mack, Republican of .Some Democrats bristled that they were now being called on to do the financial bidding of an administration they had viewed as previously uncooperative in dealing with executives who had performed irresponsibly or worse.“Financial crimes have been committed,” said Representative Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio. “Now Congress is being asked to bail out the culprits.”Throughout Sunday, small groups of lawmakers could be found around the Capitol exchanging their views on the plan. Some said they were willing to take a political risk and back it.One, Representative Jim Marshall, a Democrat facing a re-election contest, told colleagues in a private meeting that he would vote for the measure to bolster the economy. “I am willing to give up my seat over this,” Mr. Marshall said, according to another person who was there.The architects of the plan said they realized they were calling on Congress to cast a tough vote since lawmakers might not get credit for averting a financial crisis since some constituents will not believe one was looming.“Avoiding a catastrophe won’t be recognized,” said Senator , Democrat of and chairman of the Senate banking committee. “This economy is not going to have a blossoming on Wednesday.”But he and others said the support from the two presidential contenders, Senators McCain and Obama, should provide some comfort to nervous lawmakers.While the House was planning to act Monday, the Senate schedule was uncertain. A vote might not occur until Wednesday or later because of the Jewish holidays and possible procedural obstacles. But Senate vote-counters were confident they could get the needed support.One of the more contentious issues was how to limit the pay of executives whose firms seek government aid, a top priority for Democrats and even some Republican lawmakers. But it was a concern for Mr. Paulson, who worried about discouraging firms from participating in the rescue plan, which seeks to convince companies to sell potentially valuable assets to the government at relatively bargain prices.In the end, they settled on different rules for different companies depending on how they participate in the bailout. Firms that sell distressed debt directly to the government will be subject to tougher pay limits, including a mechanism to recover any bonuses or other pay based on corporate earnings that turn out to be inaccurate or fraudulent, and a ban on so-called “golden parachute” severance packages as long as the government has a stake in the firm.Companies that participate in auctions, or other market-making mechanisms, and sell more than $300 million in troubled financial instruments to the government, will be barred from making any new employment contract with a senior executive that provides a golden parachute in the event of “involuntary termination, bankruptcy filing, insolvency or receivership.”While some critics said the limits did not go far enough, lawmakers described the provision as a historic first step by Congress to limit exorbitant pay of corporate titans. “I think we wrote it as tight as we can get it in here,” Mr. Dodd said.Congressional staff from both parties and Treasury worked through Friday night and into the predawn, before heading home for some sleep. They resumed work late Saturday morning, and Mr. Paulson arrived at the Capitol to join top lawmakers in Ms. Pelosi’s suite for a meeting at 3 p.m. At least a dozen major differences remained.The meeting was initially described as a gathering of the five chief negotiators, Mr. Paulson, and a Democrat and Republican each from the House and Senate. But additional Democrats piled into the talks, angering Republicans who accused Democrats of packing the sessions.For a brief, nerve-fraying moment at the outset, one administration participant said, Mr. Paulson surveyed the circus-like scene and wondered if everyone was committed to reaching a deal. It was quickly clear that they were — but not before so much information starting leaking out that the BlackBerrys of staff members were confiscated and collected in a trash bin.At one point, Senator , Democrat of New York, was thumping the table, demanding to release the $700 billion in installments. At another point, Senator , Democrat of , was shouting at Mr. Paulson, accusing him of trying to undermine the limits on pay for executives.1208 2008-09-29 Aides and political allies to both men agreed Sunday that perhaps no episode thus far in the campaign better demonstrated how they would approach managing problems as president. Their instincts, temperaments, and leadership traits were in the spotlight in Washington, as well as their limitations and foibles — characteristics that also showed through stylistically in Friday night’s debate.Both candidates said on Sunday that they were inclined to vote for the bailout even though they were not completely happy with it. McCain advisers also began making the case that Mr. McCain had emerged as an important ally for House Republicans, while Mr. Obama criticized Mr. McCain for initially showing a “Katrina-like response” to the economic crisis when he said that “the fundamentals of the economy are strong.”As Mr. McCain appeared as a man in motion last week, Mr. Obama’s cautious side was on clear display. He loathes gambits as too unpredictable, which is why, aides say, he would have never suspended his presidential campaign like Mr. McCain did on Wednesday to join in the bailout negotiations in Washington.Mr. McCain, meanwhile, thrives in the fray, which accounts for his lead role in the Gang of 14 talks on judicial nominations and in legislative wrangling over campaign finance reform and immigration. Yet Republicans acknowledge that no McCain imprint appears to be on the final bailout package moving through Congress, and some of them were trying Sunday to put the best face on his role by casting him as a man of action.“By halting his campaign, he magnified just how important this bailout was to the nation, and showed that he would approach a crisis by locking everyone in a room and keeping them there until they had a solution,” said Anthony V. Carbonetti, a Republican political adviser to former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York.“And with Obama, you saw a kind of laissez-faire attitude — ‘you guys know it’s important, deal with it,’ ” Mr. Carbonetti added.Yet many Democrats — even some who have been critical of Mr. Obama in the past — said they were impressed with his performance over the last week, and described Mr. McCain as substituting theatrics for leadership. Mr. Obama consulted with Bush administration officials and Congressional Democrats, emphasized his priorities for the bailout, and told both sides that he was willing to do whatever would be most helpful to reach a bipartisan bailout agreement.“Obama’s approach to this has been very Obama — measured, cool and thoughtful, which I hope is what the country wants more than theatrical anger,” said Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat who had supported Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s presidential candidacy.“The more yelling and screaming you do, you get accused of grandstanding,” Mr. Rendell said. “Personally, I thought McCain looked bizarre when he came out of the box saying he wanted to fire the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.”Indeed, Mr. McCain’s early call to replace Christopher Cox, the S.E.C. chairman, drew scathing reviews from some conservatives as brash and wrong-headed. He drew fire on Wednesday from one high-profile friend, David Letterman, for canceling a guest spot on Mr. Letterman’s show that night because he had to rush to Washington — even though Mr. McCain stayed in New York until Thursday for other media and public events.If Mr. McCain’s moves were attention-grabbing, they also invited mockery: On “Saturday Night Live” this weekend, an actor portraying Mr. McCain proposed to Mr. Obama that they both suspend their campaigns and instead hold a series of pie-eating contests instead of debates.“It’s what, in my campaign, we call a stunt or a gimmick — something to shake up the race,” the McCain character said.Yet for Mr. McCain, a theatrical move in the short term has often proved to be the preferable strategy, even if the likely results were far from clear.He surprised many in August by choosing Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate — a move that delighted conservatives at the Republican convention the next week but has raised concerns more recently as Ms. Palin has struggled to explain basic foreign policy views. Earlier that month, too, Mr. McCain sent envoys to Georgia to examine that nation’s conflict with Russia — a grand act that appeared to do nothing to affect the military action except to give Mr. McCain a platform on it.Mr. McCain’s pronouncements on Georgia that week were in sharp contrast to Mr. Obama’s choice to monitor the Georgian-Russian hostilities from his Hawaiian vacation spot. Neither Democrats nor Obama aides expressed concern that Mr. Obama appeared remote from the conflict; they simply said there was little concrete he could do to make a difference.Likewise, in their debate on Friday night, Mr. Obama chose at several points to express agreement with Mr. McCain on national security threats overseas, instead of counterpunching.Mr. Obama does not tend to take fiery or partisan swipes just for the sake of them. Yet it is unclear if this more serene style will ultimately excite or win over voters in swing states.Voters list the economy as a priority, and Mr. Obama’s placid public approach may not mesh with the anger that many of them feel. But Democrats say that in the long run, Mr. Obama’s approach will appear as an appealing alternative to President Bush and his choice as a successor, Mr. McCain.“After eight years of Bush’s cavalier attitude toward serious and complex problems, people are in the market for a more thoughtful approach,” said Doug Hattaway, a Democratic communications consultant who was a spokesman on Senator Clinton’s campaign. “That’s usually dangerous for a politician trying to get elected in a ‘just do it’ culture. But the time seems to be right for Obama’s more cerebral style.”1209 2008-09-29 And McCain can note that the financial crisis isn’t going to be solved by any one piece of legislation. There are serious economists, for example, who think we could be on the verge of a huge bank run. Congress may have to act to authorize the F.D.I.C. to provide far greater deposit insurance, and the secretary of the Treasury to protect money market funds. McCain can call for Congress to stand ready to pass such legislation. He can say more generally that in the tough times ahead, we’ll need a tough president willing to make tough decisions.With respect to his campaign, McCain needs to liberate his running mate from the former Bush aides brought in to handle her — aides who seem to have succeeded in importing to the Palin campaign the trademark defensive crouch of the Bush White House. McCain picked in part because she’s a talented politician and communicator. He needs to free her to use her political talents and to communicate in her own voice.I’m told McCain recently expressed unhappiness with his staff’s handling of Palin. On Sunday he dispatched his top aides and to join Palin in . They’re supposed to liberate Palin to go on the offensive as a combative conservative in the vice- on Thursday.That debate is important. McCain took a risk in choosing Palin. If she does poorly, it will reflect badly on his judgment. If she does well, it will be a shot in the arm for his campaign.In the debate, Palin has to dispatch quickly any queries about herself, and confidently assert that of course she’s qualified to be vice president. She should spend her time making the case for McCain and, more important, the case against Obama. As one shrewd McCain supporter told me, “Every minute she spends not telling the American people something that makes them less well disposed to Obama is a minute wasted.”The core case against Obama is pretty simple: he’s too liberal. A few months ago I asked one of McCain’s aides what aspect of Obama’s liberalism they thought they could most effectively exploit. He looked at me as if I were a simpleton, and patiently explained that talking about “conservatism” and “liberalism” was so old-fashioned.Maybe. But the fact is the only Democrats to win the presidency in the past 40 years — and — distanced themselves from liberal orthodoxy. Obama is, by contrast, a garden-variety liberal. He also has radical associates in his past.The most famous of these is the Rev. , and I wonder if Obama may have inadvertently set the stage for the McCain team to reintroduce him to the American public. On Saturday, Obama criticized McCain for never using in the debate Friday night the words “middle class.” The Obama campaign even released an advertisement trumpeting McCain’s omission.The McCain campaign might consider responding by calling attention to Chapter 14 of Obama’s eloquent memoir, “Dreams From My Father.” There Obama quotes from the brochure of Reverend Wright’s church — a passage entitled “A Disavowal of the Pursuit of Middleclassness.”So when Biden goes on about the middle class on Thursday, Palin might ask Biden when Obama flip-flopped on Middleclassness.1210 2008-09-29 Scott Schoeneweis wrapped his hands around the sides of his Mets locker, seemingly trying to prevent himself from stumbling. He removed one hand to rub his eyes, kicked away a shoe and then sniffled. An hour after the Mets’ season ended disastrously, Schoeneweis, with tousled hair and red-rimmed eyes, looked as if he had not slept in three days.If there was a symbol of why the Mets failed to make the playoffs for the second straight season, it was their abominable bullpen. Manager Jerry Manuel tried to make some magic out of mediocrity, and it did not work. On the final day of the season, Schoeneweis was no pitching magician and the Marlins silenced the Mets, 4-2, at Shea Stadium.It was another brutal ending as another playoff berth eluded the Mets in the fleeting hours. It really ended with two jolts. Schoeneweis permitted a tie-breaking home run to Wes Helms in the eighth inning and Luis Ayala followed that by allowing a homer to Dan Uggla. Two homers off two relievers closed Shea forever.“I am still kind of in shock,” Schoeneweis said.As shocked as Schoeneweis was, it was not shocking that the Mets’ greatest weakness eventually doomed them. The bullpen was not alone in faltering. Other than Carlos Beltrán’s two-run homer, the Mets had three hits off five Florida pitchers who knew they were going home after the game. That type of production made sure the Mets went home, too.But, if Schoeneweis and Ayala did not disintegrate, maybe the Mets could have rallied. Maybe the Mets could have added one more meaningful run. Instead, Oliver Pérez pitched effectively into the sixth on three days’ rest, Joe Smith and Brian Stokes carried the game into the eighth and then the bullpen fell apart for the last time in 2008.When Jeff Wilpon, the Mets’ chief operating officer, was asked if it was more frustrating to lose because of a known Achilles’ heel, he said, “The whole thing’s frustrating.”1211 2008-09-29 “It may work, and it could get us through the election in November,” he said.But Mr. Johnson, a former senior researcher at the International Monetary Fund, said further steps might well be needed, with much work remaining for the next administration.The list, he said, includes overseeing the workings of the rescue plan, helping to guide the contraction and recapitalization of the banking industry, assisting homeowners who face mortgage defaults, and in general shaping policy for a nation that will be less accustomed to easy credit and overspending.“Managing this issue is going to dominate the agenda of the next president for two years,” Mr. Johnson said.Besides buying troubled mortgage securities, the main features of the bailout package include restraints on executive pay for companies that sell off weak assets; a shareholder stake for the government in firms that sell large amounts of distressed securities to the government; and a requirement that the government take more aggressive steps to prevent home foreclosures.The eventual price tag for the bailout is uncertain. It all depends on the price that the government pays for the troubled securities it buys from banks, and the price the government receives when it eventually sells them, years later.To many, the weekend agreement on a plan is cause for a qualified sense of relief, even for many conservative policy makers and economists, despite qualms that it may be too generous to Wall Street bankers, too weak for struggling homeowners and too costly for taxpayers.“By far, the most important way to help homeowners and taxpayers is avoid a serious economic recession,” said Robert E. Hall, an economist and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative research group at Stanford.An abrupt downturn, Mr. Hall estimated, would reduce economic activity and opportunity in the United States by 5 percent to 10 percent in terms of production of goods and services, job creation and personal income. That total cost, he noted, would certainly exceed $1 trillion.“A recession costs way more than $700 billion,” Mr. Hall said.There was no assurance that the bailout plan would work as intended to ease financial turmoil and economic uncertainty.Indeed, the reckoning in the finance industry has a long way to go, said Nouriel Roubini, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University.The $350 billion to $400 billion in bad credit reported by the banks so far could eventually exceed $1.5 trillion, he estimated, as banks are forced to write off more bad loans, not only on more housing-related debt, but also for corporate lending, consumer loans, credit cards and student loans.The rescue package, if successful, would make the recognition of losses and the inevitable winnowing of the banking system more an orderly retreat than a collapse. Yet that pruning of the banking industry must take place, economists say, and it is the government’s role to move it along instead of coddling the banks if the financial system is going to return to health.Japan’s experience in the 1990s is a cautionary example of the peril of propping up banks after a real estate boom ends. The Japanese government helped keep many troubled banks afloat, hoping to avoid the pain of bank failures, only to extend the economic downturn as consumer spending and job growth fell.The Japanese slump continued for many years, ending only a few years ago, a stretch of economic stagnation known as Japan’s lost decade.“The lesson from Japan is that tough love for the banks is what’s needed,” said Kenneth Rogoff, an economist at Harvard. “In the current crisis, you do want to get rid of the bad assets from the banks, to get markets working again. But the key is going to be in the details of how the bailout works. You don’t want it to be a subsidy in disguise that keeps insolvent banks alive. That would just prolong the economic pain.”History’s most sobering example, though, is the Great Depression. In that case, the government waited too long to do anything to aid the battered banks, and the economy cracked.The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, a former professor at Princeton, has studied Japan’s policy missteps and is also an expert on the Depression. “The lesson of the Depression, failing to act soon enough, very much underlies the urgency behind the government’s proposal,” Mr. Rogoff said.Sweden in the early 1990s took a middle path, swiftly taking over many of its troubled banks. The American bailout plan, economists say, takes a page from the Swedish example by making the government a shareholder in banks participating in the program. But, they add, the American banking system is so much larger and diverse than Sweden’s that the parallels are limited.The curbs on executive pay were an essential ingredient to gain political support for the United States rescue plan, blunting the criticism that a bailout would protect the suspect gains of wealthy Wall Street executives. For companies making substantial use of the program, the government would limit the tax deductibility of executive pay to $500,000, prohibit “golden parachute” payments to departing executives, and allow the recovery by the financial institution of bonuses from gains that later prove to have been based on false or inaccurate information.Earlier legislative efforts to curb executive pay have had little lasting effect, corporate governance experts say. In the early 1990s, curbs on the tax deductibility of executive salaries, they say, were sidestepped and even contributed to the generous grants of stock options, which helped drive executive pay to new heights.The provision to recover hefty bonus payments is problematic, the experts say. To make a recovery, they say, the government would have to show an executive had engaged in misconduct, not just poor judgment.Yet by taking such action, combined with the provision to become a big shareholder in companies that take part in the bailout, the government moves could well have an impact on executive pay.“Even if these steps prove to be largely symbolic, it will influence practices,” said Charles Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware. “The government has made a clear statement, and the boards of these financial companies will be under pressure to rein in compensation.”The bailout effort, economists say, underlines the pivotal role of the financial industry in the economy and the need for proportionate regulation.When the Internet dot-com bubble burst at the start of the decade, investors suffered, employment dropped, companies went out of business and America slipped into a brief recession. But there were no calls, or need, for government rescue plans for the technology industry.“Finance is so central and peculiar, so essential, and yet it carries a death threat for the economy,” said Jagdish Bhagwati, a professor of economics at Columbia. “What we’ve seen, once again, is that finance is a very powerful instrument, but one that needs to be intensively watched.”1212 2008-09-29 Louis Montuori, one of the market’s current owners and the son of the man who took it over in the 1960s, has been explaining, sometimes to 20 or 30 concerned customers a day, why he has not had the cash flow necessary to fully stock the store. To start, he has suffered from a huge uptick in competition, from Citarella, which opened one block south in 2003; Whole Foods, which opened in Union Square in 2005; and from Trader Joe’s, which opened there in 2006.So it’s a story of the big-fish markets eating the little-fish market. It’s also a story about real estate, and how the West Village has changed. “A lot of these new families, with all this money, they don’t cook,” said Mr. Montuori. “People don’t cook.” And if they do, they already know how to shop at Whole Foods — they don’t have the decades of history with Jefferson Market that their predecessors in the neighborhood had.And it’s a story, Mr. Montuori will acknowledge, of some bad management choices, like letting the staff get too big, and not wanting to let anyone go. “We were running it like a mom-and-pop when we shouldn’t have been,” Mr. Montuori said.For a long time, Jefferson Market felt like a throwback to another era, the kind of place where a kindly, rosy-cheeked butcher asked after your kids and taught you how to cook a roast. “I used to place big orders, when I threw a lot of dinner parties,” said Claudette Fink, who’s lived on 12th Street since 1973. “But I could also call at 6 o’clock and say ‘Roger, Roger, Roger, I love you, you know what I need? Just a bit of parsley.’ And he’d say, ‘It’s out the door as we speak, Mrs. Fink.’ It was like living in a small village in Tuscany.”It is still the kind of mom-and-pop where the family runs the place — not from afar, but up close and personal. When business was hopping, Mr. Montuori himself used to work behind the butcher counter (his father, legendary for his beef and poultry, trained him in the meat business). His uncle, Angelo Montuori, 82, still manages the inventory. And another uncle, Anthony Montuori, who’s 87, still rises at 4:30 a.m. to come to the store from his home in New Jersey and deliver groceries, sometimes to customers he’s been serving for 30 or 40 years. When there is nothing to deliver, he keeps busy squeezing oranges for juice.“He never learned to read or write,” Angelo said of Anthony. “He’s crazy about the store.”Back when the store opened (right across the street), it took its name from the original, 19th-century Jefferson Market, a cluster of individual proprietors selling ice, meat, dairy and vegetables that had been named for the country’s third president.Now the store is one of the last of its kind in New York, a market with name recognition that isn’t a chain, a place whose location is grounded in its specific history, not in a focus group or a financial analysis of the block’s demographic and median income. It’s not that the economy has not had an impact on business. That’s part of it, Mr. Montuori said. Food costs have jumped, but he cannot raise his prices any more. And people are ordering less. “We used to get consistent orders for $200 rib roasts, for parties,” he said. “Now that’s very rare. That’s just a holiday thing.”Mr. Montuori hasn’t given up hope of reviving the store, but he knows it will take an infusion of cash, which he has started actively seeking. There has been some interest, he was relieved to report, but until a deal is sealed, he’ll be waiting to see how the times treat him.“I picked the worst week in history,” he said, “to be looking for an investor.”1213 2008-09-29 WASHINGTON — A Justice Department investigation offers a blistering critique of the political motivations that led to the firings of a group of United States attorneys in late 2006 but stops short of recommending criminal charges against former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales or others in the affair, officials said.The Justice Department’s inspector general and its Office of Professional Responsibility have been investigating the firings since last year, trying to determine who in the Bush administration ordered the firings, whether the dismissals were intended to thwart investigations and whether anyone had broken the law in carrying out the firings or in testifying about them.Officials with the department refused to discuss the report in advance of its scheduled release on Monday, though it has been the subject of Web reports since Friday. A lawyer for Mr. Gonzales declined to comment.Mr. Gonzales, who resigned last year after coming under criticism because of the firings, has been the main focus of interest, in part because several members of Congress charged that he may have perjured himself in his testimony through his memory lapses and misstatements about the firings.But officials with knowledge of the inspector general’s investigation and defense lawyers who have been involved in it said they did not expect that the investigation would recommend that criminal charges be pursued at this point against Mr. Gonzales or other officials. The report was expected to recommend that investigators continue to pursue some elements of the case, meaning that the legal questions around Mr. Gonzales would continue.1214 2008-09-29 The Buffett Cup, played in Louisville, Ky., two weeks ago, was primarily a social occasion. Yes, the European and American players were trying to win, but the camaraderie at the table was much more apparent than it is in other international championships.The first round saw Tor Helness and Jan Petter Svendsen from Norway playing against David Berkowitz and Alan Sontag of the United States. Helness usually partners Geir Helgemo, who is a tad portly. Berkowitz looked at Svendsen and said, “Geir’s lost a little weight.”The joviality continued during the 11 boards, the diagramed deal being the fifth.Sontag (North) opened one heart, Berkowitz (South) responded one spade, and North raised to two spades, which, despite the lack of a fourth spade, is a better rebid than one no-trump without a minor-suit stopper.Against two spades, Helness led a trump. This was good news for declarer because it strongly suggested that the trumps were 3-3. With long or short trumps, the defense will usually try to make declarer ruff something, reducing his trump length to where it is the same as or shorter than one of the defenders.Declarer took East’s jack with his king and played a club, West going in with his king and leading another trump, ducked to East’s queen. East returned his last spade to dummy’s ace. West captured dummy’s club jack with his ace and shifted to the heart seven, leading third-highest from an even number of cards and lowest from an odd number.1215 2008-09-29 “The most important thing is to see money markets normalize,” said Mr. Zandi, who has advised the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. “If banks start lending to each other that would be a very positive sign and that would be key.”Many borrowers are being penalized in the bond markets, if they can borrow money at all. Credit spreads — the premium investors demand to lend money to everybody but the federal government — need to fall, said Jerry Webman, chief economist and senior investment officer for OppenheimerFunds. Last week, in a rare reversal that occurs only in times of extreme stress in the credit markets, tax-free municipal bonds were yielding more than Treasuries, which are not tax exempt.Many municipal and corporate borrowers were unable to borrow money in the credit markets last week. Mr. Webman said the economy could suffer if those tight conditions persist.“Credit is man’s confidence in man,” Mr. Webman said. “That confidence in the financial system needs to increase.”Analysts said the market would be watching closely how the Treasury Department structured its planned purchases of troubled assets from financial firms. The government has suggested it might use auctions to establish prices for the securities and loans it plans to acquire. Mr. Zandi said the Treasury should disclose more details in the next several weeks and conduct its first auctions soon after the presidential elections.Once investors have a better sense of what the troubled assets are worth, they will become more willing to invest in ailing financial firms that have not been able to raise capital because analysts fear they have not fully disclosed the quality of their assets.“We need to get clarity with respects to which institutions need to write down their assets and which institutions are well-capitalized,” Mr. Zandi said. “That would provide solace to investors who would then provide capital to the system.”Furthermore, once financial firms have raised more capital, a crucial test will be whether they plow that new money back into the market through loans and investments in businesses, said Mr. Webman. If banks remain fearful and hoard cash instead, as they have done in recent months, the rescue effort will only have a modest impact on the economy and financial system.“We need more capital coming into the market and actual investor money coming through the banks into economic activity,” Mr. Webman said. “That’s what I would really like to see happen.”But even if the government intervention is successful, economists and investors said it would not restore the days of easy credit that prevailed during the recent housing boom. Mortgage rates should come down, but they are unlikely to return to the levels seen in 2003 and 2004. Also banks are unlikely to make many adjustable-rate loans without verifying the incomes and assets of borrowers.Furthermore, the rescue might not forestall a recession, said G. David MacEwen, chief investment officer for the bond department at American Century Investments. Though he thinks the rescue efforts will help the economy, Mr. MacEwen expects bankruptcies to spread, home prices to fall and unemployment to rise.“Having this plan contains the damage to some extent,” Mr. MacEwen said. But, he added, “I think we are going to see slowing in economic activity. This is like steering a battleship, you make course adjustment but they take time to take effect.”1216 2008-09-29 Now, the heady returns of the industry’s glory days are over, at least for now. This is shaping up to be the industry’s worst year on record, with the average fund down nearly 10 percent so far, according to Hedge Fund Research. Famous traders like Steven A. Cohen, who runs SAC Capital Advisors, are losing money, and even Kenneth C. Griffin, the head of Citadel Investment Group, is down in one of his funds.And they are the lucky ones. A growing number of hedge funds are closing down. About 350 were liquidated in the first half of the year. While hedge funds come and go all the time, if the trend continues, the number of closures would be up 24 percent this year from 2007.Many funds are bracing for trouble. The industry has set aside $600 billion in cash, according to Citigroup analysts, partly because of the uncertainty hanging over the markets but also because of possible redemptions. If redemptions do pour in, hedge funds can freeze the process by not paying investors for a certain period of time, slowing the pace of withdrawals.One little-known hedge fund barometer is pointing to trouble, however. The alphabet soup of complex investments that Wall Street created in recent years — R.M.B.S.’s, C.D.O.’s and the like — includes C.F.O.’s, short for collateralized fund obligations. Virtually unknown outside the industry, these investments are the hedge fund equivalent of mortgage-backed securities: securities backed by hedge funds.But last week, credit ratings agencies warned that they might lower the ratings of several C.F.O.’s, in part because of the concern that investors would withdraw money from the funds backing the investments. Standard & Poor’s downgraded parts of nine C.F.O. deals, Fitch placed five on a negative rating watch, and Moody’s put one on a downgrade review.“The concern is over the redemptions that are happening,” said Jenny Story, an analyst with Fitch Ratings. “The gates are being closed.”While few in number, C.F.O.’s represent a broad swath of the industry. The vehicles were created by funds of funds, which invest in hedge funds. Each C.F.O. includes stakes in dozens and sometimes hundreds of hedge funds with a variety of investment strategies.Coast Asset Management, a $5.6 billion fund of funds in Santa Monica, Calif., created three C.F.O.’s in the last few years. The three vehicles raised a total of $1.85 billion, according to Dealogic, and they have a seven-year lock-up on the money. It was that lock-up that appealed to David E. Smith, the firm’s chief executive, who ran into trouble borrowing in 1998, after the collapse of the giant hedge fund Long Term Capital Management.Coast executives said they were not particularly concerned about the C.F.O.’s, because they had not seen many hedge funds putting limits on redemptions, or “closing the gates,” as the industry calls it.“It’s clearly been a very tough year for investors in general,” Mr. Smith said. “But I think hedge funds have done a good job of navigating very tough markets and don’t get the type of recognition that they should.”Two of the C.F.O.’s put on watch or downgraded by the ratings agencies are run by two units of the British hedge fund Man Group. One is run by Glenwood Capital in Chicago, which saw its multi-strategy fund lose more than 4 percent through July, according to an investor. A spokesman for the funds declined to comment.Returns are not in yet for September, but hedge fund managers say this month is even worse than the summer. Some funds were hurt by new rules from the Securities and Exchange Commission on short-selling, a tactic for betting against stock prices. The commission made it more difficult to short all stocks and temporarily banned the strategy in more than 800 financial stocks. In particular, this hurt convertible-bond managers, who often buy bonds that can be converted into shares and short the underlying stocks.The short-selling ban lasts until Thursday evening, but it is widely expected to be extended.John P. Rigas, the chief executive of Sciens Capital Management, knows firsthand how difficult it can be to get money out of troubled hedge funds. He spotted problems at Amaranth Advisors a year before that fund collapsed because of wrong-way bets in the energy markets, but it took him eight months to retrieve all of his fund of funds’ investment. Mr. Rigas’ firm runs a C.F.O. that is invested in 41 hedge funds, but he said he had put more than 25 percent of his funds’ capital into cash to weather the storm.He predicts further liquidations in the industry.“How can I say that the environment is not bad?” Mr. Rigas said. “It’s difficult with hedge funds because they are very fragile. By their nature they’re fragile instruments because investors can ask for their money.”1217 2008-09-29 “What you are looking at is the creation of a giant property management system,” said L. William Seidman, who served as the R.T.C.’s chairman.The central mission of the R.T.C., which closed its doors in 1995, was to sell office buildings, homes, loans and other assets held by failed savings-and-loan institutions. Congressional leaders have indicated that they do not foresee the need to create a new agency like the R.T.C. because the government is now buying mortgage-backed securities rather than taking over real estate.But just getting such a process off the ground will still require a large bureaucratic infrastructure. Joseph E. Robert Jr., whose property management firm was among the first contractors hired by the R.T.C., said the agency’s offices did not even have telephones when he first visited.“They had one fax machine, a lot of empty offices and maybe three or four people,” Mr. Robert recalled.Once the new regulatory structure is in place, those managing the bailout are likely to find themselves dealing with problems like trying to identify those taking undue advantage of the system.For example, individuals or companies who had caused the government to lose money during the savings-and-loan crisis were barred from buying assets from the R.T.C. But the unscrupulous found ways around that provision by using front companies or “straw purchasers” to mask their identity, recalled Kenneth M. Donohue, who served as the assistant director of the agency’s office of investigation.“I think you have to have a strong oversight and enforcement program” for the new bailout, said Mr. Donohue, who is currently inspector general of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. “That has to be done proactively, and it has to be done from day one.”Also, while the bailout legislation contains a conflict-of-interest provision, putting it into practice could also prove tricky. Given the interconnected nature of mortgage-backed securities, some of the financial firms hired by the government as contractors might have had a direct or indirect hand in issuing or evaluating those securities of dubious value.Peter H. Monroe, who served for three years as president of the oversight board that set policy for the R.T.C., said that transparency about such tangled relationships would be vital.“One day, Goldman would buy the assets and the fairness opinion would be issued by Morgan Stanley,” he said. “And the next day, Morgan Stanley would buy something and the fairness opinion would be issued by Goldman.”Along with such big-picture issues, those running the new bailout will have to oversee its day-to-day activities. In its first years of operation, the R.T.C. hired 10,000 employees as well as hundreds of outside contractors. And with that came waste.For example, one 1991 government report found that the R.T.C. and an affiliated agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, had wasted hundreds of millions of dollars hiring a small army of outside lawyers. Also, other federal investigations found significant cases of overcharging by contractors.There is also the possibility that the new bailout could lead to criminal prosecutions or lawsuits. During the time of the R.T.C., several high-profile executives or directors of failed savings-and-loan institutions, like the businessman Charles Keating, faced fraud charges in connection with their collapse.There were also more mundane scandals: an allegation, for example, that R.T.C. contractors, including the son of then-Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, had failed to disclose dealings that might have barred them from the program. Without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, Mr. Bentsen’s son, Lan Bentsen, settled the case by agreeing not to do business with the R.T.C.Those managing the current bailout can also expect plenty of second-guessing from Congress. For example, while politicians at the time of the R.T.C. claimed, just as they do today, that taxpayers would quickly recoup the cost of the bailout, it took the agency a year to make its first deal. Over time, Congress had to plow billions more into the agency.Today, the R.T.C., even with all its problems, is remembered as a success. By the time it closed its doors, a year ahead of schedule, it had sold off $459 billion in assets, recouping much of the money that the government had pumped into failed banks. The eventual cost to taxpayers was $120 billion to $140 billion, well below the estimates of $500 billion.Those who served at the agency or worked with it, however, do not expect things to go so easily this time. Executives at J. E. Robert, the real estate management firm headed by Mr. Robert, said it took about 90 days to analyze and evaluate a package of properties held by the R.T.C.But they said that performing a similar analysis on just one of the complex securities that the government planned to buy would be infinitely more complex because each represented a pool containing hundreds of mortgages of dubious value on different kinds of properties.“At the end, it looks like a restaurant kitchen,” Mr. Robert said. “You don’t want to eat there if you don’t have to.”Given the uncharted waters ahead, Mr. Seidman, the former R.T.C. chairman, also predicted a rough ride.“They are going to have to learn by the seat of their pants,” he said. “If this doesn’t work out without some tremendous snafu down the line, it will be a miracle.”1218 2008-09-29 The authors of the new book “Jewish Wisdom for Business Success” (Amacom, 2008), have had a hard time attracting attention from any media outlets, despite their provocative title. The big exception: Christian radio.The book, by Rabbi Levi Brackman and Sam Jaffe, dispenses advice straight from the Torah and other holy texts. For example Chapter 4, Patriarchal Business Models, contains a description of how Abraham began successfully building the brand of monotheism by using a bold marketing technique, namely smashing all the idols in his father’s shop.“Abraham’s public relations stunt with his father’s idols succeeded even better than he could have imagined, earning him credibility and a reputation throughout Mesopotamia as an iconoclast and a holy man,” the book instructs. Just imagine what he could have done with New Coke.It is perhaps not surprising that many Christian-oriented radio stations have expressed interest in a book that translates that passage into advice for modern living, said Stephanie Fraschetti, host of “John and Stephanie,” an afternoon drive time Christian talk show on WORD-FM (101.5) in Pittsburgh. Rabbi Brackman was a guest on the show Sept. 10, and has also appeared on the Paradise Radio Network, which reaches North Carolina and southern Virginia.“He had a lot of insight, and as Christians we definitely take the Old Testament for all it’s worth,” Ms. Fraschetti said. “These are tried and true principles, inspired by the highest authority, in my opinion.”Mr. Jaffe worked at The Wall Street Journal and has many former colleagues who work at major financial publications. Despite his pleas for coverage to The Journal, Fortune, Fast Money and Business Week, none have expressed interest, he said.1219 2008-09-29 The government’s purchase of troubled assets may amount to a $700 billion bailout of financial institutions. But “bailout” is a word President Bush did not utter last week.In a stark example of the way language is used as a public relations tactic, Mr. Bush and other government officials have characterized the measure in positive terms — “rescue plan” and “asset relief program” — thereby carefully avoiding more loaded words like “bailout.”The media, by and large, did not follow Mr. Bush’s lead. On Sunday, a Google News search conjured more than 157,000 results for “bailout,” and only 42,000 for “rescue plan.” Sunday’s newspaper headlines reflected the preferred descriptive, from the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette (“Tentative Bailout Deal Reached”) to The Richmond Times-Dispatch (“Bailout: Deal or No Deal?”) to The Wichita Eagle (“Americans Frustrated by Bailout”).The terminology of the financial crisis is particularly important because of the emotions the words can stir in readers and listeners. The Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, suggested that the bailout label was a “major reason why constituents flooded Capitol Hill offices with phone calls and e-mails, overwhelmingly urging lawmakers to reject it.”On Wednesday, in a prime-time address watched by 52 million Americans, Mr. Bush called on Congress to support his administration’s “rescue effort.” On Saturday, in his weekly radio address, the president shifted his language somewhat, calling it a “bipartisan rescue package.”During the presidential candidates’ debate on Friday, the moderator Jim Lehrer of PBS alternated between calling it a financial rescue plan and a bailout. The two candidates both avoided the “b” word in their answers.1220 2008-09-29 LEAVING MURDOCH After 55 years in journalism -- 41 of them working for Rupert Murdoch -- Steve Dunleavy, The New York Post columnist, is seeing the curtain come down on his career.

On Monday in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped almost 800 points, nearly 7 percent.The broader Topix index was also down nearly 4 percent.In Hong Kong, as shares fell at the opening of trading on Tuesday, the territory’s Securities and Futures Commission warned in a statement that it, “would not hesitate to act against abusive short selling.” The commission also reminded traders that the financial penalties for failing to settle short trades had been doubled on Friday.The government agency’s announcement highlighted Hong Kong’s unusual position as one of the few large financial markets that continues to allow short selling. The United States and some of the largest European countries have severely restricted it this month, while the Australian Stock Exchange banned almost all short selling at the start of last week.Many Asian markets, including mainland China’s, banned short selling even before the recent volatility in markets.Short selling consists of borrowing shares and selling them, in the hope of buying them back later at a lower price so as to return them to the lender. Someone who sells shares short tries to profit from the spread in prices.Some brokers in Hong Kong blame the continued legality of short selling for the Hong Kong market’s steep decline in recent weeks, as the market has lost nearly half its value since Oct. 30 of last year and has particularly underperformed other Asian markets in the past week. These brokers, like Peter Lai of DBS Vickers Securities, contend that traders from other countries have been selling shares short in Hong Kong because they can no longer do so in their home countries.The Securities and Futures Commission tried to address those worries on Tuesday morning by releasing data showing that the total volume of short selling last week was actually slightly lower than in the second quarter of this year. It was also lower last week than in the preceding weeks of the third quarter.Hong Kong has long required that stocks can only be sold short on upticks, meaning when the last trade of a specific stock in the market was higher than the preceding trade of that stock. Hedge fund managers say that it is possible to avoid the uptick rule through complicated transactions, but the Securities and Futures Commission has been trying to tighten enforcement and reminded investors of the rule in its statement on Tuesday morning.1257 2008-09-30 “Senator Obama and his allies in Congress infused unnecessary partisanship into the process,” Mr. McCain said, before adding in almost the same breath: “Now is not the time to fix the blame. It’s time to fix the problem.”Both campaigns pledged to support efforts to resolve the situation, though they were short on details. Mr. McCain’s campaign said he would continue to monitor developments closely to see whether more House Republicans could now be persuaded to vote for the bill, or whether it had to be amended to address their concerns. But his aides said there did not appear to be a need to return to Washington immediately, since Congress had recessed for Rosh Hashana.Mr. Holtz-Eakin, the campaign’s senior economic adviser, told reporters that “we don’t have a specific proposal that we believe is the magic bullet.”“Having failed to have that bill passed through the House,” he said, “I think it’s time to regroup and see whether it’s the content, whether it’s the nature of the debate that went on on the floor of the House today, or whether people really just need to take one look around the financial markets and have a wake-up call and do the right thing.”Mr. Obama had said he was inclined to support the bill that failed Monday. But it remains an open question how much political capital he will seek to expend, or how invested he wants to become, in helping Democratic leaders win passage of a bill.The failure of the measure took both camps by surprise. Mr. Obama, who was campaigning Monday in Colorado, had already sent reporters the advance text of a speech he planned to give lauding the agreement. And Mr. McCain, at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, seemed to be taking some credit for the bill.Democrats had said all along that by inserting himself into negotiations, Mr. McCain had brought presidential politics to a delicate situation and could wind up hurting more than helping. After the House vote, his aides bristled at the suggestion that his involvement had in fact been a drawback, saying he had been instrumental in getting House Republicans a seat at the negotiating table and helping bring in more of their votes.Mr. Holtz-Eakin said Mr. McCain had made “dozens of calls” on the bill, some to House Republicans who opposed it.Aides to Mr. Obama said he had not directly reached out to try to sway any House Democrats who opposed the measure. But where Mr. McCain had accused Mr. Obama of taking a hands-off approach to the financial crisis, Democratic advisers said they believed that Mr. McCain now had a role in the legislation’s failure.As aides to both campaigns pointed fingers, Mr. Obama sought to stay above the fray and maintain a steady demeanor that advisers maintain has set him apart throughout the financial turmoil.“One of the messages that I have to Congress is, Get this done,” he said in Colorado after the House vote. “Democrats, Republicans, step up to the plate and get this done. Understand even as you get it done to stabilize the markets, we have more work to do to make sure that Main Street is getting the same kind of help that Wall Street is getting. We cannot forget who this is for. This is for the American people. This shouldn’t be for a few insiders.”1258 2008-09-30 Representative John A. Boehner, the House Republican leader, became emotional as he urged his party to muster the will to approve the package. After his members overwhelmingly voted against it, he tried to shift the blame to a partisan speech delivered on the floor just before the vote by Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker.Ms. Pelosi delivered the Democratic votes she had promised, but could not muster enough of them to avert a defeat that could long be remembered.The candidates to replace Mr. Bush, Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama, were far from Washington, bit actors at best in helping to resolve a crisis that one of them will inherit.The breakdown, even if temporary, pointed up the difficulties of dealing with fast-moving emergencies through the slow-moving and inherently political legislative process. And despite rare bipartisan agreement among party leaders in this case, the gulf between what lawmakers were hearing in Washington and what they have been hearing from home proved too vast for many people, particularly Republicans, to jump.As a study in his prospective leadership, the role of Mr. McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, has done him no political good. After suspending his campaign last week and vowing to work with Republicans until a resolution was in hand, Mr. McCain was campaigning in Ohio on Monday with his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, as the House vote commenced. There he implicitly took credit for the compromise bailout that Congressional leaders had negotiated over the weekend, even as it was going down to defeat.On his plane before takeoff to Iowa, Mr. McCain spoke by phone with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke. With no credit to claim in the bill’s defeat, he flew to Iowa without making a statement to reporters on board. In Iowa, he criticized Mr. Obama, his Democratic rival, before adding, “Now is not the time to fix blame.”Even before the vote, House Republicans had trouble pointing to any contributions from Mr. McCain to their deliberations since late last week, when he and they forced the administration officials and Congressional leaders to reopen negotiations and alter the package to impose some safeguards for taxpayers’ billions.Mr. Obama, campaigning in Colorado, also was taken by surprise. He quickly revised his speech, which announced the bipartisan agreement, to instead call for Congress to “step up to the plate and get this done.” While Mr. Obama had tepidly endorsed the plan and kept in daily touch with Mr. Paulson and Congressional leaders, aides said he did not twist Democrats’ arms to support it.At the White House, aides described the president as working the phones to lobby a dozen Republicans. Vice President Dick Cheney, a former No. 2 House Republican leader, pitched in, with no better luck. “I think everyone with a phone is calling to see if we can shore up a member who may be skeptical of the proposal,” Tony Fratto, the deputy White House press secretary, said before the vote.But numerous other Republicans, including lawmakers and veterans of past administrations, complained that it was too little, too late. They said Mr. Bush should have summoned lawmakers to the White House and gone to the Capitol to personally plead his case — as other presidents including Mr. Bush have done in the past to sell their highest priorities. “Reagan did it!” one said.“There probably could have been an outreach that began earlier than in just the last couple of days,” said Representative Adam Putman of Florida, a member of the Republican leadership, who supported the bailout. “But it is very difficult to deal with an outgoing administration”— its leverage waning — “than one that’s early in its term.”The episode underscored that Mr. Bush’s credibility and political clout, long gone among Democrats, is lacking among Republicans as well. “There is a fair number of people who believe we’re not staring into the abyss as has been represented,” Mr. Putnam said. “And some people do believe we are facing a market collapse and something needs to be done, but they would rather not be the ones who have to vote for it.”Mr. Putnam, who lobbied colleagues opposed to the plan, said they were reporting that calls against the bailout were pouring in at the rate of several hundred to every one supporting it.Both parties agreed the bailout would easily pass in the Democratic-controlled Senate, with support from most of the Republicans there. So the House Republicans made the difference. Their mutiny captured just how much the Republican Party has changed from its 19th-century roots as the party of business and economic stewardship.“I don’t think this was a failure of leadership so much as a failure of followership,” said Thomas Mann, a scholar on Congress at the Brookings Institution. “This is a function of a group of House Republicans who are philosophically opposed to doing anything like this bailout and are prepared to take the risk.”1259 2008-09-30 But at the same time, the inquiry rejected accusations that the dismissals of two other prosecutors, in Phoenix and San Diego, were designed to thwart political investigations involving Republicans.The controversy over the dismissals of nine federal prosecutors led to the resignation of Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales last September, and the report saves some of its harshest criticism for him. It concludes that Mr. Gonzales was “remarkably unengaged” in an unprecedented process to fire a large number of prosecutors at once, and it says that he, along with his deputy at the time, Paul J. McNulty, “abdicated their responsibility” to ensure the integrity of the process and left it mainly to Mr. Gonzales’s chief of staff, D. Kyle Sampson.The report also faulted Mr. Gonzales’s misstatements to Congress and the news media about the true reasons for the dismissals and his “extraordinary lack of recollection about the entire removal process.”In ordering a new investigation, Mr. Mukasey echoed the language of the investigators and acknowledged that the process for firing the prosecutors was “haphazard, arbitrary and unprofessional.” The dismissed prosecutors, he added, “did not deserve the treatment they received.”The actions and misstatements by Mr. Gonzales are expected to be a central focus of the new investigation by Ms. Dannehy, who is expected to report the status of her examination within 60 days. But on Monday, Mr. Gonzales and his lawyer appeared unconcerned about that prospect.The investigation “is clearly over as to him,” said Mr. Gonzales’s lawyer, George J. Terwilliger III. “The inspector general after 18 months of investigation has basically concluded that the facts and circumstances regarding Judge Gonzales’s activity do not include any unlawful conduct.”Mr. Terwilliger said he found it odd that Mr. Mukasey was ordering an investigation nonetheless.In a statement, Mr. Gonzales said, “My family and I are glad to have the investigation of my conduct in this matter behind us, and we look forward to moving on to new challenges.”Mr. Gonzales, who was criticized in a report last month for his mishandling of classified information, has been giving paid speeches at a cost of more than $30,000 each and has done some work as a private arbitrator, Mr. Terwilliger said, but he has struggled to find another job at a private law firm since his resignation.Despite difficulties in receiving cooperation from the White House, the investigation did uncover some administration e-mail messages and other evidence not previously made public in the course of extensive Congressional investigations last year.In the case of Mr. Iglesias, for instance, the new evidence demonstrated in even starker terms the intense political pressure from Republicans to have him fired despite the strong evaluations he had received as a United States attorney in New Mexico.Mr. Iglesias had tangled with his state’s leading Republican officials, including Senator Pete V. Domenici and Representative Heather A. Wilson, over what they asserted was his slow response to accusations of voter fraud and political corruption against Democrats in New Mexico. That pressure, the report concluded, led directly to Mr. Iglesias’s removal.For many months before the dismissal of Mr. Iglesias, officials in the White House complained privately that voter fraud by Democrats might have cost Mr. Bush the state in the 2004 presidential election, the investigation said.In one previously undisclosed e-mail message obtained by investigators, Allen Weh, chairman of the state Republican Party, sent an e-mail message to four officials in the White House, including Mr. Rove, and to a staff member for Mr. Domenici on Aug. 9, 2005, complaining about Mr. Iglesias and urging that he be fired. Mr. Iglesias had “failed miserably in his duty to prosecute voter fraud,” Mr. Weh said in the message. “To be perfectly candid, he was ‘missing in action’ during the last election, just as he was in the 2002 election cycle.”The administration tried to hide the political reasons behind Mr. Iglesias’s dismissal through public misstatements and “disingenuous after-the-fact rationalizations,” the report found, including the idea that Mr. Iglesias, a captain in the Navy reserves required to serve 36 days a year, was an “absentee landlord.”Mr. Iglesias said in an interview after the report’s release: “I feel very much vindicated. This tells me there was enough evidence uncovered by the inspector general’s investigation to take this to the next level, which is a special prosecutor.”He said he hoped that the prosecutor, Ms. Dannehy, would have the subpoena power and other authority to compel the White House to turn over records that it refused to give to the inspector general, and he said a new administration in January could make it easier for her to obtain critical records.The investigation also found that political pressures played a part in at least two other dismissals, despite the denials of the White House.In Missouri, Todd P. Graves was removed as the United States prosecutor after complaints from the staff of Senator Christopher S. Bond, a Republican, about Mr. Graves’s refusal to intervene in a dispute between Mr. Bond’s staff and Mr. Graves’s brother. And in Arkansas, H. E. Cummins III, the United States attorney, was let go in order to make room for a protégé of Mr. Rove, J. Timothy Griffin.The exact reasons for the dismissals of four other United States attorneys were less clear, although all involved policy disputes with officials in Washington over issues like immigration enforcement, gun prosecution, obscenity cases and the death penalty.Notably, the investigation rejected charges that the firings of two prosecutors in that group — Paul K. Charlton in Phoenix and Carol C. Lam in San Diego — were an effort to thwart public corruption investigations in their districts involving powerful Republican lawmakers.In the case of the final two fired prosecutors — Margaret M. Chiara in western Michigan and Kevin V. Ryan in San Francisco — the investigation concluded that the Justice Department had “reasonable concerns” about their performances. It rejected the assertion from Ms. Chiara that she was let go because of what she called an unfounded rumor she was having a sexual relationship with a female lawyer in her office.1260 2008-09-30 The German state lender KfW has dismissed two board members over the transfer of around 300 million euros, or $426 million, to Lehman Brothers on the day Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection, German officials said. KfW’s board of supervisory directors decided that the two members, Peter Fleischer and Detlef Leinberger, would have to leave their posts. The two had already been suspended. KfW has said it mistakenly transferred the funds to Lehman to unwind a swap agreement, in which two counterparties agree to exchange one stream of cash flow against another stream. The case made front-page news in Germany, with one newspaper calling KfW “Germany’s dumbest bank.”1261 2008-09-30 A man who impersonated a federal drug agent, conducting raids and making arrests, has pleaded guilty to federal charges. The man, Bill Anthony Jakob, 36, pleaded guilty in St. Louis to impersonating a federal law enforcement officer and other counts. Sentencing is Dec. 19. A United States attorney, Catherine Hanaway, said Mr. Jakob represented himself as someone from the Drug Enforcement Administration, as an agent of a federal narcotics task force and as a federal marshal, all in the same month.1262 2008-09-30 The budget resolutions are merely a blueprint and do not have the force of law. But even if they indicate a propensity by Mr. Obama to vote to raise taxes — something he and his campaign would fiercely dispute — there is a question of whether the vote would raise taxes at all.“It strikes me as a bizarre proposition and a false premise to argue that you are voting for a tax increase by not voting to cut taxes,” said Bob Williams, senior research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. “Not voting in favor of extending something into the future does not seem to me to be voting for a tax increase.”Mr. Williams, formerly the assistant director of tax analysis at the Congressional Budget Office, attributed Mr. McCain’s claim to what he called “the silly season” of the presidential campaign. “They are both so anxious to find something to make the other guy look wrong,” he said.Mr. Williams pointed out that Mr. Obama had “pushed the same kind of demagoguery as regards Social Security” by falsely accusing Mr. McCain of wanting to cut benefits in half.The bottom line is that if passed into law without accompanying tax relief measures, the budget resolutions that Mr. Obama endorsed would raise taxes for some individuals making $42,000 a year. But it would not raise taxes for all of them. For a single taxpayer with no dependents, the amount of that increase would be $15. A single taxpayer with one child earning $58,000 or less, however, would not pay additional taxes.In his presidential platform, Mr. Obama has also proposed several measures to mitigate the impact of letting the Bush tax cuts expire. Under his plan, only individuals making $200,000 or more and families earning more than $250,000 a year, accounting for less than 2 percent of the population, would pay additional taxes, and more than 90 percent of the population would receive a tax break of some sort.“It is our position that if in 2011 the Bush tax cuts expire, we would define that as a tax increase,” said Mr. Obama’s chief economic adviser, Jason Furman. “The Obama plan is designed to prevent a tax increase that George Bush signed into law.”In remarks on the campaign trail on Monday in Columbus, Ohio, Mr. McCain broadened his accusations, saying that Mr. Obama had “never voted to cut your taxes” and was “always cheering for higher taxes or against tax relief.”Mr. McCain himself originally opposed the Bush tax cuts, saying they were a fiscally irresponsible gift to the wealthy “at the expense of middle-class Americans who need tax relief.” But he now favors extending them permanently.Mr. McCain’s accusations on Friday and Monday are the latest iteration of a line of attack that his campaign has been employing for several months, after an earlier claim that Mr. Obama was proposing “the largest single tax increase since World War II” was debunked by economists and tax experts.The McCain campaign originally maintained that Mr. Obama’s support of the nonbinding budget resolution meant he would raise taxes on those making as little as $32,500 a year. That failed to distinguish between total income and taxable income.But even after adopting the $42,000 figure as his benchmark, Mr. McCain went on to misrepresent his opponent’s position. In a Spanish-language advertisement, for example, the McCain campaign has said that Mr. Obama favors raising taxes on “families” making $42,000 a year.That figure is incorrect as well. In reality, a family of four with annual income of up to $90,000, to take one example, would not have been affected even in the unlikely event that the Democratic budget resolution were to be enacted with no accompanying tax relief for the middle class.In an English-language Web advertisement issued in August, Mr. McCain also claimed that Mr. Obama favored “a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year.” That statement is patently false. Under Mr. Obama’s tax proposal, those in the middle of the middle class — people earning $37,000 to $66,000 a year — would receive a tax cut of more than $1,000 a year, more than three times what Mr. McCain is proposing in his tax platform.1263 2008-09-30 After nearly eight years of voting in virtual lock step with President Bush on everything from tax cuts to torture, House Republicans decided on Monday to break ranks on the survival of the nation’s financial system.The rejected bailout bill that was on the floor after a weekend of hard negotiating was objectionable in many ways, but it was a Republican-generated bill and was improved from the administration’s original version. Sixty percent of House Democrats voted for the bill, enough to easily pass the measure if the Republicans had not decided to put on their display of pique and disarray.The question now is whether the stock-market plunge that followed the House’s failure to lead — and a renewed credit freeze — will be enough to get the 133 Republicans who voted against the measure to change their minds. And, more important, whether the damage that the no vote has inflicted is readily reversible.Republican no votes were rooted less in analysis or principle than in political posturing and ideological rigidity. The House minority leader, , conceded as much: “While we were able to move the bill drastically to the right, it wasn’t good enough for our members.”It’s not clear what would be good enough for the Republicans since there was very little talk of substance on Monday after the bill died on the floor of the House. Instead, the Republicans tried to blame their revolt on a speech given before the vote by House Speaker , who connected the current crisis to the fiscal and economic mismanagement of the Bush years. It may not have been the perfect moment to say that, but it was true.1264 2008-09-30 Yovani Gallardo will start Game 1 for the Milwaukee Brewers when they open their National League division series against the Philadelphia Phillies, followed by C. C. Sabathia for Game 2.“I don’t know how to explain it. I’m very excited, just ready to go,” Gallardo said. “I’m just going to give my team the opportunity to win.”Gallardo, a 22-year-old right-hander, returned from a torn knee ligament and pitched four innings last Thursday against Pittsburgh in his first start since May 1. He allowed one run and three hits while throwing 67 pitches.Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin, preparing for Milwaukee’s first postseason appearance since 1982, said a final decision on the playoff roster would not be made until after Tuesday’s workout in Philadelphia.The interim manager, Dale Sveum, said he had not decided on Game 3 or Game 4 starters, but it was probably between the veteran Jeff Suppan (10-10, 4.96 earned run average) and Dave Bush (9-10, 4.18).Cole Hamels (14-10) will start the opener for the Phillies. Brett Myers (10-13) and Jamie Moyer (16-7) follow in the Phillies’ rotation.1265 2008-09-30 In Douglas County, Ga., the police issued a request for motorists to stop calling 911 for help finding open gas stations. A county spokeswoman said the calls could interfere with the ability to handle emergencies.In Atlanta, where sprawl forces lengthy commutes, drivers shook their heads in disbelief over around-the-block lines at stations, $4-per-gallon prices and the prospect of two more weeks of problems.“At first I was a good sport, but this is getting ridiculous,” said Marsha Lewis, 43, an administrative assistant who lives in Dacula, Ga., and commutes to Atlanta. “I drive an hour to work every day, and looking for gasoline has become my entire life.”John Temples, 49, a self-employed construction worker, waited 30 minutes to refill his brown GMC van at a Shell station in Decatur, Ga. “This is a friendly town, and right now it’s basically just an annoyance,” he said. “But if there were an emergency and people needed to get out of town, things could get violent.”Waiting behind five cars at a BP station in Atlanta, Mike Adams, 28, a paralegal, called the shortage “an absolute catastrophe.”“Every few days they say it’s going to get better,” Mr. Adams said, “but it only seems to get worse.”Both supply and demand are perpetuating the shortage. Refinery damage and power failures in Texas created the conditions, said Brandon Wright, a spokesman for the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, but drivers contributed by refueling more often than necessary.“You hear stories about tankers pulling into gas stations and people are already waiting — and they have half a tank,” Dr. Medlock said. “It’s akin to hoarding.”Electrical power is now coming back to refineries in Louisiana and Texas. ConocoPhillips said Monday that its large Alliance and Lake Charles refineries in Louisiana were back on line.A few refineries, including an ExxonMobil facility in Beaumont, Tex., suffered flooding from Hurricane Ike and will not be fully repaired for at least several weeks. Oil analysts said they expected the gasoline shortages in much of the Southeast to improve gradually through Columbus Day.In the meantime, Mr. Wright said, “Folks need to take a deep breath.”1266 2008-09-30 Among opponents of the rescue plan, some Republicans cited ideological objections to government intervention, and liberal Democrats said they were of no mind to race to aid Wall Street tycoons. Other critics complained about haste and secrecy in assembling the plan.But lawmakers on both sides pointed to an outpouring of opposition from deeply hostile constituents just five weeks before every seat in the House was up for election as a fundamental reason that the measure was defeated. House members in potentially tough races and those seeking Senate seats fled from the plan in droves.“People’s re-elections played into this to a much greater degree than I would have imagined,” said Representative Deborah Pryce of Ohio, a former member of the Republican leadership who is retiring this year and voted for the plan. Congressional leaders in both parties said they did not know how they would proceed but were examining options, including having the Senate, where there was more support for the bailout, advance a bill after the Jewish New Year on Tuesday. Congressional leaders said any doubt about the need for action should have been removed by the market fall.“We’re not leaving town till we get it fixed,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.At the White House, Mr. Bush met with his economic advisers as well as the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to discuss next steps. “I was disappointed in the vote,” Mr. Bush said, appearing in the Oval Office with President Viktor A. Yushchenko of Ukraine. “Our strategy is to continue to address this economic situation head on.”The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was the main architect of the financial rescue plan, said he would continue to work with Congressional leaders “to find a way forward to pass a comprehensive plan to stabilize our financial system and protect the American people.” He added, “This is much too important to simply let fail.”Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama renewed their calls for swift action, though each campaign sought to partly blame the other for the defeat.At the Capitol, Democrats accused Republicans of failing to deliver enough number of votes. “Sixty-seven percent of the Republican Conference decided to put political ideology ahead of the best interest of our great nation,” the Democratic whip, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, said after the vote.Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the Republican whip, said that before the vote he had tallied 75 votes in his conference in favor of the plan. By the time the votes were cast, the Republicans could deliver only 65 of them.Other top Republicans pointed at what they saw as a partisan speech by Speaker Nancy Pelosi in advance of the vote as a factor — a charge Democrats derided.Republicans said they had alerted Democrats they might not have the numbers required. But they never recommended the legislation be put off and in the end they were unable to win any last-second converts to change the votes that would have been necessary to turn defeat into victory.Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, said he tried repeatedly and unsuccessfully to sway a handful of holdouts, but eventually gave up.“You can’t break their arms, you can’t put your whole relationship on the line with them and ask them to do something they do not want to do and have that member regret that vote for the rest of their life,” said Mr. Boehner, who said he could not remember a time when the muscle of both parties and the White House failed to produce a victory.The outcome after a slightly more than 40-minute vote on the House floor left lawmakers almost speechless. Even the strongest opponents of the measure did not expect to prevail, and the leadership of both parties, while increasingly nervous, figured they would squeak out a victory despite a parade of Republicans and Democrats to microphones to assail the measure. At the White House, the deputy press secretary, Tony Fratto, said just before the vote: “We’re confident that it will pass.”Under the proposal, the Treasury Department could tap up to $700 billion in taxpayer money in installments to buy troubled debt from financial firms, in the hopes of freeing up credit to fuel normal economic activity.In the final stages of negotiations, new provisions intended to recoup taxpayer losses were added. They helped the measure win support from Mr. Boehner and some other House Republican leaders, who had strongly opposed an earlier version of the bill. But they did not put the package over the top.In impassioned speeches on the House floor, Democrats and Republicans alike vented their frustration over the nation’s perilous economic condition and the uncomfortable position they were in, facing pressure to approve an unpopular bailout package during an election year, with no guarantee that it would work.“This is a huge cow patty with a piece of marshmallow stuck in the middle of it and I am not going to eat that cow patty,” said Representative Paul Broun, Republican of Georgia.“Nobody wants to do this,” said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who nonetheless voted for it. “Nobody wants to clean up the mess created by Wall Street recklessness.”In the speech that Republicans said infuriated them, Ms. Pelosi accused Mr. Bush of squandering the budget surpluses of the Clinton years. “They claim to be free-market advocates, when it’s really an anything-goes mentality,” she said. “No supervision. No discipline. And if you fail, you will have a golden parachute and the taxpayer will bail you out.”Democrats later said that if her speech truly cost votes, then Republicans, in the words of Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, were guilty of punishing the country because Ms. Pelosi had hurt their feelings.As the voting time expired on the floor, party leaders realized they were coming up far short. At 1:49 p.m., it was 205 for and 228 against. At 1:54 p.m., they inched closer: 207 to 226, as some representatives changed their votes. What followed was a remarkable stalemate on the House floor, with top lieutenants in both parties clutching lists of votes, as they clustered in the well and made unusual forays into what is normally enemy territory across the aisle.“I was asking where the hell their votes were,” said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the No. 4 Democrat.Mr. Blunt said he told Democrats he thought he could flip five votes, if Democrats could do the same. Democrats had warned that the Republicans that they would need to produce 80 to 100 votes to adopt an unpopular plan championed by the Republican White House. Ultimately, the Democrats decided the votes were not there and they allowed the gavel to come down. Opponents of the measure said they expected the administration and Congressional leaders to try again on a rescue proposal and were not worried about being held responsible for the stock decline or other economic uncertainty.“I think we will be back in a couple of days with a proposal more palatable to more members,” said Representative John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat who voted against the plan. “You don’t make the biggest financial decision in the history of this country in a few days’ time without hearings.”But Representative Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican who is retiring from Congress and who backed the proposal, said those who opposed to the measure might be hearing a different message from their voters if economic conditions worsen. “The members who voted no will have some culpability,” he said.The House leadership said Monday night that the House would reconvene at noon Thursday, though it was not known if another economic plan would be on the table.“Stay tuned,” said Ms. Pelosi, who seemed physically drained. But she added: “What happened today cannot stand. We must move forward, and I hope that the markets will take that message.”Representative Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who supported the bailout, said lawmakers may quickly discover “whether this is as dire a situation as we were told.”“This is playing with fire,” Mr. Walden said. “It’s very, very dangerous.”1267 2008-09-30 The drug wholesaler Cardinal Health said Monday it would spin off its high-margin clinical and medical products businesses as a stand-alone medical technology company.The company also said its chief executive, R. Kerry Clark, 56, would retire after the spinoff, and it reaffirmed its outlook for fiscal 2009.Analysts said the spinoff would allow a slimmed-down Cardinal Health to focus on turning around its underperforming drug distribution business, while potentially attracting a higher stock valuation for the publicly traded stand-alone medical technology company.“The clinical technology side is really the crown jewel,” said Jeff Jonas, portfolio manager at Gabelli Healthcare and WellnessRx Trust mutual fund, which owns Cardinal shares. “So that would presumably get a much higher multiple in the market as a stand-alone company.”Shares of Cardinal Health, which initially reacted positively to news of the spinoff, fell $1.16, or 2.3 percent, to close at $48.54 on the New York Stock Exchange as declines in the broader stock market deepened.1268 2008-09-30 Wachovia’s announcement on Friday ended a review that began in May. The review had been narrowed to the team led by Ogilvy New York and a team led by another WPP agency, Y&R.Ogilvy New York was to take on the creative duties for Wachovia that had been handled by the Winston-Salem, N.C., office of Mullen, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. The Maxus unit of WPP was to become the Wachovia agency for media planning and buying, replacing the Boston office of Carat, part of the Aegis Group.And Wachovia was to have worked with other WPP agencies like Neo@Ogilvy, for digital marketing, and Soho Square, to create direct-mail campaigns to promote credit cards.Actually, the WPP agencies did not even have three days to celebrate. Hours after Wachovia announced its decision on Friday, reports appeared on newspaper Web sites that Wachovia had started merger conversations with Citigroup, Wells Fargo and other banks.When the review began, it was estimated that Wachovia spent about $150 million a year on advertising. In its announcement on Friday, Wachovia said it would spend less on advertising in 2009 than it would this year, citing “market conditions” as well as the efficiencies of consolidating most of its campaigns at agencies all owned by the same company.In retrospect, some of what Wachovia announced last week might be viewed as whistling past the graveyard.“Selecting one of the premier ad agencies in the world should be viewed as a strong indication of our focus on future growth,” Art Smith, head of global brand marketing at Wachovia, said in a news release that Wachovia distributed on Friday. “The Wachovia brand is synonymous with the best customer service in the financial industry, and the Ogilvy team has the expertise and creative strength to help Wachovia ensure that our brand remains strong and becomes even more valuable over time.”If it is any consolation for the WPP agencies, they have company on Madison Avenue as the banking industry rapidly consolidates as a result of the financial crisis.In October 2007, the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group, was chosen as the new creative agency for Washington Mutual, which spent about $100 million last year on advertising. Four months later, TBWA/Chiat/Day brought out a new campaign for WaMu with an upbeat theme, “Whoo hoo!”But last Friday, WaMu was sold to JPMorgan Chase, which plans to operate Washington Mutual branches under the Chase bank brand and eliminate the Washington Mutual name. Chase has its own agencies, which include McGarryBowen for creative duties.The trade publication Advertising Age, in an article on its Web site on Monday, estimated that after all the deals now pending, Citigroup would emerge as the bank that spends the most each year on advertising and marketing, at more than $540 million, followed by JPMorgan Chase at more than $510 million.The acquisition of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America may also result in agency changes if Bank of America decides to reassign campaigns for Merrill Lynch to the agencies that work for Bank of America.1269 2008-09-30 A federal judge in Honolulu has dismissed a lawsuit trying to stop the running of a giant particle accelerator outside Geneva, dodging the issue of whether it could actually cause the end of the world.The judge, Helen Gillmor, said in her ruling Friday that the court lacked jurisdiction over the Large Hadron Collider, which is located on the Swiss-French border and was built by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, with help from the United States and dozens of other countries.When it is operating at full steam, the collider, which started circulating protons earlier this month before a series of mishaps shut it down for the winter, will accelerate protons to energies of seven trillion electron volts and slam them together in search of particles and forces not seen since the early moments of the Big Bang.Last spring, Walter Wagner, a retired radiation safety officer who lives in Hawaii, and Luis Sancho, a science writer and professor in Barcelona, filed the lawsuit, claiming that the collider could produce a black hole that could eat the Earth or cause some other calamitous effect. Predictions of such outcomes have been refuted in safety studies.This summer, for example, a report by a panel of physicists appointed by CERN concluded that the collider would not produce anything that billions of years of high-energy cosmic collisions had not produced.1270 2008-09-30 A problem that struck the Hubble Space Telescope on Saturday will delay the final space shuttle mission to service it, moving the launching from next month to next year, NASA officials said Monday.A crew of seven astronauts was scheduled to blast off in the shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 14 for an 11-day visit to the telescope, which for 18 years has been beaming cosmic postcards to Earth from its orbital vantage point above the atmosphere.During five spacewalks, the astronauts were set to install two new instruments and repair the telescope’s best camera and a spectrograph, both of which had electrical failures. They were also scheduled to replace the telescope’s batteries and gyroscopes, among other things.But on Saturday, a channel on a control system known as the Hubble Control Unit/Science Data Formatter — which helps relay data to the ground — failed, causing the telescope to go into a “safe mode” and cease observations. Hubble’s managers expect that activating a backup channel will restore the telescope to service later this week.But that will leave the telescope with no backup if the new channel stops working, so NASA would like to have the astronauts replace the failed control unit with a spare from the Goddard Space Flight Center.In a telephone news conference with reporters on Monday evening, Preston Burch of Goddard, Hubble’s program manager, said the control unit hangs, attached by 10 bolts, on the inside door of a bay that the astronauts can access easily. With luck, it could be exchanged during a two-hour spacewalk, he said. “We think it’s a relatively straightforward activity.”1271 2008-09-30 “Hell Girl,” a Japanese cartoon that begins its American run on IFC on Tuesday, could challenge “Law & Order” when it comes to rigid adherence to formula.Act 1: A young and attractive person who is being harassed (by a bully-stalker-malevolent boss) goes to a mysterious Web site that promises vengeance and, after much dithering, enters her tormentor’s name. Act 2: The harassee is transported to the home of Hell Girl, a saucer-eyed moppet in a kimono, and her otherworldly helpers, whose human guises incorporate floppy hair or impressive cleavage. The deal is spelled out: We send the bad guy to hell now; you follow later. Act 3: The tormentor is tormented in appropriate fashion (the baseball-star bully’s pitching arm falls off, for example) and then ferried to hell.Admittedly, this précis is based on only the first five episodes (more are available at ifc.com), and No. 5 showed signs of breaking out of the narrative rut and beginning to fill in the back stories of the Hell Girl team. In the show’s favor, the animation by Studio DEEN is above average and the English-language version was prepared by FUNimation, so the dubbing isn’t embarrassing. But that still doesn’t make this negligible show interesting, beyond what it might have to say about suppressed rage in Japanese society. (Japanese viewers apparently see something I don’t: the series, which began in 2005, is about to start its third season.)What “Hell Girl” really illustrates is the continuing fallow period in imported television anime. From 2000 to 2005, American audiences saw “Cowboy Bebop,” “FLCL,” “Fullmetal Alchemist,” “Naruto,” “Neon Genesis Evangelion,” “Paranoia Agent” and “Samurai Champloo” for the first time. There have been entertaining series introduced over the last few years — “Blood Plus,” “Death Note” — but reruns of the shows in that earlier wave are still the best anime on television.1272 2008-09-30 The Mets staged a lovely farewell to Shea Stadium on Sunday that succeeded with its tacit admission that the last 44 years have not always been grand.It didn’t have to be majestic to work as well as it did.There were wonderful Mets of postseason glory, from Tom Seaver to Mike Piazza to Jerry Koosman to Bud Harrelson, plus two men who wore Mets uniforms, Yogi Berra and Willie Mays, but were better known in the attire of other teams.The stadium adieu, carried with aplomb by SNY, embraced the team’s not-so-greats like Jack Fisher, Doug Flynn and Art Shamsky. The ceremony honored barely known former employees like a groundskeeper, Pete Flynn, and a team executive, Bob Mandt. It brought back the wives and the children of beloved deceased Mets like Gil Hodges, Tommie Agee, Tug McGraw and Bob Murphy.And there were no stadium employees dressed as dead Mets.The problem is that the emotional wallop of such a well-produced Shea goodbye came at precisely the wrong time of day. Had it preceded the Marlins’ 4-2 victory over the Mets, it might have served as inspiration. Consider the possible impact of seeing Seaver and Piazza close the center-field gates together had it occurred before the game.So the ceremony became a wake, not a nostalgic pep rally. For all the wise planning that went into the farewell, the Mets should have understood how difficult it would be for fans to cope with happy memories if the team started the day with a loss that would only have been redeemed by a Brewers loss. But Milwaukee did not comply.1273 2008-09-30 Even among outliers, Chongo, 57, had always diverged. In a time of corporate sponsorships, he lived on charity, scavenging and bartering handmade wares. In a time of brand-name gear, he rigged worthy contraptions from found parts. In a time of speed-climbing records, he gained renown for his comically deliberate ascents. Once, he stretched an assault on El Capitan across two weeks, including three days spent pausing to consider some half-forgotten existential puzzle.Dumb jokes congealed around his legend, for he projected a familiar and comforting sort of weirdness. Around a campfire or a cafeteria table, tourists and weekend warriors could find in Chongo a certain box to cross off, the obligatory aging hippie recounting unintentionally hilarious misadventures, denouncing the prison-industrial complex and rhapsodizing on junk science.Chongo would claim, for example, to remember the fear he had felt at his own birth. He would say he did not believe in the afterlife, partly out of a feeling that to do so demeaned our plane of existence, but also because he reasoned that certain principles of quantum mechanics negated such a concept.“He has (supposedly) lived in , spent years in college, spent years in jail, been a computer programmer, been shot, done some serious partying, written books, climbed big walls, resoled shoes, made clothing, been there, and done that,” one online diarist wrote. “Most of it’s true; some of it is fabricated lore.”As natural recreation in America gave way to luxury resorts, adventure travel and extreme sports, tales of Chongo grew outsize. He remained fiercely true to his vision of the outdoor spirit. While others burned out, joined the establishment or cashed in on televised feats of daredevilry, Chongo spent his days at Yosemite, revising manifestos on climbing, physics and philosophy.“He’s kind of like this force of energy that people gather around,” said Pam Gutsch, a rock climber from . “Maybe it’s based on this philosophical idea of Chongo. He’s kind of a center. He’s not the top climber, but he’s a climber, and he can discuss it with anybody.”Nearly three years ago, Chongo abandoned climbing altogether. Rumors of his whereabouts began to trade around the big rocks and rope-walking fixtures of the Western states. Expelled from Yosemite, he found his way to Sacramento, where he beds down in a trailer yard, eats lunch at a day shelter and types articles on science in the ramshackle office of a homeless advocacy group.After nature itself, Yosemite National Park owes much of its grandeur to John Muir, the Scottish conservationist who claimed to have sought directions “to any place that is wild.”In his 1912 guidebook, Muir likened the towering rock formations known as Half Dome, Sentinel Rock and El Capitan to the sight of a temple lighted from above.“But no temple made with hands can compare with Yosemite,” he wrote. “Every rock in its walls seems to glow with life.”A century later, paved roads now carve long stone tunnels through the mountains, bringing carloads of visitors to hotels with wireless Internet access, conference rooms and wedding facilities. Those who lay claim to Muir’s philosophical inheritance have long protested the commercial development. In the late 1960s, hippies living in the park began to draw the attention of the superintendent, Lawrence C. Hadley, described in news accounts of the day as “a brawny, soft-spoken man with tattoos on his arms.”On July 4, 1970, around 7:30 p.m., park rangers sought to disperse a crowd of several hundred from Stoneman Meadow.“For the next three hours, they raised hell,” Hadley later told reporters, “carrying on, boozed up, pounding their bongo drums. A lot of them seemed to be high on dope.”Calling in support from nearby police departments, the rangers cleared the meadow and detained nearly 200 people. The young campers who had been whiling away their days climbing rocks and balancing on chains would long remember the confrontation. But the sports they were pioneering would lead down similar paths, split by accusations of commercial exploitation.Some, like Dean Fidelman, 52, would sleep in the park intermittently for years. Fidelman, a photographer who sells calendars depicting nude women climbing big rocks, still practices a form of rope-walking for exercise, meditation and pleasure.“It’s very noncommercial, there’s nothing here to sell,” Fidelman said, standing by a slack-line tied between two trees. But, he added, “Then you have sponsored climbers. They come in, they do their thing and then they leave. And they have a photographer.”Younger athletes like Dean Potter and Steph Davis, a married couple who are among the most successful climbers in the world, have lucrative deals with apparel companies. Their exploits have been chronicled in magazines and documentary films.“People who have been climbing a long time, like Chongo, might say, ‘Oh, it’s becoming more mainstream,’ ” Davis said. “At the same time, it might help climbers get more recognition.”Chongo parted his hair in the aimless manner of a river, a slapdash press of gray tangling down his neckline turning dun. Hash marks made a small gridiron of his forehead and like ripples emanated from the corners of his lips to his gaunt, high cheekbones. Leathery skin, knowing eyes and a dilettante’s smile gave him the cabalistic twinkle of a movie pirate.He seemed to have found his conversational stride sometime in the early 1980s, incorporating skater slang terms like bitchin’ and rad into his vocabulary long after they had fallen from fashion.He draped his 5-foot-8, 155-pound frame in layers of cotton, the better to adapt to temperature changes without adding much weight. Around his neck he carried a cellphone that looked as if it had come skidding to his feet from the window of a moving car.By his own account, Chongo was born on an American military base in , son of an engineer, the oldest of seven children. He attended Van Nuys High School in ’s San Fernando Valley, took a single calculus course at the and worked for a few years as a computing contractor. He started rock climbing as a teenager, learning to use a basic piton and hammer at Stony Point and Tahquitz Rock in .“I finally got to know what I was doing in my 30s,” he said. “And knowing what I was doing was knowing a lot. A lot of people claim to know what they’re doing. No matter how well you plan, things can still go wrong.”In the 1980s, Chongo moved to , he said. He later told climbers that he had found the odd rubber he used to resole their shoes in the violent Tepito barrio, a claim that gained credence from his proficient Spanish. He stayed there for eight years.“There were a lot of pretty girls in Mexico, and I’ve got blue eyes,” he said, “so that kept me down there.”Returning across the border, Chongo eventually made his way to Yosemite and found a favorite climb in the gorgeous, temperate and arduous Steck-Salathé route up the north face of Sentinel Rock. He learned the form of tightrope walking that was developing into the sports now known as slack-lining and high-lining.“I saw these guys walking on a chain,” he said. “I just knew that was something I could do. I knew that was a game I could play.”In the 1990s, Chongo started making the campgrounds and forests of Yosemite his permanent home. He befriended serious climbers, helping newcomers meet partners and borrow gear.“Pretty fast, all the dirtbag climbers started knowing Chongo,” Ninov said, “and he was the connection.”Chongo earned respect as a journeyman climber, with accomplishments like rope-walking on the Lost Arrow Spire, but he gained more attention as a tinkerer. Climbers trusted him to resole their shoes. They studied his jury-rigged ropes and harnesses. But when they spoke of the spiritual aspects of rock climbing, Chongo played the spoiler.“You go spend all this money to do something that basically only improves the world by improving your outlook on it,” he would say, “and if you don’t take it and do something with it, it’s narcissistic.”Chongo’s innovations and eccentricities came to seem intertwined. Once he designed a complex set of tools allowing him to, in essence, hitchhike up the face of El Capitan. He stayed out on the rock for days on end, asking passing climbers to pull up sections of his gear.“He had all these systems where he could haul all these massive loads with these multipulley systems he had made up,” Davis said. “Just stuff to live on the wall for an indefinite time period.”The same shenanigans that endeared Chongo to rock climbers drew less favorable attention from the authorities. On July 9, 1993, park rangers issued him a warning for exceeding the seven-day limit at the Sunnyside Campground. Though many people lived in the park for extended periods, few made such brazen spectacles of themselves as Chongo.In January 1995, park rangers began to suspect him of running an unauthorized textile business from his tent at the Hidden Valley campground. Learning his nickname, they began including it in police reports as an alias.Under the rangers’ scrutiny, Chongo’s determination to live at Yosemite only increased. He sought out places in the forest to unroll his sleeping bag, or else camped dangling from the great rock formations, out of reach in plain sight.Again and again, rangers cited him for camping violations like commandeering a bear locker to store his effects. His residence appeared in court records as “transient climber.”The transient part was accurate. But Chongo was actually devoting less and less time to rock climbing, turning his attention instead to writing. In 1996, he completed the first edition of “The Complete Book of Big Wall Climbing,” a staggering brain dump of instruction and rumination, 576 pages divided into 21 chapters captioned with Roman numerals and Melvillian headings like Raising Anchor, Quarters and The Hold.He charged $100 for the book and found plenty of takers. Beginning climbers took his oddball wisdom as a guide to technique, etiquette and culture. Every spring, as the California foothills grew thick with weekenders from , Silicon Valley and beyond, demand for the book produced new sales.“He’s a draw; rock climbers know who he is,” said Debbie Collins, who publishes the books from her print shop in Altadena, Calif. “It’s like he’s got the whole thing in his head. He keeps revising later editions to fix a period or a single word.”At the same time, Chongo was growing disenchanted with the sport. The park was crowded with tourists, more than 3.4 million in 2000 compared with 2.2 million in 1970. Apparel companies were paying the top climbers to use their gear. The communal spirit was buckling beneath a new emphasis on setting speed records. And as a popular pastime, climbing was moving indoors, to manmade rocks with grooves of plastic. Some of these were erected in shopping malls.Reading widely, conversing liberally and frequently, Chongo turned his attention to popular physics. Encouraged by sales of the big-wall climbing books, he began to fashion treatises on science.Reluctantly, he embraced his vagrancy as a sort of gimmick. Though he aimed to be taken seriously, he tentatively titled his magnum opus “The Homeless Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.”The science books did not sell.“He’s spent five years on this,” Collins said. “I try to get it through his head that the audience for physics books is so tiny. He’s got delusions of grandeur.”On any given day in the first years of the new century, Chongo could be found at a corner table of the Yosemite lodge cafeteria, agonizing over the details of his manuscripts.Between tomes on science, he produced entertainments like “The Quotable Chongo on How to Be Bitchin’,” a slim volume of aphorisms including “Perfection is mandatory.”But his greatest exertions went toward completing “The Homeless Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics,” a single-spaced work of unbroken text contemplating humanity, infinity, gravitational forces, space, time and destiny. Its final paragraphs spilled across the back cover, giving the effect of a speaker whose microphone has been cut off. It opened with a poem:and all the beautiful scenes, that ever wereFirst never wereThen never, ever were againIn April 2000, park workers found Chongo in their offices making copies. He was charged with misappropriation of property. The next year, rangers impounded his property, 100 pounds of food, bedding and climbing gear stored at the base of the Sea of Dreams route on El Capitan.“Tucker, who is more commonly known as ‘Chongo,’ ” the rangers wrote, “has told various rangers he has been climbing Sea of Dreams for more than a year and a half, and has had climbing equipment, which is clearly visible from the Valley floor, hanging on this route during this period.”At first, the rangers tried reasoning with Chongo. But as the years went on, positions hardened on both sides. The rangers issued more violation notices, and Chongo gave them less information.“I’ve asked Tucker on many occasions where he stays,” Ranger Jack J. Hoeflich wrote in a report. “Tucker is evasive, ignores the question, or states that he can’t tell me.”In 2004, the authorities set out to prove that Chongo was living unlawfully at Yosemite. He had registered to camp exactly 30 times that year, suspiciously matching the annual limit. On Nov. 17, the rangers started recording every sighting of Chongo for comparison to registration records.But short of confessing, Chongo did little to disguise his residence. He viewed Yosemite as his rightful home. He voted on a provisional ballot from the park. He rented a post office box. He even bragged to rangers that “if one simply writes, Chongo, Yosemite, CA on a letter, then he will receive it.”As winter 2004 set in, the rangers began compiling evidence to charge Chongo with four misdemeanor violations of camping regulations, each carrying a maximum penalty of six months in jail. In a police report supporting the case, Ranger Edward Visnovske detailed five years of his observations.“It is assumed that Tucker has lived most of his life this way, looking for ‘loopholes’ in society to allow him to exist without a job or a home as we know them,” Visnovske wrote. “Tucker had become a master of counter-surveillance and would go through incredible routines to insure that he was not being followed.”The case of United States of America vs. Charles V. Tucker opened before federal Magistrate Judge William M. Wunderlich of the Eastern District of California on Oct. 5, 2005. In his small courtroom near Yosemite Village, the judge heard two days of testimony.“When he had his trial here, we had his courthouse packed every day,” said Fidelman, the photographer. “He means something to a lot of people here.”Several climbers, including Dean Potter, testified for the defense. Seeking to discredit the prosecution’s circumstantial evidence of illegal camping, Potter and others swore they had driven Chongo in and out of the park, putting him up in their homes for weeks on end.Chongo was convicted on three of the four counts. He left Yosemite National Park by bus.A New View of the StarsAlong the American River through central Sacramento, the Dos Rios Triangle neighborhood gives way to a nameless expanse of industrial parks, depots, drainage systems and halfway houses where the homeless, the formerly homeless and the soon-to-be homeless pass from station to station.Across from a pornography shop, the Sisters of Mercy operate an expansive day shelter called Loaves & Fishes. From inside a trailer, the Sacramento Homeless Organizing Committee publishes the Homeward Street Journal, chronicling advocacy efforts. Its back pages carry advertisements, cartoons, obituaries, poetry and, in recent issues, a full-page column on topics like special relativity, credited to “the homeless science writer, Chongo.”To the regular crowd at Loaves & Fishes, Chongo has become a familiar figure, discussing his thoughts on quantum mechanics and giving demonstrations of slack-lining. He has returned to Yosemite only briefly. Jerry Maciulla, 53, who works part-time in the shelter’s storage shed, said he was aware that Chongo “was supposedly a world-class rock climber.”“I know what he’s talking about, but I wouldn’t try it now that I’ve got a wife and two kids,” Maciulla said. “You’re taking your life in your hands with those sports.”But others have found Chongo’s place in sports history of smaller consequence than his gentle approach to everyday troubles. He has forged friendships, or at least truces, with security guards at several transit yards, warehouse facilities and other places considered prime for clandestine bivouacking. In this manner, he has helped negotiate safe harbor for homeless men like John Kraintz, 54, a skeletal figure who wears a rubber band in his beard and sways from side to side when he speaks.“He’s sort of a guru, sort of a teacher who sort of raises a bar that needs a lot of raising,” Kraintz said. “Inspiration in a place where there’s a lack of hope.”From the trailer office, Chongo emerged one morning on crutches, which he used to propel himself across the courtyard.“This place is kind of where you can go and the cops don’t mess with you,” he said. “I’ve learned a lot about the true homeless lifestyle here. This is the jail fodder. It used to be you could go out and stay at these places I stayed at, but as time went on, they made laws against that. You couldn’t just go out and rock-climb and not consume.”In the dining room, volunteers were spooning out meals designed to provide the full caloric content for an entire day, nacho pie with meat, beans and olives, sliced bread with thick slabs of butter, salad, oranges, Fig Newtons and Gatorade.Picking at his meal, Chongo spoke of his time climbing rocks at Yosemite.“I provided a great deal of inspiration to a lot of people to pursue a narcissistic activity, and I wonder if I’ve done good,” he said. Though camping in the park had been a kind of homelessness, he said, “I didn’t understand what it meant. I didn’t realize I was automatically a member of this community.”Later, as the shelter locked its gates, Chongo hauled his pack through the procession trudging toward the riverbeds, night shelters and overpasses. He passed a man strapped with an ankle monitor, another marcher in the homeless parade.“I love to sleep outdoors,” Chongo said. “Fresh air is best.”At an abandoned parking lot by the Alkali Flats train station, he dropped his knapsack and his crutches and climbed onto a cable drooping between two 4-foot-high poles, momentarily converting this small piece of the urban landscape into a slack-line. He took a tentative step, found his balance and then danced ahead with no partner as the wire tautened behind his weight.1274 2008-09-30 Frustration, and then panic, coursed through the markets. Investors feared the decision in Washington would imperil the financial industry, as well as the broader economy.At the Federal Reserve and other central banks, policy makers were also anxious. Even before the vote on Capitol Hill, central bankers tried to jump-start the credit markets. They offered hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to banks around the world because banks and investors were unwilling to lend to each other. But neither the stock market nor the credit markets appeared to respond.Just 24 hours earlier, few imagined Monday would play out this way. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced Sunday afternoon they had agreed on terms of a bailout.But while Congressional aides and lawmakers worked on the details, the credit crisis that began more than a year ago in the American mortgage market was setting off new alarms in Europe.Shortly before 6 p.m. New York time on Sunday, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg agreed to invest $16.2 billion to rescue a big bank, Fortis. A few hours later, the German government and a group of banks pledged $43 billion to save Hypo Real Estate, a commercial property lender. At 2:50 a.m., news came that the British Treasury had seized the lender Bradford & Bingley and sold the bulk of it to Banco Santander of Spain.“We will continue to do what is necessary,” a somber Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, told reporters at 10 Downing Street in London.In Tokyo, where stocks had opened higher in early trading on Monday, worries quickly set in. Traders returned from lunch to reports suggesting the financial crisis was taking a toll on the global economy. Markets across Asia began to sell off.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 sank 1.5 percent. In India, stocks fell nearly 4 percent. In Hong Kong, where a big bank, HSBC, raised key lending rates because of the credit market turmoil, the Hang Seng tumbled nearly 4.3 percent.As events unfolded in Asia, a major American bank was in trouble. Regulators in Washington were rushing to broker the sale of the Wachovia Corporation to Citigroup or Wells Fargo.At about 4 a.m., Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, called Citigroup executives to say Wachovia’s banking business was theirs.On Monday morning, before financial markets in the United States had opened, Federal Reserve officials were alarmed that credit markets in Europe and Asia had spiraled even deeper into crisis on Monday.Fed officials could see that money markets were freezing up in every part of the world, even though the Fed and other central banks had expanded their emergency lending programs last Thursday. This time, Fed officials felt compelled to provide a true show of force by expanding their existing loan arrangements by an unprecedented $330 billion.As investors in New York were getting up, the credit markets were again flashing red as banks reported higher borrowing costs. Investors continued to seek safety in Treasuries. The yield on one-year Treasury bills, for instance, fell to almost zero, meaning investors were willing to accept no return just for the assurance that they would get their money back.When trading opened on the New York Exchange at 9:30 a.m., stocks immediately fell 1 percent.Worried officials at the Fed announced at 10 a.m. that the central bank would increase to $620 billion its program to lend money through foreign central banks, up from $290 billion, to keep credit flowing. The central bank also said it would double the money it lends out domestically through an auction program to $300 billion.Many eyes on Wall Street turned to National City, the Cleveland-based bank, which has a $20 billion portfolio of troubled loans it is trying to sell. National City’s shares plummeted 50 percent to $1.50 in early trading, prompting Peter E. Raskind, the bank’s chief executive, to assert that the bank was sound.“It’s not overly dramatic to say that investors are panicking. You can see it in the market and we can feel it,” Mr. Raskind said in an interview.In New York, 10 executives at an investment firm, Bessemer Trust, huddled to discuss the markets. A question arose: What would it take to restore confidence to the credit markets? There were few upbeat answers, though one said Citigroup’s takeover of Wachovia could pave the way for more consolidation in banking. “It is the type of solution that makes good sense in these challenging times,” Marc D. Stern, Bessemer Trust ’s chief investment officer, said as he recounted the meeting.But Mr. Stern and his group would soon be dismayed by what was happening in Washington.At 1:30 p.m. the House began to vote on the rescue package that Mr. Paulson and Congressional leaders negotiated over the weekend. About 10 minutes later, when it became clear that the legislation was in trouble, the stock market went into a free fall, with the Dow plunging about 400 points in five minutes.At his home office in Great Neck, N.Y., Edward Yardeni, the investment strategist, received terse e-mail messages from clients and friends. “Is this the end of the world?” one asked. Another sent a simple plea: “Stop the world, I want to get off.”Mr. Yardeni and other analysts said the action in Washington left many investors discouraged and feeling powerless. “You can come into the office and spend a lot of time researching companies, trying to understand them. You’ve got a portfolio that you think should do well,” he said. “And none of that matters.”Marc Groz, chief executive of Topos Partners, a hedge fund in Stamford, Conn., put it this way: “It’s frustrating for someone like me because I don’t have a pipeline to what is happening in Washington, D.C.”The stock market briefly rallied, then slowly lost ground in the afternoon. A flurry of sales minutes before the close sent the Dow down another 200 points, to its lowest level for the day.Shortly after the closing bell rang on the floor of the Big Board, Mr. Paulson, looking exhausted, spoke to reporters at the White House. He lamented the vote, but vowed to keep pressing Congress for a broad rescue plan to help ease stress in the credit markets.1275 2008-09-30 You have probably seen a document that looks very much like this.
