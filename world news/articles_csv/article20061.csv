"'06-01-01,'0','Federation officials said the committee would begin interviewing the athletes by telephone as early as Sunday. Nardiello did not respond to telephone messages seeking comment Saturday.""We have to see if the allegations have any legs to stand on, with Tim having the right to confront those who are making the allegations,"" said Dan Goodwin, the federation's vice president and general counsel. ""The committee will then make its recommendations to the U.S.B.S.F. board. The board has the right to accept or reject the recommendations of the committee.""The skeleton team is scheduled to leave Friday for a World Cup race in Konigsee, Germany, and Goodwin said the federation hoped to have a conclusion by then.One of the board members appointed to the grievance committee, Nancy Pierpoint, sent her resignation to the rest of the board in an e-mail message earlier in the day. But she will stay through the inquiry.The United States Olympic Committee had members of its legal department contact athletes Saturday, scheduling interviews for its investigation. Regardless what the federation decides, the U.S.O.C. can refuse to grant an Olympic credential to Nardiello. It can also take further action against the federation if it determines the accusations were not handled properly.Canfield, 40, said she wished it had not taken her sending an e-mail message to the board detailing her experiences to prompt an investigation.She said a group of athletes had approached Fallon Vaughn, the wife of the federation's executive director, Robie Vaughn, with their accusations in October. But the federation's response until Saturday was that it did not have any ""first-hand"" accounts of harassment.In an e-mail message on Thursday, however, Robie Vaughn told the board that the federation had looked into the harassment accusations and would ask for Nardiello's resignation after the Olympics.""It's clear that there were some serious attempts by others to get this addressed months ago, and the response of the federation forced my hand when they claimed they did not have any first-hand information, and that while they admitted there were ongoing, recurrent problems, they did not feel they needed to take action,"" Canfield wrote in an e-mail message to The Times. ""The timing is unfortunate. But they had every opportunity to deal with this years ago.""Two letters corroborating the athletes' accusations were sent to the federation several days ago by Chuck and Kitty Panza of Salt Lake City, who are federation jury members who travel to officiate events. In their letters, they described Nardiello as having used inappropriate sexual language with athletes, including at times when younger athletes nearby heard the exchanges.""We witnessed these things over a period of three years,"" Chuck Panza said in a telephone interview. ""We were hoping the federation would handle the matter differently.""Kitty Panza wrote that several female athletes had shared stories with her of encounters with Nardiello that made them uncomfortable. Panza said she shared the accusations with a team leader, only to have Nardiello confront her at an event.Other skeleton team members defend Nardiello. Noelle Pikus-Pace, who is trying to return from a broken leg and hopes to qualify for the Olympic team, said that Nardiello had said some inappropriate things early in his coaching tenure.""Maybe at the beginning, when he first became our coach, because he didn't understand how to treat women and what to say to them,"" Pikus-Pace said. ""But I haven't heard anything from him as of recent, in the past two years, at least. He's been great. He's been really trying to work with us, and if we've had issues with him and talked to him about it, he's fixed them.""The top men's skeleton rider, Zach Lund, also said he supported Nardiello. ""It's just a witch hunt,"" he said. ""All of these charges are by people who didn't make the Olympic team and aren't satisfied by their own results and want to blame it on someone else.""Canfield and Gale are not in contention for the Olympic team. The only woman who has clinched an Olympic berth is Katie Uhlaender of Breckinridge, Colo.Greg Sand, the assistant national team coach, is among those who could be asked to assume Nardiello's duties. But Sand said he had not heard anything from the federation.'"
"'06-01-01,'0','""It was horrifying and embarrassing: getting foreclosure notices; lawyers knocking on your door wanting their money and no work to be found,"" the actress recalled recently over lunch at the Algonquin Hotel in Manhattan. ""It was basically, who do you pay at the end of the month. You have to pay the mortgage. You have to pay the taxes, food and electricity and lawyers.""Since those years, Ms. Bracco said, she has determinedly paid off much of her $2 million in debt to the lawyers in her bankruptcy and custody cases as well as nearly $500,000 in back taxes.""I owe my last $50,000 to the bankruptcy lawyers,"" she said, sounding somewhat relieved. And the increasing success of ""The Sopranos"" has allowed her to accumulate several million dollars in assets.""The show was a blessing,"" she said. ""It gives me huge financial security."" It meant I could think, 'Oh, my God! I can go to work next year; I don't really have to worry.' ""For the twice-divorced actress, bankruptcy has underscored the importance of financial independence. ""It made me more committed to putting enough money away so that I would never have to worry,"" Ms. Bracco said.""The Sopranos"" has helped her move closer to that goal. Income from the series, along with her earnings from the 2001 film ""Riding in Cars With Boys"" and the Broadway production of ""The Graduate"" in 2002, all went to pay her legal fees, she said. Ms. Bracco even took a loan to help pay the back taxes she owed the government.One asset that she kept through it all was her waterfront home on two acres in Sneden's Landing, in Rockland County, N.Y. ""I figured I should have two consistent things for the kids: me and our home,"" she said. ""I was land-rich and cash-poor.""Today, she is nearly out of the woods, she said.""A few more bills and it is all done,"" said her accountant, Bert Padell, of Padell, Nadell, Fine & Weinberger. HBO's decision to extend ""The Sopranos"" through 2007 could bring her about $4 million before taxes, he said. And her real estate holdings, which include a house in Bridgehampton that she bought two years ago, along with the Sneden's Landing property, may be worth a net $6 million.That is not a bad nest egg for a woman whose father got up every morning at 2 a.m. to sell fish at the Fulton Fish Market.Ms. Bracco became a money maker in her youth in Brooklyn. Though some classmates called her the ugliest girl in the sixth grade, Ms. Bracco had big dreams and confided to her high-school English teacher that she wanted to model. With his encouragement, she called the top agencies, including Wilhelmina Models. Wilhelmina Cooper herself took one look at the 16-year-old teenager and came to the family's house to sign a modeling contract that paid her $50 an hour. Her career landed her in Paris just three years later.""I got off the plane and I thought, 'I belong here,' "" Ms. Bracco recalled. ""It was like déjà vu."" She made enough of a splash on the French modeling circuit to infatuate a prince. Prince Jean Poniatowski, a member of a prestigious Parisian family, took her to dinner at the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles and wanted to buy her lavish gifts. But when he offered to get her an expensive car, she felt uncomfortable.""Everyone was telling me to marry him,"" she recalled. "" 'You will be a princess,' "" she remembered her friends saying.""I said to Jean, 'Princesses don't come from Brooklyn.' And he would say to me, 'Lorraine, you are so wrong,' "" Ms. Bracco recalled, with a raucous, nonprincess laugh.Over the years Ms. Bracco has dated other rich men, including the entrepreneur Ronald O. Perelman, but her long-term relationships have not been with superwealthy men. She says that she has never had a prenuptial agreement because ""I never married anybody with any money.""She never had ""that Cinderella thing,"" she said.""I never had that view of being taken care of,"" she added. ""I don't know why. I just never wanted to be dependent, to ask to buy my underwear."" With wealthy men, there is, Ms. Bracco believes, ""an uneven balance.""In 1978, Ms. Bracco married Daniel Guerard, a Frenchman who had a chain of hair salons in France and Italy. A year later, they had a daughter -- whom Ms. Bracco named Margaux, after the wine. The couple later divorced.""The only thing I got in the divorce was Margaux,"" she said of her daughter, who returned to the United States with her mother.When Ms. Bracco moved in with Harvey Keitel after meeting him in Paris at a film opening, he was the breadwinner, she said. ""It was one of the only times I think I was not 100 percent self-sufficient,"" she added. ""After a little bit of time, I got on my feet.""As her career took off, the couple pooled their finances and over the years made money in real estate, including a TriBeCa apartment, which was sold during her bankruptcy. After breaking up with Mr. Keitel, Ms. Bracco married the actor Edward James Olmos in 1994 but handled her own finances. ""With Eddie it was separate"" because his business interests were in California, she said.She and Mr. Olmos were divorced several years ago in the wake of the court battle with Mr. Keitel for custody of Stella. It ended with Stella in Ms. Bracco's custody, and with Mr. Olmos banned from seeing Stella alone, Ms. Bracco said. An assistant said that Mr. Olmos was traveling and could not be reached for comment.Currently, Ms. Bracco is dating Jason Cipolla, 30, a driver for the show. ""He is young, but he has an old soul,"" Ms. Bracco said. As for their finances, ""Sometimes he pays and sometimes I pay.""In her search for financial independence, Ms. Bracco sticks to one investment: real estate.""I never bought a stock in my life,"" she said. ""I don't understand it. To me it is like Chinese.""Real estate, on the other hand, ""is like porn for me,"" she said. ""Listen, if I am going to get in a cab to go home, and I see a sign for an open house, I will go in. I like real estate because I am the boss."" Ms. Bracco sees herself as ""an entrepreneur of real estate.""The house in Sneden's Landing is up for sale, Ms. Bracco said, because she has decided that she wants to be in Manhattan now that Margaux and Stella are both in their 20's.Some commentators who track personal investing strategies say they believe that Ms. Bracco is taking a big risk with such a heavy bet on real estate.Suze Orman, for example, the best-selling author, says that because real estate is tangible, it gives some women the feeling that ""they are in control. They can see it and touch it."" But, she said, it is not a wise strategy because an investor needs to diversify.Ms. Bracco says she doesn't care. ""I diversify, but I do it by ZIP code,"" she said.Her financial strategy actually is not quite that simple. ""The truth in acting is that we are all hired help,"" Ms. Bracco said. ""We are a commodity. There is no difference between being an actor and pork bellies. I can't change that, but I want to be the master of something that I create.""That something is a wine venture that she is embarking on with Vincent Viola, a liquor importer introduced to her by her accountant, Mr. Padell.Mr. Viola and Ms. Bracco soon expect to begin importing a line of ""Bracco Wines"" from Italy. She has an equity stake in the business but is not putting up any capital.""I am not just another actress selling perfume or a hair product,"" Ms. Bracco said.Ms. Bracco can count on the next two seasons of ""The Sopranos"" to keep her name in lights and her income flowing.She says she has only two regrets. ""I never had a son,"" she said, ""and I never had a minivan.""'"
"'06-01-01,'0','Mr. Bloomberg's first inaugural address, on New Year's Day 2002, was overshadowed by the dark clouds of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He was new to politics then, and his delivery drew critiques -- even from supporters -- as being wooden and monotonous. Mr. Bloomberg, however, has come a long way as a politician, and aides have been busily working on his address for weeks now.If the speech manages to impress at all, it will be among a few exceptions, according to some scholars. Those include the first-term inaugurals of men who could arguably be called three of the city's greatest mayors -- Fiorello H. La Guardia, Edward I. Koch and Rudolph W. Giuliani -- because they aimed high and then delivered on key promises over the next four years, and the address of David N. Dinkins, the city's first black mayor, which eloquently raised hopes for racial harmony and public safety, which would largely go unfulfilled.Mr. Bloomberg's inauguration ceremony will look and feel like those of his recent predecessors: an outside affair held in front of a City Hall bedecked with flags and bunting in chilling temperatures.Before 1966, inaugurations were typically held inside City Hall, in the chambers of the City Council or the old Board of Estimate. But John V. Lindsay broke with tradition that year by holding his at night on the floodlit steps of City Hall, which, in effect, challenged his successors to offer speeches that would spare their audience frostbite as well as boredom. He urged New Yorkers to ""enlist in the fight for a better New York"" and got the most applause when he denounced defiant transit workers who had gone on strike that morning.It was but one in a long list of speeches of inconsistent quality and delivery over the decades.In 1926, James J. Walker cut short his inaugural speech when a woman in the packed chamber fainted. He skipped the last few paragraphs and said, ""That is substantially my message of today.""In 1934, inheriting a city hobbled by the Depression, La Guardia eschewed the traditional ceremony, but raced from one city agency to another delivering a message of civic virtue and nonpartisanship: ""Clean house and clean it thoroughly."" In a radio address, he also delivered the Athenian oath to transmit the city not only ""not less, but far greater and more beautiful than it was transmitted to us.""Thomas Kessner, a City University historian and La Guardia biographer, said that by reciting the oath of the young men of Athens, an oath repeated decades later by Mr. Giuliani, the new mayor ""certainly signaled that this would be a different administration.""In 1978, Mr. Koch took the bus from his apartment in Greenwich Village to City Hall, where he warned that ""when we no longer waste our resources in ways that help no one, we will be able to help everyone."" Accepting the reins of a city that had nearly gone bankrupt, he added: ""These have been hard times. We have been tested by fire. We have been drawn across the knife-edge of poverty. We have been inundated by problems. We have been shaken by troubles that would have destroyed any other city. But we are not any other city. We are the City of New York, and New York in adversity towers above any other city in the world.""And then, said Chris McNickle, author of ""To Be Mayor of New York,"" Mr. Koch managed to ""make good on that"" by balancing the budget ahead of schedule.Mr. Koch was succeeded in 1990 by Mr. Dinkins, of whom a predecessor, Abraham D. Beame, said, ""In my memory no mayor has ever inherited a more serious and overwhelming condition in both financial and social problems."" (Mr. Beame's inaugural promised to ""earn public respect for our governmental institutions by showing that we can provide high quality services and that we can operate on a fiscally responsible basis,"" but by the end of his one term the city was all but placed into receivership by the state.)Mr. Dinkins hailed New York's ""gorgeous mosaic"" of diversity and quoted Lincoln as calling America ""the last, best hope of earth.""""In advancing that hope, our most powerful weapon is example,"" he said. ""And this year this city has given powerful proof of the proposition that all of us are created equal. I stand here before you today as the elected leader of the greatest city of a great nation, to which my ancestors were brought, chained and whipped in the hold of a slave ship. We have not finished the journey toward liberty and justice. But surely we have come a long way.""But Mr. Dinkins's soothing oratory proved insufficient to achieve racial harmony, and he appeared as if he had to be prodded to deliver on his inaugural vow to be ""the toughest mayor on crime this city has ever seen."" Like Mr. Beame, he was defeated after one term.In 1994, Mr. Giuliani generously saluted Mr. Dinkins, but signaled a new direction on what he called a ""day of new beginning"" and of ""dramatic change.""""The era of fear has had a long enough reign,"" he said. ""The period of doubt has run its course. As of this moment, the expressions of cynicism -- New York is not governable, New York is not manageable, New York is not worth it -- all of these I declare politically incorrect.""To his litany of goals, he added the mantra, ""It should be so and it will be so,"" which his son, Andrew, echoed at the podium.""Giuliani came in saying he would restore public safety and order and prove the city was governable, and it's fair to say that he did that,"" Mr. McNickle said.In 2002, taking office just half a mile from the ruins of the World Trade Center, Michael R. Bloomberg declared, ""New York is safe, strong, open for business and ready to lead the world in the 21st century.""He promised to govern ""free from partisanship,"" which he largely did. He demanded that ""the public through the mayor must control the school system,"" which he accomplished. He pledged, ""we cannot raise taxes,"" which he and the City Council found they needed to do.Mr. Bloomberg promised strong leadership, Mr. McNickle said, and he delivered, particularly in dealing with an early budget crisis and in placing the Education Department under mayoral control.Mr. Bloomberg's second inaugural is a rare opportunity because he cannot run again, says he has no other aspirations for public office and is not politically beholden, so he can propose a bold agenda that he might be in a unique position to fulfill.'"
"'06-01-01,'0','But other doctors continue to say that the drugs should be prescribed cautiously, especially because clinical trials have found that the drugs work only modestly better than placebo pills for most patients.Antidepressants are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the United States, with almost 200 million prescriptions written each year.A second study, also published today in the psychiatry journal, found that only about 30 percent of patients taking citalopram, a widely used antidepressant sold under the brand name Celexa, recovered fully after 12 weeks of treatment. That figure is comparable to the recovery rate for a placebo, which is generally estimated at 25 percent to 30 percent.The National Institute of Mental Health financed both studies, and the doctors who conducted them said that drug companies played no part in analyzing the data. The psychiatry journal is published by the American Psychiatric Association, which represents about 35,000 doctors.Dr. Gregory Simon, the psychiatrist who led the study examining suicide risks, said he hoped that it would allay the fears of the parents of teenagers who are considering taking an antidepressant.""The risk of a serious suicide attempt or a suicide in people taking an antidepressant is quite low, and on average the risk goes down, not up, after people start taking those medicines,"" Dr. Simon said.Dr. Simon is a researcher at Group Health Cooperative, a nonprofit insurer in the Pacific Northwest that covers about 500,000 people. The study examined suicides and hospitalizations for suicide attempts in the medical records of 65,103 members of Group Health who received antidepressants from 1992 to 2003.The study found that patients were significantly more likely to attempt or commit suicide in the month before they began drug therapy than in the six months after starting it.On one level, that finding is not surprising, because a serious suicide attempt is likely to prompt psychiatric treatment. But if the newer antidepressants posed a significant suicide risk, suicide attempts would probably rise, not fall, after treatment began, Dr. Simon said.In addition, Prozac and the other newer antidepressants, often called S.S.R.I.'s, for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, appeared to be associated with a faster and larger reduction in risk than older classes of antidepressants, which are no longer commonly used.Dr. Robert Freedman, the editor of The American Journal of Psychiatry, said he believed the study ""had real public health implications.""The study is not perfect, because it did not compare the experiences of patients who were treated with non-drug therapy or no therapy to those who took an antidepressant, Dr. Freedman said.The F.D.A. generally views the results of randomized clinical trials as more important than those of epidemiological studies like the one conducted by Dr. Simon. In a clinical trial, researchers do examine the effects of two different treatments on two groups of patients who have carefully been selected so they are identical. That way, scientists can assume that any difference in the outcomes of the two groups is produced by the two treatments.But in Dr. Simon's study, patients were not given another kind of treatment, so it is difficult to know whether their suicide rates fell because of the antidepressants they were given or for another reason.Nonetheless, the findings are striking, Dr. Freedman said. ""This was a huge sample of real patients,"" he said. ""It's the first evidence that the drugs are actually changing suicide rates.""In the second study, researchers tracked 2,876 depressed people who were taking citalopram under the care of psychiatrists or primary care doctors. Based on a widely used measure of depression, about 28 percent of the patients had recovered fully by the end of the study, with 15 percent showing some improvement.Another measure showed slightly better results, with 33 percent achieving remission.Patients who were female, white or married were significantly more likely to recover than those who were black, single or male. Response rates were very similar for people being treated by psychiatrists and for those being treated by primary care physicians.The trial did not compare people taking citalopram with those taking other antidepressants, other types of therapy or placebos. But the results were consistent with other clinical trials that show that antidepressants are in general only modestly -- if at all -- more effective than a placebo in treating depression.In fact, patients taking the highest doses of citalopram, 50 milligrams a day or more, were less likely to improve than those taking lower doses.The study is part of a longer trial financed by the National Institute of Mental Health that examined ways to treat depression in people who do not respond to initial drug therapy.Later phases will examine different drugs, multidrug combinations and drugs in combination with therapy, said Dr. Madhukar Trivedi, professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and the study's lead author.""The good news is we got a third of patients to remission,"" he said.'"
"'06-01-01,'0','Over years of breeding, Rau has made great progress creating zebras that look like quaggas. With each generation, his herds show fewer and fainter stripes in the back. ""Even we have been surprised by the progress,"" he told me. Last January, Henry, Rau's most convincing quagga foal yet, was born on a private preserve outside Cape Town. Rau says that Henry, a third-generation descendant (on his mother's side) of the project's original zebras, is very near to perfection. He has some of the brownish color quaggas had and, if not for a few stripes on Henry's hocks -- the joint in the middle of the hind leg -- Rau says he would be tempted to announce that the project was done. His life's work would be finished, and to his mind, a great ecological wrong righted.Still, Rau's project raises a lot of questions. Most central among them: If you breed something that looks like a certain animal, does that mean you have actually recreated that animal? What, in other words, gives an animal its identity -- its genetic makeup? Its history? Its behavior? Its habitat? The problem, as it was put to me by Oliver Ryder, who directs a project at the San Diego Zoo to preserve rare-animal DNA, is that even if Rau succeeds in creating an animal with the exact appearance of a quagga, uncertainty will remain about what he has done. ""We won't be able to know,"" Ryder said, ""how much quagga-ness is in it.""Extinction is always a sad story, but the quagga's is sadder than most. The animal once lived in vast herds, often intermixed with gnu and ostriches, ""for the society of which bird especially,"" the 19th-century English explorer Capt. William Cornwallis Harris noted, ""it evinces the most singular predilection."" That was probably Harris's fancy: in reality little is known about the quagga's behavior other than that it grazed on plains grass and emitted a bark -- kwahaah! -- in moments of danger or excitement. Dutch settlers recorded the name as ""quacha,"" with a guttural ""ch,"" and that remains the correct way to pronounce it: KWAH-ha.The quagga had an unfortunate series of interactions with humans. Sportsmen on the Cape of Good Hope hunted the animal with enthusiasm. That was the first blow to the quagga. The second blow was an influx of farmers of Dutch or German origin, known as Voortrekkers, in the early 19th century into the quagga's home territory, the Karoo plain. The farmers did not want quaggas sharing grass with their livestock. When they saw a quagga, they shot it. They used the hide and gave the meat to the servants. (An 1838 article in The Penny Magazine commented that while the whites thought quagga tasted no better than horseflesh, ""the natives, however, relish it."") The number of quaggas soon went into free fall. By the 1860's, they were scarce. A few decades earlier they numbered in the tens of thousands. By the 1870's there appeared to be none left in Africa.Two things make the extinction of the quagga especially heart-rending. First was the manner of its disappearance. The quagga left the world so quietly that when the Cape Town colony finally put in place legislation to protect the animal, in 1886, the government didn't even know that the last quagga in the world died nearly three years before. Not only were there no quaggas living anywhere anymore, there were also apparently almost no dead quaggas to be found, either: little to nothing in the way of quagga rugs, stuffed quaggas, quagga photographs. An article in The New York Times in 1900 noted that ""one poor skin in the Natural History Museum, London"" seemed to be ""all that remains of this noble creature to prove that it ever existed.""The other depressing thing about the disappearance of the quagga is that its fate seemed somehow connected to its ordinariness. The plains zebra, after all, filled a similar niche in nature. It, too, ate grassland that humans wanted for their livestock. But the plains zebra is a regal, stunning animal -- ""fierce, strong, fleet and surpassingly beautiful"" in Captain Harris's words -- whereas the quagga was ragtag. It seemed the sketch of something of which the plains zebra was the full realization, and so no one thought to save it.But the quagga never entirely disappeared from memory. Its extinction has always managed to touch a few individuals, at different times and different places. It was one of the motivating forces behind a European pact in 1900 to preserve vanishing African species like the giraffe and the rhinoceros. And Otto Antonius, director of the Vienna zoo from 1924 to 1945, commissioned a painting called ""The Extermination of the Quagga"" -- in which men on horseback fire as donkeylike heads rear up before a fusillade of bullets -- as a reminder of the tragedy of the animal's elimination. Today, thanks to Rau, who bought the painting from Antonius's daughter, ""The Extermination of the Quagga"" belongs to the Quagga Breeding Project and can be found in the museum where Rau has his office.Rau first became interested in the fate of the quagga in 1959, soon after he arrived at the South African Museum, where he came upon a poorly maintained stuffed quagga foal. It offended his professional standards as a taxidermist to see an extinct animal so neglected. ""It was most crudely stuffed and stuck in the midst of other animals -- I felt someone ought to do something about it,"" he recalled not long ago, when I first met him in Cape Town. ""If you consider how ignorance and greed wiped out the quagga, this is a tragedy,"" he told me. He began to think he had a responsibility -- even a destiny -- to ""reverse this disaster.""Rau is 73, a barrel-chested, compact man with a white beard and eyebrows that curl in spires over his eyes like the native South African plant spekboom. He has the intensity of people who have spent a long time opposing conventional thinking. When he began his quagga project, he expected -- correctly -- that he would meet with resistance from the scientific community. ""Never trust a taxidermist on taxonomy,"" he said to me, with dry bitterness.At the outset, Rau had no guidelines to follow. He knew as well as anyone that extinction was forever. (Even today, despite ""Jurassic Park"" fantasies, no one has been able to clone an extinct animal because DNA typically degrades too quickly.) But in the early 1970's he remembered something unusual he saw in his youth. When he was growing up near Frankfurt some 30 years before, he went to a circus where an animal called an auroch was paraded. The auroch, a powerful ox, had been extinct since the early 17th century, but two brothers, Lutz and Heinz Heck, both German zoo directors, each tried in the 1920's to recreate the beast by scrupulously mating existing breeds of cattle with one another -- getting the auroch's body size from one, its coloring from another.Rau suspected that it might be possible to reverse the extinction of the quagga the same way. The key would be to find the characteristics of the quagga in the existing zebra population, select zebras that exhibited such characteristics and breed them to bring out those characteristics. Paradoxically, what in part had condemned the quagga to extinction -- its close relationship to the plains zebra -- might now be its salvation.Of course, there was a scientific objection to overcome. Most taxonomists have held that the quagga and the plains zebra were entirely separate species. While there is no universally accepted definition of a species -- it is some combination of genetic difference, physical difference and inability to interbreed and produce fertile offspring (among other evolving criteria) -- in general, taxonomists believe they know a species when they see it. By most definitions it is impossible to breed one separate species from another: they have diverged permanently, and you cannot reverse the evolutionary history to rejoin them. But Rau maintained that the quagga was merely a subspecies, or a color variant, of the plains zebra -- distantly related enough to look different but closely related enough to be a candidate for interbreeding.At the time, Rau had no captive zebra stock and no land to graze zebras on, so he couldn't test his hypothesis. And when he looked for help in starting up his project, he got nowhere. A letter from one national park official in South Africa described his project as ""an academic exercise of very dubious conservation value."" But Rau did not let the rejections demoralize him. ""As a nonscientist, I could afford to have scientists look and sniff at me,"" he said. ""I did not care about their opinions, and I did not have to care.""He began to gather evidence that the quagga had been a subspecies of the plains zebra. For one thing, he discovered, European colonists, following the Hottentots' example, apparently regarded the two animals as interchangeable: they used the word ""quagga"" for both. Also, Rau knew taxidermy -- hides -- and he knew that plains zebras were far from uniformly striped. In fact, as you went south, their stripes faded out, and they got browner. In other words, they became more quaggalike. That suggested a spectrum between quaggas and zebras, rather than two boxes with one species in each.The next step was to examine as many preserved quagga specimens as he could. Though there are known photographs of only one living quagga, there are 23 mounted quaggas preserved at various museums throughout the world. (There had been 24 until 1945, when drunken Russian troops occupying a villa where the Germans had moved the museum holdings of Konigsberg threw one out a window.) Rau visited many of the extant quaggas in the early 70's, carefully cataloging their markings. He went to Mainz, Leiden, Munich, Wiesbaden and Amsterdam. He was approaching 40 and had no other obligations in his life. (""I had a fiancée once,"" he told me enigmatically. ""She married an American."") As his expertise in quagga became known, he was invited by museums to restore the tattered quaggas he found, and when he did, feeling he was correcting the errors of previous taxidermists, he made small changes -- old preserved skin has very little give -- that also had the effect of making the animals look more like plains zebras. If he could not shape the future, it seemed, he could at least remake the past.For all Rau's diligence, he couldn't find any institutional support. Without it, he did not have the resources to keep and breed animals. ""I was about to give up,"" he told me. Then in 1981 he heard from Oliver Ryder, a geneticist associated with the San Diego Zoo. Ryder was looking for blood and skin samples of living zebras, but Rau wrote him back that he had something better -- muscle and blood vessels preserved from extinct quaggas. (Whoever had first skinned those quaggas had done a sloppy job, leaving small pieces of flesh connected to the hide.) Ryder was thrilled. It was the moment Rau had been waiting for -- he had been keeping bits of quagga flesh in reserve ever since he remounted a quagga in 1969 -- and he sent the samples off.Over the next few years, researchers successfully extracted portions of DNA from the quagga tissue -- an achievement that in 1984 made front-page news throughout the world. (In the book ""Jurassic Park,"" the successful recovery of quagga DNA emboldens entrepreneurial scientists to try cloning dinosaurs.) Rau, however, was not interested in the big news of the announcement: that cloning extinct animals might one day be possible. He was interested in a related experiment by Ryder, published the following year, which compared the proteins in plains zebras and quaggas and reported that ""the quagga probably ought to be considered a variant of the plains zebra and not a distant species."" In a letter to Rau, Ryder wrote, ""This, I am sure, does not surprise you.""For Rau, this was the long-sought confirmation that his dream was achievable. A quagga could, in theory, be bred back into existence from zebras. On the strength of this result, in part, Rau was able to move his project forward. In 1986, the Namibian national parks agreed to supply him with a group of plains zebras, and one year later it sent him a hodgepodge of zebras captured in the Etosha National Park. Rau had arranged with the Cape Department of Nature Conservation for a farm to be set aside for the zebras and to have them delivered there. Some zebras died on the way, and some were the wrong color for the experiment. ""I was not impressed overall with the quality of what we had,"" Rau recalled. Still, after 12 years of trying to get the world's attention, he was glad he could make a start.This past August, on the 122nd anniversary of the death of the last quagga, I visited the Amsterdam Zoo, where the quagga spent its final years. The animal, a mare who was 12 years old at the time of her death, had been so tame she would allow people to pet her when her keeper was present. Consistent with the poor luck of her species, no one realized when she died that she was the last of her kind.After her death, the mare's hide was mounted and put on display at the zoo. Over time its importance became known, but all the same, 15 years ago it was moved to a large room in a zoo building that is not open to the general public. When I approached the zoo about seeing the quagga, a pleasant semiretired biologist named P.J.H. van Bree said he would show it to me. When van Bree opened the door to the room, 50 sets of glass eyes met mine. Along with the quagga were dozens of taxidermic specimens, many from the Dutch past as a colonial power -- rows of antelopes, zebras, a grizzly bear in an eight-foot-high plastic bag, a leopard and a black-maned cape lion, who, before humans extinguished it in the mid-1800's, may well have enjoyed more than one helping of quagga.The quagga was in a climate-controlled case, but the front pane was not attached. The animal was in poor shape. Its skin was separating on its back and on a rear leg. I touched the animal's bristly back, its backward pointing ears, its sensitive muzzle. I touched its hind quarters, trying to sense the life that was once inside but finding only the cast the taxidermist had made.To my eye, the quagga -- this quagga anyway -- looked more like a donkey than a zebra. It had a straight back, and its neck jutted forward. Its stripes were very light at the neck, fading to a moiré silkiness at midframe. Its underlying color was very brown. Across the room there was a glorious example of a mountain zebra looking like a small thoroughbred in a Mary Quant frock, and for me it was hard to believe that the two animals were related at all. The subject of Rau's quagga project came up, and van Bree expressed skepticism. ""I have no objection,"" he said, ""but just because a man may look like Napoleon, that does not make him Napoleon.""It's true that there is as much evidence that Rau's project is impossible as that it's possible. Since the 1985 study of quagga proteins, researchers have gone back and forth on the genetic and physical differences and similarities between the quagga and the plains zebra. The most recent and extensive analysis, published online last summer in Biology Letters of the Royal Society, suggested to some that the mitochondrial DNA of the plains zebra and the quagga was similar enough for them to be members of the same species but also said that there was no evidence that they had actually interbred. Rau saw the report as an endorsement of his ideas. But an author of the paper, Robert Fleischer of the Smithsonian Institution, told me that the scientists themselves had not been able to reach a conclusion as to what the relationship between the quagga and the plains zebra was. He said ultimately the question cannot be answered.Why not? Partly because no one knows enough about quagga behavior. Species -- even subspecies -- don't differ just in shape and color from one another; they differ in behavior: foraging habits, social habits, aggressiveness. (It's here, for instance, that the auroch project, to rebreed the extinct European ox, foundered. What the Heck brothers got was a large ox with better horns but not an animal whose behavior necessarily matched that of its extinct antecedent.) Rau's mantra, which he said to me many times, is that the ""quagga was nothing more than a southern variant of the plains zebra."" He says it behaved exactly like the zebra in the wild. But the truth is that he doesn't know because the information doesn't exist. As van Bree told me, ""before 1880 people were not interested in animal behavior.""Rau is a taxidermist, trained to recreate appearances, not to delve beneath them. But in the course of my conversations with several scientists, I noticed that those who talked about Rau, even those who condescended to his project, spoke of him with respect. For some, like Oliver Ryder, it doesn't seem to matter whether Rau is breeding a true quagga, or a zebra without its pajama pants, or an animal that looks like a quagga but doesn't share the quagga's genetic makeup. What seems to matter is that Rau does not accept that he is powerless to change the course of the mass extinction that has been under way for the past century. Instead he has reasserted the role of humans as custodians of nature. ""They're going to thank us for what we save,"" Ryder told me. And ultimately what Rau may be saving is a part of ourselves.' Not one man in a thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder,"" Charles Darwin wrote in ""The Origin of Species."" Rau has turned out to have that rare touch. He is ""a country boy,"" in his words, with a knack for animal husbandry. To make his zebras lose their stripes more quickly, he brought in some lightly striped zebras from South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal region and bred the two groups.In the late summer, I went to see Henry, Rau's star quagga, for myself. Rau drove me out of Cape Town in one of the museum's vehicles for a tour of his animals, which now number more than 100. At first meeting, Rau can seem dogmatic, painting the world as us versus them, black versus white -- but as I got to know him, he proved to be quite charming, with a flinty sense of humor. He lives alone in a southern suburb of Cape Town with two dogs and six species of European finch. The days I saw him he wore a striped sweater that had brown discolorations from where it dried on a radiator; it was as if he were working on becoming a quagga, too.Often, in the early days of his project, when Rau did not have the money for game-quality fencing, he put his zebras wherever he found adequate barriers already in place. As a result I saw some of his animals at an explosives factory and others at a particle-accelerator facility. Today, the project still operates on a tiny budget drawn from individual contributions; but because several private game-preserve owners keep the animals as tourist draws, most of his animals live better. Henry, for instance, lives on a private preserve, owned by a wealthy plastics manufacturer, about 45 minutes north of Cape Town. The preserve is large enough that if Henry wants to stay out of sight, it is very unlikely a person can find him, even with a car. ""Let's keep thumbs that the little boy will present himself,"" Rau said as we began our search.Eventually, we found Henry grazing on a heath just down the hill from a gnu and near some bontebok. His stripes began at the head like a bandit's mask, his black comb stood up like a centurion's, but that was where his resemblance to a plains zebra ended: his pelt from his rib cages to his buttocks was a soft, almost-unstriped yellow brown. He also had that moiré silkiness to his middle that I saw in the hide in Amsterdam. ""What a lovely thing he is,"" Rau kept saying, looking through his binoculars. ""Look at those stripes. They go nowhere near the belly. That's very quagga.""Henry and his group -- a stallion and three mares -- had the grace of wild things. The sun shone off them, the ocean was behind the hills they ranged over and they seemed to hear a music I didn't. If the bontebok next to them ran, they ran. If one zebra turned and showed us its rump, they all did. The stallion stood apart, seemingly ready to fight if we made any sudden moves.Not that the scene was actually truly wild -- a cellphone rang in our S.U.V., there were power lines over the next hill and the landscape was full of vegetation that had come from Australia. Human intervention has changed this landscape in radical ways for 350 years. Whatever progress Rau may have made in bringing the quagga back to the world, we are not in the world the quagga knew, and it seems safe to say we will never be again.Modern technology, though, may eventually carry the quagga project beyond where Rau can take it. Robert Fleischer at the Smithsonian told me that ""not now, not in 6 but maybe in 20 years,"" technology would be available to repair DNA from extinct animals, which might then be used to clone them back to life. The high quality of the DNA samples from the quagga skins might make the quagga a candidate for this revival, Fleischer suggests. That would be very good news, although, arguably, still the easy part. There is nothing natural about a natural landscape remade by humans. What are we bringing these animals back to? ""Let it also be borne in mind,"" Darwin wrote in ""The Origin of Species,"" ""how infinitely complex and close-fitting are the mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life."" You have to wonder if we are really intelligent enough to redesign nature.This doubt was brought home to me on my way to see Rau, during a stop I made at Addo Elephant National Park, several hundred miles east of Cape Town near Port Elizabeth. Recently some of Rau's rejects from the quagga breeding project were released there, into what had been farmland not long ago, along with some lightly striped zebras bred by the national parks themselves. Rau said they had been sent to be ""lions' lunch,"" but the lions, brought in from the Kalahari, where there are no zebras, didn't bother with them. They turned their attention instead to the local buffaloes. Lions usually have a hard time killing buffaloes -- the buffaloes make a circle around their young and hold off the predators with their horns -- but these buffaloes had lost their knowledge of how to defend themselves, so they were now easy targets. The park system relies on the sale of buffaloes to help finance the park's expansion; instead predators had pulled down 80 of them.It was a striking example of how hard it is to restore nature once you have damaged it. For instance, even as Rau's creation is making its reappearance, its cousin the Grevy's zebra, an intensely striped zebra native to East Africa, has become threatened with extinction. Rau does not seem to think about these sorts of things much. He seems to accept that nothing he will do can mitigate the larger disaster that may be awaiting the natural world and that only some of the animals he so laboriously rebreeds will go to natural parks while the rest will go to hunting preserves -- where they will be targets for sportsmen.I asked Rau whether, given this vision of the future, spending 30 years to erase a half a set of stripes on an obscure extinct animal was worth it. We were driving on a highway outside Cape Town, no antelopes, no spekboom in sight, a long way from the Karoo, the dry plains where the quaggas had once lived in huge herds. ""You would find it a bit disillusioning?"" he asked. ""Not to me. We would have given back to the Karoo -- we will have given back to the Karoo -- its original zebra. And that will be enough for me.""D.T. Max, a frequent contributor to the magazine, is working on ""The Dark Eye,"" a cultural and scientific history of mad-cow and other prion diseases.'"

"'06-01-01,'0','AT the level of investment theory, a debate continues to rage between active stock pickers and those who advocate passive indexing. At the level of everyday practice, however, the debate appears largely over. A new study finds that stock picking accounts for a small and declining proportion of the market's overall trading volume.The study, ""Is Stock Picking Declining Around the World?,"" has been circulating in academic circles as a working paper since late last year. Its authors are Utpal Bhattacharya, an associate professor of finance at Indiana University, and one of his graduate students, Neal Galpin. A version is at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract--id=849627.Measuring the prevalence of stock picking would seem difficult, if not impossible. One would have to know each investor's intent when buying or selling a particular stock. Was the investor's transaction part of a passive indexing strategy, intended merely to recreate the market's portfolio and to match its performance, or was the objective to pick only a few stocks in the hope of outperforming the overall market? And investors themselves may change their minds along the way, further complicating the measuring.The report's authors sidestep these thorny problems by approaching the question from a much different angle. They calculated what stocks' trading volume would be in a hypothetical world in which all investors abstained from active stock picking. Armed with the answer, they could estimate the prevalence of stock picking by comparing each stock's actual volume with its hypothetical extreme.What trading would occur in a world where no one was a stock picker? According to the study, it would take place only when investors wanted to put more money into the entire stock market, or to take money out. All stocks would be bought or sold in tandem on such occasions, with no one stock bought or sold more than any others.'"

During a recent showing of ""Aeon Flux,"" for example, someone sitting near me said of the black-helmeted Bregnan troops: ""What do they have on their heads? They look like dehumidifiers!"" Far from being shushed, he should have shared that insight with everyone.Those making the biggest fuss about theater noise right now are the studios and the theater owners, of course, who are worried about what appears to be a decline in movie attendance. They also want to do something about ringing cellphones. But if they were really serious about the no-talking issue, they would simply turn off the lights and run the movie, instead of showing us 15 minutes of trailers and commercials. As far as I'm concerned, it's practically obligatory to jabber until the feature starts.At that point there have to be some rules. You can't talk about just anything; you have to talk about what's on the screen, and certain movies need to be exempted -- quiet ones, for example. You don't want to be cracking jokes during ""Brokeback Mountain.""Horror movies, on the other hand, are actually more fun if someone in the audience is calling out: ""Don't open that door! I told you not to open that door!""If you're with colleagues from work and watching ""Wolf Creek,"" say, it can help ease the collective fear and tension if someone points out that creepy guy prowling the outback actually looks a lot like the new vice president up in accounting. This is what Aristotle meant about catharsis.In my experience, Times Square theaters in the late 1970's and early 80's were the great arenas for talking back to the screen. I still have a vivid recollection of ""The Hand"" -- a completely forgettable Michael Caine horror flick from back then, about an artist whose severed hand goes on to commit mayhem -- simply because of some audience dialogue. ""That's his smitty!"" one guy shouted as the hand crept along by itself. ""No,"" another guy pointed out. ""It's his ex-smitty.""'"
"'06-01-01,'0','FOR all the talk about the need to instill democratic freedoms, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Bashar al-Assad of Syria have bet they can continue to hold tight to the reins of power, if they can just improve their countries' economies.Leaders like Mr. Mubarak and Mr. Assad, who have been slow to respond to internal pressures, recognize that unemployment and poverty pose a greater threat to their power than any call for political opening.And so there has been talk, and some action, aimed at economic reform, and there will be more in 2006.In Egypt, for example, the president has just reappointed Ahmed Nazif as prime minister, returning to power ministers who have pushed through changes to open up the economy, and the new year will see increasing efforts at privatization. In Syria, officials are again beginning to talk about their five-year plan, which would chart a course toward a market-style economy.But in both countries, as elsewhere in the region, the pro-market side must battle corruption and entrenched interests. And those aren't the only forces working against them. The Middle East is exploding with young people who need jobs.

The national rate is $5.15.For workers who get tips, the minimum wage will go to $4.35 from $3.85, and will rise again next year, to $4.60.The State Legislature approved the increases in 2004 over the veto of Gov. George E. Pataki.The raise has been criticized by business lobbyists as a job destroyer that encourages businesses to move to nearby states that have lower minimums. New Jersey's is $5.15, but Connecticut's is $7.10. Mark P. Alesse, the New York director of the National Federation of Independent Business, a lobbying group, said of the increase, ""We opposed it successfully for years and got the governor to veto it."" The group's 15,000 members in New York State employ an average of fewer than 10 workers, and it is businesses that size that are most affected by the minimum wage, he said.He doubts that the increase helps the people that minimum-wage advocates say it helps, he said. ""This isn't for low-wage heads of households,"" he said. ""It's for the unions.""Many union contracts use formulas, for example, pegging salaries at $20 above minimum wage. ""This is a way of getting an across-the-board wage increase without negotiating for it,"" Mr. Alesse contended.Besides, Mr. Alesse said, ""We take care of our working poor."" New York, he said, has ""the most comprehensive social safety net in the nation.""Dan Cantor, the executive director of the Working Families Party, which lobbied the State Legislature for the increase, said it was untrue that companies move jobs to states with lower minimum wages. ""McDonald's does not close down and move across the state line when you raise the minimum wage,"" he said.James A. Parrott, the chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research organization in Manhattan, said that while job growth in New York State had lagged behind the national rate, the increase in the number of low-wage jobs in New York State had outpaced that of the low-wage jobs across the nation.For Noemi Rodriguez, 21, and her 2-year-old daughter, the minimum wage is a simple matter of going hungry. Ms. Rodriguez, a single mother who lives with her mother, makes $8 an hour as the chief photo technician at a Duane Reade in East Harlem. Six months ago, she said, ""I earned the minimum wage when I started here, and I was still going hungry,"" she said. ""It's not enough to pay utilities, buy food and take care of my baby.""She sees a solution, however. ""I'm moving to Florida,"" she said. ""I can get a $500-a-month, two-bedroom apartment and earn $9 an hour. I leave in April.""Correction: January 4, 2006, Wednesday An article on Sunday about New Yorkers' reaction to a 75-cent increase in the state's minimum wage -- to $6.75 an hour from $6 -- gave an outdated figure for New Jersey's minimum wage.

It seemed unlikely a deal could be struck by then, and it remained unclear whether he would grant more time to discuss details or would allow Gazprom to halt delivery.The European Union, which has member states that rely on Gazprom for much of their gas supply, has called for a meeting of energy officials on Jan. 4.

"'06-01-01,'0','And that means the paths of the two programs are converging to the point where they could collide.""Government competing with the development industry drives prices up for everybody,"" said Lee E. Koppelman, the chairman of the Long Island Regional Planning Board and the director of Stony Brook University's Center for Regional Policy Studies. ""But, more to the point, every acre that government preserves leaves one less acre for housing. And I can't say that there's plenty of land left for everyone.""He noted that Suffolk County voters typically support open-space preservation by overwhelming margins in referendums. In 2004, a $100-million bond act in the Town of Brookhaven was approved by more than 70 percent of the votes cast. ""I thought that would scare the voters, but it sailed through like they were giving out gold bricks,"" Dr. Koppelman said.Suffolk has an estimated 65,000 buildable acres left, most of it privately owned and nearly all in the county's eastern half, said Thomas Isles, the county planning director. ""Over all, Suffolk has the ability to grow by no more than another 15 to 20 percent of population,"" he said. ""More than half of the county is built out.""Mr. Isles said that means Suffolk is maturing into fully developed suburbia where the only way left to create more housing would be to redevelop commercial or industrial sites. ""That offers established communities a second bite of the apple -- and maybe a chance to do it better the second time around,"" he said.Of the vacant land left, Dr. Koppelman said that the eastern towns had been gradually decreasing the allowable density. Riverhead recently up-zoned parcels to one house for every two acres and East Hampton rezoned to one house for every five acres. ""And the market is such that it's a good bet most of that will be developed as luxury housing,"" he said.Of its 583,000 acres, Suffolk County already has 50,000 permanently preserved, not including federal, state and locally owned parkland, and the county has targeted another 9,000 acres for acquisition, Mr. Isles said.The competition for land between developers and government has helped to drive prices so high that ""affordable housing"" on the Island threatens to become an oxymoron. And, in perhaps 5 to 10 years, land worth preserving for environmental reasons will already have been preserved.That is a major reason that those responsible for creating affordable housing have so tightly embraced the notion of smart growth, which combines higher-density development in residential areas with remodeling blighted commercial sites into rental housing. A project by the Long Island Housing Partnership, for example, replaced two overcrowded boarding houses in the Sunnybrook Court section of Bay Shore with 10 low-cost town houses.""In areas that are already developed, we have to ask for increased density to make it work,"" said Peter Elkowitz, the partnership's president. ""But if I'm competing for land with a private developer or for open-space use, it's just not going to happen.""Mr. Levy said that with proper planning, land preservation and affordable housing need not be mutually exclusive. He has charged the county's Workforce Housing Commission with developing ways to create housing and has also suggested using county land in Yaphank to build employer-subsidized apartments.""Even 1,000 units would be just a drop in the bucket in terms of the size of the problem,"" Dr. Koppelman said.The Workforce Housing Commission observed in a report issued in late December, as did Dr. Koppelman and others, that the reasons for high housing prices and the scarcity of land are complex, driven partly by demand, partly by supply, partly by shifting government priorities.Still, the commission called Suffolk's thirst for land preservation a major contributor. The report urged the county to pursue high-density residential development in abandoned commercial areas, to put permits for such projects on a fast track and to encourage towns and villages to do the same.Nassau County has already reached the point known in planning circles as build-out. Across Nassau, only 5,000 undeveloped acres remain. With lots there starting at $750,000, the price is too high and the competition from developers too fierce for government to consider building more low-cost houses, Dr. Koppelman said.Instead, the recent emphasis has been on expanding or renovating the subsidized rental units that exist, packing more tenants into already densely developed neighborhoods.Suffolk's four westernmost towns -- Babylon, Smithtown, Huntington and Islip -- are nearing build-out, Dr. Koppelman said. Yet Brookhaven has $100 million to spend on open-space preservation, Suffolk County has $75 million, and all five East End towns -- East Hampton, Riverhead, Shelter Island, Southold and Southampton -- have a 2-percent tax on mortgage transfers to pay for land. East Hampton's tax alone generated $20 million this year.""Put it all together and it's an enormous amount of money that will dramatically diminish the availability of land,"" Dr. Koppelman said. ""That's inescapable.""Consider East Hampton. This year's winning town board candidates -- Mr. McGintee, the incumbent Councilwoman Pat Mansir and their running mate, Brad Loewen -- were not making empty campaign promises. The town board agenda for early 2006 shows signs of continuing an already aggressive open-space preservation program by targeting thousands of acres for acquisition.That agenda also includes steps to jump-start a stagnant affordable-housing program, by building up to 50 subsidized homes by the end of 2006 and loosening zoning restrictions to allow more small apartments in houses and above stores.But Mr. Isles, the county planning director, asked what would have happened to East Hampton if the town had not bought up more than a third of its land? Its bucolic views have helped to rein in development and contribute to the vigorous demand for second homes, he said.""I don't believe you would reduce the demand or market prices by increasing the supply of land,"" he said. ""The demand factors far outweigh the supply considerations, and we'd still have the problem of too little affordable housing.""The money for town acquisitions comes from the town's Community Preservation Fund, where revenue from the mortgage transfer tax is deposited.""With an endless stream of revenue, there's no reason why we shouldn't make these acquisitions,"" said Mr. McGintee, adding that there remains strong support in East Hampton to buy development rights on farmland and to acquire the deeds to wetlands and woodlands.He said that the town's share of publicly subsidized housing, typically built by partnerships of government and nonprofit groups or private developers, comes directly from taxpayers. ""We will invest as much in affordable housing as the taxpayers can bear, because the need here is enormous,"" he said.In other words, the board will give the voters what they want.Nearly 15,200 acres, or about 35 percent of East Hampton's 43,752 acres, were in the public domain by 2004, an increase of 18 percentage points from 1984. During the same span, development spread to cover 51 percent of the town, while the population grew an estimated 31 percent between 1990 and 2004. In 1997, the median sale price of a house was $200,000; it has more than quadrupled.According to the town's 2005 comprehensive plan, only 4,768 vacant acres remain, and the town board has hired its first preservation czar to make sure none of the targeted properties fall through bureaucratic cracks.Predicting that low taxes -- East Hampton has the second-lowest rate in Suffolk -- and the lure of living near beaches and working farms would continue to draw new homeowners in droves, Mr. McGintee said he could not foresee a drop-off in demand for either new houses or services like police, roads and schools.""Real estate values have always increased in relation to the demand to live out here, and that demand remains strong,"" he said.The only options for East Hampton, Mr. McGintee said, are to continue to rein in development by preserving larger, environmentally sensitive parcels, imposing limits on smaller ones with zoning restrictions, and finding places in commercial developments to fit the odd apartment or two.""It's a constant balancing act,"" he said.'"

"'06-01-01,'0','Mr. Annan begins his last year in office with a mandate to bring fundamental and lasting change to the beleaguered institution. Negotiators have been struggling for months over the terms of a new Human Rights Council that he proposed in the spring to replace the commission. A hoped-for agreement in December did not materialize.Negotiators resume talks on Jan. 11 and must settle on a resolution for the new council soon after to have it in place by March, when the commission reconvenes in Geneva. ""The commission should hold that meeting with the understanding that it is going to be its last meeting,"" said Ricardo Arias, the ambassador of Panama, who is one of the leaders of the working group drawing up the new Human Rights Council.The current commission has 53 members serving staggered three-year terms and elected from closed slates put forward by regional groups. It meets each year in Geneva for six weeks.The proposed council would exist year-round, be free to act when rights violations are discovered, conduct periodic reviews of every country's human rights performance and meet more frequently throughout the year.Still in dispute are the council's size, the procedures for citing individual countries, how often the panel would meet, a possible two-term limit for membership and whether members would be chosen based on agreed criteria of human rights performance or by a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly as a way of weeding out notorious rights violators.The proposal envisions votes on each candidate for membership rather than on regional slates. As with most of the changes being proposed at the United Nations, the rights council has drawn suspicion from the poorer and less developed nations of the 191-member General Assembly. They say they fear the new council may be yet another way for wealthier and more powerful nations to intrude in their affairs.Abdallah Baali, the ambassador of Algeria, said the main concern of objecting nations was ""whether or not this council will impose both its measures and its views on a member state or will it seek their cooperation in order to improve their human rights records. "" He said Algeria supported the proposed council.Diplomats at the United Nations singled out Egypt and Pakistan as countries that were leading the resistance to the proposed council.In introducing his recommendation for a new council in March, Mr. Annan cited the flaws in the current commission and the consequences for the United Nations of not reforming it. The commission had been undermined, he argued, by allowing participation of countries whose purpose was ""not to strengthen human rights but to protect themselves against criticism or to criticize others.""""As a result,"" he said, ""a credibility deficit has developed, which casts a shadow on the reputation of the United Nations system as a whole.""Mr. Roth of Human Rights Watch was blunter. ""If the governments of the world cannot get together on human rights at the U.N., then it is a shameful act for the entire organization,"" he said.Peggy Hicks, the global advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, said that having rights abusers on the panel had a broadly debilitating effect on its work. ""In the case of Sudan, the Sudanese government's presence on the commission meant that African states and others watered down language that human rights groups around the world thought appropriate to address crimes against humanity,"" she said.She said Zimbabwe's presence on the commission was an important factor in the panel's decision to take no action this year against the government of Robert Mugabe despite widespread accusations of abuse against Zimbabwe's own citizens.""In general,"" Ms. Hicks said, ""what the presence of abusive countries on the commission means is that much of its energy is taken up with the blocking actions and delaying tactics that end up weakening action on human rights abuses worldwide. Yes, they delay action on their own internal situations, but they have a vested interest in seeing that the overall ability is as weak as possible.""Kristen Silverberg, assistant secretary of state for international organizations, said the United States' priorities were ""to improve the membership so that countries like Zimbabwe and Sudan were not eligible"" and ""to make sure the council can act.""""We don't need more theatrics and discussion in Geneva,"" she said. ""We need concerted action.""""Some countries have argued that it's better for the council to stay away from anything that would embarrass a country, but we think the council needs to be prepared to take action in serious cases like Darfur and Burma,"" she said in an interview, referring to the country that now calls itself Myanmar.Mr. Arias said that ""a lot of emphasis has been placed on the matter of cooperation to improve human rights, not just passing resolutions against a country which is in violation but on making an effort to increase the capacity to improve human rights in the long term.""Mr. Roth said the United States and the European Union were strong supporters of the proposed council but needed to become more aggressive in building the case for it with reluctant countries.Ms. Silverberg said that she and the State Department's adviser on United Nations reform, Ambassador Sharin Tahir-Kheli, had pressed the case for the human rights council and management reform on trips to capitals in Latin America and South Asia and that she was going to the Middle East for the same purpose next month. She noted that Ms. Tahir-Kheli had visited Cairo and Islamabad, among other capitals.Prince Zeid Raad al-Hussein, the ambassador of Jordan, said that while his country supported the proposed council, it was concerned that condemning the current commission outright would be to ignore that it had sometimes proved effective.""What we are concerned about is about 20 percent of its work, while the rest seems to be working quite well,"" said the prince, a former United Nations peacekeeper in Bosnia. ""Look at all the rapporteurs in the field putting together their reports, often with good cooperation with governments. This must be encouraged and continued.""This year the commission established a special rapporteur, or investigator, on human rights and counterterrorism that drew the support of 80 United Nations members, including Russia and the United States. It also passed a resolution establishing a human rights monitoring operation in Nepal where both the government and Maoist insurgents have been accused of abuses.In November, Mr. Arias and the other leader of the working group, Dumisani Kumalo, the South African ambassador, accompanied Jan Eliasson, the Swedish diplomat who is the General Assembly president, to Geneva on a mission to calm concerns there over plans for the council.""There was a good deal of suspicion, and it's important that you don't develop an antagonistic relationship between Geneva and New York,"" Mr. Eliasson said in a telephone interview from Stockholm.""It was important to pick up the best practices and good things the Human Rights Commission has been doing,"" he said, ""and many people in Geneva felt that aspect was being disregarded.""'"
"'06-01-01,'0','Governor-elect Jon S. Corzine, a novice to politics in 1999, understood that from the start.To ease his way into the state, he immediately started donating more than $4 million worth of the fortune he made on Wall Street to a handful of Democratic Party power brokers around New Jersey.Among them was Mr. Lynch, then the Senate minority leader, who had declared himself an early supporter of Mr. Corzine's run for the United States Senate and later received more than $1 million from him for his various campaign funds and political action committees.Yet Mr. Corzine, who has given more money to the Democratic political machine than anyone in New Jersey history, was elected governor in November on a promise to rein in the bosses.""I want to be very clear: Our government should not and will not be about economic opportunities for politicians or anyone else,"" Mr. Corzine said during an election night victory speech so fiery, he repeatedly pounded the rostrum.But even with the vast powers that New Jersey's governor holds -- he is the only statewide elected official -- Mr. Corzine's ability to loosen the party leaders' grip on power will not be easy.For one, state law makes most of their activities perfectly legal.""It's not unusual,"" said Alan Marcus, a lobbyist and registered Republican who calls Mr. Lynch a friend. ""It's common. And until somebody makes it illegal, they're going to keep doing it.""And, in New Jersey, it remains strong, despite increased public scrutiny -- and even as similar systems have eroded elsewhere.The Democratic leaders operate a kind of unelected, permanent government, working behind the scenes with a complicated tangle of interests to control what gets done in their part of the state and beyond.While acting as emissaries between regulated businesses and the office holders who regulate them, the bosses amass millions of dollars in donations to distribute or withhold, as they see fit.And in a bit of New Jersey alchemy, many of the power brokers mix business and politics and make handsome profits for themselves -- often representing the special interests that tend to drive the problems that state residents find most troublesome: sprawl, pollution, sky-high property taxes and a culture of pay-to-play and patronage that drives up pension costs, say leaders of groups that are critical of the system.""The way that New Jersey's political system runs now, it is so dominated by money and the powers and special interests who can use it for leverage, that ordinary citizens don't have a voice,"" said Harry Pozycki, who defied Mr. Lynch as a Middlesex County elected official years ago, and now heads the statewide watchdog group called the Citizens Campaign. ""And they don't have a chance unless things change.""As much as the term ""boss"" has been tossed around in recent years to describe New Jersey's political powerhouses, there remain widespread misconceptions about who they are. The bosses are not cigar-chomping cartoon villains, born in some back room then set loose to strangle the state in a web of money, power and influence. They are, in some cases, elected officials, such as Newark's Mayor Sharpe James, who is also a state senator, and State Senator Raymond Lesniak of Union County. In other cases, they hold neither elected office nor any official party position. Neither Mr. Lynch, for example, or George E. Norcross III, the Commerce Bank executive who operates a sprawling political empire from his base in Camden County, hold official party titles.Many have an impressive political and personal pedigree, and some can point to a substantial record of public service. Mr. Lynch, for example, is the son of a former State Senate president who grew up in New Jersey politics and polished his credentials by finishing fifth in his class at Georgetown University Law Center in 1975. He was elected mayor of New Brunswick, where he was widely lauded for reviving the blighted city. He served in the State Senate, winning respect for his unparalleled skill at balancing politics and policy, and followed in his father's footsteps to become Senate president in 1990.He was even considered a likely candidate for governor as recently as the late 1980's, but those prospects dimmed when he married a woman whose brother, Louis Auricchio, was associated with the Genovese crime family and who later was convicted of a mob murder.Like other Democratic county leaders, Mr. Lynch has worked largely behind the scenes. But he was forced into the public eye in November when federal agents raided his business as part of a corruption inquiry.The investigation has offered a glimpse of how closely Mr. Lynch has worked with developers, even before he retired from elective office in 2002. The New Jersey Legislature is considered a part-time job, and beginning in 1993, Mr. Lynch began supplementing his State Senate income by running a consulting firm named Executive Continental.Mr. Lynch explains Executive Continental's mission as helping developers win government approvals for their projects. If they succeed, the firm is paid a colorfully named ""success fee.""Federal investigators are now poring over the records of more than 50 deals involving strip malls, housing complexes, urban renewal plans and waterfront developments shepherded by Mr. Lynch and his partner in Executive Continental, Jack Westlake, according to court documents.Mr. Lynch said that his work with developers is not only legal, but also good for the state because he promotes the kind of projects that help improve the communities, including providing badly needed housing for low and middle-income people. He described his role as a political ""choreographer"" who provides clients with nothing more than strategic advice.""I'm probably the most investigated person in New Jersey,"" said Mr. Lynch, 67, who still has the wiry build and bulldog tenacity of a welterweight. ""But anyone who says we were buying approvals or doing anything improper to help our clients get them is ridiculous.""Mr. Lynch also dismisses the suggestion that his work contributes to suburban sprawl, saying most of his projects are in cities or in the state's so-called transit villages in downtowns and represent smart growth.""I'm not involved with paving over farmland or developing on open space,"" he said. ""The state has to have some development, so you try to achieve a balance. That's why I'm proud of what I'm doing.""But opponents of sprawl say a combination of campaign funds and political influence has driven New Jersey's penchant to build, helping to make it the most densely populated state in the nation.""When it comes to the pay-to-pave system of development in New Jersey, John Lynch is king,"" said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, which has opposed Mr. Lynch and his clients on dozens of development projects around New Jersey. ""In parts of the state, you can't build unless you hire one of the lawyers or engineers or construction companies he's aligned with because you won't get the government approvals.""One example of Mr. Lynch's converging interests is a strip mall in Brick, called The Power Center. It was originally proposed by Mr. Morris, a developer who frequently hosts Mr. Lynch on his yacht and jet and has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to his political committees. In 2003, Mr. Lynch was brought in as partner in the languishing project and soon his political action committee began donating tens of thousands of dollars to the mayor of Brick and other local Democrats.The project, JSM at Brick, quickly won approval from local officials, and the town's mayor, Joseph Scarpelli, was hired as a consultant by an engineering firm working on the project.Mr. Lynch said that their donations were a mere coincidence, unrelated to the development. Mr. Morris has declined to be interviewed over the last month. Mr. Scarpelli has explained that he did not know Mr. Lynch had a stake in the project and later quit the consulting position, saying he wanted to avoid a conflict of interest.In other projects, such as the JSM at Hickory project in Dover Township, Mr. Lynch does not have an ownership stake, but he and Mr. Morris together gave $65,000 in donations to mayoral candidate Paul Brush in early 2003. Once he was elected, Mr. Brush embraced the plan and appointed one of Mr. Lynch's allies to the local planning board. The project's newfound support on the local level helped JSM at Hickory win two state zoning changes, even though hundreds of community residents had rallied against the development.Mr. Lynch said that the donations were intended solely to strengthen the Democratic Party, and had nothing to do with the development.""I don't even know where that project is,"" Mr. Lynch said during a recent interview.Mayor Brush said that his support for the proposal was based on its own merits. State officials said JSM at Hickory has been moving ahead because it will help the town meet its obligation to build affordable housing.But some local residents say they feel as if local officials sacrificed their quality of life for campaign contributions.""It was stopped until they came through with all the money,"" said Frank Kenny, who organized community opposition to the plan. ""Then it was like we didn't even exist.""At the center of Mr. Lynch's political network is his political action committee, New Directions for Responsible Leadership, which raises and distributes hundreds of thousands of dollars, much of it from developers and government contractors. State election records show that since 2000, the PAC has distributed $3.1 million across the state, sometimes funneling it from one county to another , a practice known as ""wheeling,"" which allows donors to legally give more than the $37,500 limit. Mr. Lynch has discretion over how that money is distributed, with the flexibility to reward those he favors and punish those who stand in the way of his agenda.But Mr. Lynch's lawyer, Jack Arseneault, said Mr. Lynch was civic-minded in allocating campaign money.""He's not one of those old-style political bosses who call up and try to affect policy just to line their pockets,"" Mr. Arseneault said. ""I don't think you can find a single instance where John Lynch has directly interfaced with government officials on his own in order to financially benefit his pockets or his clients.""Those politicians he favors can benefit handsomely. James E. McGreevey was a green, little-known state senator from Woodbridge in the early 1990's when Mr. Lynch recognized his intelligence and discipline as a campaigner and adopted him as a protégé and potential gubernatorial candidate.After Mr. McGreevey was elected governor in 2001, Mr. Lynch continued in his role as strategist and helped to choose key cabinet members and chart the administration's agenda.The current investigation into Mr. Lynch's business actually stems from a deal that took place in the months between Mr. McGreevey's election and inauguration, when two of Mr. McGreevey's aides used their positions on his transition team to pump up the value of a billboard company they sold at a $2 million profit. Federal investigators are examining whether their actions were a conflict of interest, and in the course of that inquiry began looking at Mr. Lynch's influence in the administration.In an interview, Mr. Lynch revealed that his firm, Executive Continental, received a small consulting fee when one of the billboards was sold.After the inauguration, Mr. Lynch could frequently be seen walking into the governor's office to discuss appointments, budget matters, development projects and other state business. One of Mr. Lynch's law partners, Al Kroll, was named labor commissioner, helping the firm's efforts to gain prestige and attract clients among unions.As Mr. McGreevey became hobbled by a variety of self-inflicted political wounds, his relationship with Mr. Lynch soured. In 2003, Mr. McGreevey distanced himself from his former mentor and Mr. Lynch began to publicly criticize the governor he had helped create.""He was more concerned with being liked than being respected,"" Mr. Lynch said at the time. ""And you just can't lead that way.""Mr. McGreevey, who resigned in August 2004 amid a sex scandal, did not respond to requests for an interview.But for all the criticism Mr. Lynch has received, there are those who insist he is simply playing by the free-wheeling rules of New Jersey politics, and being singled out because he has been so successful.Joseph Ferriero, the Bergen County Democratic chairman, said it is unfair that he, Mr. Lynch and other Democratic leaders are maligned for aiding developers, who play a crucial role in the state's economy by providing affordable housing and creating tens of thousands of jobs.""It's no different than a congressman lobbying for a defense contract in his district or supporting farmers in a rural district,"" Mr. Ferriero said. ""A county chairman tries to take care of his own constituency. And John tries to do what's best for the people in his county and the whole state.""Since Mr. Lynch's falling-out with Mr. McGreevey, many Democratic insiders say that he has become somewhat withdrawn from public life. He has suffered from a back ailment and prostate cancer. Mr. Lynch and his wife, Deborah, are also busy building a rambling estate in Lawrenceville, near the New Jersey governor's mansion, which is said to have a room large enough to seat 100. (""It's Deborah's house,"" he said. ""You'll have to ask her."")He played almost no role in Mr. Corzine's governor's race, and many aides to Mr. Corzine privately questioned his support. Mr. Lynch said he is willing to back Mr. Corzine as he embarks on an ambitious new agenda to close the budget gap, lower property taxes and curb the influence of money in politics.""If Jon Corzine wants to do the right thing, and lead, I'll be behind him all the way,"" Mr. Lynch said.Articles in this series are examining Democratic Party leaders in New Jersey who wield influence on a variety of issues.'"
"'06-01-01,'0','In the main ballroom of the Hotel Astor -- built at 44th Street and Broadway in 1904 -- the ballroom's gilt decoration was blocked out with jet-black material, against which were hung enormous festoons of flaming red and silver. A small-town Main Street was built as a midway but redesigned in the Cubist style, with modernist trees dotting the village green.An orchestra directed by the architect Kenneth Murchison consisted of pneumatic riveting machines, live steam pipes, ocean liner whistles and sledgehammers. A puppet show designed by the puppeteer and children's book illustrator Tony Sarg presented robots on strings with bodies of metal coils. Ballet dancers rendered a modernistic impression of the blues.The Times said that the committee had promised that any guest in a conventional sailor, cowboy, chef or police officer's costume would be barred, but that ""a traffic cop from Mars"" would be welcomed.At least two dozen architects came dressed as buildings they had recently designed. These included Chester Aldrich as the Union Club, at 69th and Park, and William F. Lamb as the Empire State Building. Arthur J. Arwine, a heating contractor, came as a ""low-pressure heating boiler."" Murchison came as a model tenement.But most architecture aficionados are familiar with only the well-known image of William Van Alen as his Chrysler Building. In one variant of this photo, Van Alen is the fourth in a line of six architects, the others wearing generic tunics made to look like windowed buildings.But they all wore helmetlike constructions of the tops of the buildings they had designed.A. Stewart Walker was completely hidden under the black and white ziggurat at the top of his Fuller Building, at 57th and Madison; Leonard Schultze wore the rocket-shaped crown of one of his Waldorf-Astoria towers; Ely Jacques Kahn peeked out from under the castlelike top of his Squibb Building, at 58th and Fifth; Ralph Walker wore the Art Deco tower of his building at 1 Wall Street; and Joseph Freedlander -- one of the heads of the costume committee -- looked pretty silly under the horizontal neo-Georgian pavilions of the Museum of the City of New York, at 103rd and Fifth.They all played supporting roles to Van Alen, the star of the group, whose attire included a Buck Rogers-style cloak and boots, both made of patent leather and flame-colored silk, with flexible inlays of the same exotic woods used on the Chrysler Building's elevators. Indeed, his cloak was designed to emulate the design of the doors, and two shoulder ornaments replicated the eagle heads at the 61st-floor setbacks. On his head rose a strikingly dangerous-looking crown, the graduated layers of the Chrysler tower itself rising to a spire, the ensemble at least four feet above his scalp.The ball was covered live by WABC radio starting at midnight, but just fragmentary descriptions and only a few photographs remain of what must have been one of the most spectacular parties of the last century. Van Alen's Chrysler Building is one of the icons of skyscraper architecture, but no trace of his costume appears to have survived.Although the break from historicism in 1931 was exhilarating, perhaps the deepening Depression encouraged retrospection, because in 1932 the theme was the Colonial period. Van Alen came holding a sword and attired in a silk brocade coat and pantaloons, with a huge Dutch-style hat, lace cuffs and collar. According to The Times, he was dressed as his 17th-century ancestor Pieter Van Alen.'"
"'06-01-01,'0','New Haven - I feel both personal and literary regrets that, if Pope Benedict XVI gets his way, in perhaps a year or so Limbo will be in limbo (as it were). The issue spurs a reminiscence. Walking down Broadway on a chilly Upper West Side morning in 1972, I bumped into my good acquaintance, the novelist Anthony Burgess, and at his request I resigned to him the bottle of Fundador I had just purchased at a nearby liquor store. Standing in a tattered robe and blinking in the sun, after a night devoted to composition, Burgess required immediate medication.Besides, he had introduced me to this invigorating Spanish brandy only a few weeks before, so I urged him to retain the bottle after he had absorbed two prodigious swigs outdoors. As I wended back to the liquor shop, he called out after me: ""The debt shall be paid, Bloom! When you arrive in Limbo, I will await you there with a bottle of Fundador.""A lapsed Roman Catholic (like his idol, James Joyce), Burgess was being unduly optimistic about our reunion on the Other Shore, since neither of us qualified for Limbo, a state that the church, largely at the prodding of Thomas Aquinas, designated for unbaptized babies and the Hebrew patriarchs who preceded Jesus.Dante, of course, in Canto IV of ""The Inferno,"" went beyond Aquinas, and thronged Limbo with the philosophers and poets of the ancient world; primarily his beloved guide, Virgil, but also Homer, Horace, Ovid and others, and even literary characters like Hector and Aeneas. Rather surprisingly, Dante also admitted three Muslims: the warrior Saladin and the philosophers Avicenna and Averroes.Limbo has a rich literary history, in honor of which I hope the pope and his International Theological Commission will refrain from exiling this amiably ambiguous realm. Hell, Purgatory and Heaven may seem rather strictly demarcated and limited destinations, without Limbo as an interesting outrider. In the Italian Renaissance poet Luduvico Ariosto's ""Orlando Furioso,"" the knight Astolfo visits the moon's Limbo and discovers there all of earth's wastages: talents locked up in named vases, bribes hanging on gold hooks, and much besides.In ""Henry VIII,"" Shakespeare uses the ""Limbo of the Fathers"" as a synonym for prison, while John Milton in ""Paradise Lost"" gives us the Paradise of Fools as a ""limbo large and broad,"" where winds blow about Roman Catholic cowls, hoods, habits, relics, beads, indulgences, pardons and Papal Bulls.'"
"'06-01-02,'0','""The public is way ahead of Washington,"" Mr. Samuel said. ""They see this as a matter of basic fairness, the underpinning of basic labor law in this country, a floor under wages so we're not competing with Bangladesh.""The minimum wage has been the subject of fierce ideological debate since it was first established in 1938 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt as part of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Business groups and conservative economists have argued that the minimum wage is an unwarranted government intrusion into the employer-employee relationship and a distortion of the marketplace for labor. An increase in the minimum wage, they say, drives up labor costs across the board and freezes unskilled and first-time workers out of the job market.""Increasing the minimum wage is a bad move economically, philosophically and politically,"" said Marc Freedman, director of labor law policy for the United States Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Freedman said that any minimum wage set by the federal government was completely arbitrary and did not take local labor market costs into account.According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, about two million American workers, 2.7 percent of the overall work force, earned the minimum hourly wage of $5.15 or less in 2004, the last year for which such statistics were available. Those workers were generally young (half were under 25, and a quarter were teenagers), unmarried and had not earned a high school diploma. About three-fifths of all workers paid at or below the federal minimum wage worked in bars and restaurants, and many received tips to supplement their basic wages.Advocates of an increase in the minimum wage said that inflation had so eroded the value of the minimum wage in the last nine years that it was worth less today in real terms than at any time since 1955. They also cited studies that found that raising the minimum wage did not cause job loss, as opponents argue. According to these studies, employers can absorb the higher labor costs through efficiencies, less employee turnover and higher productivity.Tim Nesbitt, the former president of the Oregon A.F.L.-C.I.O., said that despite having one of the highest minimum wages in the country at $7.25 an hour, Oregon had had twice the rate of job growth as the rest of the country.The 2006 battle over the minimum wage is expected to be particularly intense in Ohio, one of only two states that have a minimum wage below the federal level (the other is Kansas). The minimum wage in Ohio since 1991 has been $4.25 an hour, which applies to small employers, some farms and most restaurants. Workers at larger enterprises are generally covered by the federal minimum wage.Efforts to get the Republican-run General Assembly to consider raising Ohio's minimum wage have gone nowhere, so labor groups and the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, known as Acorn, an advocacy group for low-income individuals and families, are planning a ballot initiative to put the issue to a popular vote in November.Tim Burga, legislative director for the Ohio A.F.L.-C.I.O., said that 92,000 workers in the state made less than the federal minimum wage, some as little as $2 an hour. The proposed Ohio Constitutional amendment would set the state minimum wage at $6.85 an hour, indexed to future inflation, bringing an immediate raise to as many as 400,000 workers.Former Senator John Edwards, the 2004 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, said in an interview that he planned to help organize the minimum wage campaign in Ohio as part of his national campaign to alleviate poverty. He called the current minimum wage a moral disgrace and a national embarrassment.""My view is it should be $7.50 an hour, and I can make a great argument for it being a lot higher than that,"" Mr. Edwards said. ""This is a perfect example of the Republican leadership in Congress, combined with the powerful presence of lobbies in Washington, thwarting the will of the people.""Leading the opposition to the initiative will be the Ohio Restaurant Association, which like its parent organization, the National Restaurant Association, closely monitors and vigorously opposes efforts to raise the minimum wage.""Restaurants are a low-margin business,"" said Geoff Hetrick, president of the Ohio Restaurant Association. ""A number of marginal operations which are more or less on the ragged edge right now might find this to be the straw that breaks the camel's back, especially in northern Ohio where they've had a significant loss in manufacturing employment that's taken a lot of disposable income out of the economy.""One of those who would be affected by the proposed minimum wage increase in Ohio is Rick Cassara, owner of John Q's Steakhouse in downtown Cleveland. He said that while all of his 55 employees currently earn more than the minimum wage, he opposed a mandated increase because it would drive up all of his labor costs. ""It exerts upward pressure on all wages and prices,"" Mr. Cassara said. ""If the minimum wage is $7 and I have to pay $8 or $9 to hire a dishwasher, then the cooks are going to say they want more. How much can I charge for that hamburger?""Another small employer, Dan Young, owner of Young's Jersey Dairy in Yellow Springs, a working farm and restaurant operation, said that more than half of his 300 workers were high school and college students, many of them in their first jobs. He said he paid many of them $5.25 an hour, just above the federal minimum wage, but most quickly won raises or earned far more than that in tips.Mr. Young said that if Ohio enacted a Democratic proposal to raise the state's minimum wage by $1 an hour over the federal level, his labor costs would go up by $250,000 a year or more. ""When you do all the math,"" he said, ""I'll have to figure out a way to hire fewer workers, or raise prices, or both.""In 2004, voters in Nevada and Florida approved ballot initiatives raising the state minimum wage to $6.15 an hour, in both cases by more than a 2-to-1 margin. Nevada voters must vote on the measure again this year because it is a Constitutional amendment, but proponents are confident they will prevail. Lawmakers in California, which already has one of the highest rates in the nation at $6.75 an hour, approved a bill last year to increase the wage to $7.75 an hour in 2007, but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it, the second time he has rejected such legislation.Mr. Schwarzenegger said then that he believed that low-wage California workers deserved a raise, but said the legislation, which contained automatic increases tied to inflation, would be too costly to employers.But aides to Mr. Schwarzenegger said late last week that the governor would propose a $1-an-hour increase in the California minimum wage in his State of the State address this week. If approved, the proposal would take effect over the next 18 months and would not have an automatic inflation adjustment, the aides said. The move appears designed in part to pre-empt a ballot initiative that would raise the California hourly rate an additional $1, to $8.75 an hour, and include annual cost-of-living increases.Inflation indexing is also an issue in Oregon, where the minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour and adjusts every year for inflation under an initiative approved by voters in 2002. Each year since passage of that measure, the Oregon Restaurant Association and other business groups have pushed legislation to cancel the indexing provision or to exempt some workers from the wage law, but have so far failed. Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski, a Democrat and former labor lawyer, has vowed to veto any such measure that reaches his desk.'"

""I'm already stressed out about Christmas, and December isn't even over,"" Mr. Wisgerhof, the store's window director, said last week.Yes, he's talking about next Christmas, Dec. 25, 2006. He has already come up with the theme for next year's display, which in his business is akin to a state secret. ""To be honest, I'm sick of Christmas already.""At the Christmas Cottage, a store on Seventh Avenue and 51st Street that deals in you-know-what, Jeffrey So, the assistant manager, was having similar thoughts. ""Personally, I've had enough,"" said Mr. So, surrounded by the glittering remains of Christmas past. ""For us, Christmas never really ends.""Up in the Bronx, at a sprawling warehouse near the Major Deegan Expressway, workers at American Christmas, which produces and installs decorations for the city's biggest office buildings and department stores, have been in a holiday limbo of sorts.In the coming days, crews will begin hauling away the giant toy soldiers and oversize gift boxes arrayed along Avenue of the Americas while other employees start to plot out next year's displays for clients like Radio City Music Hall, the New York Palace Hotel and the Kings Plaza Shopping Center in Brooklyn.For the owner, Fred Schwam, the increasingly early start of the season equals a lot more green. ""We have no complaints,"" said Mr. Schwam, whose company is adding a dozen workers to its full-time roster of 20. During the peak weeks of decoration mounting and demounting, the company employs an additional 80 people.""My crews get Christmas off, but otherwise they're busy all year long,"" said Mr. Schwam, whose telephone customers will hear music of the seasonal sort when they are placed on hold and whose Web site counts down the days to Dec. 25.At the Kurt S. Adler showroom, Mr. Pipitone, the company's sales and visual coordinator, was helping to put the final touches on two dizzying floors of Christmas excess. There was an entire panel of Elvis ornaments, a section for brightly hued Romanian and Colombian glassware, and a collection of animated barnyard animals that mooed and snorted their way through Christmas favorites like ""Deck the Halls"" and ""O Tannenbaum.""Like any tastemaker worth his salt, Mr. Pipitone, who also designs ornaments, offered up his thoughts on next year's styles. The retro look is back, he said, with reds and greens taking center stage. Other hot colors include teal, light pink and snowy white. Gingerbread? Bigger than ever, he said. ""People expect us to be fashion-forward, to stay on top of the trends,"" said Mr. Pipitone, 57, whose Brooklyn home is crammed with six Christmas trees. ""You can't give them the same thing year after year.""Over at Macy's, Jeanne Crowley and her friend Susan Stackpole, in from Connecticut, were more interested in value than the next year's color palette. Dressed in a traditional Christmas sweater and lugging around some felt stockings and a $40 holiday topiary she got at half price, Ms. Crowley, 49, was momentarily transfixed by a fuzzy white Christmas tree skirt, still a bit steep at $35.""I'm a Christmas junkie,"" she said, looking as wide-eyed as a child on Christmas morn. As one measure of her bona fides, she regaled a stranger about her annual spin through downtown Branford, Conn., in which she waves from the back of a fire truck dressed like Mrs. Claus.At a time when many of her neighbors have packed away their tree stands and wreaths, Ms. Crowley, a homemaker, is just getting started. Her attic is filled with Christmas bounty, and she especially enjoys the surprise, come next November, when she opens those Tupperware boxes to find items she purchased 11 months earlier. Her family, Grinchlike, can only roll their eyes.When told that Macy's would usher in a 75 percent markdown the following week, Ms. Crowley nearly burst into applause. ""Let's face it, the coming weeks can be so dark and depressing, so why not extend the holiday season?"" she asked. Then, before heading to the cashier, she had an additional thought: ""Thank God none of this stuff is perishable.""'"

"'06-01-02,'0','Executives at Touchstone Pictures, the division of the Walt Disney Company that released the movie, were initially less sure. ""This was an unusual approach for a Hollywood movie,"" Andrew Mondshein, the film's editor, said by telephone from his home in Larchmont, N.Y., ""and the studio was concerned that we wouldn't be able to do an entire score with original material.""Well, it was possible, and a CD soundtrack has been released to prove it. But the journey from idea to this reconstructed 18th-century score was anything but simple.It helped that Mr. Hallstrom's upbringing in Sweden was steeped in music: he attended a school that specialized in music and music history, and he played the piano, sang in choirs and composed music. Years later, he made pop videos for Swedish television, while one of his first Swedish-language feature films, ""Happy We,"" was set in the world of opera.For ""Casanova,"" though, he did not want a score that illustrated the action. ""I am suspicious of scores which support along the lines of what you're already seeing on the screen,"" he said. ""The American tendency is to underscore what it already up there. I wanted to add an irony or color or shading which doesn't go right along with the visuals.""Still, shooting began in Venice last year without a decision on the score. Leslie Holleran, Mr. Hallstrom's longtime producer, who is married to Mr. Mondshein, said she had even discussed an original score with a ""very famous and expensive"" composer. But, she added, the director's idea of making a ""broad operatic high farce"" in the spirit of commedia dell'arte kept leading them back to period music.While in Venice, with Baroque concerts being held in a church beside the movie's production office, Mr. Mondshein began selecting passages of 18th-century music and testing them on different scenes. Vivaldi is, of course, the Venetian composer par excellence. But, eager to avoid too-familiar music, Mr. Mondshein also turned to Vivaldi's contemporary, Tomaso Albinoni.Once the studio had given its tentative approval for period music, the production then recruited Roy Prendergast, a New York-based movie music editor with a background in classical music and composition. ""When I looked at the film, I thought, this is opera buffa, this is farce,"" he said in a telephone interview, ""and I realized that the opera repertory could provide the most cinematic material.""Although Vivaldi and Albinoni each wrote more than 50 operas, few of them have been recorded, and not all were in the opera buffa style. In contrast, Jean-Philippe Rameau, the 18th-century French composer, presented Mr. Prendergast with a rich choice of comic operas. ""Casanova"" includes no vocal excerpts, but Mr. Prendergast borrowed overtures and dances from eight Rameau operas, including ""Platée,"" ""Zoroastre"" and ""Zaïs.""""I sort of ripped through the entire recorded repertory and just pulled things that I felt would work,"" he recalled. ""I was aware of a large part of the Baroque repertory from my background, but there was also a lot of music that I discovered, which was delightful.""Vivaldi and Albinoni were not overlooked: there are passages from four Vivaldi concertos and one opera, ""Farnace,"" as well as from four Albinoni concertos. Four other Italian composers were also used -- Giovanni Paisiello, Arcangelo Corelli, Leonardo Leo and Francesco Durante -- as well as Vicente Martín y Soler, from Spain, and Johan Helmich Roman, from Sweden. Even Handel and Telemann make cameo appearances in the score.But what about Mozart? Although he was born in 1756, three years after the film is set, legend has it that he consulted Giacomo Casanova before composing ""Don Giovanni,"" his opera about another serial seducer. Indeed, there is evidence that Casanova himself attended the opera's premiere in Prague on Oct. 29, 1787.""After spending two weeks listening to nothing but Baroque music, I finally said, 'Well, now we can go to Mozart,' "" Mr. Prendergast said. ""And I started listening to Mozart, and it was as if I had just come out of a different era. My God, what a radical! Mozart's style was so very, very different from this material. It just didn't play.""Mr. Prendergast put together a track from existing recordings, but he found there were still gaps, notably in what he called ""the most intimate emotional moments."" For these passages, the French composer Alexandre Desplat, who is credited for ""original music,"" and the American composer and conductor Sonny Kompanek wrote short sections in the Baroque style.The entire score also had to be rerecorded, and here, Mr. Prendergast needed to find original sheet music, itself no easy task. Then, through a copy-and-paste job, he created his final version, which runs for around 60 minutes of the 105-minute movie. In July, more than 40 Baroque musicians -- named the Hollywood Studio Symphony for the occasion -- joined Mr. Kompanek in New York to record the score, using period instruments.""I apologized to them beforehand,"" Mr. Prendergast recalled. ""I said, 'I am the person responsible for chopping all this music up.' But they were wonderful. They were all so delighted that Baroque music was getting this kind of exposure.""For his final edit, Mr. Mondshein said, his inspiration was comic opera. ""We mixed the music as another voice in the film, not as a background score,"" he said. To this, Ms. Holleran added excitedly: ""The music became the support on which the film could rest. It was a great adventure on top of a great adventure.""'"
"'06-01-02,'0','Last month the big challenge was to encourage Sunni Arabs to vote in Iraq's parliamentary election. They did, in hearteningly high numbers. Now the challenge is to convince the Sunnis that the results, giving them only a modest minority of seats, reflect not systematic fraud, but the fact that Sunni Arabs make up only a modest minority -- roughly 20 percent -- of Iraq's population.Convincing them has been no easy task, despite declarations by United Nations and other neutral observers that the elections were fair, credible and transparent. This page has emphasized the need for Iraq's majority Shiites and their Kurdish allies to be more inclusive in dealing with the Sunni Arab minority. But the other side of that coin is that the Sunnis themselves need to accept that in democracies, majorities rule, and that the special privileges they enjoyed under a succession of Sunni-dominated regimes are not a birthright.Sunni Arabs have disproportionately dominated Iraq's political elite since even before the modern Iraqi state was created after World War I. The Ottoman Turks favored their fellow Sunnis. The British worked through a Sunni family they installed on the Iraqi throne.The Baathist dictatorship was Sunni-led and, under Saddam Hussein, mercilessly persecuted Shiites and Kurds. It persecuted many Sunnis as well, but as a group they were favored with more than their share of scarce economic resources. Many Sunnis came to believe, and still believe, that they are not a minority at all and account for as much as half the Iraqi population.The new political power of the long-oppressed Shiites and Kurds is proving very hard for many of Iraq's Sunni Arabs to accept. But until they can, it will be hard for them to find their legitimate place in a new democratic order.'"
"'06-01-02,'0','The Club Crackers placement was created by Marathon Ventures, based in Wakarusa, Ind., near South Bend, which has become a major player in virtual product placement. In the last couple of years, the company, which has offices in Los Angeles and New York, has used its technology, called digital brand integration, on several CBS shows, and it is developing versions for NBC Universal and Warner Brothers for both network and syndicated shows.""Anything you can package, we can do,"" said David Brenner, the president of Marathon. ""We could do pharmaceuticals, shampoos, takeout foods, bags from Target.""Deals to introduce new product placement into reruns or DVD releases exclusively have been slow to materialize, Mr. Brenner said. But Dana McClintock, a spokesman for CBS, notes that because the use of the technology is still relatively new, ""there is no hard and fast rule"" on what format is most desirable for virtual products.Mr. McClintock said that so far most advertisers had chosen to run their virtual products on all platforms, but acknowledged that ""as time goes on, there are more complicated deals being cut.""Producers appreciate that the insertion does not affect the work of the show. For instance, it does not need to be accounted for on the set or written into the script. In addition, shots of a product, unlike real brand insertion, cannot be cut out by late editing changes. Many of Marathon's digital placements can be done in a single day.""We can bypass all the production nonsense,"" said Elizabeth Herbst-Brady, a vice president of a media buying agency, Starcom USA, which works closely with Marathon to get products on television. Ms. Herbst-Brady said that her company had moved away from real placement of products in recent years specifically because of these production issues.In December, Marathon signed a deal with Fox to place products on selected prime-time shows. Marathon not only inserted the Club Cracker box into episodes of ""Yes, Dear,"" but also inserted Cheez-Its, a can of Star-Kist tuna and Nutri-Grain bars into the show.Marathon also placed a nonexistent Cheez-It package into episodes of ""Listen Up,"" now canceled. The company also developed a series of Chevrolet Impala logos for a weeklong CBS contest that asked viewers to spot them on various shows, including ""How I Met Your Mother,"" ""NCIS,"" ""Yes, Dear,"" ""C.S.I."" and ""Threshold.""For competitive reasons, Mr. Brenner declines to go into detail about how his technology team, working in a digital studio in Los Angeles, creates the effects. But Eugene Dwyer, chief technology officer at Princeton Video Image, in Lawrenceville, N.J., the company widely credited with pioneering digital product placement, notes that creating virtual products, which are usually two-dimensional digital images supplied by advertisers, is not technically difficult. (Occasionally the company must create 3-D images, so that the camera can move around a product.)Marathon's images look quite real, although they sometimes seem artificially bright if one looks at them closely. The results are much more effective if one is not aware in advance that an item has been inserted.""It has to be contextually logical,"" said Mr. Brenner. ""We wouldn't put a Coke can on the bathroom sink.""Jake Brenner, director of integrated marketing at Marathon, and also Mr. Brenner's son, added: ""We like to say it becomes part of the landscape of life.""The harder task is first finding realistic places to fit the images among a show's many cuts and variations. Princeton Video Image uses software developed at the David Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, N.J., to identify locations and track them in a scene.Marathon has filed for a patent on a system for postproduction placement of products in video programming. The software, among other features, marks potential virtual advertising placement spots with orange dots and provides a detailed description of the shot, its context and its duration.The other difficult part, said Mr. Dwyer, is assuring that the product adjusts to the minute changes in most scenes, like small camera movements and changes in light. Without computer-aided adjustments, the image would inevitably bounce around unnaturally and suddenly appear to lose or gain brightness.Digital manipulation of live television is not new. Networks like Fox have long inserted digital advertisements (but not products) into sports broadcasts -- for example, placing company logos on the backstop behind home plate in baseball games.Princeton Video Image, which claims to have invented the first-down stripes for football telecasts, has placed virtual logos in broadcasts of soccer, golf, football, poker and baseball games, including this year's World Series. The company also made a brief foray into digital insertion during a newscast, replacing NBC's logo with CBS's during CBS's broadcast of the Millennium New Year's celebration, drawing an outcry from critics. ""No one wants to do that anymore,"" said Samuel McCleery, a company vice president.While it is common knowledge that hundreds of TV shows and movies receive fees from advertisers to include their products in scenes, the people behind digital product placement seem concerned that consumers could rebel if the placements became too awkward or intrusive. Will Donald Trump have 30 cans of Pringles in front of him on ""The Apprentice""? Will Coke cans sit on the operating table during reruns of ""Scrubs""?""We're careful not to saturate people,"" said Mr. Brenner, who started his company in 2001. But Ms. Herbst-Brady, who said that networks and advertisers were extremely sensitive to the risks of bombarding their viewers with too many ads, made no distinction between traditional placement and the virtual kind.""It's no different than if the cereal box was there,"" said Ms. Herbst-Brady. ""It's all television. Don't get me started getting into the realm of what's real and what's not real in Hollywood. Don't get me started.""'"
"'06-01-02,'0','ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Jan. 1 - As the incendiary training at some of Pakistan's seminaries drew renewed focus in the weeks after the July 7 bombings in London, President Pervez Musharraf promised to bring the schools into the mainstream and expel their foreign students by the end of the year.But his tough pledge has fizzled.Last week, the government backed away from its deadline and said it would not use force to deport the students. The schools then said they would resist any effort to round up the students, and on Sunday, a coalition representing the seminaries called the government's plan ""inhuman, immoral and totally illegal,"" The Associated Press reported.The schools, called madrasas, were once the Islamic equivalent of Sunday school. Supported by private donations, they now provide housing, meals and education free -- a lure for poor families in particular. The rigid training at some schools, though, makes them ripe for recruiting by Islamist militant groups.Of the four suicide bombers in the London attacks, at least one had spent time at a madrasa here with connections to militant groups.The limited gains in carrying out the madrasa changes reflect the delicate choices General Musharraf faces. His backers say that pursuing madrasas too aggressively would enable religious radicals to depict him as a stooge for the West. Critics say the effort reflects a half-hearted resolve to flush out religious militancy.'"

"'06-01-03,'1','When I spoke to the resident, he confirmed that his patient was angry with him, but he was surprised at the intensity of her reaction to his comments and at her request for a new doctor.Sure, he said, on occasion he had run over with another patient and had kept her waiting a few minutes, but he felt they had a good relationship. Then I met his patient.She was a woman in her early 30's who was articulate and intelligent and angry. I asked her why she was so angry. Well, she said, her therapist was unprofessional for being late, but what really bothered her was his response to her anger.Apparently, he had suggested that her rage over his tardiness was pretty much like her problem in all relationships: other people were perfect until they did the slightest thing to disappoint or frustrate her, then her adoration morphed instantly into rage.His apology for being late had little effect on her reaction.Like others who have what psychiatrists call borderline personality disorder, this young woman had a very fragile sense of self and drastic shifts in her mood in response to even the mildest interpersonal friction.""Can't you just assign her to work with a different therapist?"" the patient care representative asked me.She understandably wanted to please this patient and was clearly worried that if she didn't, the patient might take her complaint to a higher level, like the Department of Health. It wouldn't be the first time.I could have reassigned the patient, but it would not have been in her best interest. Her frustration and anger, I explained to the representative, were an essential part of the problem for which the patient was being treated in the first place.And, her emotions were actually a sign that the treatment was doing what it was supposed to.The representative insisted that the patient was going to make trouble and asked if we could find some way to ""accommodate"" her.Considering that the patient had already fired two therapists in the previous year for nearly identical reasons, I said that switching doctors again would not only fail to solve the problem, it would be anti-therapeutic.According to the business model that now permeates hospitals, all complaints must be taken at face value and assuaged, with little regard to the clinical context or to the effect on the patient.But in good psychotherapy, it is not possible, let alone desirable, to keep patients happy and satisfied all the time. Frustration, anxiety and discomfort are unavoidable in life, and in therapy -- particularly for patients with certain personality disorders.This isn't to say that doctors and hospitals shouldn't submit to intense scrutiny of how they do things. But they can't be blind to the fact that good treatment doesn't always feel good. Conversely, sometimes patients feel good about years of bad psychotherapy that is doing little to help them.For medical consumers, there is a message here: good medicine sometimes means that the customer -- I mean patient -- isn't always right.'"

Investigators traced the plate to the address of one of the teenagers, and the baby Jesus figures were found in a car there, the police said.The boys were charged with theft, conspiracy, criminal mischief and desecration of a place of burial.The baby Jesus figures, now at the police station, were probably stolen from homes and churches around the Sayreville area within the past few weeks, the police said.'"

"'06-01-03,'1','Very carefully, central bankers in Washington, Frankfurt or Tokyo might well answer.None of the three banks is acting aggressively, and two of them, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, seem prepared to rethink their plans if economic conditions suddenly deteriorate. While the Federal Reserve has left itself room for further rate increases, it is believed to be nearing the end of this cycle after raising the rate to 4.25 percent in 13 consecutive quarter-point increases.The good news, analysts say, is that the world has a fair amount of momentum as it heads into 2006. Propelled by a fast-growing Asia and a still-vibrant United States, the global economy could expand 4.5 percent this year, according to Deutsche Bank. That is roughly on par with 2005.While housing prices in the United States may have peaked, the economy remains vigorous, and consumer spending is likely to get a fillip from the easing of oil prices. Deutsche Bank forecasts that the American economy will expand 3.9 percent in 2006, a shade more than last year. Other economists expect less robust growth, on the order of around 3.3 percent, compared with this year's expected 3.7 percent.Growth is also likely to accelerate in Asia, thanks to a reinvigorated Japan and the continuing boom in China. The Chinese economy will expand nearly 9 percent in 2006, only slightly less than last year, according to a forecast by the Asian Development Bank.Even Europe, which fell short of expectations last year, may perk up in 2006, thanks to continued strong demand for its exports -- from China, as well as from traditional markets like the United States -- and signs that Germany's long-dormant consumers are stirring.There are caveats to this upbeat scenario. A sharp decline in real estate prices in the United States, rather than the expected gradual softening, would crimp consumer spending. That would hurt both Europe and China, which ships 40 percent of its exports to the ravenous American market.A slowdown in China's export-led economy, either because of internal political pressure or external resistance, would also reverberate globally. China's relentless rise as a low-cost manufacturer has helped the global economy in a number of ways, not least by driving down inflation.""For the last three years, we've had a two-engine world: the Chinese producer and the American consumer,"" said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley. ""Both engines are going to slow down. The debate will be whether this two-engine global 747 is in danger of stalling.""Sometimes regarded as an economic Cassandra, Mr. Roach is not actually predicting such a calamity. But he says that there are risks. If China's exports continue to boom, China will face rising pressure from the United States to further revalue its currency, the yuan -- a move that could start to reorient its economy from exports to its vast domestic market.""Everybody still embraces China as a perma-growth story,"" Mr. Roach said. ""But that will be challenged in 2006.""A renewed weakness in the dollar, which Mr. Roach expects this year, would put pressure on American consumers because it would make imports more costly. That, in turn, could threaten the sky-high housing market, without which, he said, ""the American consumer is toast.""In any case, the lopsided trade relationship between China and the United States will likely re-emerge as the decisive factor in the value of the dollar. The dollar's resilience proved to be one of the major surprises of last year. It declined sharply against the euro, yen and other currencies in 2004, and Mr. Roach and others expected it to fall further in 2005.The United States, after all, is running a quarterly current-account deficit -- the broadest measure of its balance of trade -- of nearly $200 billion, which most economists view as unsustainable.Instead, the dollar staged a rebound, driven in part by the widening gap in interest rates between the United States and Europe and Japan. The euro was also weaker because of Europe's anemic economic performance, the deadlocked German elections and the rejection of the European Union's proposed constitution by voters in France and the Netherlands.Now, with Europe and Japan reviving and with the Federal Reserve perceived as nearing the end of its tightening cycle, analysts predict that the dollar will resume its downward course against the euro and the yen. They note, too, that the current-account deficit is coming back into focus.""Investors will once again take this risk into account,"" said Michael Schubert, a currency analyst with Commerzbank. ""The only thing we know about the current-account deficit is that it can't go on forever.""Mr. Schubert forecasts that the dollar will trade at $1.28 versus the euro by the end of this year; it is currently $1.185. He said the yen's value would hinge on the actions of the Bank of Japan, while the Chinese would modestly revalue the yuan, having done so once last summer.A weaker dollar could help American stocks, Mr. Mayer said, because it would make American exporters more competitive. But with the uncertain prospects for consumer spending, it might be difficult for American markets to match their buoyant performance of recent years.Conversely, a rising euro would not be welcome in Europe, which relies heavily on exports. Morgan Stanley expects European stock markets, after a remarkable rally in 2005, to stagnate this year, especially with corporate profits already high and interest rates starting to climb.Repeating the performance of 2005 will be especially difficult in Germany. The DAX stock index, which includes big names like DaimlerChrysler, Volkswagen and Siemens, rose more than 30 percent -- a sprightly pace utterly at odds with the country's sluggish economy.Despite the muscular euro, Germany demonstrated in 2005 that it could maintain its title as the world's top exporter of manufactured goods. One factor was China's demand for heavy machinery and other products. But German companies, analysts said, also improved their competitiveness generally by cutting costs and keeping a lid on wage increases.""The success of Germany's export sector has been remarkable, and I think it's quite likely to continue,"" said Michael Heise, the chief economist at Dresdner Bank and Allianz in Frankfurt.The question is whether stricter monetary policy will strangle Europe. Despite a few rays of hope, consumer demand in Germany remains weak. Italy has been skirting recession and France is saddled with double-digit unemployment, which some blame for the recent surge of urban unrest there.European politicians have vigorously protested the central bank's recent shift in policy, saying that the continent's economies are still too fragile. They say that the bank has also overestimated the threat of inflation, particularly since oil prices have moderated after surging for much of 2005.In fact, tighter monetary policy on three continents could help keep the price of crude oil in check this year.""Part of the run-up in oil prices was a reflection that there was a lot of monetary stimulus in the market,"" Mr. Mayer said. ""Taking some of that out of the market could take the air out of oil prices.""Deutsche Bank forecasts that oil prices will ease after the winter, though the average price per barrel may end up the same this year as last. By the end of 2006, it projects a reduction in prices as demand moderates and OPEC members increase their production capacity.With the retirement of Alan Greenspan this month -- and the arrival of Ben S. Bernanke as the new Fed chairman -- and with the major central banks moving in tandem to tighten credit, 2006 promises to be an eventful year for those who watch these institutions.""The Greenspan era has coincided with a period when the global economy has made the job of a central banker easier,"" said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics and public policy at Harvard.The curse of high inflation has receded, he said, because the competition from low-cost producers like China has driven down the prices of so many goods. That is why the economic health of China -- just like that of the United States -- is a matter of concern to everybody.""China has made everything run better,"" Mr. Rogoff said. ""If it were to collapse, Ben Bernanke might be in the uncomfortable position of having to set interest rates much higher than he expected.""'"
"'06-01-03,'1','Union leaders say that they have achieved a tentative contract that is fair and equitable and that should be ratified. In a statement yesterday, Mr. Toussaint said the contract proposal had ""the overwhelming support of the executive board.""""It not only provides solid wage gains for our members,"" he said in the statement, ""but secures their golden years by protecting their pensions and by offering full health benefits after retirement for the first time. In addition, the contract goes further by providing pension refunds to our members who overpaid into their benefits.""The contract goes to the 33,700 members of the rank and file, subway and bus workers, for a mail-in vote later this month. The dissidents urged the members to vote no.Mr. Toussaint is due in court this month to face penalties for taking his union out on a strike that was barred by the state's Taylor Law. Mr. Mooney said he believed that the looming legal pressure had compromised Mr. Toussaint's bargaining power.""Roger Toussaint gets threatened with jail, and the next thing you know, he's coming back to us with a contract full of givebacks,"" he said.Workers had previously paid nothing toward their health insurance premiums, but under the new contract, they would contribute 1.5 percent of their wages. Mr. Toussaint agreed to the concessions on health insurance premiums in exchange for the transportation authority's dropping its demand to have future workers pay 6 percent of their wages toward their pensions, up from 2 percent for current workers.The dissidents called upon Mr. Toussaint to convene an immediate meeting of the board and disclose the negotiations to the other board members and transit workers.The complaints reflect the deep divisions between the dissidents and Mr. Toussaint, who was elected in 2000 from a slate of insurgents promising to strengthen the union against the demands of management.Last January, Mr. Mooney and four other union vice presidents sued Mr. Toussaint in Federal District Court in Manhattan, alleging that he had violated the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, a federal law that gives union members democratic rights. The suit complained that Mr. Toussaint had failed to hold open meetings and had suppressed free speech.Mr. Toussaint has denied the accusations. In September, both sides agreed not to file any new motions in the federal lawsuit until the union had reached a new contract with the authority.In his statement, Mr. Toussaint called the dissidents ""a few disruptive individuals.""""At every turn, they have taken positions that would hurt our members and the union only to further their own ambitions,"" he said.'"

"'06-01-04,'1','In six years on the Council, Christine Callaghan Quinn has proved to be both a formidable opponent and ally of the mayor's.As chairwoman of the Health Committee, she has sponsored legislation to provide health care benefits to domestic partners and grocery workers over the objections of Mr. Bloomberg. But she also provided support for his ban on smoking in most restaurants and bars.Yesterday, in her first news conference since emerging as the next speaker, Ms. Quinn, who lives in Chelsea, appeared elated and a bit nervous as reporters and television cameras followed her around a center for the elderly in Greenwich Village.Though short of specifics, Ms. Quinn pledged to promote ""an aggressive legislative agenda"" that would revisit the issue of term limits for council members, which she opposes and the mayor supports. Ms. Quinn said that she envisioned her role as that of an equal partner with Mr. Bloomberg, adding that their relationship was ""a solid one, a professional one, one where we have mutual respect.""She takes on a post that has played an increasingly central role in running the city in recent years, with the departing speaker, Gifford Miller, often blocking Mr. Bloomberg's initiatives and overriding his vetoes of legislation. Many expect Ms. Quinn to take an even more active role in shaping policies, though perhaps by consulting more with the mayor.""She's a person who's not afraid to stand up for what she believes in,"" said George Arzt, who has known Ms. Quinn for more than a decade. Mr. Arzt was press secretary for Mayor Edward I. Koch. ""But she tries to sit down and reason with you. If not, she will go her own way.""The Council's agenda for the next four years is expected to include efforts to extend term limits for council members from 8 to 12 years, to develop a waste disposal plan, and to create new zoning rules for a city bursting with economic growth and desperate for new housing.Ms. Quinn, who lives in a rent-stabilized apartment, said that she would seek to improve the lives of New Yorkers by preserving important social services like senior centers, among other things.""I want to be a five-borough speaker who targets the problems and needs that New Yorkers face every day,"" she said. ""I want the City Council to be a place that in four years, New Yorkers will look back and say, 'Those people made the challenges we face easier.' ""Ms. Quinn emerged as a vocal and galvanizing detractor of the stadium as soon as the plan was unveiled in March 2004, helping to organize the opposition and lend it legitimacy before others took note of the issue's potency. It was not until November of that year that the Council speaker, Mr. Miller, spoke out against the plan.And through her membership on the Council, she raised major questions about the planned public financing for the stadium in her district, which includes Greenwich Village, Chelsea, Clinton, parts of SoHo and Murray Hill.Despite their differences over the stadium project, Ms. Quinn has already started to build on her relationship with Mr. Bloomberg. In recent weeks, as she emerged as the strongest contender for speaker in a crowded field with six other council members, Ms. Quinn was invited to Gracie Mansion for coffee with Mr. Bloomberg, mayoral aides said. She happily obliged.And on Monday, the mayor called to congratulate Ms. Quinn after she received the support of the powerful Democratic organizations in Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn, all but ensuring that she would be elected speaker by a majority vote of the council members today.Mr. Bloomberg, who did not get along with the previous speaker, Mr. Miller, pledged yesterday to work with the Council's new leader.""I don't agree with her on everything, she doesn't agree with the administration on everything,"" Mr. Bloomberg said about Ms. Quinn at a news conference at a Brooklyn park. ""But we'd be happy to work with whoever the City Council picks.""She entered the political world after meeting Thomas K. Duane, who would be the city's first openly gay council member, while she was running the Housing Justice Campaign for the Association of Neighborhood and Housing Development. She left that job to manage his 1991 campaign.In the Council, Ms. Quinn's sensitivity has made her popular with other members and lobbyists, who praise her receptiveness and commitment to issues rather than adherence to any particular ideology. During hearings, she has not only teared up with joy but also let out loud belly laughs that make her colleagues chuckle.But Ms. Quinn's easygoing, gregarious demeanor can also be deceiving. Councilman James S. Oddo of Staten Island, the Republican minority leader, said he has watched with admiration as Ms. Quinn has evolved into a skilled leader with ""a laserlike concentration"" since they both started out as Council aides in the early 1990's.""She's lived through so many battles, and that provides you with armor for the battles yet to come,"" Mr. Oddo said. ""She has an institutional memory, and she's seen the best and the worst of the City Council.""Ms. Quinn, a Long Island native, said that her leadership style would be neither liberal nor conservative in the traditional sense, but rather pragmatic. ""What I would like to be is effective,"" she said. ""I like to think of myself as someone who is compassionate, and responsive and effective.""EDUCATION -- Trinity College, Hartford, class of 1988, degree in urban studies and education.CAREER HIGHLIGHTS -- city councilwoman, 1999 to present; executive director, New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, 1996 to '98; chief of staff for Councilman Thomas K.

"'06-01-04,'1','If it does nothing else, ""Stryker,"" a grim little gang melodrama directed by Noam Gonick, might dispel some American assumptions about life in Canada. The streets of Winnipeg, where this crude, punchy picture takes place, look a lot like those in Detroit, Philadelphia or Los Angeles, as depicted in countless hip-hop-inflected movies (more than a few actually filmed in Canada) about the perils and thrill of the thug life.One difference is that there is more snow on the ground. Another is the ethnicity of the gangs battling for control of the drug trade. The central character (Kyle Henry) is a 14-year-old boy from an Indian reservation who comes to Winnipeg by freight train after burning down an abandoned church. He arrives just in time to witness a fight between members of the Indian Posse, a crew led by a swaggering matriarch known as Mama Ceece (Deena Fontaine), and the Asian Bomb Squad, a mostly Filipino outfit whose boss is Ceece's archrival, Omar (Ryan Black).From there, Stryker -- not his name, which we never learn, but rather a slang term for a new gang recruit -- takes a tour of the North Winnipeg lower depths, moving from a house full of transvestite prostitutes to police custody, and then to a foster home run by a dissolute Eastern European woman named Tania. He never speaks a word and serves as a mute witness to the brutality and squalor around him.Mr. Gonick's point, underscored by the defiant, politically tinged rap on the soundtrack, is that much of Canada's indigenous youth has been forced into crime by a racist and unfeeling system, and that gangs represent a desperate form of political resistance. This idea might have been more persuasive, or at least more provocative, if ""Stryker"" had been executed with more force and coherence.The mostly unprofessional cast does a lot of shouting and swearing, and Mr. Henry's face has a haunting impassivity, but the film does not offer much in the way of social insight or credible emotion. Its dogged sincerity is evident, but not enough to make it more than an amateurish curiosity.Directed by Noam Gonick; written by Mr. Gonick and David McIntosh; director of photography, Ed Lachman; edited by Bruce Little; music by Rezofficial; production designer, Mark Gebel; produced by Ryan Black and Mr. Gonick; released by Strand Releasing.

"'06-01-04,'1','Adding to the uncertainty was the release of three contradictory market reports yesterday purporting to measure the same thing -- current prices of Manhattan co-ops and condos. Prices were reported to be up slightly, down slightly, or down more sharply, from the previous quarter, depending on who was counting.The Elliman report found that despite the slowing sales, the average price of a Manhattan apartment rose 3.3 percent, to $1,187,000, from the previous quarter, but nearly 10 percent below the peak reported in the second quarter. Even so, the average remained 23 percent above the average in the last quarter of 2004.And it reported that the average sale price per square foot -- which takes into account the changes in mix of large and small apartments -- rose above $1,000 for the first time this quarter, to $1,002 a square foot.A second report by two other brokerage firms, Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead, found that average prices declined from the previous quarter by 4.3 percent, to $1,090,000. A third report by the Corcoran Group, found that average prices had declined 7 percent, to $1,129,000.The differences reflect the difficulties in collecting data in Manhattan, where co-op sales prices are not publicly reported, and condominium sale deeds are often filed a month or more after a sale is completed. But they may also reflect changes in the market that occurred late in the quarter that were picked up by some surveys but not by others.Brokers said, for instance, that they had seen a flurry of contracts in the last few weeks, especially in the more expensive apartments, as buyers contemplating softening prices and end-of-year bonuses decided to overcome their fears and buy. But most of them would not have found their way into the reports.""There was significant pickup in the last six weeks of the market; the buyers came flocking back,"" said Pamela Liebman, chief executive and president of the Corcoran Group. ""Part of it was the anticipation of the Wall Street bonuses, part of it was the feeling that there was some opportunity to buy and negotiate.""The market watchers also point to other optimistic signs: a handful of sales of more than $10 million that have gone into contract but not yet closed, and that are not reflected in the current data. And they note that the current market numbers do not include dozens of sales in new buildings that went to contract this fall but will not be reflected in sales statistics for a year or more, until buildings are completed and the sales close.Gregory Heym, chief economist for Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead, attributed the decline in the average sale price in his study to the declining share of sales of large apartments in the last six months, and the increasing share of lower-priced studios and one-bedrooms.""The only thing holding prices back is the fact that mix has changed,"" he said.In his study, for instance, sales of studio and one-bedroom apartments accounted for 61 percent of all sales, up from 55 percent in the fourth quarter a year earlier.And the Corcoran study, which recorded the largest decline in overall average sales, prices of one- and two-bedroom apartments actually rose, while those of studios and large apartments of three bedrooms or more fell.The inventory of unsold co-ops and condos on the market also rose again in the last quarter, often a sign of a weakening market. Yet the increase, 3.5 percent to 5,964 listings, was only modest, compared with the 16 percent increase from the second to third quarter, according to Mr. Miller. The average number of days an apartment was on the market rose by four days, from 133 to 137.The inventory listings at the end of this quarter, 5,964, were far above the level reported a year earlier, when only 3,922 apartments were listed. Mr. Miller said inventory at the end of 2004 was the lowest in more than four years and marked the start of a large run-up in prices, and worries about a market bubble.But he said the current inventory levels were below those found several years ago, and closer to balance between buyers and sellers.'"

"'06-01-04,'1','The Homeland Security Department announced this week that it intended to rely more on the risk of a terrorist attack, and less on politics, when it hands out funds under a key antiterrorism program. This is very good news -- with two caveats. It still remains to be seen precisely how the money will be handed out. And the improvements in this single program do not change the fact that Congress, thanks to the influence of small-state senators, still lets politics play a disturbingly large role in the distribution of other antiterrorism funds.National security experts, including the 9/11 commission, overwhelmingly agree that antiterrorism money should be handed out based on the risk of an attack and the harm it would do. But members of Congress have trouble seeing any program -- even one designed to protect the nation from terrorists -- as above politics and patronage.Senators from small low-risk states, led by Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, scored an unfortunate victory last year when they blocked an amendment, backed by all six senators from New York, California and Texas, that would have distributed more antiterrorism money on the basis of risk. As a result, states like Wyoming -- and Maine -- still get too much money, and places like New York City and Washington, D.C., get too little.Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff has, to his credit, been a consistent supporter of an approach based more on risk. In this week's announcement, he promised to rely more heavily on risk in making decisions on allocating $765 million under the Urban Area Security Initiative. There are, however, several factors that may interfere with his good intentions. The department intends to take into account the degree to which a grant could be used to help with disasters not related to terrorism, like hurricanes or pandemics. This could blur the program's focus and end up directing more money toward places that face nonterrorist threats, an outcome that was not Congress's intention.It is also possible that when financing proposals are actually evaluated later this year, Mr. Chertoff's emphasis on risk will become lost in an array of other criteria.Whatever success Mr. Chertoff has in improving this program, two others are still badly in need of a similar reorientation toward risk and away from politics: the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program, which account for much of the nation's antiterrorism spending.'"
"'06-01-04,'1','The housing project was scuttled and much of the land eventually turned over to the city, after which it became the site of Dodger Stadium, new home to the former Brooklyn Dodgers.The entire episode has inspired books, documentaries, a play and even a recently released album by Ry Cooder called ""Chavez Ravine."" ""Every church has its prophets and its elders,"" one song goes. ""God will love you if you just play ball.""Mr. Wilkinson consistently refused to testify about his political beliefs. He had, in fact, joined the Communist Party in 1942, according to ""First Amendment Felon,"" a 2005 biography by Robert Sherrill. He left the party in 1975.Mr. Wilkinson continued his antipoverty activities and, in 1955, was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee, which wanted to know whether he was a Communist. This time, Mr. Wilkinson used what he believed was a novel approach. Instead of claiming his Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination, he refused to answer on First Amendment grounds, saying the committee had no right to ask him.The committee requested that Congress cite Mr. Wilkinson for contempt, but it was not until 1958 that he and a co-worker, Carl Braden, became the last men ordered to prison at the committee's behest. Mr. Wilkinson fought the contempt citation in the courts, but the Supreme Court, by a vote of 5 to 4, affirmed it.At a press conference after the decision, Mr. Wilkinson said: ""We will not save free speech if we are not prepared to go to jail in its defense. I am prepared to pay that price.""In 1961, the year construction began on Dodger Stadium, Mr. Wilkinson spent nine months at the federal prison in Lewisburg, Pa. He came out of prison, he said, determined to fight for the committee's abolition. For the next decade, he traveled the country, speaking and protesting, largely through his National Committee Against Repressive Legislation, based in Los Angeles.On Jan. 14, 1975, when the committee was finally abolished, Representative Robert F. Drinan, Democrat of Massachusetts, paid tribute to Mr. Wilkinson, saying, ""No account of the demise of the House Un-American Activities Committee would be complete without a notation of the extraordinary work done by the National Committee Against Repressive Legislation.""But Mr. Wilkinson was not finished with the federal government. When he discovered, in 1986, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had been compiling files on him, he filed a Freedom of Information Act request for their release.He was sent 4,500 documents. But he sued for more, and the next year the F.B.I. released an additional 30,000 documents, and then 70,000 two years later. Eventually, there were 132,000 documents covering 38 years of surveillance, including detailed reports of Mr. Wilkinson's travel arrangements and speaking schedules, and vague and mysterious accusations of an assassination attempt against Mr. Wilkinson in 1964.A federal judge ordered the F.B.I. to stop spying on Mr. Wilkinson and to never do it again.He is survived by his first wife, Jean, of Oakland, Calif.; their three children, Jeffry Wilkinson, of Albany, Calif., Tony Wilkinson, of Berkeley, Calif., and Jo Wilkinson of Tucson; and by his second wife, Donna; her three children from a previous marriage, John, William and Robert Childers; 19 grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.Frank Wilkinson was born Aug. 16, 1914, in a cottage behind his family's lakeside retreat in Charlevoix, Mich. His father, a doctor, came from a family that had lived in America since colonial days. His mother was French Canadian. Mr. Wilkinson was the youngest of four children.Mr. Wilkinson's father fell in love with Arizona while posted there in World War I and moved the family to Douglas, Ariz., after the war. The family lived there until Frank was 10, then moved to Hollywood for two years while their permanent home was being built in Beverly Hills.They were a devout Methodist family and firm Republicans. ""Every morning of my life, we had Bible readings and prayers at the breakfast table,"" Mr. Wilkinson once said.He attended Beverly Hills High School and then the University of California, Los Angeles, graduating in 1936. He was active in the Methodist Youth Movement, president of the Hollywood Young People's chapter of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and an organizer for Youth for Herbert Hoover.After college, considering a career in the ministry, he decided to tour the Holy Land. On the way, along Maxwell Street in Chicago, the Bowery in New York and later in the Middle East, he had his first glimpse at wrenching poverty, and he described it as a life-altering experience.Mr. Wilkinson lost his faith and found himself adrift. ""What do you do if you have no religion?"" he said. ""What is the basis of your ethics?"" He chose to become active in efforts to eradicate the kind of poverty he had seen in his travels.In later years, he would spend months on the road, speaking to whatever group would listen to him, usually telling his own story and answering questions.In 1999, he received a lifetime achievement award from the American Civil Liberties Union. Four years earlier, the City of Los Angeles, which had once fired him, issued a citation praising Mr. Wilkinson for his ""lifetime commitment to civil liberties and for making this community a better place in which to live.""'"
"'06-01-04,'1','WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 - The Bush administration notified federal trial judges in Washington that it would soon ask them to dismiss all lawsuits brought by prisoners at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, challenging their detentions, Justice Department officials said Tuesday.The action means that the administration is moving swiftly to take advantage of an amendment to the military bill that President Bush signed into law last Friday. The amendment strips federal courts from hearing habeas corpus petitions from Guantánamo detainees.On Tuesday, the Justice Department sent notices to all the federal judges in Washington who have cases involving challenges brought by Guantánamo inmates, informing them of the new amendment. The officials said the department would file formal notices within several days asking the judges to dismiss more than 160 cases involving at least 300 detainees.If the administration wins its argument it would mean an abrupt end to a wide effort by dozens of lawyers to use the right of habeas corpus in federal courts to challenge the imprisonment of suspected terrorists at Guantánamo as enemy combatants.The administration had selected Guantánamo as the site for a detention camp for terrorism suspects in the expectation that its actions would not be subject to review by federal courts. But in June 2004, the Supreme Court ruled that the naval base at Guantánamo was not outside the jurisdiction of United States law and that the habeas corpus statute that allows prisoners to challenge their detentions was applicable.'"
"'06-01-04,'1','MEXICO CITY, Jan. 3 - The Mexican authorities are investigating the death of an 18-year-old Mexican man shot by a United States Border Patrol agent after he had illegally crossed the border into California.Witnesses told Mexican authorities that the man, Guillermo Martínez Rodríguez, was shot Friday. A brother and two other men traveling with him helped him to return to Tijuana, where he died in a hospital a day later.Todd Fraser, a spokesman for the Border Patrol, acknowledged the shooting in a telephone interview on Tuesday, saying that an agent had ""come under attack by an assailant who was throwing rocks."" The agent ""fired back in self-defense,"" Mr. Fraser said. Then, he said, the migrant climbed back over the fence and fled into Mexico.Mr. Fraser said he did not have a figure for the number of migrants shot by American border agents last year, but he said the number of rock attacks by migrants against agents in the San Diego area had increased to 218 incidents in 2005, from 112 in 2004. ""The rock attacks are increasing, and that is attributed to the increased enforcement by our agents,"" he said. ""Smugglers are getting frustrated because they can't get their loads through, and that results in more attacks on our officers.""Mexican authorities, however, said the shooting reflected a growing hostility in the United States toward migrants. The authorities have used the shooting to draw attention to a law passed by Congress last month that would strengthen controls along the border and mandate the construction of miles of steel fences that Mexicans have likened to the Berlin Wall.Mexico has condemned the proposed law as ""shameful,"" saying it does not recognize the contributions of undocumented workers to the American economy. Previous border enforcement efforts, Mexican authorities say, have not stopped migrants, but have pushed them onto isolated and inhospitable routes.'"

"'06-01-05,'1','A six-loser hand opposite a single major-suit raise is usually worth a game-try. Doing that with this hand is debatable because it is highly unlikely that you can make four hearts. But bidding three diamonds has the advantage that it tells partner about your second suit, potentially making it easier for her to judge what to do should North's next bid be, say, four spades.You rebid three diamonds, lefty passes, partner returns to three hearts, and righty contests with three spades. What would you do?You have bid your hand to its fullest extent, so you should pass. Lefty passes and partner doubles. What now? You have described your hand fairly well. True, partner will expect another couple of points, but that is too bad. Do not run to four hearts out of fear. Trust your partner and pass. (South would double four hearts. The lead of a trump or an unlikely low club defeats it by two tricks.)Last question: What would you lead against three spades doubled?Eventually I decided to start with the club deuce. I was tempted by a diamond because partner rated to be short there. And the heart ace was feasible but less appealing because it might establish a trick for declarer's king, and it might be an important later entry.Declarer ducked the first trick to my partner's king, and she shifted to her singleton diamond. South took the trick with his ace. This would have been all right if he had cashed his club jack, played a trump to dummy's ace, and taken the ace-queen of clubs, discarding two red-suit losers from his hand. That would have held the penalty to 100 and a slightly under average score for North-South. But declarer wanted to take the trump finesse, which he should have realized had no chance. If South had won Trick 2 with dummy's diamond king and continued with the ace and another trump, he could have escaped for minus 300. But when he followed his plan, my partner won Trick 3 with her spade king and switched to the heart ten. I overtook with my jack and led the diamond queen, East ruffing the board's king. Now came the heart nine to my queen, and I cashed the diamond jack, partner discarding her last heart. I led the heart ace, dummy ruffing with the spade eight and East overruffing with her ten. Declarer had the rest, but we were plus 500 for a 91 percent board.If you overbid early, live with it. Do not furiously backpedal later.'"

"'06-01-05,'1','The Brooklyn district attorney's office is investigating whether a former F.B.I. agent may have helped a Mafia mole murder a rival in a 1992 gangland killing.Investigators are looking into whether the former agent, R. Lindley DeVecchio, may have helped a Colombo family gangster, who was working secretly as his informer, kill a rival in the mob, according to a law enforcement official who has been briefed on the case.The investigation concerns the killing of Nicholas Grancio on the streets of southern Brooklyn on Jan. 7, 1992, after a joint F.B.I.- New York Police Department surveillance team was called off of a mission to watch him.The official said investigators were trying to determine whether Mr. DeVecchio, a former organized-crime investigator for the F.B.I., was the one who withdrew the surveillance team and, if so, whether that withdrawal was timed to allow his Mafia informant, Gregory Scarpa Sr., to sweep down on Mr. Grancio with a well-armed hit squad and assassinate him.When Mr. Grancio was killed -- in his car, by a shotgun blast to the head -- it was at the height of the Colombo family wars, an internecine squabble in which two factions of the family murderously fought each other for control. According to court documents, Mr. Scarpa was seeking revenge that day against Mr. Grancio: He was under the impression that Mr. Grancio had had a role in an attempt on his own life, the documents show.'"
"'06-01-05,'1','The countries settled the argument by naming RosUkrEnergo, a company now owned 50 percent by Gazprom and 50 percent by an Austrian-based shell company with unknown beneficiaries, as the exclusive supplier of natural gas to Ukraine.Under the deal, Russia will sell natural gas to this intermediary at the price it had demanded from Ukraine, $230 per 1,000 cubic meters, while Ukraine will buy gas from that company for $95. Ukraine has been paying $50 per 1,000 cubic meters. The company will balance out the price at $95 by selling Ukraine less of the expensive Russian natural gas and a greater volume of lower priced gas from Central Asia.At the center of the deal is an energy trading company that for a decade, under various names, has shipped natural gas to Ukraine from Central Asia, exploiting the price differentials in former Soviet markets and making billions of dollars in profits for its unnamed owners.Exactly who will benefit financially from the new arrangement is obscured by the mysterious nature of RosUkrEnergo, despite vague promises by Ukrainian officials that the company will be reformed in the months ahead to fulfill its new role.'We have reached an agreement that is mutually beneficial and therefore mutually acceptable,"" Oleksiy Ivchenko, the director of Ukraine's natural gas company, Naftogaz, said in Moscow after signing the agreement.The deal, Mr. Ivchenko said, will guarantee Ukraine's domestic supply as well as the transshipment of Russian gas to other European countries, which along with world energy markets were jittery when their supply was put in doubt by the Russian-Ukrainian dispute.Crude oil prices dipped slightly on the latest news. The companies also agreed on a 47 percent increase, to $1.60 per 1,000 cubic meters, in the price Ukraine charges Russia for shipping gas across its territory to Europe.Whatever extra revenue Gazprom might earn through the deal may be offset in the long term by a huge dose of skepticism over its expansion plans in Western Europe created by the failed Russian gas embargo. Western European countries, Moscow's primary natural gas customers, hailed the settlement but said Wednesday that they would seek to diversify their sources of energy.The disruption in the flow of natural gas from fields in the Siberia and Central Asia was the first in the four decades since the Soviet Union began exporting natural gas to Western Europe, according to Martin Bartenstein, the economy minister of Austria, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union.Russian gas will remain ""the backbone of European energy supplies, but certainly we will have to learn the lesson of what has happened in the last few days,"" Mr. Bartenstein was quoted by Reuters as saying.Mr. Yekhanurov, the Ukrainian prime minister, said the higher prices would impel industry in his country to become more energy efficient, perhaps heightening the pace of modernization at Soviet-era factories. But he added that the immediate consequence of the price rise could be bankruptcies at some chemical and metallurgical plants. Those two energy-intensive industries form the core of Ukraine's exports.""I will not say who won or who lost,"" Mr. Yekhanurov said. ""The people of Ukraine and Russia won. Europe won because it will calmly receive gas. Common sense won.""Yet critics have darkly commented on the murky past of the company at the center of the deal. In the 1990's it snatched the most lucrative bits of Ukraine's gas market for itself and won exclusive, and profitable, rights to transship gas over Gazprom's domestic pipeline system.Operating under various names, it was one of many subsidiaries, daughter companies and joint ventures that tapped into the then poorly audited revenue flows of Gazprom, analysts who follow the company say. When Mr. Putin brought new management to Gazprom, many of the schemes dried up. But the Ukrainian middlemen stayed in business.Ukraine's national security service investigated RosUkrEnergo last summer for allegations of ties to organized crime. The security agency's former director, Oleksandr Turchinov, has told the Ukrainian news media that he pressed President Viktor A. Yushchenko to prosecute but instead was removed from his job.Former executives at Gazprom and Naftogaz have held interests in RosUkrEnergo, according to Jérôme Guillet, a Paris-based banker and authority on Gazprom's business practices. ""The names change every year, but it's always been the same mechanism,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""You have a huge trade with hundreds of millions of dollars being captured by a small number of people.""Ukraine's national security adviser, Anatoly K.

"'06-01-05,'1','Mr. Scannell said in a telephone interview yesterday that after ""blossoming the brand, it is time to do something new."" Two executives close to the giant media company, which was officially separated from CBS on Monday, said, however, that Mr. Scannell had not been happy about recent revamping and that he had not hidden his disappointment.In July 2004, Judy McGrath was named chairman and chief of MTV Networks. In November, Thomas Freston, Viacom's chief, reached outside the company to fill the No. 2 spot at the unit, naming Michael Wolf, a former McKinsey executive, president and chief operating officer. These people said that, while Ms. McGrath's appointment was long expected, Mr. Wolf's appointment left Mr. Scannell particularly unhappy.Yesterday, Mr. Scannell denied that he had been upset by the changes.""Michael's appointment made a lot of sense,"" Mr. Scannell said, adding that he was ""valuable for the company."" As for Ms. McGrath's appointment, Mr. Scannell said that the two were friends and that he thought her ""appointment was great.""As to why Mr. Scannell did not get the post of president, a third executive who is close to Viacom said that Ms. McGrath had sought an executive with broad business experience and that Mr. Scannell was more of a ""creative type,"" as this person put it.The executives close to Viacom noted that the salaries for top-level Viacom executives were high by industry standards and that Mr. Scannell earned $3 million to $4 million a year. (Mr. Scannell declined to comment on his pay.) Although Viacom has hardly been slashing costs, the company did lay off about 90 people at MTV Networks in December. While that is a relatively small number, it represents the first layoffs since 2001.During Mr. Scannell's tenure, the company took over the Nashville Network as part of its 2000 merger with CBS. It transformed it into the National Network and, when that did not work, revised it again to become Spike, a network aimed at young men. Spike has recently begun gaining some traction with viewers and advertisers. Mr. Scannell also spun off TV Land from Nick at Nite.Ms. Zarghami has been at the company for 20 years and worked at Mr. Scannell's side for the last 17. She was named general manager of the channel in 1996 and has helped develop other blocks of Nickelodeon programming, including Nick Jr.; Snick, which is Nickelodeon's Saturday night slate; and TEENick.In the release yesterday, Ms. McGrath said that she had appreciated Mr. Scannell as a ""creative and strategic thinker and most importantly, as a friend.""'"

"'06-01-05,'1','Want to ask the Internal Revenue Service whether a wrinkle in rolling money from your 401(k) plan into another retirement account may result in additional taxes? Well, don't delay asking or it will cost you a lot more.The I.R.S. charged $95 last year to rule in advance on unusual rollovers to individual retirement accounts, or I.R.A.'s. The new fees range from $500 to $3,000.For the top fee, the increase is more than 850 times the inflation rate. But if you ask before the end of the month, the I.R.S. will charge last year's fee.The higher fees were buried deep in a regulatory notice posted on the I.R.S. Web site Tuesday night and spotted by Ed Slott, a Long Island accountant who publishes a newsletter on I.R.A. tax traps.Other fee increases include charging $9,000, up from $2,750, to entrepreneurs who want to make sure that their simplified employee pension plans are not too complicated. Multinational businesses that want an advance agreement on how much in taxes they owe on imported goods will soon pay as much as $50,000, which is 10 times the minimum fee last year.And many fee discounts that taxpayers of modest means received in the past will be reduced or eliminated, the I.R.S. announced.'"
"'06-01-05,'1','This is why I decided Sticky needed a coat. Or a sweater. Or something.I went online to look at the possibilities. At Teacuppuppies.com I saw a Chihuahua in a rose-embroidered sweater ($62.99) and matching beanie. I read a description at Purecountrypetboutique.com that said, ""Tummy area is open so they can still do their business."" Adorabledogclothes.com had a Texas cowgirl outfit with a straw hat ($25.59). Thegildedpaw.com had a poncho category.I looked down at Otto, who was sprawled on the floor with a filthy, moldy tennis ball and I said, ""I can't do this.""Otto stopped snoring. He looked up. He scratched. He went back to sleep, and his legs twitched as he chased a dream rabbit.""The photos of dogs in sequined dresses are particularly troubling,"" I said.""Don't get something that makes her look like a hairy Paris Hilton,"" he said. ""Get her something that makes her look tough.""Tough? Sticky weighs 10 pounds. She has ear fringe. She has nicknames like Little Man, Sticky Elizabeth and, inexplicably, Tinka Friedman.""Get her a sweater with a skull and crossbones on it,"" my husband said.""That will terrify her,"" I said.""If it's on her back, she won't see it,"" he said. ""Cover her eyes when you put it on.""A little blindfold might work. I found a scary black skull-and-crossbones T-shirt at Thepamperedpup.com ($28, with ""Monster"" written across the back).But would the cotton lycra fabric keep Sticky warm in the rain? I phoned Derek Hovey, the Web site's owner, to find out.""If you're talking about wearing it for purposes of staying dry in the rain, a raincoat would be better,"" Mr. Hovey said ""There are no raincoats with a skull and crossbones. But we do have a hooded sweatshirt.""""I don't think a hood would fit over her ears,"" I said.""To be honest the hood most often doesn't get pulled over a dog's head,"" he said. ""It's a decorative accent.""""Sticky herself is enough decorative accent,"" I said.Mr. Hovey steered me toward some of his site's popular raincoat designs -- the Lobster and the Whale -- and also mentioned pearlized slickers. (""Reversible,"" he said, ""so if you want to go out at night, eating at a restaurant, you can reverse to the other side, and it's a fashionable print."")Size challenged me. When I tried to measure Sticky from the base of her neck to the base of her tail, she got suspicious of the measuring tape and pranced out of range.Fieldwork was in order. A family delegation, consisting of Sticky, Otto, my youngest daughter and me walked over to Alpha Dog, the local pet store, to inspect the merchandise, which unfortunately did not include any items flying the Jolly Roger. Barely were we inside the door than Otto tried to sidle inconspicuously toward the dog treats. The sales clerk intercepted him and fitted him with an orange slicker. It looked very handsome. He did not seem to notice he was wearing it as he edged toward the organic dog biscuits.""Sticky is a medium,"" the clerk said.""Tinka, you're so cute!"" my youngest daughter said.""Little Man, it's you,"" my daughter said.Sticky tried on a red raincoat with a Count Dracula collar.My daughter asked if Otto could have a coat too. I said no. We took it off him. He did not seem to notice as he lurched toward a display of bones.On the walk home my daughter said, ""If you get Sticky a T-shirt too, she can layer."" My oldest daughter advised, ""It will be a good look for her.""It is a measure of how far gone I was that I considered this statement to be good advice. Back home I saw that Smalldogmall.com had two skull options -- the Happy Skull T ($25) and the Bad to the Bone T ($38, comes in black or pink) -- both of which looked lightweight.""The T-shirt would be fine for lounging around the house, but if you're going out and the wind's blowing, you're going to need something more substantial,"" said Robin Weaver, the owner of Smalldogmall.com.Her dog, Doug, who is pictured on the site modeling the clothes, prefers the whipstitch sweater ($20) with a turtleneck, Ms. Weaver said.But then Doug looks good in anything. Sticky, meanwhile, was dragging around the house, listless in her raincoat. She can sigh loudly for something so small.I came to my senses then. Instead of the T-shirt I ordered some liver biscotti ($6.19) for Otto from Gooddogexpress.com.Correction: January 12, 2006, Thursday The Online Shopper column last Thursday, about coats for small dogs, misstated the name of a Web site that sells a rose-embroidered sweater.

"'06-01-05,'1','LONDON, Jan. 4 - Sheik Maktoum bin Rashid al-Maktoum, emir of Dubai and prime minister and vice president of the United Arab Emirates, died Wednesday in Australia. He was 62.No official cause of death was given, but Australian and Arab news media reported that he had suffered heart problems. His body was flown back to the Persian Gulf on Wednesday for a state burial to be held Thursday in Dubai.Sheik Maktoum had presided over Dubai since 1990, overseeing the development of the emirate from a trading town into a rapidly growing metropolis and business hub.He largely left the emirate's day-to-day affairs to his younger brother, and successor, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, but took active roles in the federation's foreign policy, often representing the seven emirates at international meetings. He also oversaw projects aimed at upgrading the standard of living and education as part of a broad modernization program.But most of all Sheik Maktoum, who was born in a modest family home and educated at a British university, was a lover of horses. He is often credited with introducing Arabs to the world of international equestrian competitions, forming the world-class Godolphin equestrian team and establishing the Dubai World Cup, an annual event that placed Dubai firmly at the center of the equestrian scene.The emir arrived in Queensland, Australia, on Dec. 28 for a renowned yearling sale known as the Magic Millions, The Associated Press reported.Sheik Mohammed, the crown prince of Dubai and the emirates' defense minister, succeeded his older brother as emir. The emirates' Supreme Council, which comprises the seven rulers in the federation, will meet soon to choose a vice president to replace Sheik Maktoum. Similarly, the emirates' president, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, is to nominate a new prime minister to form a cabinet. It is customary for the emir of Dubai to serve in both roles.'"

"'06-01-06,'1','Four longtime purchasing agents who bought milk for Roman Catholic schoolchildren in New York were indicted on fraud charges yesterday, accused of skimming money off the top of their purchases.The indictment, issued by a federal grand jury in Manhattan, accuses the four purchasing agents of collecting at least $2 million over 12 years in hidden commissions on purchases of milk, juice and other food and supplies for schools run by the Archdiocese of New York.The defendants include Vincent J. Heintz, who served from 1992 to March 2004 as the general manager of Institutional Commodity Services, the central purchasing agent for the archdiocese, and Nanette B. Melera, a food services buyer who was described in the indictment as Mr. Heintz's wife. Two other defendants, Joseph J. DeRusso and Michael J. O'Shaughnessy, were buyers not directly employed by the archdiocese.They are accused of fraud and tax evasion.According to the indictment, Mr. DeRusso demanded commissions in cash from a vending company, not named, that provided milk and juice for the archdiocese's schools. At first taking a 5 percent fee, Mr. DeRusso later raised his rate to 10 percent, the indictment says, collecting at least $250,000 over six years on milk and juice purchases alone.Mr. DeRusso often received the payments in Mr. Heintz's office, the indictment charges, and sometimes Mr. Heintz accepted the cash for Mr. DeRusso. It says that in August 2003, a top executive at the milk vending company asked if he could pay the commission by check. Mr. Heintz balked, the indictment claims, and after that Mr. DeRusso insisted on receiving the commissions in cash in the lobby of the archdiocese's offices on the East Side.Mr. Heintz, the indictment alleges, instructed two vendors to submit virtually identical bids so he could continue to extend milk contracts to them. The indictment says that after Mr. DeRusso was questioned by an F.B.I. agent in March 2004, he drew up a false ""brokerage agreement,"" backdated to Feb. 19, 2002, to show that the vendor would pay Mr. DeRusso $1,000 a month for services. According to the charges, the payments far exceeded that amount.'"
"'06-01-06,'1','The Burger King agency, Crispin Porter & Bogusky in Miami, part of MDC Partners, is working on a campaign to help introduce the value menu, which may come as soon as next month.The focus on lower-priced fare is part of a trend that is changing the way marketers hawk their wares to consumers. After years of playing up their higher-priced offerings, advertisers like Procter & Gamble and SABMiller are aiming campaigns at budget-minded shoppers -- who, in these days of high prices for homes, gas, oil and gasoline, may be just about everyone who is not on the Forbes 400.""The reality of the economy"" factors into the decision by Wendy's to restore the Super Value Menu, said Ian Rowden, executive vice president for marketing at Wendy's in Dublin, Ohio.""There's a consumer out there, roughly 18 to 20 percent of our customers, who comes to us to get a good, quality, filling meal at the right price,"" Mr. Rowden said. ""It's an important base.""Many value-minded customers tend to be younger men, he added, which is significant because the consumers who eat the most often at fast-food restaurants are males ages 16 to 24.For the last six months, Wendy's had replaced the Super Value Menu with a Value Choices menu, which raised the maximum price for cheaper products to $1.29, improving profit margins, while keeping some items at 99 cents.Analysts who follow the fast-food industry said the changes confused many longtime Wendy's customers and were partly responsible for a recent slump in sales. (Wendy's is scheduled to report its most recently quarterly results today.)Customers who prefer lower-priced products ""are not always shopping for 99-cent items,"" Mr. Rowden said, but ""based on what we saw in the business"" after the price increases took effect ""we decided we had to make a stronger value proposition, and now we are.""In addition to restoring the 99-cent price for the Junior Bacon Cheeseburger, the Super Value Menu also features products like Crispy Chicken Nuggets, Frosty desserts and a new item, a Junior BBQ Cheeseburger.At Burger King, said Edna Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Burger King Corporation in Miami, a value menu ""is going to be launched nationwide by the end of the first quarter"" after ""an overwhelming majority of franchisees"" approved it in a vote last month.The lower-priced menu is meant to provide ""another compelling reason to visit us more often,"" she added, while offering ""a comprehensive menu that provides our customers with a full range of options from premium products to value-priced products.""Burger King is not ready to discuss prices for or items on the new menu, Ms. Johnson said, nor the ad plans. Burger King is owned by a consortium that includes Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and the Texas Pacific Group.Among other fast-food chains, the McDonald's Corporation, the largest, has a nine-item Dollar Menu, introduced in 2002, and Taco Bell, part of Yum Brands, has a Big Bell Value Menu, with most items costing 99 cents each. The McDonald's Dollar Menu, which includes a Double Cheeseburger and a McChicken sandwich, has been advertised recently in national magazines and is also featured on the company's Web site (mcdonalds.com).As Wendy's reintroduces the Super Value Menu, Mr. Rowden said, the chain is also resuming a campaign that began last September, which plays up the ability of customers to order food custom made to their preferences. Two commercials by McCann Erickson, which are to start running Monday, poke fun at what Wendy's portrays as the reluctance of its rivals to cater to consumer choice.In one commercial, employees of a Brand X restaurant greet a man's request for a personalized burger with a ragged chorus of the Hall and Oates tune ""I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)."" In another spot, a similar request is greeted with a mangled version of the Stephen Stills song ""Love the One You're With.""""The essence of what built Wendy's as a business is food made fresh, made to order, when you want it, how you want it,"" Mr. Rowden said. ""This communicates that in a contemporary way.""""We've seen a couple of years of decline"" in perceptions about Wendy's in ""attributes critical to our brand, like freshness, quality, uniqueness of product offerings,"" he added, but recently ""we've seen that turn around and be positive again, which is good because it indicates future purchase intent.""'"

"'06-01-06,'1','The United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation has been ordered to appear before a judge on Monday to show cause for suspending the skeleton coach, Tim Nardiello, whom the federation placed on administrative leave last week pending an investigation into sexual harassment accusations.Justice James P. Dawson of New York State Supreme Court issued the order yesterday in response to a request by Nardiello's lawyer, James Brooks of Lake Placid, N.Y., for an injunction returning Nardiello to his job and thereby allowing him to go to Germany to coach the team for a World Cup event next week.The hearing will take place Monday afternoon at the Essex County Courthouse in Elizabethtown.As of last night, federation officials said they had not been served with the judge's order, but the federation's president, Jim Shea Sr., said Nardiello had told him it was coming after Shea's motion that the board reinstate Nardiello failed Wednesday. ""I expected it,"" Shea said. ""I expect everything.""Nardiello, the national team coach since 2002, is also seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages from the federation, Brooks said.Brooks said that the only evidence he had received from the federation to support the suspension was a letter written to the federation by Marsha Gale, mother of the 2002 Olympic gold medalist Tristan Gale. The letter details complaints by Tristan Gale about sexual comments made by Nardiello.""I certainly don't think Marsha Gale's letter is sufficient, and if it is sufficient then God help sport,"" Brooks said in a telephone interview. ""If we are talking about stuff that goes back to 2002, it should have been raised before. It can't be, 'If my daughter can't go, you can't go,' and that's the bottom line of that to me.""Gale is not in contention for an Olympic team spot this year.Federation officials say, however, that they have received at least three formal grievances from athletes. One is from Felicia Canfield, who, along with Gale, first leveled the accusations publicly against Nardiello last week. Canfield wrote an e-mail message to the federation board describing what she deemed inappropriate sexual advances and comments by Nardiello. She did this in response to the decision by the federation's interim executive director, Robie Vaughn, to acknowledge previous complaints and ask for Nardiello's resignation, but not until after the Olympics.'"

The proteins, normally found in human saliva, milk and tears, could be refined for use in medicines to fight diarrhea, dehydration and other conditions.But delays in the approval of funding by the Missouri state legislature led Ventria to terminate its agreement to move its operations to Northwest Missouri State, which is in Maryville, about 90 miles north of Kansas City. Ground was broken for the plant last summer.Ventria, a privately held company based in Sacramento, said in a joint statement with the university that its business objectives required having ""processing facilities in place sooner than possible"" for the Missouri Center of Excellence for Plant Biologics, the new plant at the university. Ventria officials declined to comment further.Dean L. Hubbard, president of Northwest Missouri State, said in an interview that demand for Ventria's proteins had grown faster than expected, leading the company to move up by a year its timeline for construction of a processing plant.

"'06-01-06,'1','For proof that criminalizing abortion doesn't reduce abortion rates and only endangers the lives of women, consider Latin America. In most of the region, abortions are a crime, but the abortion rate is far higher than in Western Europe or the United States. Colombia -- where abortion is illegal even if a woman's life is in danger -- averages more than one abortion per woman over all of her fertile years. In Peru, the average is nearly two abortions per woman over the course of her reproductive years.In a region where there is little sex education and social taboos keep unmarried women from seeking contraception, criminalizing abortion has not made it rare, only dangerous. Rich women can go to private doctors. The rest rely on quacks or amateurs or do it themselves. Up to 5,000 women die each year from abortions in Latin America, and hundreds of thousands more are hospitalized.Abortion is legal on demand in the region only in Cuba, and a few other countries permit it for extreme circumstances, mostly when the mother's life is at risk, the fetus will not live or the pregnancy is the result of rape. Even when pregnancies do qualify for legal abortions, women are often denied them because anti-abortion local medical officials and priests intervene, the requirements are unnecessarily stringent, or women do not want to incur the public shame of reporting rape.But Latin Americans are beginning to look at abortion as an issue of maternal mortality, not just maternal morality. Where they have been conducted, polls show that Latin Americans support the right to abortion under some circumstances. Decriminalization, at least in part, is being seriously discussed in Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela, Uruguay and Argentina, and perhaps will be on the agenda after the presidential election in July in Mexico.International pressure is helping. In November, the United Nations Human Rights Committee decided that Peru had violated a woman's rights when a hospital denied an abortion to a 17-year-old carrying a severely malformed fetus, who died shortly after birth. United Nations conferences on women also have forced governments to track and publish their progress on expanding women's rights. This has emboldened women's groups and led to the creation of government offices on women's issues, which have helped the push for abortion rights.Latin American women, who are increasing their participation in the work force and in politics, have also become more vocal. Their voice would be much louder were it not for the Bush administration's global gag rule, which bans any family planning group that gets American money from speaking about abortions, or even criticizing unsafe illegal abortions. This has silenced such respected and influential groups as Profamilia in Colombia. Anti-abortion lawmakers in Washington can look at Latin America as a place where the global gag rule has worked exactly as they had hoped. All Americans can look at Latin America to see unnecessary deaths and injuries from unsafe abortions.'"
"'06-01-06,'1','""He's been a great short-yardage guy for three solid years,"" Trojans Coach Pete Carroll said. ""We ran it to the side and the best way. Everything was exactly what we wanted.""Except the result. A Texas linebacker crashed the gap. Safety Michael Huff came in and completed the tackle as White gasped for extra yardage. White, who finished with 124 yards rushing and 3 touchdowns, fell a few inches short, setting the stage for Young's winning drive.""I tried to make one more surge forward,"" White said wistfully. ""It just didn't work.""Texas Coach Mack Brown said Thursday morning that he would have made the same decision and run the same play.""We had not stopped LenDale White all night,"" Brown said. ""We had not stopped the power play.""That aggressive play-calling popped up throughout the game and the U.S.C. winning streak. Carroll eschewed a chip-shot field goal on fourth-and-1 in the first quarter and called a Leinart sneak. Inexplicably, the Trojans lined up with an empty backfield, and Leinart was stopped for no gain.Against Notre Dame, Carroll elected to go for the victory at the 1 in the waning seconds instead of kicking a field goal to force overtime. That resulted in the Bush Push of Leinart into the end zone, perhaps the most heart-pounding victory in the 34-game streak.""That's just Coach Carroll's philosophy,"" Trojans safety Scott Ware said. ""We always want to be the ones that decide the game.""That philosophy applies to the officiating. Carroll has said he dislikes officials in the replay booth deciding a game. Heading into the Notre Dame game, Carroll elected not to have instant replay. The decision helped the Trojans when Leinart fumbled out of bounds on the play preceding Reggie Bush's push. Perhaps with replay, the spot would have been farther back than the 1.But in the Rose Bowl, replay -- or its absence -- burned U.S.C. at least twice. The officials had ruled that a Leinart pass to the end zone was not an interception, saying that Texas' Michael Griffin did not catch the ball inbounds. The officials reversed the call after reviewing the replay.When Young's knee hit the ground before he pitched the ball to Selvin Young for a 12-yard touchdown, a replay review did not occur.""I'd like to go without instant replay,"" Carroll said last week. ""I'm not a proponent of instant replay. I'd rather stick with what the officials call.""So much goes into a streak like the one U.S.C. cobbled together for three years, from the officials' calls to the health of players to simple good luck. On Wednesday night, the Trojans gambled a bit too much, were frivolous with their timeouts and were stung by the officials.""This was our game to win, there was no doubt about that,"" Carroll said. ""We needed two inches.""Who takes the field for U.S.C. next season lingers as the big question. As many as six juniors, including Bush, White and safety Darnell Bing, could enter the N.F.L. draft.Bush's decision is a foregone conclusion. White said he would decide in a week after talking with his family. ""I love my teammates like they're my family,"" White said. ""I don't want to just bail out on them.""The most closely watched position battle will be who will replace Leinart. The sophomore John David Booty and the redshirt freshman Mark Sanchez will compete for the starting job. Each was considered the top quarterback recruit in the country in his class.They will have to replace one of the great quarterbacks in college football history. Leinart won a Heisman Trophy and was 37-2 as a starter. And as the locker room emptied, Bob Leinart patted his son on the back and said, ""Let's go, Matty.""His hair wet and shaggy, and his eyes sullen, Leinart left the locker room. At the same time, U.S.C.'s football program entered a new era.'"
"'06-01-06,'1','The blog was removed last week from a Microsoft service called MSN Spaces after the blog discussed the firing of the independent-minded editor of The Beijing News, which prompted 100 journalists at the paper to go on strike Dec. 29. It was an unusual show of solidarity for a Chinese news organization in an industry that has complied with tight restrictions on what can be published.The move by Microsoft comes at a time when the Chinese government is stepping up its own efforts to crack down on press freedom. Several prominent editors and journalists have been jailed in China over the last few years and charged with everything from espionage to revealing state secrets.Another research assistant for The New York Times, Zhao Yan (no relation to Zhao Jing), was indicted last month on charges that he passed state secrets to the newspaper, which published a report in 2004 about the timing of Jiang Zemin's decision to give up the country's top military post.China closely monitors what people here post on the Internet and the government regularly shuts Web sites and deletes postings that are considered antigovernment. A spokeswoman for Microsoft said the company had blocked ""many sites"" in China. The MSN Spaces sites are maintained on computer servers in the United States.Ms. Richardson of Microsoft said Mr. Zhou's site was taken down after Chinese authorities made a request through a Shanghai-based affiliate of the company.The shutdown of Mr. Zhao's site drew attention and condemnation this week elsewhere online. Rebecca MacKinnon, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, wrote on her blog, referring to Microsoft and other technology companies: ""Can we be sure they won't do the same thing in response to potentially illegal demands by an overzealous government agency in our own country?""Robert Scoble, a blogger and official ""technology evangelist"" for Microsoft, took a public stand against the company's action. ""This one is depressing to me,"" he wrote on Tuesday. ""It's one thing to pull a list of words out of blogs using an algorithm. It's another thing to become an agent of a government and censor an entire blogger's work.""Another American online service operating in China, Yahoo, was widely criticized in the fall after it was revealed that the company had provided Chinese authorities with information that led to the imprisonment of a Chinese journalist who kept a personal e-mail account with Yahoo. Yahoo also defended its action by saying it was forced to comply with local law.Mr. Zhao is so well known as a blogger that he served as China's lone jury member last year in Germany for a world blog competition.A former computer programmer, Mr. Zhao worked as a journalist for a Chinese newspaper and as a research assistant for The Washington Post before joining The New York Times in 2003.Mr. Zhao, in an interview this evening, said he had kept a personal blog for more than a year and was regularly censored in China, even though he has tried to be careful not to write about significant issues related to his work at The Times.He was apparently one of the first on the Internet to mention that several editors could be fired from The Beijing News. He said he posted something about possible firings on Dec. 28.Two days later, after the top editor there was dismissed, Reuters reported that about a hundred journalists had gone on strike over the dispute and added that several Chinese blogs and Internet chat rooms were discussing the issue. The report said Mr. Zhao had used his blog to urge readers to cancel their subscriptions.Mr. Zhao said in an interview Thursday that Microsoft chose to delete his blog on Dec. 30 with no warning. ""I didn't even say I supported the strike,"" he said. ""This action by Microsoft infringed upon my freedom of speech. They even deleted my blog and gave me no chance to back up my files without any warning.""'"

She didn't accept other people's opinions at face value; she considered them and showed tremendous discipline in the process.""Her husband, J. Insley Blair Jr., was mostly interested in Chinese porcelain; the couple rarely bought things together. Nonetheless, the highlight of the sale is a painting that both Blairs acquired in 1919: ""George Washington at Princeton,"" a signed portrait by Charles Willson Peale, dated 1779 (one of eight known full-length portraits done by Peale between 1779 and 1781 and the only one still in private hands, according to John Hays, Christie's top Americana expert). It is expected to sell for $10 million to $15 million. (On Nov. 30, Sotheby's sold a half-length portrait of Washington by Gilbert Stuart for $8.1 million, a record for a painting by Stuart sold at auction.)A descendant of an old New England family, Mrs. Blair was raised in New York City and outside Newburgh, N.Y. She was a champion tennis player, golfer, skier and skater. She loved salmon fishing on the Restigouche River in Canada and paddling around the Adirondack lakes.Christie's catalog has photographs of the young Natalie Bennett Knowlton in her ski gear in St. Moritz in 1912, the year she married Mr. Blair (1876-1939), a banker and heir to a railroad and banking fortune.The newlyweds bought land in Tuxedo Park, a private community 40 miles northwest of Manhattan, and commissioned Carrère and Hastings, the architects of the New York Public Library, to build a mansion. They had two daughters, Natica (1913-55) and Joan (1915-98). In 1957, Joan Blair Overton donated Blairhame to the Tuxedo Park School.Mrs. Blair first collected English and European antiques, but she was increasingly turned off by antiques on the market with new (or not original) parts grafted on. ""At that time this faking in toto did not obtain in the American furniture -- or rather not to any extent, except possibly in some of the elaborate mahogany pieces,"" she wrote in an unpublished memoir, cited by Mr. Heckscher in The Magazine Antiques in January 2000. ""There was still enough of the real to be found that dealers often had it.""She became intensely patriotic during World War I and began collecting Americana in earnest. She was a proud descendant of Col. Thomas Knowlton, a Revolutionary War hero (and personal favorite of Gen. George Washington's) who fought at the battle of Bunker Hill and died at the Battle of Harlem Heights in 1776.In the 1920's she patronized such New York dealers as Collings & Collings (54 antiques), Henry V. Weil (17 pieces), Charles Woolsey Lyon (15 pieces) and Charles R. Morson (13 pieces). In the 1930's, she turned to Willoughby Farr of Edgewater, N.J., buying 44 pieces from him until she learned he was also selling to Henry Francis du Pont, whose prices she could not (or would not) match.Mrs. Blair collected Americana years before her competitors: du Pont, whose house is now the Winterthur Museum in Delaware; Henry Flynt, the founder of Historic Deerfield in Massachusetts; and Henry Ford, who created Greenfield Village outside Detroit.Her association with the Met began when she donated an antique light fixture for the opening of the American Wing in 1924; she lent or gave the Met many pieces after that. After her husband's death, she closed the big house and moved to a cottage at Blairhame. She then lent 69 pieces of furniture to the Met that the curator of the wing, Joseph Downs, had selected on a previous visit.That loan is an important part of the Met's collection today, although not all of it is still there. Before she died, Mrs. Blair withdrew favorite pieces like the Taunton chest of drawers and the turret-top card table for her new Fifth Avenue apartment.Apart from gifts to institutions, Mrs. Blair left most of her antiques to her daughters, Natica (Mrs. Screven Lorillard) and Joan (Mrs. J. Woodhull Overton). Her grandson, John Overton, is the consignor of this sale.""I'm selling the antiques mostly because I don't think I can care for them in the way they deserve,"" Mr. Overton said in a phone interview from Hawaii. ""They are old, precious and beautiful. I have four young children. I was an only child and grew up with these antiques, understanding their value. I don't think my children would appreciate them.""Mr. Hays of Christie's said that the sale of the whole collection, including the Peale painting, should realize $20 million. If it does, it would be the highest single-owner sale of Americana ever at an auction house. The record is the $14.8 million spent on American furniture, Colonial silver and folk art in the $18.7 million sale of Mr. and Mrs. Walter M. Jeffords's collection at Sotheby's in October 2004.'"

Tymoshenko, who was a driving force behind last winter's Orange Revolution, is emerging as a leading critic of the intricate commercial deal that ended the gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia.Though Ukraine was widely seen as a winner in the dispute after forcing Russia to about-face on its natural gas embargo after one day, and then negotiating a price lower than most other former Soviet states pay, Ms. Tymoshenko said she would work to scuttle the deal because it transfers control of energy imports to a company she calls corrupt.She also said she hoped to use the deal, negotiated by aides to President Viktor A. Yushchenko, to discredit his bloc in parliamentary elections in March. In place of the new deal, she said, Ukraine should insist that Russia uphold a 2004 agreement that fixed gas prices through 2009 at $50 per 1,000 cubic meters.Her opposition adds another layer of uncertainty to the settlement, a multibillion-dollar contract signed by Gazprom, the Russian natural gas company that is the world's largest. Ms. Tymoshenko, who worked closely with natural gas policy in government, is a powerful figure in Ukraine. She and Mr. Yushchenko were allies in the Orange Revolution, the popular uprising that overturned an election and changed the political course of the nation, but fell out last fall during a corruption scandal.Ms. Tymoshenko said the settlement left in place an energy-trading scheme run by RosUkrEnergo, a company that has been criticized for ties to organized crime.'"
"'06-01-07,'0','The United States Postal Service, after a fashion, announced weeks ago that the price of a first-class postage stamp was going up to 39 cents, a 2-cent increase. Tomorrow.""What?"" Kat Roberts, a film producer from Brooklyn, said as she walked down the steps yesterday of the vast James A. Farley Post Office on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. ""I didn't see anything. Have they been advertising it in the paper or anything? That's ridiculous! That's an outrage! I'm a pretty aware person, I read everything, and I keep my eyes open, and I didn't see a thing.""At the Farley Post Office, one of the nation's largest, there were no signs announcing the increase, which the Postal Service said was a result of a Congressional act in 2003 requiring it to put aside more than $3 billion each year into escrow, beginning this year. Congress has not yet decided what the rainy-day fund should be used for.The Postal Service, which last raised rates in 2002, posted a profit of $1.4 billion last year. Without the extra money required by Congress, the service said in a news release, ""postage rates most likely would have remained at current levels until 2007."" All of this information is available on the Postal Service's Web site, www.usps.com.Under the heading ""Stamp News: The Latest From Your Postal Service"" a Web surfer will find the following release, dated Dec. 7, 2005, on the site:""Customers have more options than ever to purchase 39-cent first-class stamps beginning Dec. 8 to use when the new postage rates go into effect Jan. 8, 2006,"" it says.

"'06-01-07,'0','NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 6 - Barry Cowsill, a member of the popular 1960's and early 70's singing family the Cowsills, was identified Tuesday as among the dead nearly four months after he disappeared when Hurricane Katrina flooded this city. He was 51.Mr. Cowsill's body, recovered Dec. 28 from the Chartres Street Wharf, was identified with dental records, said Dr. Louis Cataldie, head of the state hurricane morgue in Carville. The cause of death has not been determined.Mr. Cowsill, who lived on and off in New Orleans, had not been heard from since he left phone messages for his sister on Sept. 1, his family's Web site said.The Cowsills, the inspiration for the television series ""The Partridge Family,"" recorded a series of top hits between 1967 and 1970, including ""The Rain, the Park and Other Things"" and ""Hair."" They also appeared in commercials and print ads for the American Dairy Association.Four Cowsill brothers played in the band: Barry on bass, Bill on guitar, Bob on guitar and organ, and John on drums. Their mother, Barbara, and sister, Susan, eventually joined the group.The Cowsills got their start in Newport, R.I., where by 1965 they had a regular gig at a club. They were spotted by a producer for NBC's ""Today"" show who booked them for an appearance that led to a record deal.The band broke up in the 1970's, amid acrimony that left some members estranged for several years.'"
"'06-01-07,'0','Businesses have postponed buying equipment until after the changeover, she said. When activity picks up, it will exaggerate comparisons of tech providers' past and future earnings.Ms. Walchli's favorite stocks include Insight Enterprises and Avnet, which sell computer systems to small and midsize companies; Ciber, a consulting company that is helping the federal government to build intelligence systems; and Intrado, which provides emergency communication systems to phone companies.As invigorating as an upturn in business spending might be, all work and no play makes a dull recovery. No need to worry. Ms. Walchli said that the shift to the 64-bit platform would allow for souped-up telephones, video and computer games, iPods and other high-tech diversions.""People have kind of given up on technology because they were hit so brutally in the last cycle,"" she said, ""but I think we're going to see bigger demand than people expect.""Some people, maybe, but not Tom Elliott, global strategist for J. P. Morgan Funds in London. He, too, expects a surge in technology spending this year, but he would head to Taiwan to try to profit from it.TAIWAN'S economy is dominated by technology industries, and its stock market is one of the few in Asia to miss out on a huge rally over the last three years. Its turn to shine is approaching, Mr. Elliott said.""The tech cycle is looking positive for Taiwan, which will help about 50 percent of the index,"" he said. ""This will drive a rebound in earnings, with growth possibly as high as 25 percent, compared to the fall of 20 percent we saw in 2005."" Americans can benefit by buying shares in exchange-traded funds.John Buckingham, president of Al Frank Asset Management, likes technology shares for many of the reasons Ms. Walchli does, although he suggested a different set of stocks.""Given the flushness of the average corporate balance sheet, there is plenty of money out there to invest in capital expenditure,"" he said. ""Half of our buy list is tech.""That list includes Seagate, a maker of data storage devices that is trading at 10 times current earnings and that has a 1.7 percent dividend yield, and Avaya, which makes telecommunication equipment. Mr. Buckingham noted that Avaya has a lot of cash on its books, a reasonable price-earnings ratio of 15 and ""the potential to grow nicely for the next three to five years.""Two other ""cash is king"" stocks he likes are American Software, a developer of programs for supply-chain management that has a 4 percent dividend yield, and Traffix, an Internet spammer, but, he assured, ""not one of the horrid guys."" Traffix yields about 6 percent and has $2 per share of cash on its books, a whopping amount for a $5 stock.Low valuations, high yields and big hoards of cash, relative to share prices, are signs of neglect. Fund managers like Mr. Buckingham and Ms. Walchli are happy to adopt these orphan stocks and wait for their peers to discover them.""Buy them when they're cheap, hold onto them and wait to get your bounty when the greater fools come along and track them down,"" Mr. Buckingham advised. ""We know what can happen when investors suddenly discover these stocks. They can go to the moon.""'"

"'06-01-07,'0','In Thursday's column, I mentioned an online 12-board pair event on Dec. 28 at WorldWinner Bridge (www.worldwinner.com). The theme of the session was: bid light and get great results.On Board 6 I had opened one club with 11 points and 2-3-3-5 distribution, and on Board 8 I had opened one heart with ten points and 0-5-5-3 distribution, luckily doing well both times. The diagramed deal was Board 9. I was East. Look only at my hand. With the opponents vulnerable, what would you do as dealer?I was just about to open three clubs, which is not my normal style but the vulnerability was favorable and it felt appropriate for this session, when the telephone rang. I knew the call was going to take some time, so I passed. What a mistake!South opened one no-trump, showing 15-17 points. North, ignoring his spade suit, responded with Gerber, and jumped to seven no-trump over the two-ace reply. At the time I thought that if I had opened three clubs, South would have made a takeout double, and probably North would have driven into six spades, perhaps six no-trump. But it was unlikely that they would have reached a grand slam. Afterward, though, I checked the auctions at the other 22 tables. Only one East opened three clubs. South doubled, West raised to four clubs, North cue-bid five clubs, South rebid five spades, and North jumped to seven spades. So much for my theory.The other disadvantage of my failing to open came with my partner's lead. Understandably, she selected the diamond jack. But now it was the work of only a few moments for South to rake in 13 tricks: five spades, three hearts, four diamonds and one club. He won the first trick on the board, ran the spades, crossed to hand with a heart and played a diamond to dummy's nine. Minus 2,220 gave us a zero.'"
"'06-01-07,'0','Responding to yesterday's government report showing paltry job creation in December, Treasury Secretary John Snow urged Americans not to overreact to one month's snapshot, and to focus on the bigger picture. But that picture is not so pretty.In 2005, the economy added about 2 million jobs. At this point in the last recovery, the yearly job-gain total was 3.5 million.The longer view is even uglier. Job growth in the current period is the worst by far of the four comparable economic upturns since the 1960's: 2.7 percent versus the 7.8 percent tallied in the weakest of those earlier recoveries.It's little wonder, then, that President Bush cherry-picked his way through the latest economic figures in his speech yesterday before the Economic Club of Chicago, rattling off numbers without context. The president's prescription -- more tax cuts -- has failed in the past to create a robust job market and is still not the right answer.For the past two years, average hourly wages and weekly salaries have been flat or falling. Americans' borrowing binge has masked the decline in earning power, but good jobs and rising wages are essential for widespread prosperity. Without them, economic growth has become increasingly concentrated among corporations, shareholders and the top 20 percent or so of earners. The holiday shopping season illustrates this situation: retailers that cater to lower- and middle-income shoppers, like Wal-Mart, Sears and Kohl's had disappointing results, while higher-end chains, like Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, thrived.'"

"'06-01-08,'0','It is a pivotal moment in the professional career of Bradway, 50, who has two years remaining on his contract. Whomever he hires as the Jets' next coach from a list of candidates that includes Jim Haslett, Jim Fassel, Mike Sherman, Al Saunders and Donnie Henderson, Bradway is the man of the hour.In baseball, there has been precedent for a New York general manager following a manager out the door. With the Mets, Steve Phillips, the general manager, was gone not even a year after Manager Bobby Valentine was dismissed, ending a partnership that had taken them to the 2000 World Series.Bradway's handling of the Edwards imbroglio last week did not exactly warm the hearts of Jets fans. His former boss, Carl Peterson, the Chiefs' general manager, wrested the negotiating rights to Edwards, who had two years left on his contract, from the Jets for a fourth-round draft pick.Based on recent deals for coaches, the Jets seemed to be in position to receive at least two midrange picks in exchange for releasing Edwards from his contract. Granted, if Woody Johnson, the Jets' owner, had emerged from the shadows long enough to act as if he still thought the world of Edwards, Bradway might have had more leverage in the negotiations.But Johnson is a leading man for the silent-film era, not the age of the 24/7 news cycle. In November, he ended a public silence of more than a year to talk about the Jets, and then it was to affirm his affection for Edwards.Johnson has been quiet through the recent turmoil, declining interview requests.Bradway's personnel decisions have produced mixed results. He drafted offensive lineman Kareem McKenzie, running back LaMont Jordan and receiver Santana Moss, only to lose McKenzie and Jordan to free agency.Two of Bradway's first-round picks, Moss and Jonathan Vilma, have flourished, though Moss's breakout season came this year with the Redskins after Bradway traded him to Washington for Laveranues Coles. Two other first-round picks, defensive end Bryan Thomas and defensive tackle Dewayne Robertson, have yet to live up to expectations.When he was named the Jets' general manager in January 2001 after working nine seasons in the player personnel department of the Kansas City Chiefs, Bradway touted his interpersonal skills. ""This is a people business,"" he said, ""and the way you win in this business is dealing with people. That's a strength of mine.""In the spring of 2003, when Bradway's performance came under attack after the Redskins signed away four players from the Jets, he took refuge from the critics' arrows. Then he made himself virtually invisible during this 4-12 season, leaving Edwards to account for the injuries and lack of depth that sabotaged the Jets' mission to win the American Football Conference championship.Bradway's public speaking is virtually limited to a weekly call-in radio program during the season that he conducts from a hotel near the Jets' practice center. Bradway is, at his core, a football junkie. Like the fans who call in, the game is his passion.Is Bradway a good fit for Broadway? Right now, the lights are shining on him, and only he can answer that question.'"

""Some were hot enough to evaporate ponds,"" said Kevin Nickell, the extension director in Wewoka, 60 miles southeast of Oklahoma City, for Oklahoma State's program in Seminole County. Wildfires have consumed close to 650,000 acres since November in Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico, and more than 500 homes and at least six lives have been lost. Firefighters in the three states braced for further outbreaks this weekend from the unseasonably warm temperatures, parched landscape and predicted winds.In Texas, the concern shifted to more populated areas, with fires threatening Nacogdoches, in East Texas, and greater San Antonio, to the south, and forcing the evacuation of 250 people in Killeen, in Central Texas. All three blazes were contained by nightfall.[On Friday, Gov. Brad Henry of Oklahoma issued a proclamation declaring Sunday a day of prayer. ""Our hearts go out to those whose lives have been affected by the wildfires,"" Mr. Henry said. ""Oklahomans are strong and resilient, but as people of deep faith in God who have always found solace and comfort in prayer, we understand our limits."" He called on Oklahomans to pray for fire victims and firefighters ""and for rain.""Also, the Federal Emergency Management Agency authorized more money from the nation's Disaster Relief Fund to offset the cost of fighting four recent fires in Texas and Oklahoma. But there was no report on the status of last week's requests by the governors of the two states for federal disaster declarations.Up to 70 of the 269 wildfires in Texas may have been deliberately set, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said on Friday, calling for state authorities to investigate.]Oklahoma officials say that arson is suspected in a small number of the blazes but that most can be attributed to accidents and human carelessness. ""High winds get the power lines to swinging and they arc -- all it takes is a small spark,"" said Chuck Brown, supervisor of audits and investigations for the state Department of Agriculture.In Oklahoma alone, more than 400 firefighters from state forestry agencies, the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, and visiting units from Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, Florida and Kentucky have augmented thousands of local volunteers in battling the blazes. An air war deploying water-carrying Chinook helicopters, tanker planes loaded with fire-retardant chemicals and spotter planes is also being waged.""In Oklahoma -- I have to brag upon our state -- we're very good at coming together,"" Lt. Gov. Mary Fallin said in a visit this week to a convention center in Shawnee that had been turned into a command center.The fires that struck on Dec. 27 in Seminole and Hughes Counties were particularly extensive, covering about 40,000 acres in each county -- about 10 percent of the land in Seminole and somewhat less in Hughes.""It looked like a war zone, like the Kuwait oil fires,"" recalled Mr. Nickell, the extension director, who is helping devise lower-hay diets for the cattle of the stricken ranchers. A bale of hay five feet by four feet feeds about 28 cows for one day and usually sells for about $35.Mrs. Weger, who also works as a deputy county clerk in Wewoka, said she could see two fires burning when she left for lunch a few miles away in Holdenville. ""When we came back there were seven fires,"" she said.And, she recalled, they were headed their way. Mrs. Weger got their daughter, Stephanie, and Stephanie's three children out of their trailer on the property while Mr. Weger, an oil field worker, borrowed a tanker truck with water from a nearby lumber yard and began spraying the grounds. But the lumber company needed its truck back -- it, too, had caught fire.Mrs. Weger said their cows, bulls, pigs and horses were in the path of the flames. ""I couldn't see anything because of the smoke,"" she recalled. They managed to lower some gates to shoo the cattle, none of which turned out to have been on fire, into an area already burned, saving them. Some of the pigs, though, suffered seared bellies, she said.Mr. Weger extinguished some of the flames with a plastic garbage lid, stopping them short of their farmhouse and their daughter's trailer.One neighbor, James Orsburn, who had already lost hundreds of his own acres to the fire, arrived with his tractor to plow a firebreak that kept the flames from spreading.Another neighbor, Barry Tucker, was also in the path of the advancing flames. ""My wife called me frantically, 'Barry, get home!' "" Mr. Tucker said. ""You couldn't hardly see to drive through the smoke.""It just kind of sat there like it was alive, with embers blowing,"" he said of the fire. Then, he said: ""It came and jumped Highway 59. It would hit a cedar tree and just explode.""By nightfall, Mr. Tucker said, a neighbor, Jim Moody, arrived with a spray rig that helped knock down the fire, saving the house. ""My cattle are standing on black ground,"" Mr. Tucker said. But he was hopeful. ""I've seen little blades of green,"" he said. ""This will be beautiful if we get some moisture.""'"
"'06-01-08,'0','The managers of these mutual funds hope to appeal to investors who are frustrated by the weak returns of more conventional investments but unable to commit the $1 million that hedge funds often require as a minimum investment.""The ability to generate superior performance does not rest with the hedge fund industry,"" said Brian S. Posner, a onetime Fidelity star manager who is winding down Hygrove Partners, a $200 million hedge fund firm of which he was a co-founder, to run a new $110 billion unit at Legg Mason, the eighth-largest manager of stock and bond mutual funds.For Mr. Posner, the chance to oversee a large pool of assets at a fast-growing, publicly traded company was irresistible. ""The opportunity to be able to work for a platform like this was very compelling,"" he said. ""There are few times in one's life when you get called up to the Yankees.""The vast size and resources that stand behind the largest mutual fund firms are enticing to hedge fund managers, many of whom are struggling to attract assets.CONSULTANTS say they are seeing a rising number of traders move back to mutual funds or to other conventional money managers.""It used to be a one-way street, with all the traffic going to the hedge funds,"" said Jeff Garrity, a managing director at Russell Reynolds, the recruiting firm. ""Now, for the first time in years, we are starting to see movement in both directions.""Fidelity has filled three top positions with hedge fund veterans recently, reversing a decade-long trend.Last month, Fidelity hired Seema R. Hingorani as director of stock research for Pyramis, a new division catering to institutional investors. Ms. Hingorani came to Fidelity from Mirador Capital Management, a hedge fund where she was a co-founder. Previously, she worked at Andor Capital, a large technology hedge fund firm.Earlier, the firm hired Brian Conroy to oversee its global stock trading business. Mr. Conroy is the former chief operating officer of an affiliate of SAC Capital, a $7 billion hedge fund manager, and was previously that firm's head trader.And J. Fergus Shiel, 48, a Fidelity veteran who left two years ago to start his own hedge fund, returned in September to take over portfolios with close to $8 billion in assets. A spokesman for Fidelity said that none of the recent hires were available for comment.""For years, there was a brain drain from Fidelity to hedge funds,"" said James H. Lowell III, editor of The Fidelity Investor, an independent newsletter. ""But some of these managers have discovered that being an entrepreneur is not what it's cracked up to be.""Few of the Fidelity veterans who left to start their own hedge funds went on to attract substantial assets, Mr. Lowell said. One notable exception is Jeffrey N. Vinik, the former manager of the Magellan fund, whose hedge fund grew to $4 billion before he returned outside investors' money five years ago to focus on his personal investments.Consultants predict that weak performance will drive other big names from the volatile hedge fund business, where managers make most of their money by taking 20 percent of any profits.After a strong November, driven by a surge in domestic stocks, the average hedge fund was up 7.7 percent for the first 11 months of 2005, according to Hedge Fund Research in Chicago, compared with a 4.9 percent return for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.But hedge fund performance was uneven in 2005, with the average one actually losing money in 4 out of 11 months. In 2004, the average fund lagged behind the S.& P. index. The rocky results follow a period of torrid growth for hedge funds, whose assets more than doubled in the last five years, to more than $1 trillion, according to Hedge Fund Research. In contrast, mutual fund assets rose just 23 percent during the same period, to $8.6 trillion.But the average hedge fund remains small, with less than $200 million in assets, Hedge Fund Research said. That compares with $1 billion for the average mutual fund.To managers of smaller hedge funds, the large, relatively stable assets of mutual funds are appealing, Mr. Garrity said. Mutual fund investors, particularly those in retirement accounts, are also perceived as less fickle.""The money coming into the hedge fund business now is somewhat hot,"" Mr. Posner of Legg Mason said.Some investment managers, meanwhile, are finding ways to run mutual funds with some of the flexibility of hedge funds.The average hedge fund has a broad mandate in terms of its range of investments and its ability to make concentrated bets, to borrow against its portfolio and to short stocks.In contrast, mutual funds tend to focus on a more defined set of opportunities. And there are legal restrictions that prevent mutual funds from putting a high proportion of their money into illiquid investments.But in recent years, laws have changed, giving managers greater flexibility. The trend gained momentum in August 1997, when Congress repealed rules that had restricted short-selling by limiting short-term trading to 30 percent of a mutual fund's profits. (Mutual funds are still required to keep liquid assets on hand that are of equivalent value to the shares sold short.)Mutual funds also can take greater advantage of derivatives, which now trade more often and are less likely to be considered illiquid securities, said Jay G. Baris, a partner at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel who advises investment companies. Rules regarding mutual funds' trading of futures and options have also been loosened, he said.Mutual funds that take advantage of less conventional investments are increasingly attractive to some investors who have been disappointed with the stock market's performance.And by investing in a mutual fund, these investors avoid the hefty fees charged by hedge funds -- typically 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of profits. In contrast, the average mutual fund charges 1.4 percent of assets, according to Morningstar.""Hedge funds are mutual funds without as many limits, but with much higher fees,"" Mr. Baris said.One of the most popular of these hybrid mutual funds is run by William H. Miller III, better known as the manager of the $19 billion Legg Mason Value Trust, which has beaten the S.& P. 500 for the last 15 years.Six years ago, Mr. Miller started Legg Mason Opportunity Trust, a fund in which he can invest in stocks, bonds, derivatives and other financial instruments of companies worldwide, with no restrictions on market capitalization or industry concentration. In contrast, Value Trust tends to invest only in shares of United States companies, and its more measured approach to stock picking means that its performance is less volatile, Mr. Miller said. Legg Mason Opportunity has had an average annual return of 11.9 percent over the last five years, more than 11 points ahead of the S.& P.Ronald Baron, the growth stock picker who once ran the hedge fund Baron Partners, converted that fund to a mutual fund in 2003. Assets have grown to $1.3 billion from $100 million. Last year, the fund was up 14.4 percent, 10 points ahead of the S.& P.""This is me unplugged,"" Mr. Baron said.These mutual funds have attracted investors partly because individuals who are familiar with the track records of the managers are willing to trust them with more aggressive bets.BUT more recently, mutual funds have been set up by hedge fund managers, whose ability to discuss the hedge funds' performance is limited by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These managers are hoping in part to attract individual investors by capitalizing on the allure of the hedge fund business itself.In November, J. P. Morgan unveiled plans to start the Highbridge Statistical Market Neutral fund, a mutual fund to be run by a team from Highbridge Capital, a hedge fund firm with a 13-year track record; Morgan acquired the firm a year ago.Another mutual fund started in December, the QCM Absolute Return fund, will be run by Jerry Paul, a former manager of Invesco's junk-bond mutual funds who left to start his own hedge fund firm four years ago. Mr. Paul's firm, Quixote Capital Management, focuses on investing in takeovers and other one-time corporate events.""I've had so many investment advisers approach me saying I have clients who don't qualify for hedge funds who would love to invest with you,"" Mr. Paul said. His fund has a minimum investment of just $2,500, compared with a minimum of $250,000 for his hedge fund.Some fund managers say they think that there are limits to hedge funds' crossover appeal, and worry that smaller investors may not appreciate the risks.""Investing in hedge funds today is like buying Cisco in 1999,"" said Mario J. Gabelli, whose investment firm runs both hedge funds and mutual funds. ""They are not appropriate for everyone.""'"

But she is quick to qualify, saying, ""But only when it's being employed as a bridge to ideas that are relevant, timeless and important.""Perhaps nothing reflects this trend more than the eclectic dissertation topics of Ph.D.'s -- research interests that eventually filter into the classroom.In her own thesis, Dr. Clark studied religious symbols and adolescents, ""analyzing the interpretive strategies that teens brought to such popular television programs as 'Touched by an Angel.'

"'06-01-08,'0','Given this prosperity, maybe the whingeing books shouldn't be taken seriously, suggested Boyd Tonkin, literary editor of The Independent, except as ""an easy escape valve"" for people with vague political discontents.But Steve Lowe, one of the authors of ""Is It Just Me,"" insists that he and his co-author, Alan McArthur, really are ""angry and young.""""We certainly are angry about the complacency and idiocy and worthlessness and lack of quality of a money-drenched society,"" said Mr. Lowe, who is, at 34, at least youngish.""Is It Just Me"" evinces a left-wing bent, while the other books in the whining section tend to be Tory. But politics are not the only or even the main point: an entry mocking Condoleezza Rice for her past ties to the oil industry is preceded by the screed about toilets.Envy is nearly as prominent as politics. An entry in ""Is It Just Me"" mocks Alain de Botton, a writer of popular philosophical works, for always saying ""the most fatuously expected thing possible.""Arguably, it is Ms. Truss who got the curmudgeonly ball rolling with ""Eats, Shoots and Leaves,"" published in 2003, about the importance of punctuation. Her latest work, ""Tell It to the Hand,"" applies the same self-conscious astringency to social encounters. She rails at those for whom she has held open a door who don't say thank you: ""Finally, you HATE the person who did not say thank you. Indifference is no longer an option. The whole incident has now become intensely personal, although you daren't say anything for fear of reprisal.""She also is annoyed by skateboarders on the sidewalk, and ""young men drunkenly shouting.""Ms. Truss's editor, Andrew Franklin, disdains the term ""grumpy generation,"" preferring ""ostrich books,"" as in, ""instead of worrying if the world is going to end, we worry about litter on the street.""While a bit of a fan of the ""Is It Just Me"" encyclopedia, Mr. Franklin said he didn't learn much. ""I have three teenagers so I know how awful the world is.""To him, the gripe genre reflects the crotchetiness of people growing older, who don't like what's coming up behind them. One reviewer, Charlotte Raven, writing in The New Statesman, seemed to take a similar view. ""If I was young, my husband says, I wouldn't be sitting there moaning."" Or reading books by moaners.Maybe, in the end, life is too good in Britain, at least for the class of person clever and educated enough to make a living writing books.""If you were an Angry Young Man,"" said Mr. Tonkin, ""you wouldn't just be sounding off. You might be a socialist, an activist in the anti-colonist movement, or the anti-nuclear movement later in that decade.""""Those movements provided a pretty active channel for all that rage,"" he added. ""Today there isn't the same sense of a coherent channel. You may be complaining about supermarkets, but does that mean you are in favor of greater state control of the economy?""'"
"'06-01-08,'0','""Governor Rell is mindful of the potential security issues and risks surrounding this proposal, but she is equally concerned that the public has access to as much information as possible before final decisions are made,"" said Judd Everhart, director of communications for the governor.Richard Amper, executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society in Riverhead and coordinator for the Anti-Broadwater Coalition, which has members in Connecticut and on Long Island, said Broadwater had been less than forthcoming about details of the project. ""Part of our complaint all along has been that Broadwater is long on promotion and short on information,"" he said.Suffolk County's lawyers are demanding that the commission halt all proceedings related to Broadwater's proposal because the commission and state agencies ""are unable to disclose certain information necessary to make the statutory determination required to authorize the project"" as safe and in the public interest.Because of the secrecy constraints, the lawyers argued in a letter to the commission dated Dec. 8 that there could never be a full public airing of how the $700 million plant, which would be 1,200 feet long and 180 feet wide, would be designed to withstand hurricanes, surging tides, accidents or attacks.Broadwater contends that the secrecy poses no obstacle to approving the plant. In its reply to the county's claims, the company's lawyers said that while the classified data must be kept from the public, state officials directly involved in project reviews could have full access to it if they sign nondisclosure agreements.Company officials said the approval process was as open as it could be under the circumstances.""There is absolutely nothing secret about this,"" said John Hritcko, senior vice president of Broadwater, in an interview on Tuesday. ""Every major infrastructure project has to abide by this process.""A spokeswoman for the commission, Tamara Young-Allen, said on Tuesday that the commission was still considering the matter and had not yet ruled on the county's request.The document at issue, ""Environmental Resource Report 13, Engineering and Design Material,"" is being withheld from public view by the commission because of a rule it adopted in 2003 limiting public disclosures about liquefied natural gas plants, refineries, pipelines and other energy infrastructure.In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Blumenthal said, ""The broad and sweeping secrecy of this information because it is necessary for security proves the point that security and safety are at risk in this project.""""It is powerful evidence of the susceptibility to terrorist attack and proves that the public interest is greatly endangered,"" he added.Mr. Blumenthal said that was all the more reason why the project was inappropriate for a crowded waterway in a highly populated area.""If they need this much secrecy, security must be really be at risk and they should put the facility somewhere else,"" he said.He also said that his office did not want information about the project if it required signing a nondisclosure agreement. ""We would rather not have the information if it means muzzling and censuring what we can say to the public,"" he said.Broadwater, a partnership of Shell and the TransCanada Corporation, wants to build the plant in New York waters, 9 miles off of Shoreham, N.Y., and 11 miles from Branford, and put it in service by 2010. It would receive imported liquefied gas from three or four tankers a week, warm it back to a gaseous state and feed it, at a rate of about one billion cubic feet a day, into an existing cross-sound gas pipeline owned by the Iroquois Gas Transmission System.A new 22-mile pipeline would connect the plant to the Iroquois line, which runs from Waddington, in upstate New York, through Connecticut, under the Sound between Milford and Northport, N.Y., and ends in Commack, N.Y. An existing extension branches off at Northport and runs under the sound to the Bronx. Gas can be delivered to customers anywhere along the pipelines.Proponents say the plant would deliver badly needed new supplies and help stabilize energy costs in the region. Opponents, including many elected officials in Connecticut and on Long Island, say the project would industrialize the sound and pose major hazards to people and the environment on both shores.""The people of Suffolk County cannot be expected to take on faith Broadwater's assertions that their safety and other concerns have been addressed in classified documents,"" said the county's Dec. 8 letter to the commission, signed by Charlotte Biblow, its lawyer. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ""has determined that the engineering and design information about proposed new L.N.G. terminals, such as Broadwater, would be useful to terrorists or saboteurs because incapacity or destruction of an L.N.G. terminal would 'negatively' impact public health and safety,"" she wrote. ""This fact alone shows that the Broadwater project can not be found safe or in the public interest.""The letter also asserted that Broadwater had offered no analysis of how the plant would survive ""catastrophic winds, waves and high water caused by natural disasters.""Mr. Hritcko said it was ""absolutely not the case"" that the need for secrecy meant that the Broadwater plant would be inherently unsafe. He noted that water treatment plants are covered by a similar rule, ""but that doesn't mean they are any more dangerous.""Broadwater's response, signed by Brett A. Snyder, a Washington lawyer, said that if the commission accepts the county's argument, ""the nation would be denied all new sources of energy.""William J. Lindsay, the presiding officer of the Suffolk County Legislature, said the county remained opposed to the project. The county executive, Steve Levy, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that Suffolk should not be left in the dark.But Broadwater picked up support from the New York City Council, which adopted a resolution on Dec. 21 describing the project in favorable terms, saying the gas it would deliver would be vital to the city, and calling for a review of the proposal.In Connecticut, State Senator Leonard Fasano, a Republican from North Haven and chairman of Governor Rell's task force on the project, said government-ordered secrecy about aspects of it made him suspect it might be a more attractive target for terrorists than the commission and Broadwater are acknowledging. ""They want to keep it out of the public eye because it very well may be a terrorist target,"" he said.Mr. Fasano said Connecticut had a strong case for seeking jurisdiction over the project despite its location just within New York waters.""The jury is still out on whether or not we have a regulatory interest in it,"" he said.""The more I hear about this project, the more I am convinced the door is not closed on that issue,"" he said.""The supply barges may have to go through Connecticut,"" Mr. Fasano said, referring to tankers carrying liquefied natural gas, ""and I'm not convinced that the pipeline isn't going to have impacts in Connecticut.""He said the task force report would comment on these issues, on the environmental and visual impact of the project, and on ""the fact that this would be the first time that a significant portion of Long Island Sound would be allowed to be controlled by a business entity.""Broadwater also has to deal with Iroquois's concerns about the proposed underwater pipeline connection. Among them are questions about whether operating problems at the Broadwater plant would shut down the Iroquois pipeline and interrupt its flow of gas, and questions about how to make imported gas compatible with the North American gas now carried in the pipeline.But both Broadwater and Iroquois officials expect these and other technical questions to be resolved.'"
"'06-01-08,'0','COLOMBO, Sri Lanka, Jan. 7 - A suicide bomber destroyed a Sri Lankan gunboat early Saturday, the authorities said, and European cease-fire monitors warned that such an expansion of violence could lead to a return of full-scale war between the government and Tamil Tiger rebels.The incident, in which 13 of the 15 sailors aboard are believed to have been killed, was the most lethal attack at sea here since a 2002 cease-fire agreement between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who have been fighting for a separate homeland for more than 20 years.""If the L.T.T.E. is behind this, then they are pushing the situation closer to war,"" said Hagrup Haukland of Norway, the chief monitor of the truce brokered by Norway in 2002. ""I am very worried. I have never been so worried about the situation.""A speedboat laden with explosives rammed the Israeli-built gunboat shortly after midnight, the navy said, sinking the vessel, which carried a 15-member crew. Fishermen plucked 2 sailors from the water, but the 13 others were feared dead.The Tamil Tigers denied responsibility for the attack.Sri Lanka's foreign minister, Mangala Samaraweera, in Washington for talks with Secretary of State of State Condoleezza Rice, told reporters that such incidents risked a major expansion of the conflict, Agence France-Presse reported. ""There will come a point when the public could be provoked into action and the government may not be able to control,"" he said.The boat sank amid spiraling violence; nearly 50 police officers and soldiers were killed in December alone, the bloodiest month since the truce began. On Monday, five ethnic Tamil students were killed in Trincomalee in eastern Sri Lanka. The military said they died in a botched grenade explosion, but the rebels accused the military of shooting them.'"
"'06-01-08,'0','Dr. Shlomo Mor-Yosef, the director of Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital, said Saturday that Mr. Sharon's blood pressure, heart rate and other ""vital signs were within normal limits."" Mr. Sharon is breathing with the aid of a mechanical respirator.The hospital has disclosed only limited information about Mr. Sharon's care, making it difficult for independent stroke experts to estimate the severity of brain damage and to follow the case. In addition, conflicting reports form the hospital have added to the confusion.On Saturday, for example, Dr. Mor-Yosef said that a CT scan obtained earlier in the day showed further reduction in the swelling of Mr. Sharon's brain and said that the pressure had returned to normal.But on Friday, he had said Mr. Sharon's brain pressure had returned to normal after a third operation to stop bleeding in the brain.On Saturday, he made no mention of continued bleeding. He also said the left side of Mr. Sharon's brain ""looked better"" than the right. But he did not say whether he meant that the structure of the left brain seemed normal or whether it was only less damaged than the right.Later on Saturday, Dr. Jose Cohen, a member of the team monitoring Mr. Sharon, rated his prospects of survival as ""very high,"" Israel's Channel 2 television reported, according to Reuters. ""I am pretty optimistic about it. We are praying there won't be complications, like catching an infection,"" Dr. Cohen was quoted as saying. But he stressed that Mr. Sharon would not be unscathed, saying, ""To say that after a severe impact like this one there would not be cognitive problems is just not acknowledging reality.""On Sunday, Mr. Sharon's medical team will consider when to try to wake him from the induced coma. Until that effort is made, doctors cannot determine how much damage the stroke has caused in terms of paralysis and intellectual functions.Many Israelis prayed for Mr. Sharon on the Jewish Sabbath while his two sons, Omri and Gilad, kept a vigil by his bedside.Separately, the imprisoned Palestinian politician Marwan Barghouti warned against any move to use Mr. Sharon's illness as a reason to postpone Palestinian legislative elections scheduled for Jan. 25.""The Palestinian Authority should avoid making any connection between the health of Sharon and the election date,"" he said in a statement published in Palestinian newspapers. ""The election is a national Palestinian issue and it must not be linked to any foreign concerns such as what is happening in Israel with Sharon.""Mr. Barghouti, who heads the list of Fatah Party candidates despite serving multiple life sentences in Israel for his role in the killing of five Israeli civilians, also criticized the conduct of members of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, an armed offshoot of Fatah, who carried out violent protests in the Gaza Strip this week.The gunmen were ultimately successful in forcing the Palestinian Authority to release Alaa al-Hams, who had been arrested for kidnapping a British family.On Saturday in Gaza, 10 Palestinians were wounded, including 8 police officers, in gun battles in Deir al Balah, when the police tried to make an arrest. One wounded police officer was said to be in serious condition.In the West Bank, clashes flared briefly between Palestinian gunmen and Israeli soldiers in the northern city of Jenin. Also in Jenin, Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades ordered international observers overseeing this month's Palestinian election to leave the city. ""We are sorry to tell you that you must leave Jenin as soon as possible,"" said a statement to the observers, most of them European.'"

"'06-01-08,'0','These contracted services have allowed international donors and concerned governments to cut through dysfunctional bureaucracies -- or work around them, and to improve health care and efficiency at modest cost.Here in Cambodia, the nonprofit groups -- all of them international -- are instilling discipline and clarity of purpose in a health care system enfeebled by corruption, absenteeism and decades of war and upheaval. They have introduced incentives to draw Cambodia's own doctors and nurses back into the system. Patients, especially the poorest ones, have followed in droves.""All the evidence is that this worked very well in a situation where nothing much else worked very well,"" said Shyam Bajpai, the representative here for the Asian Development Bank, which financed the original contracts.Cambodia's health care system is still recovering from the traumas of the murderous reign of the Khmer Rouge, which in the 1970's singled out the educated for slaughter, decimating the ranks of medical professionals. Decades of war that completely drew to a close only in 1998 destroyed hospitals and deepened poverty.Today international donors provide about two-thirds of the public spending on health and over the years have financed the construction of hundreds of hospitals and clinics. But money and buildings alone were not enough to overcome a bureaucratic culture afflicted by favoritism and lackadaisical accountability.The Health Ministry began testing the use of contractors in 1999. Then, the main hospital in the Pearaing district was a crumbling shell. It had fallen so far into disuse that termite mounds rose on the broken tile floors and farm animals rooted in the yard, chewing on mangy bits of grass.""We saw more cows than patients,"" said Sopha Sum, a nurse then assigned to the hospital.Six years after the main hospital was turned over to Health Net International, based in the Netherlands, Pearaing's hospitals and clinics now see thousands of patients a week. In just the first nine months of 2005, more than half the district's 200,000 people sought care.And the government and donors are spending only $4 a year per person on health care in the district -- what a couple of aspirin tablets would cost in many American hospitals.The five nongovernmental organizations running parts of the health system, Health Net and Save the Children Australia, among them, are paid based on their performance in improving services, like childhood immunizations and the proportion of women getting prenatal care and delivering babies in a health center. With additional support from the British and the World Bank, the government recently expanded the approach to cover one in 10 Cambodians.Districts managed by the nongovernmental organizations have been much more successful in improving health services than districts run by the government, a World Bank study found, though both have made progress. The study randomly assigned districts to be managed by nonprofits, or by the government, then measured results through household surveys conducted in 1997 and 2003.""There were fantastic improvements,"" said Michael Kremer, a Harvard economist.Those changes did not happen overnight. For years, Dr. Fred Griffiths, the 54-year old Pakistani who runs the Pearaing district for Health Net, said he saw most of his operating budget from the Cambodian government skimmed off as it made its way through layers of bureaucracy.Sao Chhorn, who then monitored the contracted districts for the Health Ministry, said officials simply took the money through various corrupt practices. ""At least 40 percent of the budget just disappears,"" said Mr. Chhorn, who now works for a management consulting firm. ""And this is the best situation. In the worst situation, almost all of it disappears.""Dr. Griffiths found himself in the worst of situations. A trim man with a neatly clipped mustache and a no-nonsense style, he did not take it quietly. ""We screamed at workshops and conferences, wherever there was a forum,"" he said.Last year, to his relief, the government began transferring the funds directly from the national treasury to the contractors, bypassing potential layers of graft.But his toughest job was motivating the staff. Dr. Griffiths realized he would never get the system functioning unless he could improve the health workers' earnings.The government paid poverty wages: $20 a month to a doctor, $15 for a nurse. The staff pocketed the paltry government salaries and spent almost all their time operating private practices. Not surprisingly, there were almost no patients at the district hospital in Snay Pol, a bone-rattling three-hour drive from the capital, Phnom Penh.Sokong Lim, 34, then a paramedic, said he saw only two patients come for treatment in the two years before Health Net arrived. But he also admitted that he was usually working at his own clinic near a ferry crossing on the Mekong River.""Nobody was willing to work at that time,"" he said. ""Even the chief of the hospital had his own business. Nobody blamed anybody.""The hospital itself was like a stolen car stripped of its parts. Dr. Griffiths said the equipment had simply disappeared, probably into the staff members' private practices. Thermometers, stethoscopes, speculums, obstetrical instruments -- all were missing.Dr. Griffiths decided to use part of his contracting budget to supplement his staff's pay. Pearaing also introduced small fees, charging 25 cents to see a doctor and 75 cents for a day's stay at the hospital.Health Net used the revenues to bolster the staff's incomes, paying for incentives for punctuality and reaching targets to immunize children, and generally instilling a culture of accountability. Despite grumbling, most of the staff gave up their side jobs to work full-time and provide 24-hour coverage.Nurses now earn $60 to $200 a month depending on their qualifications and performance, while doctors make $200 to $250.Because the district's fees are much lower than those charged by the drug sellers, quacks and government doctors who used to operate private practices, peasants have flocked to the public clinics and hospitals. Health Net covers the hospital costs of the poor, about 40 percent of the patients, out of its contracting budget.One recent afternoon, the beds at the hospital in Snay Pol were filled with peoplesuffering from the kinds of easily treated illnesses that kill millions in developing countries each year.Sory Ros, a 45-year-old mother of eight, had gotten her 10-month-old twins, Boramey and Bon, to the hospital on an arduous, five-hour journey that began on a boat slipping through a rice field at dawn, continued on a bumpy horse cart and finished on a motorbike.The babies, coughing and listless, had two potentially mortal ailments: diarrhea and acute respiratory infections. The mother watched anxiously as intravenous drips replaced their lost fluids, preventing their deaths from dehydration.The hospital under Health Net's management has gradually won people's trust. Not least, the district's newfound credibility, as well as the 24-hour availability of qualified midwives and doctors, has transformed childbirth habits across this rural landscape.As far back as anyone can remember, the women here in the village of Reap have depended only on traditional birth attendants -- village women with no formal medical training -- to bring babies into the world. But now more than half the women in the district give birth in a health center, compared with less than 10 percent in Cambodia.""All our parents delivered at home,"" said Mrs. Sna's husband, Veasna Van. ""Now, nobody does. We believe the health care center can save lives if there is a problem.""Mrs. Sna's birth attendant, Min Heng, 50, agreed. ""I have only my empty hands,"" she explained.Health Net turned women like Mrs. Heng into some of its best recruiters. It pays the clinic an extra $20 for every woman who gives birth there. The clinic, in turn, pays the attendants a bonus of $1.25 for each woman in labor they bring in, more than the 75 cents a family typically pays the attendant for delivering the baby by herself.With Mrs. Heng assisting at the clinic, the midwife began to worry that Mrs. Sna's labor had reached a standstill and decided she should be taken to the hospital in Snay Pol, where surgeons and better equipment were available.Phat Yim, a pony cart driver who has built a good business getting women to the hospital, pulled in at the clinic. He filled his wooden cart with straw and lay a mat on top of it. Mr. Van gently picked up his wife and placed her in the cart. Her face crumpled when yet another contraction seized her belly.As the cart jounced through the emerald green paddy fields along a road cratered by the monsoons, Mrs. Sna moaned, her husband rubbed her lower back and Mrs. Heng rested her hand on Mrs. Sna's hip.A half hour later, they trotted up to the maternity ward at the hospital. Dr. Sorny Kong hustled into the birthing room. She started Mrs. Sna on a sugar drip to give her a bit of a lift, got out the vacuum extractor -- operated with a foot pedal -- and attached the suction cup to the crown of the baby's head. A half hour later, a healthy boy emerged into the world.Moments later, Mrs. Sna lay on a bed in a row of new mothers, her baby swaddled beside her, a luminous smile on her face.Correction: February 9, 2006, Thursday An article on Jan. 8 about the Cambodian government's contracts with nonprofit groups to manage public health districts referred incorrectly to remarks by a former official who said corruption consumed much of the money budgeted for health care. The former official, Sao Chhorn, has notified the writer that he was referring to developments before nonprofit groups took over, not after.'"

Local residents said an American helicopter had fired a missile at the compound, but the American military said it had no knowledge of the incident.Local officials said the attack, an hour or so after midnight, was on the residence of Maulvi Noor Muhammad, a religious leader in Saidgi, near the border with Afghanistan in the North Waziristan tribal area.Residents including a local elder, Momin Khan, said that they had seen two American helicopters hovering over the compound and that one had fired a missile that destroyed the residence. Witnesses said that two women and a child were among the dead and that nine people had been wounded. A doctor at a hospital in Miramshah said that the survivors were treated there for multiple shrapnel wounds.A spokesman for the Pakistani Army, Maj. Gen.

Monsanto produces herbicide and agricultural products including genetically modified seeds for crops. ""The company is transforming itself from a pesticide company to a genetically modified seed producer,"" Mr. Lynch said. He called that ""a huge growth area.""Mr. Lynch would not comment on the overall stock market for the coming year. ""We feel confident making decisions about our companies,"" he said, ""but we have no idea what might happen at the bigger level.""The $68 million Oberweis Micro-Cap fund gained 7.49 percent in the quarter. James W. Oberweis, 31, picks the fund's 90 stocks from among companies with market capitalizations of less than $250 million at the time of purchase. He seeks ""small, very rapidly growing companies that have not yet hit the radar of the mainstream Wall Street community,"" he said. Average annual earnings and revenue growth of the companies exceeds 50 percent a year.The fund made money in Bodisen Biotech, an organic fertilizer manufacturer based in China; its stock rose 7.5 percent. Mr. Oberweis says that the company is still undervalued and that he expects earnings growth exceeding 80 percent in 2006 as Chinese farmers increasingly embrace the use of organic fertilizer.Another winner was the Hurco Companies, an Indianapolis producer of computerized machine tools for the metal-cutting industry.

Because the fund holds only about 20 stocks, it can be more volatile than more diversified portfolios.Its current focus is the ""the benefits of the Internet, and the changes to the world that the Internet brings,"" Mr. Oelschlager said. The fund's holdings include shares of Google and eBay, each of which accounts for 7 percent of the portfolio.Its lesser-known winners include Blue Nile, based in Seattle, an online retailer of diamonds, jewelry and watches. The company's shares rose 27 percent in the fourth quarter, based on ""a gradual realization by the market of the strength of its business model,"" Mr. Oelschlager said. The company signs exclusive distribution agreements with diamond wholesalers, he said, so ""wholesalers get rid of extra product, and consumers get product at lower prices than they would from Tiffany or from a local retailer.""The fund also made money in Avid Technology, based in Tewksbury, Mass.; its shares rose 32 percent. The company -- which develops and markets software and hardware for digital media production, management and distribution -- is at the forefront of what Mr. Oelschlager calls a ""sea change"" among newsrooms and broadcasters moving from analog to digital equipment.Another winner was Rockwell Automation, up 12 percent. Rockwell, based in Milwaukee, is a big maker of factory controls. ""Global competition is fiercer than it's ever been, and companies have no choice but to become more efficient to remain competitive,"" Mr. Oelschlager said. By installing Rockwell's equipment, he said, companies can improve productivity.He calls himself an ""eternal optimist"" about the market over all. ""Market prices haven't kept up with earnings growth,"" he said. While value stocks have outpaced growth stocks recently, ""we think that it's time for that to change again, and growth will outperform value.""'"

"'06-01-08,'0','Still, the domestic funds' gains were small when compared with the 17.8 percent return for the average international stock portfolio.In recent years, domestic equity funds have had a knack for staging big rallies in fourth quarters. But they did not pull a rabbit out of the hat last year, as they advanced a solid -- but unspectacular -- 2.2 percent in the final three months. Instead, it was foreign equity portfolios that sparkled in the fourth quarter, surging 5.2 percent.In particular, stock funds focused on Japan partied like it was 1999 -- or rather like it was 1989, when the Nikkei 225 index peaked before starting a 14-year decline.The Japanese funds soared 18.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 as Japan's economy appeared to be emerging from its deflationary doldrums. For the year, these funds returned a heady 37.9 percent, on average, raising hope that the country's stock market might be back.Still, the Japanese portfolios were not the year's best performers. That distinction went to Latin American stock funds, with a staggering return of 55 percent, on average.Funds that focus on the emerging markets in general also flourished, as many Latin American and Asian markets benefited from soaring prices of commodities. The average diversified emerging-markets equity fund soared 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter and 32.1 percent for the year.""We expected and positioned for the international markets to do well,"" said Jeffrey L. Knight, chief investment officer of the global asset allocation team at Putnam Investments. ""But I was surprised at how well the foreign markets did.""The performance of foreign equities was even more remarkable, considering the unexpected rally in the dollar last year. When the dollar strengthens -- it gained 13 percent against the euro and 15 percent against the yen in 2005 -- it hurts American investors abroad, as each share of foreign stock they own is worth less in United States currency. In other words, foreign stock funds would have done even better had the dollar weakened, as was predicted at the start of last year.""It's clear that there's a performance-chasing element to the fund flows,"" said Russel Kinnel, Morningstar's director of mutual fund research.Still, many market watchers say they think that investors are likely to increase their foreign stock allocations. ""Perhaps with globalization, the investor is becoming more sophisticated and sees a greater need for international holdings in their asset allocation,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.Many analysts are again looking for the foreign markets to outshine United States stocks this year.According to a recent survey of money managers by the Russell Investment Group, 54 percent are bullish on foreign equities, while only 17 percent are bearish.David Darst, chief investment strategist for Morgan Stanley's individual investor group, says he believes that moderate investors may want to put around 40 percent of their equity allocation into foreign holdings.Aaron S. Gurwitz, senior strategist for Lehman Brothers' private investment management group, says some investors may even want to consider holding half their stock portfolios in foreign shares.""Investors have to remember that half of all stocks in the world are non-U.S. shares,"" he said. He cautions investors not to overweight emerging-markets stocks, however, even though they were the market leaders in 2005.John R. Chisholm, co-chief investment officer at Acadian Asset Management in Boston, agreed. He said that because of their recent performance -- the average emerging-markets fund has climbed more than 19 percent, annualized, over the past five years -- these highly volatile shares are not as cheap as they once were. ""We expect returns to be more muted in the coming year,"" he said.Donald L. Cassidy, senior research analyst at Lipper, says the recent popularity of gold funds is yet more evidence that investors ""are betting against the U.S. market as being the place to be."" Last year, the average precious-metals fund delivered a return of 31.8 percent.Actually, domestic equity funds did not fare all that badly, given factors like the yearlong climb in the federal funds rate -- the benchmark short-term interest rate -- to 4.25 percent from 2.25 percent. A nonfactor, it turns out, was Hurricane Katrina, the most costly storm in terms of property damage in the country's history.""If you would have said that we'd have one of the worst natural disasters in the country's history, that oil would have peaked at around $70 a barrel, that the federal funds rate would have climbed to 4.25 percent with indications that we're headed for 4.5 percent, virtually everyone would have predicted a negative year,"" said Jonathan Golub, a domestic equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Funds.Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P., agreed that the market was resilient. He noted that from June 30, 2004, when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, through the end of 2005, the Nasdaq composite jumped 7.7 percent, the S.& P. 500 climbed 12.4 percent and the S.& P. 400 index of midcap stocks soared 23.6 percent.ONE reason for that strength was that that the United States economy held up remarkably well. In the third quarter, for instance, the economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.1 percent despite record energy prices.""There's no reason yet to abort the rosy view that the U.S. economy will continue to grow at around trend or above,"" said Alan Brown, head of investment at Schroders.But Mr. Brown says the domestic economy faces long-term challenges. Among them is a potential slowdown in consumer spending, as households will eventually need to rebuild their savings, he said. And potentially higher interest rates this year may further cool the housing boom.Of course, investors bet that long-term rates would rise considerably in 2005 -- and were wrong. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ended the year at 4.39 percent, down from 4.62 percent at the end of March and up only slightly from 4.22 percent at the beginning of the year. The stability in such rates helped long-term government bond funds return 4.1 percent for the year.""Looking ahead, it seems to be a pretty tricky year to figure out,"" said Mr. Knight at Putnam. Among the uncertainties is the market's reaction to the Federal Reserve transition at the end of this month, when Ben S. Bernanke is expected to replace Alan Greenspan as chairman.Considering all the unknowns, ""the best approach might be to make sure you have all the bases covered,"" he said. ""Be well diversified. And if we happen to get another blowout performance somewhere, great.""'"

"'06-01-08,'0','The pop-rock trio Hanson is finally breaking through to a grown-up audience. All it had to do was split up with a record company and go to college.On the group's recently concluded concert tour, the band of brothers best known for the 90's hit ""MMMBop"" played several universities and screened its raw documentary, ""Strong Enough to Break,"" which depicts its tribulations with its former record label, Island/Def Jam. Think of it as Hanson's version of ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart,"" the documentary that brought the band Wilco's tribulations to a whole new audience. Except the Hanson boys come across as well-adjusted young men, not moody artistes.When filming began, in 2001, the plan was to document the recording of the group's third CD and a tour, said the film's director, Ashley Greyson. ""I thought it would be a few months of shooting,"" Mr. Greyson said by phone from Broken Arrow, Okla., his hometown. Instead the film took four years.Though ""Strong Enough to Break,"" named after a Hanson song, shows the band writing and playing adult music (and collaborating with more established musicians, like Matthew Sweet), Mr. Greyson said, it also shows the musicians coping with suggestions from Jeff Fenster, an A&R representative for Island/Def Jam. In many scenes the brothers, including the youngest, Zac, are huddled around phones as Mr. Fenster hems and haws about the group's songs and says things like, ""You don't have an album.""""He's not a bad guy,"" Mr. Greyson said, ""but he does seem to play the role of the Devil in the film.""Mr. Fenster could not be reached for comment, while Island/Def Jam had no comment.Taylor Hanson, 22, the family's middle son and the group's keyboardist and lead singer, said he was not angry about the company or the system, just bewildered. ""The business used to be about labels grooming artists they believed in, over a long period,"" he said by phone from Tulsa, Okla., his hometown. ""Like they once did with, say, Bob Dylan. Now, you have people at record companies who don't know how to do the jobs they're supposed to do. They really don't know much about music; they're just trying to not get fired.""'"

"'06-01-09,'1','TODAY Diabetes, long viewed as a routine byproduct of old age, is emerging as the biggest health problem menacing New York City.Driven in part by overeating and inactivity, diabetes has already stricken an estimated one of every eight adult New Yorkers, a rate nearly one-third higher than in the nation as a whole. It is finding new victims, and killing many of them, faster than any other major illness - even as scourges like heart disease, or all cancers taken together, have leveled off or fallen. If unchecked, it is expected to ensnare coming generations on an unheard-of scale: One in every three Americans born five years ago. One in two Latinos.Yet a yearlong examination by The New York Times found an alarming lack of urgency about the threat among patients, doctors, insurers and even public health authorities - partly because of the quirks of the disease, which can take years to show symptoms.Those symptoms are dire. Diabetes allows sugar to build up in the blood, detonating a barrage of complications: kidney failure, strokes, decaying limbs. Type 2 diabetes, the most widespread variety and the focus of this series, increasingly afflicts children, who rarely got it a generation ago. It can often be controlled, or possibly prevented, but many of those at risk - and the medical system that could help them - seem stymied by the effort and cost.Diabetes is a global crisis. But for New York, a city of immigrants adopting American lifestyles, the signs of the epidemic are chilling: crowded hospitals, swelling disability rolls and mounting costs that already touch everyone.'"
"'06-01-09,'1','There are plenty of mock commercials for Beautee in period style, meaning radio spots replete with jingles constantly spelling out the brand name (""B-e-a-u-t-double-e"") and continuously repeating the same simple slogan (""Love that soap!"").Evan Evans was based on an actual advertiser, George Washington Hill, who was the president of the American Tobacco Company. His hard-selling tactics are described in a speech by Evans: ""Beautee soap, Beautee soap, Beautee soap. Repeat it until it comes out of their ears. Repeat it until they say it in their sleep. Irritate them, Mr. Norman. Irritate, irritate, irritate them.""CRAZY EDDIE In ""A Letter to Three Wives"" (1949), one wife (Ann Sothern) is a writer of radio soap operas whose bane is the sponsor of her show. Her husband (Kirk Douglas) decries what he considers the coarsening effects of radio and the ads that pay for the programming.There are several fake commercials that wickedly send up the conventions of radio advertising, for products called Baby Breath and Protecto. The best is for a car dealer, Crazy Eddie, based on Earl Muntz, who sold used cars in the 1940's under the name Madman Muntz. The commercial features an inane rhyming jingle and Crazy Eddie's demonic laughter.New Yorkers may recall an actual chain of consumer electronics stores with the Crazy Eddie name, owned by Eddie Antar, which was advertised incessantly during the 70's and 80's. Coincidentally, after Madman Muntz left the car business, he sold TV sets and car stereos.DAZZLEDENT In ""The Seven Year Itch"" (1955), Richard Sherman (Tom Ewell), a book publisher, is tempted, while his wife is away for the summer, by his upstairs neighbor, a model (Marilyn Monroe).When they are not together, Ms. Monroe's character makes television commercials for Dazzledent toothpaste, clearly based on the real-life brand Pepsodent. Her spiel: ""I had onions at lunch. I had garlic dressing for dinner. But he'll never know because I stay kissing sweet, the new Dazzledent way."" In one scene, after Richard kisses her, he proclaims, ""My faith in the integrity of American advertising is somewhat restored.""HAPPY In ""The Thrill of It All"" (1963), a wife and mother (Doris Day) charms the maker of Happy soap and detergent at a dinner party. Her tales of how much she and her family like the products persuade him to hire her as his national spokeswoman. Happy's omnipresent ads and billboards transform her into a celebrity, much to the dismay of her husband (James Garner).KLENZRITE ""It's Always Fair Weather"" (1955) sends up the early days of TV and TV advertising. There are several mock commercials for products like Klenzrite, a washing soap peddled by an animated character called Miss Mop Up.An unctuous announcer (Frank Nelson) urges viewers to buy Klenzrite and its sibling brands, Duzrite, Izrite and Wuzrite, along with H2O Cola, which tastes as good as water because, he confides, ""it is water.""MAXFORD HOUSE In ""Christmas in July"" (1940), a young dreamer (Dick Powell) who works for Baxter & Sons Coffee is tricked by his co-workers into believing he has won the $25,000 grand prize in a slogan-writing contest for a competitor, Maxford House Coffee (modeled after Maxwell House, natch). His ""winning"" slogan: ""If you can't sleep, it isn't the coffee - it's the bunk.""PIKE'S PALE ALE In ""The Lady Eve"" (1941), one reason that a naïve explorer (Henry Fonda) initially catches the eye of a femme fatale (Barbara Stanwyck) is that he is the heir to the Pike's Pale Ale fortune.A giant billboard looming over the brewery calls Pike's ""the ale that won for Yale."" An ad linking athletic prowess and alcohol would be impossible today, but remember, this was an era when baseball players endorsed cigarettes.VIP In ""Lover Come Back"" (1961), the battle between Jerry Webster, a playboy adman (Rock Hudson), and his virginal rival (Doris Day) changes course when he tries to trick her by filming commercials for a product that does not exist, which he calls VIP. When the spots are mistakenly broadcast, Jerry is forced to put VIP into production with the help of an oddball scientist (Jack Kruschen), who invents candy that ""enters the bloodstream as pure alcohol,"" instantly inebriating anyone who eats it.Love eventually conquers all, thanks to the liquor industry's bribing Jerry to suppress the formula for VIP so the world will never know the joys of what the scientist calls ""a good 10-cent drunk.""WALLACE FLOWRIGHT In ""Laura"" (1944), Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a famous columnist, becomes obsessed with a young woman, Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney). When they first meet, she is a tyro at an ad agency who interrupts his lunch at the Algonquin Hotel to ask him to endorse the Wallace Flowright fountain pen.""I don't use a pen,"" Waldo snaps. ""I write with a goose quill dipped in venom."" Later, he apologizes to her and endorses the pen ""for reasons which are too embarrassing to mention"" - that is, the $5,000 fee.WHAM In ""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House"" (1948), the career of Jim Blandings (Cary Grant), an adman who makes a whopping $15,000 a year, hinges on his ability to create a slam-bang campaign for his client's ham product, Wham. The resemblance between Wham and the real-life brand Spam was purely intentional.Time and again, Jim fails to come up with a good slogan. His housekeeper Gussie (Louise Beavers) saves the day when she brings him breakfast and declares, ""If you ain't eatin' Wham, you ain't eatin' ham."" The line saves his job and Jim gets to finish restoring his dream home.'"
"'06-01-09,'1','Peter Martins's full-length ""Swan Lake,"" seen first in Copenhagen in 1996 and in New York in 1999, glided back smoothly onto the New York State Theater stage Friday for the first time in two years.The New York City Ballet must be unique in having two versions of this classic in its active repertory. Aside from the Martins, there is George Balanchine's one-act compaction, dating from 1951 and based on Lev Ivanov's 1895 St. Petersburg choreography for the Romantic acts with Odette, the swan queen, with some additions from Marius Petipa's choreography for the rest.The Martins account was controversial in 1999; most everything Mr. Martins does is controversial in New York. But on Friday it seemed a solid success, not that solid is the ideal attribute for this psychological fairy tale. There is a certain stiff formality to the corps dances; Per Kirkeby's abstract dropcloths and characteristic abstractions of roots and veins and lightning flashes are still not to every taste; and Mr. Martins's tragic ending will not please those (like the Soviets) in search of moral uplift.Nonetheless, Mr. Martins has made a careful, respectful synthesis of past traditions (not only Petipa and Ivanov, but also Aleksandr Gorsky's introduction of a Jester in the court scenes as well as Balanchine's emendations to the St. Petersburg templates). He forgoes fancy interpretations and subtexts, sometimes to the point of banality: Von Rotbart, for instance, is a pure cartoon villain with no tricky Freudian shadings whatsoever. Mr. Martins's choreographic innovations, while strictly classical with a minimum of mime, are often pleasing, and the ending (after the awkward dispatching of Von Rotbart) makes emotional sense.Mr. Kirkeby slights the Romanticism of the forest scenes, but his turbulent nature-abstractions work well: they look good and evoke the Prince's troubled subconscious. His interior scenes are handsome and his costumes spectacular. The contrasts of bright colors, especially in the first act, may be more pleasing than deeply significant, but the idea of the Prince's blue fabric evoking nature and contrasting with the rest, and the gradual bleeding of color as the ballet progresses, and the checkerboard black-and-white swans at the end, are all very telling.'"
"'06-01-09,'1','With the lessons of the Roberts hearings as a guide, then, here is a primer on the questions Judge Alito is likely to face and how he may be expected to answer.Supreme Court confirmation hearings employ a sort of code when it comes to abortion. Since nominees typically refuse to divulge their views about what the Constitution has to say on the subject, on the grounds that the issue may come before them, senators tend to ask instead about privacy and about precedent.Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that found a constitutional right to abortion, was largely based on the right to privacy described in a 1965 case, Griswold v. Connecticut. Senators eager to tease out some information about the fate of Roe ask instead about the validity of Griswold.The Griswold case, which struck down a law making the use of contraceptives illegal, found a constitutional right to privacy in the ""penumbras"" and ""emanations"" of various provisions of the Bill of Rights.Judge Robert H. Bork's harsh criticism of Griswold in his academic writings and his skepticism about the nature and scope of a constitutional right to privacy at his confirmation hearings helped doom his nomination in 1987.A second proxy for abortion is precedent. Senator Arlen Specter, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a supporter of abortion rights, pressed Judge Roberts, for instance, on whether the Supreme Court's reaffirmation of the core abortion right in a 1992 case, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, made Roe a ""super-duper precedent.""Judge Roberts did not adopt Mr. Specter's language and listed several factors on each side of the general question of when precedents should be overruled, many drawn from Casey itself.Judge Alito may find it harder to take refuge in Casey's discussion of precedent, as the case presents something of a minefield for him. He participated in it as an appeals court judge, dissenting in 1991 from a ruling striking down a Pennsylvania law that required married women to notify their husbands before having an abortion. The Supreme Court disagreed with him in a 5-to-4 ruling the next year.Though Judge Alito's decision in Casey was careful, technical and reflected an effort to interpret the Supreme Court's confusing abortion jurisprudence at the time, the fact that he found himself on the losing side of the most important abortion case since Roe will doubtless prompt many questions.So, too, will a statement Mr. Alito made in a 1985 job application for a position in the Justice Department. He said he was proud to have helped advance ""legal positions in which I personally believe very strongly."" One of those positions, he said, was that ""the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion.""While Judge Roberts was one of nine government lawyers who signed a brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe, he said that positions he took as an advocate were not necessarily his own. Judge Alito may find it harder to distance himself, should he wish to, from his Casey dissent and his personal statement in 1985.Mr. Specter, in prepared remarks to be presented Monday, said, ""This hearing comes at a time of great national concern about the balance between civil rights and the president's national security authority,"" a reference to the domestic surveillance program. There is, he said, an apparent conflict between ""the president's constitutional war powers as commander in chief to conduct electronic surveillance"" and ""Congressional legislation in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.""In September, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, asked Judge Roberts about the scope of presidential power in the context of a 2002 Justice Department legal memorandum concerning harsh interrogations that were arguably forbidden by federal law. The Bush administration had by then disavowed aspects of the memorandum, but Mr. Leahy wanted to know about one of its more abstract assertions.""Congress can no more interfere,"" the memorandum said, ""with the president's conduct of interrogations of enemy combatants than it can dictate strategic or tactical decisions on the battlefield."" The Bush administration has made similar arguments in connection with the surveillance program.Judge Roberts said the framework for analyzing the question of whether the president had exceeded his authority was in a concurring opinion by Justice Robert H. Jackson in a 1952 decision rejecting President Harry S. Truman's assertion that he had the inherent constitutional authority to seize private steel mills as a matter of national security during the Korean War.""Where the president is acting contrary to Congressional authority,"" Judge Roberts said, ""what Justice Jackson said is, the president's authority is at its lowest ebb.""It is not clear whether Judge Alito will also endorse Justice Jackson's approach. In a 2001 speech to the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group, Judge Alito spoke in favor of vigorous and expansive executive power. As a government lawyer, too, he frequently argued for a broad interpretation of executive authority.Perhaps no issue engaged the senators questioning Judge Roberts more than a series of recent Supreme Court decisions limiting the ability of Congress to make federal law binding on the states or, sometimes, to legislate on a subject at all.Judge Alito may expect questions about two of his decisions in this area. In one, a 1996 dissent, he voted to strike down a federal law regulating machine guns, saying Congress had not provided adequate evidence that those weapons facilitated crimes with an effect on interstate commerce.In a similar vein, Judge Alito took a constrained view of Congressional power in a 2000 case involving the Family and Medical Leave Act. He said the states were immune from lawsuits under the act. The Supreme Court came to the opposite conclusion in a different case in 2003.In his 1985 job application, Mr. Alito said that his interest in constitutional law was motivated by disagreement with some decisions of the Warren Court, among them those concerning reapportionment. The decisions, from the 1960's, required states to draw voting districts with equal populations. Some legal scholars at the time contended that the decisions did not have a basis in the Constitution.Judge Bork, too, was critical of the decisions at his confirmation hearings. ""There is nothing in our history that suggests 'one man one vote' is the only proper way of apportioning,"" he said.In November, after the disclosure of the 1985 job application, the White House said that Judge Alito now believes that one person one vote is ""bedrock principle.""'"
"'06-01-09,'1','Richard J. Bressler, the former chief financial officer of Viacom, said yesterday that he planned to join Thomas H. Lee Partners, the Boston-based private equity firm. The firm is expected to formally announce the appointment today.Mr. Bressler, a veteran of the media industry who has held several top positions at Viacom and Time Warner, is the latest highly ranked executive from corporate America to join the ranks of the growing and lucrative private equity industry.

"'06-01-09,'1','In part, the Urge is a response to an online survey, said John Cupit, a design manager for Nissan. Mr. Cupit interpreted the survey results in the bare, exposed look of the Urge, an articulation of the car's parts aimed, he said, at giving the feel of a motorcycle.The fenders and structure, mostly aluminum, stand out as separate parts. The engine -- a piece of the car so unimportant in this case that Nissan did not even provide the usual specifications of horsepower and torque -- is visible beneath a transparent hood. Nissan calls the look ""minimalism to the maximum.""The bottoms of the doors are cut away, revealing a surrounding frame of aluminum rendered in ""acid yellow,"" which Anka Mazzei, the color designer, said she chose to express intensity and speed.The front end of the Urge is similar to the GT-R Proto, a concept that Nissan unveiled at the Tokyo auto show last fall. But one should not take the exterior of the Urge too literally. Its weirdness signals that it is unlikely to become a production vehicle. What counts is the concept.Urge is an implicit response to cultural change: young buyers have proved more fascinated by the innovations of their new cellphones, hand-held devices and video games than by the automotive advances that captivated their parents.The showcase game for the Xbox 360 is a special edition of Project Gotham Racing, one of the hit titles for the original Xbox as well. Mr. Cupit said that he and his colleagues at the La Jolla studio spend a lot of time playing on a huge plasma screen.The project was a joint effort with Microsoft, so the Xbox 360 beneath the boattail- shape trunk, one of a half-million consoles shipped since the game system went on sale Nov. 22, is different from the others: no one stood in line to buy it.Video gaming is not the only technology incorporated into the Urge. In addition to the Xbox 360, there is an iPod docking station and a cellphone that doubles as a ""smart key"" to start the engine.In at least one respect, the Urge might be the perfect car: it burns no gasoline while parked for game playing; it generates no emissions; it lines up in no traffic jams. It can virtually roll through the streets of Las Vegas or spin around the Nürburgring.Its version of Gotham Racing can even run uptown on the parts of Broadway that are one-way heading downtown, a special thrill for Manhattan drivers.With a wireless connection, in theory, two Urges could be parked side-by-side for competition like the old racing games at the arcade in Atlantic City. Thanks to the Internet, the same thing could be done even if the Urges were half a world apart.The game encourages stylish driving. Good driving through the curves earns the driver style points, called Kudos, that can be redeemed for a better vehicle. According to the Microsoft programmers, power sliding, pulling off a 360-degree spin, getting air time, drafting and getting up on two wheels ""will earn gamers Kudos points for their style and skill."" Too bad the real automotive world doesn't work this way.Each car in the game is made up of 80,000 polygons and takes eight days of programming by its creators, who are holed up in the London studio of Bizarre Creations. Real-world details include gauges that move and realistic bug-smash streaks on the windshield.Oddly, the Urge itself is not among the cars you can drive on the screen. That will probably be remedied soon. Project Gotham players and programmers regularly produce new cars that can be downloaded.The Urge's notion of car-as-video game is not unprecedented. A similar concept, the Scion Speedster -- a red Scion xA show car built by 5 Axis Productions in Huntington Beach, Calif. -- was displayed at the Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show in Las Vegas last fall. The Speedster also has an open panel in the doors -- and two Xboxes running the Forza racing game onboard.The two cars simply evolved at the same time, Mr. Cupit said. He prefers his version of the idea. ""We tried to take seriously designing the door glass to protect the occupants from wind and rain, and also vehicle ingress-egress,"" he said. ""Our door moves up and down to ease entry into the car, for example.""""We often visit tuner and customizing shows to see what young people are thinking about,"" Mr. Cupit said. ""The Urge helps reinvent the sports car for the next generation of young people.""Observing young people at auto shows, it is impossible not to note that they pay more attention to how their cars look and sound than how fast they go. The investment tends to go into electronics and colorful bolt-on parts, rather than into making the engine run faster and more furious.Maybe more automakers should put Xboxes in their cars.

A canary to sing like a mobster? A llama to do, well, whatever you need a llama to do? Just call Mr. Berloni, agent to the stars of the animal kingdom.""They're all booked,"" he said.Early on the Thursday evening before the show closed, Mr. Berloni, with an assistant in tow, hauled a truckload of his animals into the city. He parked near the back entrance of the Hilton Theater and began unloading Barney, Harriet and six other dogs, all of whom had barking parts in ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.""Until yesterday, that cluster of dogs lived in a spacious loft in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. Each day during their Broadway stretch, Barney and friends commuted to and from their apartment, working on a weekly schedule that called for eight performances in seven nights.Mr. Berloni, who has 25 animals on his farm and represents 700 others, said that after he finds work for his clients, he puts them up in comfortable quarters near their jobs to ensure they are happy, well-fed and energetic before taking to the stage or working in front of a camera.In fact, he has just found an apartment on the Upper West Side for his black cat, Mr. Ed, who will begin rehearsals this month for a future role in ""The Lieutenant of Inishmore"" at the Atlantic Theater Company.""The animals I represent usually need a nice place where they could blow off some steam,"" he said. ""At the dogs' apartment, they spent a lot of time with each other, playing or sleeping, and getting plenty of exercise. If you keep an animal happy, they will perform on optimum once they learn the behaviors required in their performance.""After dropping off his dogs with an assistant, Mr. Berloni took himself for a short walk north along Broadway until he came to the Marquis Theater, where a number of his other clients are working in Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Woman in White.""Backstage, just off a hallway covered with theater reviews, playbills and framed head shots, was a dressing room that seemed more like a pet shop. Beatrice, a white rat, and her two understudies, Norma and Heffalump, zipped around a large cage as showtime neared.Just 9 months old, Beatrice is already a veteran actress, and her understudies, each of whom is several months younger, are there in case something worse than a cold or a broken leg befalls her.""Rats generally live about three years,"" said Rob Cox, the head animal trainer for the show. ""Should anything happen to Beatrice, these two are ready to take her place.""As he spoke, Mr. Cox took Beatrice out of her cage and began warming her up. He spread his arms out wide, and the well-trained rodent ran circles around his neck, and back and forth across his shoulders, just as she must do on stage. As actors and actresses scurried by, Mr. Cox continued rehearsing with Beatrice and the other rats.""Holding them like this helps me get in tune with what they are thinking, and to see how they are feeling,"" he said. ""Lately, Beatrice has been real hyper, which is great for the show.""Norman Large, who was playing the part of Count Fosco on Thursday evening -- the character who is fond of small animals and sings as the rat runs across his body -- said that he could not remember Beatrice's ever failing to deliver on stage.""She's one of the most consistent actors I've ever worked with,"" he said. ""I just put my arms out and pretend I'm doing the work, but I'm just acting, and it's Beatrice who is doing the real work.""Sharing the rat pack's dressing room were 5 white mice and 10 canaries who were also set to go on stage. Mr. Berloni, petting one of his mice as he spoke, said it can take three months to a year to properly train mice and rats, and then he explained why his canaries were giving visitors the silent treatment.""The canaries are pretty much used as part of a backdrop, and are not supposed to make noise,"" he said. ""So we trained them to be quiet.""Mr. Berloni said that throughout the years, most of his clients were rescued from animal shelters, as was Sandy, the dog he discovered and trained in the mid-1970's who went from death row to celebrity row during the Broadway run of ""Annie.""Though Barney has not quite reached Sandy status, he's keeping busy. In a few weeks, he is set to return to the fire hydrants of New York -- this time, he will be living in SoHo -- to take part in rehearsals for ""Awake and Sing,"" a play that will be performed at Lincoln Center's Belasco Theater beginning in March.If Harriet comes to town to catch Barney's performance, she can crash at his place.'"
"'06-01-09,'1','Theodore H. Bullock, who made wide-ranging studies of sensory and nervous systems in fish and invertebrates and then used his research to explore the evolution of the brain in animals, died on Dec. 20 in San Diego. He was 90.From 1966 to 1982, Dr. Bullock taught at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, where he was a professor of neurosciences, and he continued to conduct research there until last month.Dr. Bullock was interested in the way animals function and, in the course of his career, published influential papers that examined their vision, sense of smell, hearing and sensitivity to electrical fields.He studied how rattlesnakes employed infrared receptors to detect heat in their prey and how porpoises used sound underwater to locate their prey and one another. But he was probably most widely known for his work with fish, particularly the electric fishes of South America, and their use of electrical pulses in navigation and communication.In 1965, Dr. Bullock and G. Adrian Horridge published a benchmark two-volume study of worms, mollusks and other animals, ""Structure and Function in the Nervous Systems of Invertebrates."" A colleague at Scripps, R. Glenn Northcutt, a professor of neurosciences, described the study as a ""tour de force and a comparative approach that systematically covered all invertebrates.""'"
"'06-01-09,'1','But veterinarians at Cornell University Hospital for Animals, which has become a Northeast hub for dogs believed to be poisoned by the food, including Minnie, are worried. In the three weeks since the recall, veterinarians at the hospital in Ithaca have increased their estimate of dog fatalities so far to 100 nationwide from a handful.Some pet owners may not have heard of the recall because it was announced just before the holidays. And aflatoxin poisoning does not always take effect quickly and can be mistaken for less serious illnesses, so Cornell has adapted a human protein test to quickly detect the toxin. Veterinarians fear the number of fatalities could grow to several hundred in the coming months.""I've never in my life seen anything like this,"" said Dr. Sharon Center, a professor of veterinary medicine at Cornell.The chain of events that led to the poisoning began with a drought in the South that left cornfields vulnerable to Aspergillus flavus, a colorless, odorless fungus that spawns aflatoxin. The contaminated corn came from one of Diamond's main suppliers in Hilton Head, S.C., Mr. Brinkmann said, adding that Diamond tests for aflatoxin, and an average of one truckload of corn has been rejected nearly every week because it tested positive for the toxin.But the industry's testing methods are not foolproof, experts said. The fungus does not grow throughout the crop, so it may exist in some parts of the truckload and not others.On Oct. 11, a contaminated truckload slipped through, Mr. Brinkmann said. The pet food was processed at a plant in Gaston, S.C., sent to a distributor in Buffalo, and then put on store shelves east of Ohio.Nearly two months later, several young Labradors at Kresland Kennel, near Rochester, began showing signs of liver failure, which include fatigue, vomiting and internal bleeding. Within about a week, three had died. ""I had no idea why,"" said Susan Patrick, a breeder for 35 years.Ms. Patrick's veterinarian, Dr. Stuart Gluckman, suggested post-mortem testing by Cornell's pathologists. In the meantime, an associate at his practice, Dr. Sara Sanders, was investigating the illness of two golden retrievers, one of whom later died. The veterinarians realized that both groups of dogs were being fed Diamond products.They alerted the state veterinary diagnostic center at Cornell, which tested the food and found aflatoxin.Ms. Patrick has lost 7 of her 25 dogs and all of the others are still sick. ""They were dying in my lap,"" she said.Once the problem was realized, Cornell experts prepared for the onslaught of cases. Many cut short holiday plans and are still working long shifts trying to figure out how to stave off death in the dogs.There is no antidote. If a human contracted aflatoxin poisoning, which sometimes occurs in Third World countries, that person would need a liver transplant. Dr. Center is giving the dogs a series of drugs to sustain them until their livers can regain some function.Still, the fatality rate at Cornell is about 70 percent. The dogs that survive could face lifelong liver complications and a greatly increased risk of liver cancer.Dr. Center is fielding calls from concerned veterinarians from the East Coast, and she fears that many other pets have died at their local animal hospital or at home without the disease's being diagnosed. The hardest calls, she said, are from older pet owners. ""They're anguished,"" she said.In some cases, it is the owners, not the medicine, who bring comfort to the dogs.Jane-Marie Law crawled into the large cage that held her standard poodle, Tavi, to comfort her during her more difficult moments. After three weeks and nearly $7,500 in bills, Tavi is recovering. Now Ms. Law is helping the Lugo family. After meeting them on Friday at Cornell, Ms. Law took in Robert and Janice Lugo.Diamond is also trying to cope, Mr. Brinkmann said. After the company confirmed the contamination, it set up a call center and hired 12 veterinarians to answer questions. About 1,000 people a day call in. ""They're getting hammered,"" said Dr. Stan Casteel, a veterinary professor who is working at the call center.Diamond has also created an additional level of testing for aflatoxin and it will reimburse people for their veterinary bills and the cost of their lost animal in confirmed cases, Mr. Brinkmann said. ""If we do the right thing, we can recover,"" he said.On Saturday, Minnie lay in her cage, awake but motionless except for a tail wag when she saw her owners. ""Once in a while, she'll just look at us like the old Minnie,"" Mr. Lugo said. ""We just want her back.""'"

"'06-01-10,'1','In Washington, Congress is considering similar bills to increase monitoring of sex offenders. On Monday, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver cautioned against New York's passing of a state law before federal regulations are settled.Any change in state law would be obsolete after federal changes are made, Mr. Silver said.Enacting changes in the law now would ""create confusion in keeping track of sex offenders,"" Mr. Silver said.The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said Mr. Silver's claim was ""pure nonsense.""""That is trying to cover a position that is not sustainable publicly,"" Mr. Bruno said. ""We cannot allow these dangerous offenders to blend back into society simply because 10 years"" have passed.The law requires those convicted of sex offenses -- including rape, sexual assault and child molestation -- to register their addresses with the state annually once they are released from prison. When the law was approved in 1996, the state required only a 10-year registry.There are about 20,000 registered offenders in New York State tracked on a Web site operated by the Division of Criminal Justice Services.On Monday, the Assembly outlined its plan for civil confinement, calling for separate evaluations by officials from the Office of Mental Health to determine whether a convicted sex offender would be likely to repeat the crime. Under the proposal, sex offenders would be housed separately from patients diagnosed with mental illness. The Senate is expected to introduce its own bill on civil confinement next week.In an interview, Mr. Silver accused Mr. Bruno of using the sex offender issue to distract attention from gun control legislation that the Democrats introduced in the Assembly on Monday. Like legislation the Assembly has passed in previous years, the bill would ban armor-piercing bullets and puts stricter controls on legal gun sales.In a special session last month, the Legislature approved a bill placing stronger penalties on illegal gun sales. At the time, Mr. Silver was under intense pressure to approve a version of the bill backed by Mr. Bruno and Mr. Pataki. On Monday, Mr. Silver appeared determined to keep the gun control issue at the center of debate on issues of crime.""They want to take away attention from the issue of guns,"" Mr. Silver said. ""That's the whole reason they did this today. They can't stand or withstand a public debate on the issue.""As the Senate debated the sex offender legislation, Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, a Democrat from Manhattan, called for an amendment in the bill to back the Assembly's gun control measure.""The Senate dished out all this rhetoric about being tough on guns in the special session and now we are going to call them on their bluff,"" Mr. Schneiderman said. ""We want people to know Senate is the place gun control goes to die.""The amendment was easily defeated in the Senate, with a vote split along party lines.'"
"'06-01-10,'1','Joyce Marcus, a professor at the University of Michigan and an authority on Mesoamerican cultures, said the Maya discovery ""is terrific and does constitute some of the earliest Maya writing.""""Every piece of early writing enriches our knowledge of the ancient Maya,"" Dr. Marcus said.As matters stand, the Zapotec, who lived around Oaxaca, Mexico, appear to have led the way to literacy, at least by 400 B.C., perhaps as early as 600 B.C. Clear evidence for Maya writing has been more recent.A few scholars contend that the Olmec, living along the Gulf of Mexico near Veracruz, developed a script even earlier.Some of the confusion stems from differing definitions of writing, whether a few symbols strung together suffice or fuller texts are required.But it is generally agreed that the primal writing by contemporary groups in Mesoamerica was one of just four scripts -- Sumerian, Egyptian and Chinese are the others -- to be invented independent of outside influences.What may be the earliest Maya words turned up in the same ruins where the same archaeologists reported last month finding a richly colored mural depicting the culture's mythology of creation and kingship. The mural is one of the earliest examples of Maya art, dated about 100 B.C.Boris Beltrán, an archaeologist at the University of San Carlos in Guatemala, was exploring deeper in the ruins of a pyramid, down several layers of debris and time below the mural chamber. There he came on the Maya glyphs painted in black on white plaster.A scribe apparently drew the characters along a subtle pinkish-orange stripe as a guideline.Radiocarbon analysis of charcoal associated with the inscription dated the written words to as early as 300 B.C. The column, Dr. Saturno said, was presumably part of a text associated with a nearby work of art that included a painted image of the maize god.The style of the painting was distinct from later Maya art, and the glyphs were more archaic and abstract than later Maya writing.This has been frustrating for David Stuart, a professor of Mesoamerican art and writing at the University of Texas, a member of the discovery team.Dr. Stuart said the glyphs had distinctive Maya characteristics and were ""the earliest firmly dated Maya writing."" But he and others were able to decipher just one symbol, the one meaning ""ruler"" or ""lord"" or possibly anyone of noble status.""It's the same script,"" Dr. Stuart said. ""But it was written several centuries before the full Maya script that we can read. It makes it tough. I don't think we will be able to read this anytime soon.""The exact meaning of the other nine glyphs will probably remain obscure, he said, until additional and longer texts are found from the same time in Maya history. Then there may be enough specimens, he continued, to compare with later decipherable glyphs and ""make some tentative connections with things we are familiar with.""The discovery at San Bartolo is expected to inspire archaeologists to search for other examples of Mesoamerican writing from this period or earlier. Previous ideas about the relationships of Olmec, Zapotec and Maya writing are giving way to new thinking.""Now it is looking like a lot of Mesoamerican cultures came up with writing at about the same period,"" Dr. Stuart said. ""They all were in contact with each other, building cities, trading, telling their history and ideology through script and art.""Dr. Marcus cited recent excavations that produced monuments with Zapotec writing as early as 600 B.C., and even though the Mesoamerican cultures were in frequent contact with one another, she pointed out the individuality of their writing systems.""What is of great interest,"" she said, ""is that Zapotec writing is distinctive and Maya writing is distinctive, and each has its own genesis.""'"
"'06-01-10,'1','LONDON, Jan. 9 - A private equity group's planned $12 billion takeover of a Danish telecommunications company, TDC, was thrown into doubt on Monday when the company's largest investor, a pension fund, said it opposed the deal because the offer was too low.The deal, which would be Europe's largest private equity takeover, was subject to shareholder approval and was expected to close this week. Now that the pension fund, ATP, also of Denmark, has said that it will not accept the offer, the five private equity investment firms that had obtained board approval for the deal in November face the prospect of returning to negotiations.The outcome is expected to be closely watched by deal makers in Europe and the United States. Private equity companies are under pressure to spend the huge pools of capital they have raised, and have found themselves edged out by corporate buyers in some recent transactions. They have looked for increasingly larger prey, and the acquisition of TDC was considered a bellwether deal because of its size and the number of private investment firms involved.ATP said Monday that it did not consider the cash offer of 382 Danish kroner ($61.88) a share ""sufficiently attractive"" compared with TDC's possible value if it remained a publicly listed company and began making changes like selling off noncore assets. It added that not completing the deal might produce uncertainty over TDC's share price, yet said that it was focused on ""long-term value creation.""The prospective buyers -- the Blackstone Group, Apax Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Permira Advisers and Providence Equity Partners -- have until Thursday to persuade a required 90 percent of TDC shareholders to sign on to the deal. ATP owns 5.5 percent; attaining the takeover threshold without the pension fund's support seems unlikely.Several executives involved in the process said that the private equity groups would sit down with ATP managers to try to change their minds.'"

"'06-01-10,'1','Throughout the industry, the oxygen canisters, the telephones, the ventilation equipment and almost every other piece of safety equipment are nearly identical to those used more than 20 years ago. Some mines still extract coal with explosives, a technique that has changed little in 100 years.Mines are routinely cited for violating federal safety rules. Federal inspections occur at least four times a year.For some mining operations, paying fines is less expensive than adhering to the rules, miners say. And a few mines do not bother to pay at all. Since 2000, 84 mines have not paid any citation levied against them that exceeded $10,000, according to federal records. Indeed, miners say that they are sometimes forced to accept unsafe working conditions in return for employment.The proof is that miners continue to die -- and not just from roof falls, electrocutions and explosions. Black lung disease still stalks the coal fields even though the technology to prevent it has been available for nearly 100 years, and federal rules that would eliminate it have been in place for more than 35 years.Still, the nation's coal mines are far safer today. The toll from black lung has plunged to around 1,000 deaths annually now. Accidental deaths are also down. In 1907, 3,242 miners died in accidents in the United States, the worst year on record. Last year, 22 died.But new technologies that might improve working conditions often enter mining slowly. Consider the oxygen canister carried by most miners. Weighing six pounds, it provides an hour's worth of oxygen through a chemical reaction. The canisters have not changed substantially in more than 20 years.An hour might have been enough to allow the Sago miners to reach fresh air, but the miners did not know that. Had their canisters delivered more air, they might have risked a two-mile crawl instead of retreating and waiting for rescuers who arrived too late.Last year, researchers at Wheeling Jesuit University in Wheeling, W.Va., did a brief technology survey to determine if these devices could be improved to deliver more oxygen in a smaller, lighter container.""What we found is that there are technologies that can be used to improve the system to do all three,"" said Michelle Dougherty, a director at the university's national technology transfer center. ""I can't answer why no one in the private sector has thought of this before.""Bruce Watzman, vice president of safety, health and human resources at the National Mining Association, said it was not the responsibility of coal operators to develop new safety equipment. ""We're not in the self-rescuer manufacturing business,"" Mr. Watzman said.Lewis V. Wade, senior science adviser for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which sponsored the Wheeling Jesuit survey, said mining was ""a small market.""Communications systems in underground mines are also often aging and rudimentary. Most mines have just a few telephones attached to cables -- identical to systems in use for decades. In disasters, a crew may be trapped far from a phone.A few mines have antennas that allow radio communication by any miner from any place in a mine. Every miner at the Willow Creek mine in Price, Utah, escaped a major fire in November 1998 in part because many crew members had hand-held radios and were alerted almost immediately, Mr. Oppegard said.Suzy Bohnert, a spokeswoman for the federal mine safety agency, said the agency had not mandated the new communications systems because they did not work well in all mines.Even when safer techniques become widely available, federal regulators rarely ban older, less-safe production techniques. Like Sago, most mines use machines to claw coal from mountains, a far safer method than the old system that relied on explosives. Using explosives in small, narrow spaces creates obvious safety problems, but the technique is still allowed. In Kentucky alone, one in five mines are still ""shooting"" with explosives, according to state records.Federal inspectors almost never close a mine even when they find repeated instances of life-threatening safety problems.The Sago Mine had 202 safety violations last year, a number that included 16 blatant violations that were considered immediate hazards to miners' safety. Like Sago, six other underground mines in West Virginia have 100 to 150 employees, according to federal records. Not one of the six had a similar blatant violation last year, according to federal mine records. Sago has had 14 major roof falls since June. Its injury rate last year was three times the national average.Yesterday, Gov. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia named J. Davitt McAteer, who oversaw the mine safety agency in the Clinton administration, to oversee the work of state and federal investigators and issue a report on last week's disaster by July 1.""We will pursue every lead,"" Mr. McAteer said. ""We will take every step necessary to find the problems and to fix those problems.""Wilbur L. Ross Jr., whose investment firm took over the Sago Mine in November, vehemently denied in an interview last week that his company had compromised worker safety. Indeed, company officials said safety had improved since Mr. Ross's firm took over.But Sago has had three major cave-ins since the takeover, including one on Nov. 27 that dropped a rock 70 feet long, 20 feet wide and 18 feet high, roughly the size of a blue whale.""I think this mine should have been closed,"" said Jack Spadaro, who retired in 2004 as the director of the National Mine Health and Safety Academy in Beckley, W.Va.Even when inspectors find violations and the mine agency levies fines, the citations are often ignored, although this does not appear to be the case with Sago.Ms. Bohnert, of the federal mine safety agency, did not answer a question via e-mail about why the agency failed to collect fines.In Pike County, Ky., for instance, eight operating mines have paid only a tiny fraction of the fines levied against them for years, according to federal records. Midgard Mining of Pike County has more than $350,000 in fines that have accumulated since 1996. In 1998, the company paid $700 to the agency. Since then, nothing, the records show.Josh Osborne owns Midgard Mining, according to federal mine records. Mr. Osborne's father, Stanley Osborne, of Jonancy, Ky., owns a mine near Jenkins, Ky., called Misty Mountain No. 5, according to federal court records. Neither man could be reached.This Jenkins mine suggests another reason that coal mining continues to be dangerous: workers who complain about unsafe conditions are sometimes fired or penalized. Wade Damron complained to the mine superintendent after the brakes gave out on a coal scoop on Aug. 30, 2004.Mr. Damron and three other miners subsequently lost their jobs.Todd T. Hodgdon, a federal administrative law judge, ruled in October that the miners had been fired unfairly, and awarded each back pay and fined Misty Mountain and Stanley Osborne $10,000.Some miners say that they are expected to put up with such problems to keep their jobs, Mr. Oppegard said.""It's a Hobson's choice,"" he said, ""of their safety or their jobs.""'"

"'06-01-10,'1','Using the movie business for target practice may seem like an old game at this point. What, after all, could Mr. Beane contribute to the sport that hasn't been provided already by movies like ""The Player"" or the television series ""Entourage""? The answer is an expressly theatrical energy that finds the verbal music and rhythm in Hollywood-style hypocrisy. And Mr. Ellis brings the same appreciation to this script's snap and pop that he did to the crackling artifice of the recent revival of ""Twelve Angry Men.""What has garnered the most advance attention for ""Little Dog"" has been the promise that it would be about a closeted gay actor who knows his homosexuality is incompatible with being a matinee idol. Sure enough, the character of Mitchell (Mr. Huff) is suggestively familiar enough that certain contemporary male stars (names withheld in view of possible litigation) should probably stay away from this show if they want to avoid sleepless nights. (Diane muses wonderingly on her client's naïve idea of taking his mother as a date to an awards ceremony ""so that no one will know he's gay."")Certainly the play's basic plot hinges on the professional problems of such secrecy, after Mitchell begins an affair with a young prostitute named Alex (Mr. Galecki) while visiting New York. Diane has secured the film rights to a play in which the lead male character is gay. And as she observes: ""If a perceived straight actor portrays a gay role in a feature film, it's noble, it's a stretch. It's the pretty lady putting on a fake nose and winning an Oscar.""What makes ""Little Dog"" more than an extended satiric sketch, though, is Mr. Beane's use of the big lie to consider more subtle forms of self-deception -- from Mitchell and Alex's insistence to each other that they aren't really gay to the emotion-deflecting armor of downtown hipness assumed by Alex and his girlfriend, Ellen (Zoe Lister-Jones).Like ""Bees,"" ""Little Dog"" unfolds in artful counterpoints of lyrical internal monologues and quick scenes, with two or three vignettes sometimes occurring simultaneously. (Allen Moyer's sleek paneled set allows this to happen with beguiling fluidness.) Much of the dialogue is eminently quotable out of context. (Ellen on wishing she had figured out earlier that club-hopping was boring: ""I might have done a little more drugs and paid a little less attention."")But the one-liners are always particular to their speakers. Don't feel restless if in the early scenes it seems as if the performers (Ms. White aside) aren't landing their jokes; it's because they're grounding their characters instead of going for laughs.And surprisingly intricate characters they turn out to be. Mr. Huff (of ""Take Me Out"") presents a Mitchell who is both charming and blurred around the edges, the way actors without parts to play can be. You can see why Alex would both fall hard for and be exasperated by him. Mr. Galecki, best known as Darlene's spineless boyfriend on ""Roseanne,"" finds the unexpected will and resilience in a man who at first registers as a passive drifter. Ms. Lister-Jones, who has less to work with, still shapes a complete portrait of a conflicted and corruptible young woman.All these folks -- along with other, unseen characters, like the self-righteous gay playwright and battalions of lawyers and producers -- are to some degree the pawns of Diane, who is to movies what Faye Dunaway was to television in ""Network,"" a business's calculating heart made flesh. Fortunately, Ms. White's Diane isn't the melodramatic masochist that Ms. Dunaway's Diana was.She may have no life outside her job. She may be damned by actually having perspective on the shallowness of her world. (Listen to the way she makes fun of the way movie people, including herself, turn ordering salads into power plays.) But Diane loves what she does. And Mr. Beane, who has clearly done time among Hollywood power mongers, hears the perverse poetry in her hyped-up industry-speak, in its odd blend of a fan's genuine enthusiasm and a cynic's distancing exaggeration.Ms. White talks this talk so fluently and expertly, with knife-edged body language to match, that even when she's hammering out the clauses in a contract (taken to the last delicious degree of absurdity by Mr. Beane), she's Scheherazade. Just be thankful she's not asking you to sell your soul, because, really, you wouldn't stand a chance.By Douglas Carter Beane; directed by Scott Ellis; sets by Allen Moyer; costumes by Jeff Mahshie; lighting by Don Holder; music and sound design by Lewis Flinn; production stage manager, Linda Marvel; stage manager, Heather Prince; Christopher Burney, associate artistic director; C.

"'06-01-10,'1','""My heart broke, my heart broke,"" said Ms. Gallardo, who crumbled as she recounted her decision to leave her girls with her sister and make the uncertain journey across the border. ""But I had to give them a better life. I told them I would go and work, and we could buy a small plot of land and build a little house and have a dog.""Undaunted by a backlash against illegal immigrants here, Ms. Gallardo is part of what some experts say is a largely unnoticed phenomenon: the increasing number of women, many without male companions, enduring danger and the risk of capture to come to the United States to work and to settle.As many as 11 million illegal immigrants are thought to be living and working in the United States, though estimates vary.No one knows how many people illegally cross the Mexico-United States border, trekking through the desert, hiding in cars and trucks, or walking through points of entry with false papers. But academics, immigration advocates and Border Patrol agents all agree that the number of women making the trip is on the rise.Katharine Donato, an associate professor of sociology at Rice University in Houston who studies Mexican migration to the United States, estimates that as many as 35 percent to 45 percent of those crossing the border illegally today are women. Twenty years ago, fewer than 20 percent of the people crossing illegally were women, she said.The increase, which has occurred gradually, comes at a time when anger over illegal immigration is on the upswing, especially in states near the border. Some of that anger is directed at women who have babies in American hospitals and send their children to public schools.The House recently passed a hard-hitting bill that seeks to beef up border enforcement and make it a federal crime to live in the United States illegally.But to most of the women who cross the border, the debate over illegal immigration and the ire of taxpayers has little bearing, if any, on the difficult decision they make to undertake the journey. "" 'Vale la pena,' "" said Kat Rodriguez, an organizer for the Human Rights Coalition in Tucson, echoing a refrain among the women. "" 'It's worth it.' ""Some women cross simply to keep their families together and join their husbands after long separations, a situation that has grown more pronounced since the Border Patrol agency began stepping up enforcement 10 years ago. With the border more secure in California and Texas, many people are now being funneled into the rugged territory of Arizona -- an effort that virtually requires the help of an expensive coyote to cross successfully.Yet a growing number of single women, like Ms. Gallardo, are coming not to join husbands, but to find jobs, send money home and escape a bleak future in Mexico. They come to find work in the booming underground economy, through a vast network of friends and relatives already employed here as maids, cooks, kitchen helpers, factory workers and baby sitters. In these jobs, they can earn double or triple their Mexican salaries.""It remains a story about family reunification, but the proportion of women coming to the U.S. who are not married and working full time has gone up substantially,"" Professor Donato said. ""So we see the single migrant woman motivated by economic reasons coming to the United States that we saw very little of 30 years ago.""Still, the promise of a sweeter future often goes unfulfilled.Ms. Gallardo never made it to Kansas. She never made it beyond the desert. After walking eight hours at night and committing $500 to a coyote, she stumbled down a rocky hill near Tucson and broke her ankle. The coyote left her sitting on a nearby highway in the desert, where the Border Patrol eventually found her, took her to a local emergency room and deported her to Nogales, Mexico, the next day.A Mexican immigrant group, Grupo Beta, took her to a Mexican hospital where she was told she needed surgery on her ankle at a cost of 3,000 pesos, or seven weeks' salary. She also owes the friends who gave the coyote $500.A month and a half earlier, Margarita Ximil Lopez, 20, had her hopes dashed, too. She sat in a dismal holding cell at the United States Border Patrol station in Nogales in October and tried to hide her tears from her son, Edel, who is about to turn 6.It was for his sake, she said, that she illegally crossed the border, only to be abandoned by the coyote and picked up at a motel by American immigration officers. Ms. Ximil, from Puebla, a large city southeast of Mexico City, had hoped to join her sister, who had lined up a job for her as a waitress in Los Angeles.Here in Arizona, a tide of anti-immigrant sentiment has swelled along with the number of border crossers, some of it directed particularly at women. Many taxpayers say they resent that their tax dollars are being spent to educate these women's children and pay for their delivery costs at local hospitals.Reacting to the surge in illegal border crossings, voters in Arizona passed Proposition 200 in November 2004, which, among other things, requires people applying for some public benefits to show proof of citizenship.The economic reality of illegal immigration is complex. Whether these workers cost taxpayers more than they contribute has been debated for years, factoring in the taxes collected, the unclaimed Social Security funds and the undesirable jobs filled at low wages.Pregnant women who are already in the United States illegally invariably use hospitals to give birth, though statistics are unreliable because emergency room patients are not asked their legal status. Children born in America are automatically granted citizenship, and some critics accuse the mothers of exploiting that guarantee.But advocates for illegal immigrants maintain that the women's reasons for coming here reach far beyond citizenship for their children; few women come to the United States expressly to have babies, collect benefits and visit the emergency room, the advocates say. Jim Hawkins, a Tucson sector Border Patrol agent, said such instances were rare but not unheard of.""I had a woman sit on the south side of the fence until she went into labor, then jumped the fence,"" Mr. Hawkins said. ""She was coached well: she immediately asked for an ambulance.""After she gave birth, the woman was ordered to return to Mexico. Rather than have her baby put up for adoption, Mr. Hawkins said, she took the baby back to Mexico with her.The nation's roiling immigration debate weighs little on the minds of the women who cross here. Nor do the dangers of the crossing itself, which they know routinely include sexual harassment or assault. As the borders have become tighter, the coyotes have become more violent and desperate, law enforcement officials and immigration advocates say.""These poor aliens are nothing but product to these animals,"" said Mr. Hawkins, adding that many women are raped, robbed and abandoned at the first sign of trouble and are given amphetamines to keep them moving faster at night.Since most women do not come forward to report the crimes -- because they do not speak the language and are illegal, ashamed and scared of deportation -- few hard numbers exist. But there is ample anecdotal information to bolster the claim.Maria Jimenez, 29, who is from Oaxaca and came here to work and join her husband, has experienced most of what can go wrong. The first time she crossed into Arizona three years ago, she was told by a coyote to expect a three-hour evening walk across the desert. She packed no water. The journey took two nights and three days, and Ms. Jimenez grew desperately dizzy and disoriented.Then the coyote, an American, tried to sexually assault her and her sister-in-law, she said. ""I told him no,"" Ms. Jimenez said. ""I started to cry."" He left her alone, but robbed her of the $300 in her pocket. Then just as they neared a highway, the Border Patrol arrested the group.She tried again a month later carrying drinks with electrolytes but no money in her pocket. She made it, joining her husband in Tucson, where she got a job at a restaurant and had a baby, Stephanie. A family emergency in Oaxaca forced her to return home last year. But in November, she came back into the country, this time with a group of eight people -- four of them women she met in Nogales.During the trip, Ms. Jimenez slipped and fell, spraining her ankle. She wrapped it in discarded clothes strewn across the desert by other immigrants, and she hobbled on.After a night of walking, they reached the railroad tracks and hopped a freight train to Tucson. Her husband paid the coyote $1,000.Ms. Jimenez, her husband and baby now share a house with another family. She found work quickly in a restaurant kitchen for $5.25 an hour, no breaks, no sick days.""We are all scared when we cross,"" she said. ""But the thought that we can help people back home makes it worth it.""'"

"'06-01-10,'1','For months, we have been arguing that the Bush administration has generally the right substantive agenda for badly needed changes at the United Nations, but that Ambassador John Bolton's scorched-earth alternative to diplomacy is undermining the prospects for successfully achieving these reforms. Now it turns out that our criticism has been only half-right in at least one crucial area -- in restoring the United Nations' moral authority on human rights by excluding egregious violators from a new human rights monitoring council. Mr. Bolton's latest proposal on this gets the substance wrong as well.The problem with the current discredited Human Rights Commission is that its members are chosen by a system of regional rotation that fails to take into account the actual human rights performance of prospective members. The reform was originally intended to change that, by requiring the approval of at least two-thirds of the 191 member countries to win a seat on the new council.Mr. Bolton wants to defeat the whole purpose of that reform by automatically assuring seats for all five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- regardless of their own human rights records.That would, of course, guarantee a seat every year for the United States, despite what other countries may think of Guantánamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, the death penalty, or Washington's practice of secretly flying suspects to be interrogated in countries that countenance torture. It would also guarantee a seat every year to China, one of the world's most notorious human rights violators, and to Russia, whose own human rights record is less than stellar and which has never hesitated to gloss over the human rights abuses of dictatorships it considers friendly, like Cuba, for example.There are plenty of areas where special weight is, and should be, given to the Security Council's big five powers, which also happen to be world's five legally recognized nuclear weapons states. Most of these areas, appropriately, are in the Security Council's special domain of war, peace and sanctions.But the issue of human rights is very different. It is not about recognizing the interests of the powerful. It is about protecting the interests of the powerless. It would be nice if all of the big five could be trusted to do this. But not all of them can, either at home or internationally. Some of the people most in need of a strong U.N. voice on human rights live under tyrannies that have carefully cultivated Chinese or Russian favor: Cuba, Iran, Myanmar, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe, to name a few.'"

"'06-01-11,'1','Guidant's board was wrestling last night with whether to select Boston Scientific's $25 billion bid amid an 11th-hour effort by a rival, Johnson & Johnson, to negotiate a new deal, people involved in the talks said yesterday.Guidant's board met yesterday and planned to declare Boston Scientific's offer superior to Johnson & Johnson's $21.4 billion bid, these people said. That would have set in motion a five-day deadline for Johnson & Johnson to make a new offer. Hoping to pre-empt such a showdown, Johnson & Johnson made a last-minute approach, these people said. But it was unclear last night if Johnson & Johnson had actually made a higher formal bid.Guidant is expected to announce its decision today, these people said.Johnson & Johnson's management and advisers had spent yesterday plotting strategy, weighing whether to raise its offer. Despite Johnson & Johnson's public comments about what it perceived to be the diminished value of Guidant, the company is still interested in acquiring it.Perhaps offering a hint about how far it will go to reach a deal with Guidant, Johnson & Johnson recently hired an advisory firm that specializes in proxy contests. If Johnson & Johnson's maneuvering proves successful, the company would be stealing a page from Chevron, which made a late pre-emptive offer this summer to end a battle with Cnooc for control of Unocal.A spokesman for Johnson & Johnson declined comment, and a spokesman for Guidant could not be reached.Guidant is scheduled to hold a shareholder vote on its deal with Johnson & Johnson on Jan. 31 unless it puts its support behind Boston Scientific first. It is unclear whether Johnson & Johnson needs to match Boston Scientific's offer or if it just needs to come close because it can also offer the certainty that the transaction would close quickly.Johnson & Johnson had initially reached a deal to buy Guidant in December 2004 but renegotiated its $76-a-share offer down to $63.08 after declaring that recalls and investigations involving its heart devices had damaged Guidant's prospects. Boston Scientific's offer is worth $72 a share.'"
"'06-01-11,'1','But he did not commit himself to upholding or overturning the right to an abortion, and he did not address whether he might support further incremental restrictions on abortions.Under nine and a half hours of on-and-off questioning on the second day of his hearing before the committee, which will pass initial judgment on his fitness for the seat being vacated by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Judge Alito also tried to avoid locking himself into any specific position on executive authority.He said no president could operate outside the law and the Constitution, but he repeatedly dodged efforts to solicit his views on whether President Bush had exceeded his authority in the recently disclosed eavesdropping program and in the way terrorism suspects and enemy combatants have been held.The judge, who was frequently defended by the panel's Republicans, addressed other issues that Democrats tried to use against him. They included his membership in a Princeton alumni group known for its opposition to co-education and affirmative action admission policies, his failure as a federal appeals court judge to recuse himself in a case that touched on the interests of a mutual fund firm with which he invested his money and what Democrats characterized as a pattern of favoring the interests of the government and powerful institutions over those of individuals.Speaking calmly, if with a continued hint of nervousness, Judge Alito provided no substantive new insights into his judicial philosophy or background as he tried to cast himself as open-minded and dedicated to the proposition that the rule of law should trump personal views and public opinion.Democratic senators tried throughout the day to argue that the burden was on Judge Alito to earn confirmation.""It should not be a situation that unless he says something wrong he is confirmed,"" Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, told reporters. But that, in fact, seemed to be the working assumption of both liberal and conservative groups.By the end of the day, Judge Alito seemed to remain in a good position to win confirmation from the Republican-run Senate, despite concern among many Democrats that he has a too deeply ingrained conservative ideology, especially for the seat being vacated by Justice O'Connor. She has occupied a crucial middle ground on abortion, affirmative action, religion and other social issues, and many liberal groups fear that Judge Alito, if confirmed, would move the court distinctly rightward.Democrats raised the specter of ideological extremism directly and obliquely. Under questioning from Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, Judge Alito explained as largely a matter of partisan loyalty his previously expressed admiration for Judge Robert H. Bork, whose Supreme Court nomination failed in 1987 because of concerns that his brand of conservatism was far out of the mainstream. He said he disagreed with Judge Bork on many issues.Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, also gave Judge Alito a chance to draw a clear line between himself and Judge Bork. Mr. Kyl repeated to Judge Alito a question that got Judge Bork in trouble during his hearing, asking why he wanted to serve on the court. Judge Bork, responding to Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, answered that it would be ""an intellectual feast,"" a response that struck his critics and even some of his supporters as bloodless and detached.Judge Alito answered the question by saying that it would be ""a way in which I can make a contribution to the country and to society.""Much as Judge John G. Roberts Jr. did during his confirmation hearings last year to become chief justice, Judge Alito steered a noncommittal course on abortion. He agreed that the Constitution protected the right to privacy, and endorsed the idea that even the Supreme Court should think long and hard before overturning well-established precedents.When asked directly whether he still agreed with the position he took as a Reagan administration lawyer in 1985, that the Constitution does not provide a basis for a woman's right to abortion, he acknowledged that that was his view at the time. But he dodged the question of how he felt now, saying that he now approached the issue as a judge and that if the issue came before him on the Supreme Court, he would look first at the weight given to precedent.Judge Alito's comments about Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that first found a constitutional right to abortion, were largely drawn out in two colloquies: a brisk but respectful exploration of the issue by Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the committee chairman, in the morning and a more aggressive and adversarial approach from Senator Schumer nearly nine hours later.Mr. Specter asked if Judge Alito agreed that Roe and a later case, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, could be regarded as ""super-precedents"" as some legal analysts and judges have claimed. Under that theory, judges should be exceedingly reluctant to reverse such rulings because many people have come to rely on the constitutional right to abortion.Judge Alito, evidently prepared for the question, tried to dismiss the notion of ""categorizing precedents as super-precedents or super-duper precedents."" He said that cases like Roe, which have been reaffirmed many times, had a greater claim to survive further review.But Mr. Schumer, at the end of the day's session, said that Judge Alito's pledges of fealty to the concept of precedent were of little value.He told Judge Alito that Judge Clarence Thomas made similar comments at his confirmation hearing in 1991 but had since voted to reverse a wide range of precedents. Mr. Schumer said that Judge Alito's colleagues on the federal appeals court, many of whom support him, had written opinions criticizing him as ignoring precedent in his own court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.Judge Alito responded that his record as a judge on the appeals court showed that he decided each case on the merits and not with the intention of reflexively restricting abortion rights. Although Judge Alito took what abortion rights activists considered an antiabortion position on the most prominent case that has come before him on abortion rights, Casey in 1992, he came down in other cases, largely on technical grounds, in favor of upholding laws on reproductive rights.""When someone becomes a judge, you really have to put aside the things that you did as a lawyer at prior points in your legal career and think about legal issues the way a judge thinks about legal issues,"" he said.With the dance over abortion having become well choreographed over the years, the questioning about the extent of executive authority offered the opportunity for fresh insights into Judge Alito's thinking, and Democrats pressed him hard on the topic.""I believe there is a larger pattern in your writings and speeches and cases that show an excess of almost single-minded deference to the executive power without showing a balanced consideration of the individual rights of people,"" said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.Judge Alito sought to set out a position that recognized limits on presidential power without specifying what those limits might be. He said he agreed with a framework for assessing such limits set out in 1952 by Justice Robert H. Jackson in a concurring opinion that rejected President Harry S. Truman's attempt to seize the nation's steel mills.He also endorsed Justice O'Connor's statement in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld in 2004 that ""a state of war is not a blank check for the president when it comes to the rights of the nation's citizens.""But he was vague when asked about how he would view the dispute over whether Mr. Bush had exceeded his authority or acted illegally in establishing an eavesdropping program that listened in, without a warrant, on calls between American citizens in the United States and people abroad who were suspected of having ties to terrorists.Those issues, he said, ""are obviously very difficult and important and complicated questions that are quite likely to arise in litigation perhaps before my own court or before the Supreme Court.""Democrats sought to make an ethical issue out of Judge Alito's failure to live up to a statement he made during his confirmation to the appeals court, that he would recuse himself from any case involving a number of institutions with which he had financial dealings.They bored in on his failure to recuse himself in a case involving Vanguard, the mutual fund firm that handles his investments. Judge Alito initially heard the case, but after the plaintiff raised questions about his potential conflict of interest, he stepped aside and the case was reheard by the appeals court.Judge Alito told the committee that he mistakenly heard the case because it slipped through the court's process of screening for conflicts. He said that although he violated no ethical rules, he wished he had not heard the case in the first place.Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, asked Judge Alito why he had made a point of including his membership in a group called Concerned Alumni of Princeton in his 1985 job application to the Reagan administration. The group had complained about the admission of women and what it had asserted were less well-qualified minority candidates. ""Why in heaven's name were you proud of being part of CAP?"" Mr. Leahy asked.""Senator, I have racked my memory about this issue, and I really have no specific recollection of that organization,"" Judge Alito replied. He said that he was unaware of the criticism of the group in 1985 when he included it on his application.'"

"'06-01-11,'1','The recommendations are among dozens in a sweeping seven-part report to be announced beginning on Wednesday by the Bring Back New Orleans Commission. Mayor C. Ray Nagin established the panel in September to plan the rebuilding.Because the state and federal governments will have large voices in the process, many proposals may run into opposition, but the plan represents the city's first comprehensive effort to put itself back together.The most controversial proposal, reported on Sunday by The New York Times, would have allowed residents to return soon to all sections of the city but within a year would close those neighborhoods that did not achieve a critical mass of residents. A leader of the commission, Joseph C. Canizaro, said Tuesday that members had modified that proposal over the last two days and now believed that no one should be allowed back into the most damaged neighborhoods until June.City services will probably be more readily available then, Mr. Canizaro said, and the extra time will allow the city to identify who wants to return and set up planning teams for each neighborhood.""My concern,"" he said, ""is for people who have the money and we let fix up a place and then they find themselves sitting all by themselves without any neighbors around.""By Aug. 20, under the plan, the city should begin the neighborhood reconstruction and should begin acquiring property for public projects like expanding parks. Some low-lying neighborhoods may become parks or marshland if they do not attract enough housing development.One measure of whether a neighborhood will succeed will be whether it has enough residents to justify a high school and two primary schools.An essential element, Mr. Canizaro said, is forming the Crescent City Recovery Corporation, through which federal funds would flow. The corporation would have the power to buy and sell property for redevelopment, including the use of eminent domain, and could issue bonds.Board members of the recovery corporation, to number seven to 15 under the plan, would be appointed by the president, the governor, the mayor and the City Council.""If we don't get a reconstruction authority in place right away, we won't have a chance with implementation,"" Mr. Canizaro said.To create such an agency, however, the city needs to amend its charter, he and others said.As of midday on Tuesday, members of the commission and city workers were frantically cobbling together the components of a plan remarkable for breadth and scope. The commission was created to draw up a master plan to remake a city that suffered what was widely described as the worst urban disaster in the country's history.The floodwater that covered 80 percent of the city caused half its houses to sit in four feet or more of foul, murky water for weeks, according to a draft of the final report, and it destroyed much of the public works in the city.The commission has missed the Dec. 31 deadline that Mr. Nagin imposed. Members said releasing an overview of its plans this week should give the White House time to digest a blueprint certain to cost billions in federal dollars before President Bush delivers his State of the Union address on Jan. 20.That assumes that Mr. Nagin formally adopts the commission's recommendations.Some proposals like the light-rail system have been floated for years and are likely to be greeted with skepticism in Washington.""We might be a little bit late, but we've tried to make this an inclusive process, and we've all been doing the best we can,"" the co-chairwoman of the commission, Barbara Major, said. ""I'm always conscious of the fact that everybody that sits on that commission is also struggling to put their life back together.""Ms. Major has been living in temporary housing in Texas since the storm, a five-hour drive from New Orleans.The commission early on created seven committees led by commission members with scores of volunteers as staff members. The seven areas are urban planning, education, culture, health and social services, infrastructure, government effectiveness and economic development.Each will present the details of its plan over the next 10 days.""There was a time I didn't know if this process would work, but it has,"" W. Anthony Patton, a member of the commission, said. ""I'm feeling very good about things.""To improve a school system that has long ranked as one of the worst in the nation, the commission has endorsed a plan that breaks the district into clusters of 8 to 14 schools that will function as semiautonomous units, said Scott S. Cowen, chairman of the commission's education committee and president of Tulane University.Before the hurricane, the district operated about 120 schools.The networks of schools would have the freedom to determine everything from the length of school days to critical curriculum choices and teachers.Now that public and private schools are beginning to reopen, a lack of livable housing is the main impediment to people returning. The commission will call on the city to return quickly to the market the thousands of blighted houses in a legal limbo because of tax and ownership problems.The federal government will be asked to pay the $12 billion cost of compensating homeowners who lost their houses.By rehabilitating abandoned houses in sections with little or no flooding or demolishing them and building anew, the commission estimates that the city could house an additional 37,000 people.The plan calls on the authorities to close the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet, a shortcut from the river to the coast that slices through a corner of the city. Known as Mr. Go, the byway cost $92 million to construct and was heralded as a critical economic driver when it opened to great fanfare in the 1960's.It was also a major source of the water that flooded the eastern, predominantly black half of New Orleans when the storm surge roared up from the Gulf Coast.Officials at the Port of New Orleans have defended the byway as a critical segment of the regional shipping industry. But local officials have reached a consensus that it should be closed. For years, it has been little used, and it serves as a conduit for destructive saltwater into freshwater wetlands.""There are no easy decisions here,"" Ms. Major said. ""So whatever decisions are made, I can guarantee there will be some people who are unhappy.""'"

""We require a lot of field work and comparison to see if there is any new area that we did not consider before.""TOKYO, Jan. 10 (Agence France Presse) -- Japan said Tuesday that 77 poultry workers had tested positive for bird flu in the first confirmed infections of humans involving the weaker strain of the virus that has hit its chicken industry.The farm workers in Ibaraki and Saitama prefectures, both north of Tokyo, were infected at some point in the past but showed no symptoms, the Health and Welfare Ministry said.The ministry said the workers posed no risk to others and had the A(H5N2) virus, a milder strain than A(H5N1) which has killed more than 70 people.""The result of the tests showed that a total of 77 people were carrying antibodies supposed to be created following an infection of H5N2,"" a ministry official said.""It was the first ever case in the world showing a human infection of H5N2,"" the official said, adding however that developing countries hit hardest by bird flu rarely bother to confirm cases of the weaker strain.""None of them have the virus now, which means there is no fear of secondary infection,"" he said, adding that it was unknown when they were infected.While the workers represent the first human infections of A(H5N2), five people were infected with A(H5N1) in western Japan in 2004. None had more than a sore throat.The five included four workers and one inspector exposed to a farm near the western city of Kyoto, which took few precautions during an outbreak of the virus among chickens.The chairman of the poultry farm and his wife hanged themselves after they came under intense criticism for covering up the outbreak at their farm.'"

"'06-01-11,'1','Elliott Erwitt has probably taken more laugh-out-loud pictures than any other photographer in the history of the medium. At 77, this veteran photojournalist and obsessive traveler has made a long career of capturing life's comedic parade and fleeting sight gags. He has been justly compared with comic geniuses like Harpo Marx and Charlie Chaplin and seems never to have met a child or dog that he didn't want to photograph. Evidence of the latter affinity include books of photographs titled ""Son of Bitch,"" ""To the Dogs"" and ""Woof.""But an exhibition at the Edwynn Houk Gallery demonstrates that Mr. Erwitt is much more than photography's leading funny man. Its very title -- ""Elliott Erwitt: Pioneer of the Social Landscape"" -- fires a warning shot across the bow of received opinion.Yes, several of Mr. Erwitt's most famously amusing images are included among the show's 61 vintage photographs. They confirm once more how much funnier existence became after the invention of cameras, and how for Mr. Erwitt, funny is not just a matter of gesture and expression: it is also about form, space and scale, as well as human pathos, regardless of species. One Erwitt classic is an image of a small, anxious dog dwarfed by the boots of his owner and the colossal front feet and legs of a Great Dane. Another shows a woman seated behind a shelf on which rest two turnips exactly where her breasts should be -- a kind of readymade exquisite corpse.As sharp as a New Yorker cartoon and as lushly empty as a de Chirico is his picture riffing on a fig-leaf theme played out before a fortresslike doorway in Florence: two marble nude statues have the real thing and, between them, there's a policeman whose white-gloved hands just happen to be clasped in front of him. Still, a Rockwellesque cuteness can accrue, as in the well-known image of two adults and a child in a museum intently studying a small white card at the center of an empty frame while an adjacent portrait looks on.Many more of the images at Houk tend toward the serious. Taken mostly before 1960, they show an artist as deeply in touch as Robert Frank with the tensions and conflicts of postwar America, and also attuned to the nuances of life elsewhere.'"

"'06-01-11,'1','""Our concern is that the development process itself is not keeping up at a fast enough pace to match the progress on the discovery end,"" said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the agency's deputy commissioner for medical and scientific affairs.The F.D.A. is looking for ways to speed the approval of new treatments -- like approving drugs based on ""surrogate endpoints,"" whether, for example, a cancer drug causes tumors to shrink instead of whether it prolongs the life of patients. It was on such a basis that the F.D.A. last month approved Nexavar, a Bayer drug for treating kidney cancer.But like finding new treatments, diagnosing the problem of drug development is easier than figuring out a solution. Even as the F.D.A. looks for ways to speed the testing of new treatments, members of Congress and some consumer groups are calling for even more testing before drugs are approved.The low output from research last year was even worse than the top-line figures might indicate. In 2004, important cancer treatments including Avastin, by Genentech, and Tarceva, through a partnership of Genentech and OSI Pharmaceuticals, were among the therapies that regulators allowed onto the market. The drugs that were approved were mostly for rare diseases like chronic iron overload, a condition for which the Novartis medicine Exjade received clearance.In the meantime, the agency delayed approval of prominent new treatments like Pargluva, a diabetes drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck, and Exubera, a form of inhaled insulin from Pfizer.The paucity of new products is a big reason that the stock prices of large drug makers have tended to fare poorly in recent years. Shares of Pfizer, the industry leader, for example, reached a peak of $49 in July 2000 and have trended downward since, closing yesterday at $24.44.The drought in new drugs has led some industry executives to complain that the F.D.A. is denying approval to good new treatments because of the criticism the agency has faced from lawmakers over Vioxx. Merck stopped selling its arthritis painkiller Vioxx in 2004 after a clinical trial showed that it increased the risks of heart attacks and strokes in patients taking it for 18 months or longer. Some other studies found heart attack risks as early as 2000, and the F.D.A. has been criticized for not forcing Merck to withdraw the drug earlier or to warn doctors prominently of such risks.Dr. Gottlieb said that the agency's attitude toward approving new drugs had changed only marginally, if at all. Its approval rate has been roughly flat for the last several years, but companies are submitting fewer applications, he said.Albert Rauch, a drug industry analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons, says that the F.D.A. should not be blamed for the drop in new approvals last year.""Some of the drugs that didn't make it through, they had issues,"" Mr. Rauch said. ""If you come up with something that's unique and really has a unique advantage, the F.D.A.'s very receptive to that.""Mr. Rauch said he believed that the industry was probably at the bottom of the development cycle and that the number of new drugs would increase in the next few years, as some sophisticated research techniques started to bear fruit. ""When you're talking about targets, there's a lot of them out there,"" Mr. Rauch said. ""But those targets didn't become evident until after 1995. It's only been 10 years, and it typically takes at least 10 years to get a product to market.""Researching and developing a drug is a long and arduous process. Genentech's work leading to Avastin, for example, began in 1989 -- 15 years before the drug's approval. Scientists first identify the cellular process of disease within the body. They may search for proteins that cancerous tumors release in order to spread, or receptors on the surface of a cell that become the targets of viruses.The drug company then searches for chemical compounds or proteins that are able to interact with the targets the scientists have found -- without damaging cells in other parts of the body. If a treatment appears to have therapeutic effects in test-tube and animal trials, the companies then move on to Phase I human testing, when a handful of healthy volunteers are given the therapy to make sure that it is safe enough for wider testing. In Phase II testing, the drug is tried on a few dozen to a few hundred patients for safety and effectiveness.Finally, in Phase III development, the drug is tested in large-scale trials with as many as several thousand patients to demonstrate its effectiveness and to search for rarer side effects.If the treatment is shown to be unsafe or ineffective at any stage, it fails development and is put aside.According to a report in December from Merrill Lynch, the number of potential new drugs in Phase I and II testing has nearly doubled in the last decade, to 1,971 in 2004 from 1,010 in 1995. But that has not translated into success in Phase III development; the number of drugs in Phase III has been flat at fewer than 400.""R&D statistics over the past decade have been disappointing,"" Merrill's analysts wrote in their report. Still, the analysts predicted that companies would continue to increase research spending and expand their pipelines of early-stage drugs.The advances in early-stage development, though, may be increasing the rate of attrition as drugs move into later stages, according to the report. ""Technological advances may have allowed companies to more easily create new therapies, thus boosting the number of compounds in early development,"" it said. ""But the increasing complexity of the targeted disease could mean that it is hard to predict efficacy and safety.""Analysts note that the biotechnology industry is still coming into its own and that the medical payoffs from genomics still lie mainly in the future.So far, said Robert Rech, a managing director at Ferghana Partners, a specialty investment bank that specializes in the drug industry, the increased knowledge about disease processes has created as many questions as answers. ""We have all this extra information, and all it's done is complicated everything,"" he said. ""It's almost like we know too much, because for everything that we learn, it almost brings up two new questions.""Still, the companies that Ferghana works with are optimistic that the drought in drug development will not last forever, Mr. Rech said. ""If you're in the industry, you certainly don't sense any lack of activity. I think we will get there, but we're only 15 years into this. It just takes time.""'"
"'06-01-11,'1','Although stores catering to do-it-yourselfers still provide the biggest chunk of sales, analysts say that with more than 2,000 stores, Home Depot may be facing saturation.They also say that Lowe's, its smaller but fast-growing competitor, is gaining ground. Revenue at Lowe's has nearly tripled in the last five years, rising to $36.5 billion in fiscal 2004 from $18.4 billion in 2000. Home Depot had sales of $73.1 billion in fiscal 2004, compared with $45.7 billion in 2000.""When Lowe's puts up a brightly lit, attractive new store near a Home Depot store, the Lowe's parking lot is usually more crowded,"" said Craig R. Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a consulting firm.Home Depot, analysts say, has been trying to distance itself from Lowe's in arenas other than North American stores. It is opening stores in China, an area Lowe's has avoided. And, while Lowe's does sell supplies to professional builders, it does so mainly at its stores; analysts say it is unlikely to adopt the Hughes distribution model anytime soon.""Builders use stores as secondary or tertiary suppliers, but with Hughes, Home Depot can be the primary supplier,"" said Matthew J. Fassler, an analyst at Goldman Sachs who has an outperform rating on Home Depot shares.Home Depot continues to open stores and modernize old ones, and to seek contracts to install the countertops, flooring and other items it sells. Indeed, on Monday, Home Depot said that it would pay an undisclosed amount to buy Chem-Dry, which supplies carpet and upholstery cleaning services to homeowners.That acquisition bolsters the At Home Services unit of Home Depot, which has had double-digit growth.Although smaller than Hughes, Chem-Dry may prove to be a more difficult cog to fit into Home Depot's fast-spinning wheel. It is a franchising operation, a business method Home Depot has never tried. And while most analysts say Robert L. Nardelli, who left General Electric to become Home Depot's chief executive in 2000, learned much about integrating acquisitions at G.E., he never dealt with franchises there, either.""It will be interesting to see whether they have the management skills to run a franchising operation,"" Mr. Johnson said.Ms. Smith, the Home Depot spokeswoman, acknowledged the gap but said Home Depot was eager to learn. ""We want to gain expertise in franchising for all our service businesses,"" she said.'"

"'06-01-11,'1','The Securities and Exchange Commission has notified Perry Capital, a large hedge fund company, that it intends to take action against the firm, accusing it of violating disclosure rules when it used an unusual trading technique last year to try to influence a takeover battle, the company said.Perry, which was founded by a former Goldman Sachs partner, Richard C. Perry, received what is known as a Wells notice, which describes the S.E.C.'s complaint. Before a case is brought, Perry has the right to argue its case to the agency.The case stems from a complex hedging technique that Perry used to buy a voting stake in a company without holding the same economic interest in the company.Perry used the technique to try to influence the outcome of a takeover battle for King Pharmaceuticals, a generic drug maker, waged by a larger rival, Mylan Laboratories.The firm appeared to have set up a sophisticated swap trade with Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs so that it controlled about 10 percent of Mylan's votes, with limited or no exposure to fluctuations in Mylan's share price.'"
"'06-01-11,'1','""For the Russians, this is an angry statement,"" said the administration official, who did not want to be identified while discussing tactics or strategy, as opposed to settled policy. The official added that American officials would confer with the other Europeans and the Russians in the next few days before deciding what action to take against Iran.""We view this as a serious escalation on the part of Iran on the nuclear issue,"" said Sean McCormack, a State Department spokesman. ""What you see here is the international community coming out and sending a very clear message to Iran that their behavior is unacceptable.""German, French and British officials joined in assailing the Iranian action. Over the last year, the three nations persuaded the Bush administration to go along with their effort to negotiate with Iran to keep a freeze on activities that Iran says are peaceful but that many Western experts believe are part of a covert weapons program.The negotiations involved European offers of economic incentives, including the sale of aircraft parts and talks leading to trade preferences. But Iran's action appears to have derailed any such discussions for now.""The Iranians have behaved so remarkably badly, it's hard to believe that the international community will do anything other than put them in front of the ultimate court of international public opinion,"" a European diplomat said, referring to the Security Council. ""That is where the Iranians are heading."" The official did not want to be identified by name or country to preserve a united front with his European colleagues.President Jacques Chirac of France criticized Iran's action as a grave error, and the new German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said Iran was sending ""very, very disastrous signals.""In Tehran, Iranian officials were quoted as saying the actions they were taking involved research activities permitted by the Nonproliferation Treaty, which allows signers to have peaceful nuclear programs as long as they agree to monitoring and do not do anything that could make weapons.The International Atomic Energy Agency has not charged that Iran is making a bomb, but Iran has concealed its activities from inspectors in a way that has aroused suspicions.Iran voluntarily suspended some of those activities more than a year ago in an agreement with the three European nations in Paris. Last year, however, it proceeded with the conversion of raw uranium, or yellow cake, into a gas known as uranium hexaflouride, also called UF6.On Tuesday, the seals placed by the International Atomic Energy Agency were removed at Natanz, Iran, where centrifuges for enrichment of uranium to a higher grade are stored. Iranian officials also removed seals at two related storage and testing locations known as Pars Trash, near Isfahan, and Farayand Technique. The international agency said the seals had covered centrifuge components, manufacturing equipment and two cylinders containing uranium hexaflouride.Western diplomats said Iran appeared ready to enrich uranium with 164 or more centrifuges, the minimum amount they said was needed for combined use in a ""cascade"" that could produce highly enriched fuel. The centrifuges spin the gas into a concentrated form that can be used for fuel or weapons.But other nuclear experts say enriching uranium in centrifuges is an extremely complex undertaking requiring thousands of centrifuges to make enough material for a nuclear bomb. A small ""cascade"" could help teach the Iranians how to get to that larger goal, some experts say.While proclaiming its right to enrich uranium as part of its nuclear energy program, Iran has maintained that all its actions are intended for research and not for producing nuclear fuel, even for its energy-related reactors.""We make a difference between research on nuclear fuel technology and production of nuclear fuel,"" Muhammad Saeedi, deputy head of Iran's atomic energy organization, was quoted as saying by the ISNA news agency.Last year, the West warned Iran not to convert raw uranium into uranium hexaflouride gas. But when Iran proceeded to do so, the West took no punitive action, instead drawing a new ""red line"" saying it would invite retaliation if it took the gas and enriched it in centrifuges.""There's no question that Iran has miscalculated here,"" the administration official said. ""They may have thought that since there have been long and protracted negotiation for two years, there would not be any credible reaction. But this is a big step across a big, bright red line.""American officials also said Iran had insulted Mohamed ElBaradei, the chairman of the International Atomic Energy Agency, by removing the seals itself and not waiting for the agency to do it.Dr. ElBaradei, who has cautiously said there was no evidence of an Iranian weapons program, has also continually called for Iran to disclose all its activities. On Tuesday, he expressed ""serious concern"" about Iran's action, which he said added to the problem of its ""less than full and prompt transparency"" in nuclear areas, an agency statement said.Dr. ElBaradei called on Iran to return to its suspension of activities and to resume its dialogue ""with all concerned parties,"" the agency said.Two years ago, when the European nations sought to avert a confrontation between Iran and the West by offering incentives for Iran to abandon its nuclear program, many Bush administration officials were openly disdainful of the European effort.Earlier this year, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice changed course and with President Bush in Europe enthusiastically endorsed the diplomatic efforts. This fall, Mr. Bush also endorsed a separate Russian offer to join with Iran in a Russian-Iranian uranium enrichment facility on Russian soil as an alternative to an Iranian program.A top Russian envoy, Sergei Kisliak, went to Tehran last weekend to try to promote that offer. But Iran's actions have now served as an apparent rebuff to Russia.A recurrent concern of the Bush administration relates to North Korea, which was referred to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions because of its nuclear weapons program. The SecurityCouncil has not acted, however. American diplomats say they believe that this time, with Russian and Chinese help, there can be a different result.'"

"'06-01-11,'1','Meanwhile, G.M., which offered sweeping discounts to customers last summer only to see its sales crater when the deals were gone, said on Tuesday that it was cutting the sticker prices on 57 of 76 models, in an effort to persuade customers that its deals were attractive.The effort, which affects 75 percent of G.M.'s lineup, does not include vehicles from Hummer and Saab, and also excludes some Saturn and Cadillac models.Mr. York declined to talk about that move. But he said of G.M.: ""The time has come to go into crisis mode and act accordingly.""G.M. lost more than $4 billion on its North American operations in the first nine months of 2005. Its market share, which has fallen steadily since the late 1970's, dropped another point last year, leaving G.M. with 26 percent of the American market, its lowest since the 1920's.In November, G.M. announced a plan to close all or part of 12 plants, cut 30,000 jobs through 2008, and reduce its structural costs by $7 billion a year. But many analysts questioned whether that was enough.While praising the latest reorganization plan, Mr. York said G.M. could do more. He calculated that the company had access to about $30 billion in cash, including divisions and operations that it could sell to raise money.But the automaker is burning through about $24 million a day, meaning it has enough to operate for about 1,000 days. While that sounds like a lot of time in a city whose time horizon is often aligned with its monthly auto sales reports, Mr. York said it could work against G.M. if its financial crisis, and a parallel crisis at Ford Motor, continue unabated.""Every single day the companies are in the headlines regarding their financial stress,"" Mr. York said, ""they are one day closer to the day when customers could begin deciding not to take the risk"" of buying their vehicles.Mr. York said G.M. needed to issue the kind of financial targets that Mr. Ghosn of Nissan has since taking charge in 1999. Mr. Ghosn has drafted three strategies -- the Nissan Revitalization Plan; its successor, called Nissan 360; and the current plan, named ValueUp -- each with four or five crucial goals, like expanding international sales by one million vehicles and halving its automotive debt.In the first two plans, Nissan either met the goals ahead of schedule or exceeded its targets.But last week, G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, dismissed such a tactic, saying he thought G.M. had been clear enough about its intentions. And on Tuesday, G.M.'s new chief financial officer, Frederick A. Henderson, said the company felt a sense of urgency.""To be honest, I am in crisis mode. So I agree with him,"" Mr. Henderson said. In December, he succeeded John M. Devine, now a G.M. vice chairman, who accompanied him to Mr. York's speech. Like Mr. Devine, Mr. Henderson watched impassively while Mr. York spoke.Several auto industry analysts have questioned why G.M. continues to pay an annual dividend of $2, a rate in place since 1997. Eliminating the dividend would save G.M. about $566 million a year, Mr. York said. But Mr. Henderson said a dividend cut was up to G.M.'s board, while Mr. Wagoner acknowledged last week that shareholders had sacrificed along with G.M. because of the 50 percent drop in the value of its stock.The speech brought Mr. York back to a podium in a town where he spent much of his career. At Chrysler, he served as a finance executive during its brush with bankruptcy in the early 1980's, and subsequently as its chief financial officer.After participating in a turnaround at I.B.M., Mr. York subsequently became an adviser to Mr. Kerkorian, the biggest shareholder in Chrysler before it merged with DaimlerBenz in 1998.In late 1995, Mr. York demanded a board seat from Chrysler, which ultimately allowed a different Tracinda representative to become one of its directors. Under Mr. York's prodding, the company also increased its dividend and repurchased $3 billion in stock.Thus far, however, G.M. and Tracinda have failed to agree on terms for a Tracinda board seat.G.M.'s latest incentive plan, announced at the North American International Auto Show, could reduce sticker prices by $2,500 per car or truck, although savings will be lower in most cases.Mr. Wagoner said that he did not expect incentives to vanish from the company's marketing strategy, but that they would play a smaller role in the future.""We do not plan on having the kind of propensity for incentives as we have over the past couple years,"" Mr. Wagoner said. He later added, ""We'd be naïve to assume that we're not going to ever run incentives.""The latest pricing strategy is not a new tactic for G.M. Over the years, it has tried similar efforts, particularly in California, where its market share is much lower than the 26 percent of sales that it holds nationwide.Indeed, the effort is essentially an expansion of a promotion the company announced in August, which cut sticker prices on some of its most recent models. That less comprehensive plan ""wasn't as good,"" Mr. Wagoner said. ""Now we're confident we can take this across the whole lineup.""'"

"'06-01-11,'1','WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 - The National Security Agency's inspector general has been reviewing the agency's domestic surveillance program for months, but the goal of the review is not to assess the legal justification of the program, an N.S.A. official said Tuesday night.The inspector general, Joel F. Brenner, is auditing the program to make certain it follows rules set by the agency and an executive order signed by President Bush in 2002, the official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the classified nature of the program.The official said the review was not the result of any accusation of wrongdoing but simply seemed like a prudent step. ""It was a sensitive program,"" he said, ""and it was important to the agency and the country that it be done right.""He declined to comment on the results of the review, except to say that suggestions that any eavesdropping had been conducted for ""domestic political purposes"" is false. The N.S.A. program has come under fire from some members of Congress and former intelligence officials because it targets the international communications of Americans and others in the United States without warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court as the law appears to require.But the review led by Mr. Brenner began long before the existence of the program was made public by The New York Times last month and did not involve legal and constitutional issues, the official said. Those issues are handled inside the agency by the general counsel's office and outside by the Department of Justice.President Bush and Alberto R. Gonzales, the attorney general, have said eavesdropping without warrants is being carried out under the president's powers as commander in chief and the Congressional resolution passed in 2001 authorizing the use of force against those responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.The N.S.A. inspector general's review has been mentioned by the president in his defense of its propriety. It was mentioned in a letter released on Tuesday written by the Pentagon's inspector general, Thomas F. Gimble, to House Democrats who had asked him to review it.'"

"'06-01-12,'0','Dr. Gregorian, the president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York and a member of the memorial foundation board, said he learned about it from a Jan. 3 article in The New York Times.Without commenting on the latest revision, he urged a ""major public presentation"" of how the original design has changed in the last two years as the result of budgeting, engineering and security concerns. There ought to be regular updates, Dr. Gregorian said, ""in order to avert surprises, rumors or speculation.""Yesterday, Mr. Arad said the role of the vessel and surrounding rooms had evolved, particularly after he visited the refrigerated trailers where the body parts are currently stored in the hope that they can eventually be matched with individuals.""We're not burying the remains,"" Mr. Arad said. ""They have to be kept for future identification. We're essentially keeping them in medically controlled conditions.""He also said he learned from the medical examiner that ""many family members wanted to see where the remains were, how they were being stored.""Asked, then, what was the purpose of the monolith itself, Mr. Arad said, ""It provides a touchstone, a center, something that people can gather around.""""I can imagine people leaving flowers or candles at the base of this,"" he added. ""People may tape pictures to it. We don't know how they will interact.""Anne Papageorge, a senior vice president of the development corporation, said, ""There are many memorials or vessels that don't contain actual remains that still serve a symbolic focal purpose.""BUT Ms. Lutnick said she did not understand why the vessel could not have drawers on one side, if that were necessary for retrieval, and solid stone on the other sides, with the entire tomb enclosed in a see-through material if it must be climate-controlled. ""It seems to me they're not trying very hard,"" she said.Prof. James E. Young of the University of Massachusetts, an expert on memorials who served on the memorial jury, said, ""Perhaps a small vessel with unidentified remains could be entombed in the large 'symbolic' vessel, coming to represent the rest of the remains entombed behind the wall nearby.""Speaking of the monolith-as-tomb, Professor Young said in an e-mail message: ""I always cautioned against making this feature too central to the role of the memorial, only because the signficance of remains varies widely among different religious traditions.""I know that in some Christian communities, a vessel with remains (an urn with ashes, for example) occupies a pretty prominent place in memorializing the dead. In contrast, orthodox Jewish tradition proscribes certain priestly sects from treading in cemeteries at all, where human remains are present.""The way forward, therefore, will probably be to find a balance or compromise between the literal and symbolic roles of the mortuary vessel.""He did not say it would be easy.'"
"'06-01-12,'0','""Justice O'Connor and Judge Sam Alito both set limits on Congress's commerce power,"" Mr. Cornyn said. ""Sandra Day O'Connor and Sam Alito both struck down affirmative action policies that had strict numerical quotas. And both -- this ought to be a shocker to some based on what we've heard here today -- is that both Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Judge Sam Alito have criticized Roe v. Wade.""Democratic senators, on the other hand, worked hard to show that Judge Alito and Justice O'Connor were at odds, particularly in an important abortion case.In his opening statement, striking a theme that has run through the hearings, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, asked rhetorically, ""Are you in Justice O'Connor's mold or, as the president has vowed, are you in the mold of Justices Scalia and Thomas?""President Bush has said he would try to appoint justices like Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, the court's two most conservative members.By Wednesday morning, Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, had grown frustrated with all the O'Connor talk. ""The fact that you have to fit the Sandra Day O'Connor mold is really a misapplication,"" he said. ""There is no precedent that would say that.""Judge Alito said he would be his own person, but not before offering one more tribute. ""No nominee can ever be a duplicate of someone who retires,"" he said, ""and particularly when someone retires after such a distinguished career and such a historic career as Justice O'Connor. Nobody can be expected, as a nominee, to fit that mold.""Judge Alito gave no indication, beyond saying he respected precedent and would proceed with an open mind, about whether he would follow the joint opinion Justice O'Connor signed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1992 decision affirming the constitutional right to abortion found by Roe v. Wade in 1973. Casey was, however, a 6-to-3 decision, and Judge Alito will not be in a position to move the court away from its support of the core right to abortion.But Justice O'Connor did provide the crucial fifth vote in the court's last major abortion ruling, in 2000, striking down Nebraska's ban on what were called ""partial birth"" abortions. The court will soon decide whether to hear a challenge to a similar federal law, and in that case Judge Alito could alter the course of the court's abortion jurisprudence.Judge Alito participated in the Casey decision in 1991 as an appeals court judge, and he seemed a little defensive in explaining his dissenting vote to uphold a Pennsylvania law that required women to notify their husbands before having abortions. The Supreme Court took the opposite view the next year.All he had been trying to do in his dissent, Judge Alito explained, was to understand what Judge O'Connor had meant in some earlier decisions.""There were just a few hints in those opinions about what she meant,"" Judge Alito said. ""Based on the information that I had from Justice O'Connor's opinions, it seemed to me that this was not what she had in mind. Now, that turned out not to be a correct prediction.""In another exchange, asked whether he agreed with Justice O'Connor's statement in a 2004 decision that ""a state of war is not a blank check for the president when it comes to the rights of the nation's citizens,"" Judge Alito did not hesitate.""Absolutely,"" he said. ""That's a very important principle.""In defending his dissent in a 10-to-1 decision of his court in an employment discrimination case, Judge Alito also invoked Justice O'Connor.""When the issue went to the Supreme Court"" in another case, he said, ""Justice O'Connor wrote the opinion for the Supreme Court, and she agreed with my analysis.""In 1996, Judge Alito voted in dissent to strike down a law regulating the possession of machine guns, citing United States v. Lopez, a 1995 Supreme Court case that struck down a law banning the possession of handguns near schools.Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, was quick to note the lineup in the Lopez case. ""By the way,"" Mr. Kyl said, ""it was one of those decisions that Justice O'Connor was in the majority, a 5-4 decision in which her position could be characterized as the swing vote.""On Wednesday, Judge Alito said he would follow Justice O'Connor's approach in religion cases.""Justice O'Connor pointed out something that's very critical in this area,"" he said. ""She said there is a big difference between government speech endorsing religion and private religious speech. And private religious speech can't be discriminated against. It has to be treated equally with secular speech.""From the moment he was nominated in October, Judge Alito has made clear his fondness and admiration for Justice O'Connor. That was based in part, he said in remarks accepting the nomination, on something she had done at his first argument before the Supreme Court in 1982, an occasion that filled him with ""a sense of awe.""""I also remember,"" he said, ""the relief that I felt when Justice O'Connor, sensing, I think, that I was a rookie, made sure that the first question that I was asked was a kind one. I was grateful to her on that happy occasion, and I am particularly honored to be nominated for her seat.""'"
"'06-01-12,'0','Her coach, John Nicks, said Cohen was feeling more confident than ever. He said she would be ready to compete Thursday.""She completed all of her triples and spins,"" he said of Cohen's practice at the Savvis Center on Wednesday. ""It looked like a big step forward to me.""This is a nerve-racking week for the competitors. The first-place finishers at the nationals in all senior events, including the pairs and the ice dancers, win automatic Olympic bids. In every event except the pairs, which has only two Olympic spots, three competitors or teams will be named to the team going to Turin.In the women's event, the two other Olympic team spots will be chosen by a 36-member committee of the United States Figure Skating Association after Saturday's free skate. After that, U.S. Figure Skating must submit nominees to the U.S. Olympic Committee by Jan. 16. Even then, a nominee could be replaced until Jan. 30, when athletes' names are submitted to the Turin Games organizing committee.The biggest question is whether Kwan, who petitioned for a medical bye onto the Olympic team, will be one of those nominated skaters. She has competed only once under the new scoring system, finishing fourth at last year's worlds. This season, she competed only at an exhibition event, and she failed to land even one triple jump.Now, for the first time in 14 years, she is at home while the nationals go on without her. She said doctors ordered her to refrain from spinning and jumping until Friday.""I'm sure that the powers that be will want Michelle to be there,"" said her former coach, Frank Carroll. ""I'm also sure that the powers that be will make sure she is in shape and is physically able to do it.""If Kwan is named to the team, that will leave two open spots, with Cohen a likely candidate, along with a younger skater like Alissa Czisny, 18, Kimmie Meissner, 16, or Emily Hughes, 16, sister of Sarah Hughes, the 2002 Olympic gold medalist.Some skaters, like Emily Hughes, said they were trying to focus on their performances instead of calculating how many Olympic spots were open. Others, like Czisny, are going into this competition assuming Kwan will be in Turin.""I think she has done so much for the sport, and she has been a champion for so many years,"" Czisny said. She added, ""I'm guessing they'll give her a spot on the Olympic team.""The men will also skate their short programs Thursday, earlier in the day, with the two-time defending national champion, Johnny Weir, looking to make his first Olympic team. Other top contenders are Evan Lysacek, who finished third at last year's worlds, and Timothy Goebel, the 2002 Olympic bronze medalist.All of those skaters, and every other one here, must deal with a scoring system making its debut at these nationals. It is a system based on cumulative points, with judges having access to video replays.Weir, who altered his programs so they would score higher, called the new system frustrating and silly. ""The worst part of the system right now is that nobody gets it,"" he said.Cohen is just trying to ignore it.She has spent many hours resting in her hotel room, hoping to shut out distractions like the new scoring, Kwan's petition or any other drama that could sidetrack her from finally winning a national championship.""I got my own things to worry about,"" said Cohen, her voice raspy because of her illness, as she rubbed her red nose with her tiny right hand.Katie Orscher and Garrett Lucash, the defending national champions, finished first in Wednesday's short program in the pairs competition, scoring 60.65 points. They are comfortably ahead of the second-place pair of Marcy Hinzmann and Aaron Parchem (57.41). The most surprising performance in pairs came from the former national champions Rena Inoue and John Baldwin, two of the favorites to make the Olympic team. After major errors in their short program, they will go into Friday's free skate in fourth. Inoue fell on a throw triple loop, and Baldwin stumbled during their side-by-side triple toe loop jumps.'"

"'06-01-12,'0','When newborns arrive and are placed in row after row of bassinets at the hospital, a nurse with 23 years' experience says even she can't tell the difference between the boys and the girls. Three or four years later, the boys are making up stories about killing people and animals. (The girls are inventing stories about families and friends.)So it goes in ""Raising Cain,"" a thought-provoking two-hour documentary based on the book of that name by Michael Thompson, a children's psychologist. Early in the film, which has its premiere tonight on PBS, a little boy explains why he enjoys football: ""You get to nail people. You get to hurt them.""Mr. Thompson is worried about the future of American boys and wants to understand their psychology. He begins with a revealing study in which the mothers of 5-month-old babies play with them for a while, then ignore them. The girls in the study look puzzled for a moment, then start amusing themselves by looking around the room. The boys look puzzled for a moment, then begin crying and waving their arms. ""Baby boys are more emotionally vulnerable,"" not less, Mr. Thompson, the film's narrator and host, concludes.So how do those vulnerable little cuties turn into aggressive kindergarten students with homicidal fantasies? ""Raising Cain"" ignores all the ""Who's my big, strong little man?"" and ""Who's my sweet little princess?"" messages in between. Or maybe it just accepts that conditioning as an unavoidable given.As for those kindergarten stories, Tom Newkirk, the author of ""Misreading Masculinity,"" is all for them. ""Violent writing tests our fear,"" he says in the film, adding that it doesn't turn boys into killers. They know the difference between fantasy and real life. But Mr. Newkirk does object to exposing children to gory violence because seeing the gore alters their fantasy life.'"

"'06-01-12,'0','Still, those hundreds of thousands of 99 centses must be better than nothing. Throughout the 1990's, record companies all but stopped selling singles, in hopes that people would buy full-length CD's instead. Listeners who wanted one song instead of 15 were out of luck. Radio D.J.'s often found themselves playing songs that weren't even available except on albums. Hit singles often were not singles at all -- were not, that is, available singly.In the last few years, though, the idea of buying songs has been resurrected, thanks to iTunes and other legal music download providers. Billboard recently began including digital-download sales in the formula it uses to compile its pop charts. Just as the rise of the vinyl LP helped usher in an era of so-called album-rock, it seems likely that the rise of paid downloads -- and the resurrection of the retail singles market -- will have unpredictable musical side effects.Which brings us right back to snap music. On the hip-hop prestige scale, goofy dance songs like ""Laffy Taffy"" don't rate very high. Even in Atlanta, which has produced more than its fair share of goofy dance smash hits (like ""Whoomp! There It Is"" and ""Get Low,"" to name two of the biggest), dance-oriented hip-hop is often treated like a guilty pleasure. Tough-talking, lyric-oriented storytellers like T. I. and Young Jeezy get much more respect than D4L and Dem Franchize Boyz, whose hits are considered light club music, as opposed to heavy street music.Of course this is a specious dichotomy, but the distinction between serious and frilly exists in many genres, and it often finds expression in consumers' buying patterns. For the serious stuff, you need the album; for the frilly stuff, a song might suffice. Young Jeezy has never had a song as big as ""Laffy Taffy,"" but he has sold many more albums than D4L. In hip-hop as elsewhere, ""album artist"" isn't just a sales category; it's a music category, too. An elite one.So despite D4L's success, it's a safe bet that Dem Franchize Boyz are hoping their career more closely resembles Young Jeezy's, even though their music doesn't. ""I Think They Like Me (Remix)"" came from a compilation called ""Jermaine Dupri Presents Young, Fly & Flashy Vol. 1"" (Virgin), which made a tepid debut at No. 43 on the album chart. Now Dem Franchize Boyz have a new emerging hit, ""Lean With It, Rock With It,"" and a new album, ""On Top of Our Game,"" due in stores Feb. 7. For the sake of both their reputation and their bank accounts, no doubt the members are hoping more listeners buy the CD than the single.For now, though, it certainly seems as if snap music and digital downloads were made for each other. Easy and cheap, single-song downloads are the musical equivalent of an impulse buy, so maybe it's no coincidence that the biggest digital download in history (so far) is a cheap-sounding hip-hop track named after a sugary snack that's traditionally found near the cash register. The silly little song about candy was neither as silly nor as little as it first seemed.The 99-cent model may well be unsustainable for major labels, which probably need to sell something more expensive to stay in business. But it might be helpful for smaller acts hoping to score a freak hit. With any luck, the next snap-music hit will be ""What's Happenin',"" the insanely addictive track from the as yet little-known group Trap Squad. (The refrain comes out in a nasal bleat: ""Whass ha na na! Whass ha na na!"" This isn't a song; it's a virus.) Here's hoping it soon comes to an iTunes near you.'"

"'06-01-12,'0','Despite major strides in oil production and trailblazing development of renewable fuels, Brazil's energy picture is marred by its inability to meet soaring demand for natural gas. There is no clear estimate of how much natural gas Brazil would consume if the gas were available, but plants occasionally go dark and gas distributors are turning away clients. Existing shortfalls limit new investment in gas-fueled plants and power generators.""There's an imbalance,"" said Rafael Schechtman, director of the Brazilian Infrastructure Center, a consulting firm here. ""Natural gas lags an otherwise healthy energy sector.""Indeed, as Brazil became a star in energy self-sufficiency, natural gas was something of an afterthought. Demand began in the 1990's, when the government decided to reinforce Brazil's hydroelectric power grid with plants fueled by natural gas. Industry, facing environmental pressures and higher oil prices, also sought gas to replace the fuel oil that fired engines and furnaces.Because Brazil at the time had discovered few reserves at home, it relied upon imports from gas-rich neighbors, like Argentina and Bolivia. A $1.8 billion 2,000-mile pipeline from Bolivia, financed mostly by Petróleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras, Brazil's state-controlled energy company, feeds Brazil half its needs.But in 2003, Petrobras found huge gas deposits off the state of São Paulo in the Santos basin. Initially, Petrobras estimated that the new find tripled the country's gas reserves to more than 600 billion cubic meters total. While the fields will help Brazil reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers, Petrobras is reluctant to forecast exactly how much they could yield. At present, Brazil boasts proven reserves of 326 billion cubic meters. The fields, however, would help Brazil move toward self-sufficiency in gas.But the fields are still untapped. Petrobras said in 2005 that it would invest $15 billion through 2010 to develop them and double an existing 2,500-mile network of pipelines. The first gas would be produced in 2008. But the rising cost of steel, coupled with the sheer scale of Brazil's geography, makes a precise project timetable sketchy. Though Brazil is on its way to tapping the gas, it will no doubt come too late to address current need and pent-up demand.""Existing supplies don't match the growth in demand,"" said Sophie Aldebert, an associate director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, who is based here.Critics blame Brazil's government for failing to spur investment in the pipelines and distribution networks that could bring more natural gas from Bolivia as well as from existing domestic fields to more parts of the country. Laws that could stimulate that investment are mired in Congress, leaving the onus on Petrobras, the country's dominant wholesale supplier, to set the development agenda.""Petrobras controls supply and decides where and when to increase it,"" said Luis Domenech, president of Companhia de Gás de São Paulo, or Comgás, the distributor in Brazil's most populous state. Until the investment rules are clearer, he said, ""companies remain reluctant to compete with Petrobras.""But Petrobras rejects the notion that Brazil's gas fortunes rest solely on its shoulders. Though it recognizes its position as a near monopoly -- only a handful of other companies supply regional distributors -- the company was partly privatized in 1997 and its obligations lie more with private investors than in public service.""We're not obliged to meet any demand at any price,"" Ildo Sauer, Petrobras's director for gas and energy, said recently.From a black leather armchair in his spacious office in the Petrobras tower in Rio, Mr. Sauer points to wall maps illustrating a web of possible gas ducts in Brazil and throughout South America.The problems in supply, he said, are just symptoms of the immaturity of Brazil's gas market: there are shortfalls precisely because nobody expected demand to grow so fast. ""Any sector would be envious to have this kind of growth and investment,"" he said.Still, the shortfalls are hampering development.In the northeastern state of Bahia, factories and other industrial clients are pressing Bahiagás, the regional distributor, to supply more. While there is demand for at least 6.5 million cubic meters a day in Bahia, the company said, it is able to get only 3.5 million from Petrobras. Until a Petrobras-led consortium completes a new pipeline next year, the company is losing at least 1.56 million reais ($660,000) a day in potential revenue.With demand nationwide projected to grow more than 15 percent annually in coming years, future supply is even shakier and could steer manufacturers away from natural gas.Besides industrial users, homeowners in Brazil's big cities are switching to natural gas. Also, growing numbers of heavily used vehicles are converting to the fuel. Instead of popping a gasoline cap at the rear of their taxis, cabbies in cities like Rio and São Paulo are increasingly lifting their hoods and pumping natural gas into their tanks.""Demand is moving into a variety of other uses, but future growth remains dependent on supply,"" said Carlos Senna Figueredo, an energy consultant in Rio for the National Confederation of Industry, a manufacturing trade group based in São Paulo.Doubts cloud the supplies Brazil is getting from its neighbors, too.Contracts from Argentina, facing an energy squeeze because investment has withered since a financial meltdown earlier this decade, are faltering. Also, Argentina is required by law to suspend exports if it needs its gas at home. And Evo Morales, Bolivia's nationalist president-elect, has vowed to renegotiate agreements with foreign investors, with Petrobras being the biggest of them. [On Wednesday, Mr. Morales said he would cancel any contracts giving foreign companies ownership rights to the country's gas, according to Bloomberg News. Petrobras currently has rights to 17.5 percent of Bolivia's gas. Petrobras had no comment on Wednesday.]Other leaders around the region have talked of a host of potential new sources, like a transcontinental pipeline to carry gas from Venezuela southward, but those projects could be slow getting off the ground.Energy projects and policy, after all, are political hot potatoes in a region where economic fortunes often rely on the price and demand for commodities.""The need for more gas is clear, but the political landscape is not,"" Francisco Bugallo, president of generation in Brazil for the Spanish power company Endesa. ""The balance between supply and demand for energy is always a sensitive issue.""'"

"'06-01-12,'0','According to testimony by corrections officers on Wednesday, Mr. Druce later told them he ""did it for the children,"" to stop Mr. Geoghan, 68, from molesting more boys when he got out of prison.Mr. Geoghan was serving 6 years of a 9-to-10-year sentence for groping a boy in a swimming pool, and Mr. Druce told law enforcement authorities that he had heard Mr. Geoghan talking about plans to assault more children upon his release. Mr. Druce also signed a card waiving his Miranda rights ""the Reverend Joseph Druce.""Mr. LaChance suggested Wednesday that Mr. Druce's behavior was evidence of insanity, saying ""he began fantasizing about being an individual who would save the kids and save the world.""The prosecutor, Lawrence Murphy, suggested the opposite, that the fact that ""Mr. Druce was planning to kill John Geoghan"" showed that he was not insane.Mr. Druce is serving a life sentence without parole for beating and strangling a driver who he said made a sexual advance toward him when he was hitchhiking in 1988. He unsuccessfully tried an insanity defense in that case in 1989, and his lawyer in that case emphasized Mr. Druce's highly troubled background, including serious behavior problems, drug use, a mother who did not want him and a father who was abusive to his mother.Mr. LaChance referred to that background Wednesday, saying that Mr. Druce was ""like a little puppy you beat and beat,"" adding, ""Eventually the puppy strikes back when it is old enough and big enough.""At the time of Mr. Geoghan's slaying, Mr. Druce's father, Dana Smiledge, said Mr. Druce also had white supremacist leanings -- a hatred of gay people, Jews and blacks.Mr. Geoghan's murder not only stunned victims of abuse by priests, but also ignited a state investigation into the prison system. Several correction officials were removed, including the correction commissioner.The investigation found that only one guard was monitoring the 26-inmate unit at the time Mr. Druce slipped into Mr. Geoghan's cell and that the cell doors had been left open while the inmates were taking their lunch trays to a collection point.Mr. Geoghan was jailed in early 2002 and moved from a medium-security prison in Concord to the maximum-security Souza-Baranowski prison in Shirley in early 2003 after complaining that he felt harassed by guards and afraid for his safety.The state investigation said that Mr. Geoghan was indeed mistreated by guards in Concord and that he was inappropriately transferred to Shirley, where he was put in a wing for inmates who needed to be separated from the general prison population. But some of them were violent offenders, and many were younger than the frail Mr. Geoghan.Mr. Druce was transferred there not long afterward because he, too, had felt unsafe in his previous prison, where he had become a jailhouse informant, his lawyer said. Mr. Druce had changed his name, from Darrin Smiledge, because he was afraid of his prison enemies.Mr. LaChance said that Mr. Druce had been delusional in the past, pretending he was a rich person who owned yachts and million-dollar houses, and subscribing to Robb Report, the luxury magazine, at his previous prison. He said Mr. Druce fantasized that if he killed Mr. Geoghan ""he would be someone like a rich person with a yacht.""Mr. Druce, who has previously held up photographs and demonstrated other showy behavior in court, was medicated Wednesday with Ritalin and possibly other drugs, Mr. LaChance said. He made a thumbs up sign to several reporters, but otherwise seemed less attention-seeking. If his defense is successful, Mr. Druce is likely to be moved to a psychiatric institution.'"
"'06-01-12,'0','KIEV, Ukraine, Jan. 11 - President Viktor A. Yushchenko of Ukraine on Wednesday criticized as illegitimate a parliamentary vote to dismiss his prime minister and government, deepening the country's political turmoil ahead of new elections in March.""The decision was made by a Parliament that was elected four years ago by the old regime and is living its last weeks,"" Mr. Yushchenko said during a visit to Kazakhstan, where he attended the inauguration of President Nursultan A.

It not only undermined his political position before the elections but also called into question recent constitutional changes that gave Parliament new powers, including the authority to dismiss the government.'"

Corzine nominated a prominent Cuban-born lawyer on Wednesday to be New Jersey's next attorney general.It is the second time in recent years that the nominee, Zulima V.

McGreevey considered nominating her for a seat on the State Supreme Court but abandoned the idea upon learning that Ms. Farber was the subject of a bench warrant after failing to appear in court after being ticketed for unsafe driving. Ms. Farber, who is 61, said at the time that she never received notice of the court hearing. She later resolved the case by paying a fine.Aides to Mr. Corzine said he was confident that the issue was behind her and that her nomination would be confirmed by the full Senate, after being heard by the Judiciary Committee.Ms. Farber, a former assistant prosecutor in Bergen County and a former New Jersey public advocate, said she was not worried about the issue or the scrutiny that the confirmation process entails.""I respect very much the responsibility of the Judiciary Committee and I look forward to that process,"" she said on Wednesday in a telephone interview.'"
"'06-01-12,'0','What Libération neglected to say, as have most of the other articles in an irresistible landslide of coverage in print and on the Web, is that the McDonald's closed in December 2002. The paper spoke vaguely of events a ""number"" of months ago.But no matter. The protagonists here in Altamura as well as many others are thrilled with the belated attention, and the distinction as the city whose food was so good that it closed down a McDonald's without really trying.""What took place was a small war between us and McDonald's,"" said Onofrio Pepe, a retired journalist who founded an association here devoted to local delicacies. ""Our bullets were focaccia. And sausage. And bread. It was a peaceful war, without any spilling of blood.""Mr. Pepe and several like-minded citizens of Altamura, a city of 65,000 residents, made up one wing of the army. They say they fought largely for pride and for their food, which includes a local mushroom called the cardoncello, focaccia, mozzarella and, most of all, a coarse-grain bread famous for millennia around Italy. The bread is protected as unique in European Union regulations, which note that Horace called it, in 37 B.C., ""far the best bread to be had, so good that the wise traveler takes a supply of it for his onward journey.""When the McDonald's first opened in early 2001, Mr. Pepe said, he was not opposed to it, and even welcomed the 25 or so jobs it created. ""In the beginning,"" he said, ""it seemed like modernization.""Then the modern seemed to take over: McDonald's erected the huge arches on a pole near the old town center, jarringly near the 13th century cathedral, beaming yellow neon 24 hours a day (and disturbing, Mr. Pepe said, little falcons that nested in nearby trees).""It gave the sense of a city being occupied,"" he said. ""It was considered a sort of challenge. Not a challenge to confront in anger but with a smile. They brought in their products, and we had ours.""So his group held low-key protests to highlight local food, as another front on the war opened, very much unplanned.A fourth-generation baker, Luca Digesu, now 35, opened Antica Casa Digesu, a small bakery right next to the McDonald's. He said he had had no intention of challenging it, but had merely hoped to shake free some customers attracted to the spot by the novelty.""I was afraid of McDonald's,"" he said in his bakery on Tuesday. ""I was afraid we would be completely glossed over. I was afraid no one would even notice us.""For a while, McDonald's drew in the customers of Altamura. ""In the beginning,"" Mr. Digesu said, ""McDonald's was McDonald's.""But soon there was a migration of locals who preferred their own version of fast food: hunks of thick focaccia like the dozen that Mr. Digesu was tending in the oven as he spoke. Part of the reason seemed economic: Mr. Digesu said a big slice of focaccia cost the same as a single McDonald's hamburger. It was also, clearly, preference.McDonald's began fighting back, offering school trips to visit the kitchens, free rentals of the restaurant for children's birthday parties, coupons for children and a television for customers to watch soccer. Nothing seemed to work.""They'd watch the game, and as soon as it was over go out and get focaccia,"" Mr. Pepe said.Finally, in December 2002, after less than two years in operation, the McDonald's closed shop, according to the company, for lack of profitability. The huge space is now divided up into a jeans store and a bank. Mr. Digesu smiled broadly when asked how he felt that the Italian news media, which missed the story three years ago, are now hailing him as a modern-day David.""I like it,"" he said. ""McDonald's is big. I am small. Right now it is 1-0.""The company sees it differently, of course. ""In no way is this a defeat for McDonald's,"" contended Mario Resca, president of McDonald's in Italy, saying he hoped to double the number of McDonald's here from the current 340. ""If anything, I am proud that the local culture is appreciating its local cuisine because this means that McDonald's has stimulated a healthy competition.""In the end, it seems there may simply be places in the world where McDonald's is out of its depth on every front.The landlord both for McDonald's and Mr. Digesu happened to be Mr. Digesu's brother-in-law. The brother-in-law gave Mr. Digesu a good deal on the rent. He did not do so for McDonald's.Then there is the local food -- cheap and overwhelmingly good -- and the people who have eaten it for centuries and consider it as much their tradition as their history. Odd as it might seem in a corporate boardroom, they put no value on a McDonald's in Altamura.""The majority couldn't imagine McDonald's becoming an integral part of their lives,"" said Patrick Girondi, 48, an entrepreneur from Chicago who has lived here for 15 years. ""McDonald's didn't get beat by a baker. McDonald's got beat by a culture.""'"

""And all kinds of other questions would roll through my head at night. What if the business failed? Or he wanted to open up a new location?""In the end, Ms. Frey said she realized that having him buy her out would be ""less of a gamble"" than remaining as the business partner of her former husband. Also, ""we hope to maintain our friendship, and if we had a bunch of trust issues with the business, that wouldn't happen,"" she said.With the surge of family start-ups in recent years -- the number of ventures with one or more owners and no paid employees has grown rapidly since 2000 and now totals more than 17.6 million, according to the Census Bureau -- many couples are grappling with the same issue: What happens to a mom-and-pop shop when mom and pop divorce?Helping warring spouses navigate such issues takes up a good share of Bill Lee's time. Mr. Lee, owner of Lee Resources, a family-business consulting firm in Greenville, S.C., said that he had seen many such businesses fail because of messy divorces.It's all too common, he said, for one member of the dueling pair to insist upon an enormous payout that cripples the business. Mr. Lee recently worked with the owner of a building supply company whose wife demanded 50 percent of the business's value, or $5 million. The court awarded her that amount, and ever since then the man has ""struggled to keep his head above water,"" Mr. Lee said.""He had to go out and borrow the money for the payout, which put a severe damper on his ability to grow the business,"" he said. ""He has gone from growth mode to survival mode. That's pretty typical of what can happen.""In other cases, spouses who cannot agree can become ""downright deceptive,"" said Andy Birol, owner of Birol Growth Consulting in Cleveland and the author of ""The Five Catalysts of Seven-Figure Growth,"" a book to be released in February. Mr. Birol worked with a woman who was trying to get her spouse to buy out her share of a consulting business, only to find that her husband was secretly planning to move the business to a different locale without her knowledge.""The guy was planning to take whatever he could from the office and high-tail it out of town,"" Mr. Birol said. But when the husband arrived with a U-Haul trailer in the middle of the night to load up his records and office furniture, Mr. Birol said, he was thwarted by the town sheriff, who had put chains on the office doors. His soon-to-be ex-wife was tipped off by her daughter, who worked at the business and had learned of the secret plan to relocate.The wife quickly had a lien put on the business and the man left town without any of his possessions. ""He was totally busted,"" Mr. Birol said.To avoid such soap opera productions, Sharyn T. Sooho, co-founder of Divorcenet.com, an online service for divorcing couples, urges spouses to consider the health of their marriages before beginning a business together. She cites the example of a recent client who opened several gift stores with her husband, only to discover that he was cheating on her with her best friend.""If this woman had been more honest with herself, she would have realized that her husband was a scoundrel and avoided becoming more entangled with him by starting a business,"" Ms. Sooho said. ""Many people know their marriage is bad, but they believe their enthusiasm for the business will overcome any shortfall.""Ms. Sooho urges couples to sign prenuptial agreements that detail what happens to a family business should the couple go their separate ways. If they are already married when they begin a venture, she recommends that the couple write an agreement on buying and selling the business with a clause spelling out the terms in case of divorce.That is what Ms. Frey and her husband did, and they used the clause to negotiate the buyout agreement. However, ""these agreements aren't ironclad,"" Ms. Sooho warns. ""If the court thinks one spouse should get more money, they may simply award more alimony or child support to make up for it.""Without a buyout clause, Mr. Lee recommends that each spouse submit sealed bids for the business and agree that the highest bidder becomes the buyer and the lower bidder becomes the seller. Alternatively, one spouse could set a price at which he or she would be willing to buy or sell, leaving the choice up to the other. ""That will keep them honest,"" he said. ""They won't submit an outrageous number because they have to be willing to pay the price if the spouse doesn't want to.""In some rare cases, divorcing couples decide to remain business partners. ""One thing that really motivates people to keep working together is when the business is really profitable,"" said David Gage, co-founder of BMC Associates, a conflict-resolution firm in Arlington, Va. That often will not work for couples who cannot communicate well -- or those who have cheated on one another -- ""because you've broken the trust,"" he said.But couples still on a friendly basis have a better shot, Mr. Gage said. He recently worked with a couple who created an architectural design firm after they were married. When they divorced a few years later, they split their company into two entities, but still work together on certain projects. ""Their anger at each other wasn't off the charts, so they were able to come up with a creative solution,"" he said.In another case, Ms. Sooho worked with a divorcing couple in the consumer-electronics field who decided that the wife would give up all of her control over the business but stay on as a silent partner. ""The husband considered her a good luck charm and wanted the public to still perceive them as a couple, so they were able to work it out,"" Ms. Sooho said.In cases where divorcing spouses cannot reach a compromise, Mr. Birol tries to remind the couple that their squabbles could damage the business. ""I always beg people not to use the business for revenge or for getting validation,"" he said. ""It's an income-producing asset, and just because you're no longer in love does not mean that your business should become a piñata for revenge.""'"
"'06-01-12,'0','Unquestionably, water pollution is an extreme problem in China. Government studies show that 70 percent of the country's lakes and waterways are polluted.A vice minister for water resources has estimated that 360 million rural residents lack safe drinking water.Water pollution has also been blamed for high cancer rates in villages along several Chinese waterways.Local officials responding to the two new spills say that neither has forced shutdowns of municipal water systems. In Hunan Province, a spill occurred Jan. 4 in the industrial city of Zhuzhou after workers cleaning up a wastewater ditch mistakenly diverted the sewage water into the nearby Xiangjiang River.The water was laced with cadmium, a metal used in manufacturing that has been linked to neurological disorders and cancer. Initial water quality tests showed that cadmium levels in the river were at least 25 times above the safety standard. Last month, a different cadmium spill on the Beijiang River in Guangdong Province threatened water supplies to millions of people and forced some temporary water supply shutdowns in the densely populated region.In Hunan, Jiang Yimin, head of the provincial environmental protection bureau, said officials had used neutralizing chemicals to dilute the toxicity. He said the 60-mile slick had already flowed past the provincial capital, Changsha, without contaminating the drinking supply.The city draws its drinking water from the Xiangjiang, and Mr. Jiang said that tests had initially showed that cadmium levels at city intake pipes were five times above the national safety standard. But he said the water was treated at municipal water quality plants so that it would be safe for public consumption.Mr. Jiang said the toxicity of the river water now met quality standards. He also denied a report in China Youth Daily, a Beijing-based newspaper, which accused Hunan officials of intentionally playing down the levels of contamination to prevent a public panic.""All of the downstream cities have met the water quality standard,"" Mr. Jiang said in a telephone interview.A second major accident occurred last Friday, when a spill in Henan Province created a slick of diesel fuel flowing down the Yellow River. By the time the slick had reached neighboring Shandong Province, state news media reported that officials had shut down 63 pumping stations that draw drinking water from the river along the river, including in the provincial capital, Jinan. Officials in Jinan said the city would instead depend on water from reservoirs.Meanwhile, a smaller spill was reported last Friday in central China along the Qijiang River, when a sulfur leak forced communities along the river to go without running water for two days.This week, the central government announced plans to spend an additional $3 billion to clean up the Songhua River. Last Sunday, the State Council, China's cabinet, announced a new national emergency response plan, partly because of the Songhua controversy. The plan requires that natural disasters, major accidents and other incidents threatening public health should be reported to the State Council within four hours. The plan also requires that the public should be given timely and accurate information through the Chinese news media.Ms. Economy applauded the idea of a faster, more public response, but said it did not represent a solution to the country's water pollution problem. She noted that factories commonly dump wastewater into rivers and that environmental officials lack the political power to stop it.Indeed, the Xiangjiang River suffered such serious pollution problems even before last week's spill that local legislative delegates had complained that normal discharges of cadmium had long exceeded national standards.Ms. Economy noted that a 2004 government study found that half of the sewage treatment facilities built under the last five-year economic plan were not being used because local officials considered operating them too expensive.'"

If your monitor is not adjusted properly, color prints will not look the same as they do on your screen.Pantone, which makes color accuracy systems, has a new device called Huey that will set your monitor to Pantone standards, which are often used by photo printers as well.The device is a light sensor the size of a fountain pen. After it is attached to the monitor with suction cups, the included software displays bars of color. Huey reads the bars for accuracy, then adjusts the monitor. Once this is done, Huey goes into a stand on your desk to continuously check room lighting and adjust the screen settings.Although it will be a boon to photo buffs, Huey, available next week for $89 at www.pantone.com, could also be helpful to online shoppers. Pantone says 85 percent of online retailers use its system to set image colors, so Huey makes it more likely that the sweater you are considering will actually be the color you see on-screen.'"

The Mini system from Zvox Audio has at least one advantage over most standard iPod speaker sets: it creates virtual surround sound and accepts audio input from just about anything, including televisions and game consoles.The three-pound device, which is available at zvoxaudio.com for $200, is about the size of an average laptop. It does not have a CD player or built-in FM radio, and it lacks a standard iPod dock: it is connected to an MP3 player through a headphone jack with the included cord.The Zvox is notable, however, for its speaker technology, called PhaseCue. The device has three speaker drivers and one 4-by-6-inch subwoofer inside, and can digitally mix the signals from each speaker to create a sort of sonic dance that makes the audio sound bigger, as opposed to just louder, as the volume is increased. The result is like listening to speakers placed eight feet away from each other -- a sound that may even entice iPod listeners to forgo those space-age speaker sets sold in the Apple store.'"

"'06-01-13,'0','There are a few shows that are sophisticated and also have a childish appeal. Even some of the most jaded television snobs look forward to the season premieres of ""The Sopranos"" or ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" as if those HBO shows were Christmas morning. On Fox, a new ""24"" also has the power to make grown men squeal.And amazingly, the new season, which once again drags the special agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) back into the line of duty, does not disappoint. ""Sleeper Cell,"" a Showtime series about an undercover F.B.I. agent who infiltrates a Muslim terrorist cell in Los Angeles, is a spookier, subtler thriller. But ""24"" still provides an irresistible blend of iPodish computer wizardry and ""Perils of Pauline"" cliffhanger suspense.Fox asked critics to swear a blood oath not to reveal the plot of the first 10 minutes of the four-hour premiere that will be shown in two parts on Sunday and Monday nights, and even most spoiler Web sites have shown admirable restraint. But obviously, dire things happen, leaving many lives and national security at stake. Bauer, who last season saved the nation from a cataclysmic nuclear attack and then had to fake his own death to avoid extradition to China, is the one man who can save the day, or in this case, Day 5.This countdown clock begins ticking at 7 a.m., 18 months after the end of Day 4. (Each episode takes place over one hour of a 24-hour day that ends at the conclusion of the season.) Bauer, who is still officially dead, has assumed a new identity as Frank, an oil rig worker who lives in Mojave, Calif., with a girlfriend, Diane (Connie Britton), and her surly teenage son, Derek (Brady Corbet).There has been considerable turnover at Bauer's old office in the Los Angeles branch of the counterterrorism unit, but fortunately, the best computer savant, Chloe (Mary Lynn Rajskub), is still hard at work in the unit, and she remains as delightfully irritable and awkward as ever. This season, she has a suitor, of sorts, yet even romance does not soften her demeanor. And she is still willing to break rules to decode and reroute all kinds of computer data to help Bauer.'"

Volkert Jr. of Superior Court in Essex County, N.J., has been friends with the Alitos for two decades. ""She knows a little about music, a little about art. She's very active in sports and has been active in the community.""And the role that she plays in life is that she has stayed home and raised two beautiful children, and of course been there for him.""That role, being there for her husband, is certainly the one Mrs. Alito has played at the hearing. She has sat behind him all week, a pleasant-looking woman in sensible clothes, peering through rimless glasses as Democrats grilled Judge Alito about his investments and his affiliation with a conservative Princeton alumni group and Republicans tried to provide him some relief.On Wednesday, one of those Republicans, Mr. Graham, tried to mock the Democrats with a question about the alumni group, which opposed affirmative action.""Are you really a closet bigot?"" Mr. Graham asked, at which point Mrs. Alito drew her hands to her face and left the hearing room weeping.On Thursday, the judge's sister Rosemary Alito said her sister-in law took Mr. Graham's comments as they were intended, as a message of support.""Martha understood them to be kind comments,"" Ms. Alito said. ""It was that expression of warmth, the feeling of support for Sam, that triggered an emotional response.""The tears, in turn, triggered a political response, as Democrats faced questions about whether they had been too hard on the judge and whether it would hurt them.""I stand by my questions,"" Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip, said. ""I think when the president admonished us to be dignified I believe we were in the questions that were asked. It's true that we asked some difficult questions, some hard questions that went to very important issues. But this is a lifetime appointment, and we have one chance for the American people to get to know Sam Alito.""Friends say Mrs. Alito is hardly a shrinking violet, and she is not especially given to tears.""She's a caring person, a very empathetic person,"" Ms. Volkert said. ""But she is not a wilting person. Anybody that knows Martha knows that Martha stands on her own.""She and her husband are said to have much in common, including the same ""wicked sense of humor,"" a close friend, Judith Hammerschmidt, said.But if Judge Alito is quiet and reserved to the point of seeming almost nerdy, Mrs. Alito is the couple's public face, effervescent and outgoing. She talks to strangers. He does not.""They complement each other,"" Ms. Hammerschmidt said. ""He's calming for her, and she's socializing for him.""Born Martha-Ann Bomgardner in Fort Knox, Ky., Mrs. Alito, 52, is an only child. Her father was an air traffic controller in the Air Force. Her mother was a librarian at the bases where the Bomgardner family lived.Mrs. Alito graduated from the University of Kentucky with a bachelor's in comparative literature in 1976 and a master's in library sciences in 1977. She met her husband-to-be in the late 70's, when he was an assistant United States attorney in New Jersey and she was a law librarian in the office. She told friends that she knew instantly that they would wed.""After meeting Sam, after about 20 minutes, she said, 'I'm going to marry this man,' "" Ms. Volkert said.The two did not court right away. Despite frequent visits to the library, Judge Alito did not ask her for a date for more than a year. In August 1981, he moved to Washington to work for the Justice Department under President Ronald Reagan.The future Mrs. Alito eventually followed, also working for the Justice Department as a law librarian, though Rosemary Alito said the two did not live together.They married in 1985. After the couple had children, Philip, now a student at the University of Virginia, and Laura, now a high school senior, Mrs. Alito left her career.Aside from substitute teaching, she teaches religious education classes at her church and raises money for her daughter's swim team, friends and neighbors said. Last year, the Alitos were hosts for a pasta party for the team.Michael Giordano of West Caldwell, N.J., who once coached Little League with Judge Alito, said Mrs. Alito was extremely organized, kind of a go-to person at the games.""If ever anything was needed, she was going to run right up and take the bull by the horns,"" Mr. Giordano said. ""Who's going to bring the Gatorade? Who's going to deliver the uniforms? Who's going to make phone calls?""One thing that Mrs. Alito does not do, friends say, is talk politics. Yet Steve Trivino, coach of Laura Alito's swim team, said Mrs. Alito was well aware of the hearings' risks, adding that the couple were ""ready and knew what was going to happen.""On Thursday, with her husband's participation at long last over, Mrs. Alito walked out of the hearing room and gave a quick hug to Mr. Graham.

"'06-01-13,'0','BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan, Jan. 12 - Human Rights Watch and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees voiced concern this week over the fate of four refugees who fled violence in Uzbekistan last summer.The four men were granted refugee status by the United Nations after they fled Uzbekistan for Kyrgyzstan in May following an uprising in the Uzbek city of Andijon. Witnesses said hundreds of people fled the city after government troops ended the uprising by shooting hundreds of unarmed protesters.Uzbekistan is seeking the extradition of the four men, whom it accuses of killing a regional prosecutor during the violence. Under pressure from Uzbekistan to honor its request, Kyrgyzstan's Committee of Migration and Employment, which is responsible for refugees, has asked Kyrgyz courts to invalidate their refugee status and approve extradition, said lawyers for the men, identified as Yakub Tashbayev, Rasul Pirmatov, Jakhongir Maksudov, and Odiljan Rakhimov.The decision by the United Nations agency to consider the men refugees ""was made after a thorough review of all the circumstances surrounding their cases,"" including the criminal charges against them, according to a news release issued by the agency on Monday.Human Rights Watch issued a statement about the case on Thursday. ""The Uzbek government's promises not to torture these men are not worth the paper they're written on,"" Holly Cartner, the group's Europe and Central Asia director, was quoted as saying.Human Rights Watch says that Kyrgyzstan is bound by both the 1951 United Nations refugee convention and other treaties against torture not to return the men to Uzbekistan.Under a 1993 multilateral agreement known as the Minsk Convention, however, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and other former Soviet republics are obligated to provide legal assistance and extradition to other signatory countries.'"

""I think our answer, our view, is that waterfowl biologists who know the area have essentially all said that a core goose molting area needs to be protected without fragmentation.""Though 242,000 acres of the 389,000 can have no surface structures except pipelines, Mr. Senner said, the lines and the human monitoring they require will intrude in areas the birds have had to themselves.The final decision, which the Interior Department released on Wednesday, opens seven tracts, of 45,000 to 60,000 acres each, that were previously off limits to energy development.""We believe that we have put forward the best environmentally sensitive approach we could take in terms of conducting a viable oil and gas leasing and development opportunity,"" Mr. Bisson said in an interview. ""I can't think of anything else we could do to make it more environmentally protective than we have.""He added that for the areas north of Teshekpuk Lake, the department would not allow exceptions to its restrictions except for aircraft that have to deviate from agreed-on flight patterns for passengers' safety .Dora Nukapigak, one of 450 residents of Nuiqsut, an Inupiat village near the affected area, said she was certain that the policy reversal would have a significant impact.""Where there's industry, there's going to be traffic, work and construction,"" Ms. Nukapigak said,The 200 or so hunters in the village, she added, pursue whales and caribou, as well as fish, and she expressed concern that taking water from Teshekpuk and other lakes to build ice roads for winter construction could affect all the animals involved.Mr. Bisson said his estimates of the commercially retrievable oil and the 3.2 trillion cubic feet of retrievable natural gas were based on federal and company data. The estimates, he said, indicate that a compromise reached by Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary in the Clinton administration, that opened all but 13 percent of the reserve to energy production left as much as three-quarters of the recoverable oil in the reserve off limits to drilling.Mr. Bisson said there would be no more than 300 acres with improvements like roads, drilling pads or airstrips in each lease tract. Mr. Senner said the resulting spider web would be intrusive.""We don't think the basic geometry of the areas makes sense,"" Mr. Senner said, referring to the 242,000 acres where surface development other than pipelines is off limits. ""This will not result in fewer facilities or reduced disturbance.""'"

"'06-01-13,'0','Third, intellect: Judge Alito's intellect is of a very high order. He is brilliant. He is highly analytical and meticulous and careful in his comments and his written work. He is a wonderful partner in dialogue. He will think of things that his colleagues have missed. He is not doctrinaire but rather is open to differing views and will often change his mind in light of the views of a colleague.Contrary to some reports, Sam does not dissent often. According to our court statistics, in the last six years, he has dissented only 16 times, a little over two cases per year. That's the same number that I have dissented and fewer than a number of our colleagues. In my view, Sam Alito has the intellect to sit on the Supreme Court. I know all of its members. I've known -- I know them reasonably well. And in my view he will be a strong and independent justice, his own man. Finally, Sam's intellect is not abstract but practical. He does not mistake the obscure for the profound.Fourth, approach to the law: As I address this topic, I am acutely aware of the deep concern of the members of the committee about this subject. I am also aware that my role here is to testify to fact, not to opinion. And hence I will express neither normative or predictive judgments. The Sam Alito that I have sat with for 15 years is not an ideologue. He's not a movement person. He's a real judge deciding each case on the facts and the law, not on his personal views, whatever they may be. He scrupulously adheres to precedent. I have never seen him exhibit a bias against any class of litigation or litigants.MR. KIRSANOW -- One would expect that if someone were out of the mainstream that, by definition, he would rarely agree with his colleagues on the Third Circuit and, moreover, you'd expect that he'd almost never agree with his Democratic colleagues and would vote overwhelmingly with his Republican colleagues.But an examination of Judge Alito's extensive record on the Third Circuit shows that his co-panelists on civil rights cases actually agreed with his written opinions and votes 94 percent of the time, and that's whether or not those panelists were Republican or Democrat; and, in fact, produced unanimous decisions 90 percent of the time.Moreover, judges appointed by Democratic presidents actually agreed with Judge Alito's civil rights positions at a slightly higher rate than his Republican colleagues, by a margin of 96 percent to 92 percent. In fact, judges appointed by Democratic Presidents Johnson, Carter and Clinton agreed with Judge Alito's civil rights position at the same or slightly higher rate than judges appointed by President Reagan or either Presidents Bush.Obviously, in order to thoroughly assess Judge Alito's civil rights cases you have to look at the actual facts and applicable law in each case. But it cannot be credibly stated that Judge Alito is hostile to civil rights, out of the mainstream or extreme without leveling the same charges against every other judge on the court, whether Republican or Democrat.PROFESSOR ISSACHAROFF -- While the basic principle of one person, one vote may now be so deeply embedded in our culture as to seemingly defy any controversy, its implementation was another matter, and I think that's what's significant about these cases.Those whose votes were discounted to the point of irrelevance were repeatedly frustrated by entrenched political power. The intervention of the Supreme Court was indispensable. Indeed, it was the single most successful remedial effort by the Supreme Court in our history. It changed and made fundamentally more democratic the legislative process and it made the legislative process one that was deserving of judicial deference.When I teach these cases today to students, however, and even when I was a law student in the early 1980's, the idea of one person, one vote appears so elemental, so in keeping with the most rudimentary sense of democracy and legitimacy that students cannot even fathom that a society, a democratic society, could be organized on any other basis.I do not know how a young college student in 1970 might have reacted, particularly when presented with the formidable writings of Alexander Bickel. Bickel captured well the tension between a commitment to popular sovereignty and the overriding commands of the Constitution. And it is well to remember that although we turn our attention here to the court, it is obviously the Congress that is a significant and major institution expanding our democratic horizons, as with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.Nonetheless, I would suggest that the fact that the reapportionment cases should appear on a job application in the 1980's is at least a curiosity. Perhaps it was the recounting of an intellectual path, but perhaps an indication of a continuing view that courts have no business in checking the abuses of political power. If it is the latter, it should be deeply troubling to this committee and to the Senate.PROFESSOR LIU -- Most of the counterexamples cited in these hearings are not terribly illuminating. The constitutional violations were clear; the holdings were unanimous. In the contested cases, Judge Alito agreed with the government over 90 percent of the time, far more often than other appellate judges in similar cases, even those appointed by Republican presidents. Now these figures are not dispositive. Every case is different, and I'm sure Judge Alito got it right many times. But let me give three examples that show his instinct, I think, to defer to government power.The first is a memo he wrote in 1984 as assistant to the solicitor general, analyzing a case where police saw a burglary suspect running across a backyard. The suspect reached a fence, and an officer called out: ""Police! Halt!"" When the suspect tried to climb the fence, the officer shot him in the back of the head, killing him. The suspect, Edward Garner, was an eighth grader with a stolen purse and $10 on his body. He was not armed, and the officer did not think he was. The sole reason for his killing was to prevent his escape.Judge Alito's memo, speaking for no one but himself, said, ""I think the shooting can be justified as reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment."" In a remarkable passage, he argued that using deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect rests on, and I quote, ""the general principle that the state is justified in using whatever force is necessary to enforce its laws."" In 1985, the Supreme Court rejected this view.Second, in a 2004 case, the F.B.I. installed a secret video camera in a suspect's hotel room. This was done without a warrant on the ground that the F.B.I. turned on the camera only when the target allowed an undercover informant into the room. Judge Alito accepted this logic, even though the camera remained in the room day and night. The dissent called the surveillance Orwellian, limited only by the government's self-imposed restraint. Judge Alito seemed not to grasp that the concept of a warrant puts a judge between the citizen and the police precisely because our privacy is too precious to entrust to law enforcement alone. The N.S.A. program of warrantless eavesdropping is also being defended by assurances of executive self-restraint.Finally, in 1997 there was a capital case where two Reagan appointees, both former prosecutors, found a misleading jury instruction unconstitutional. Judge Alito said the instruction was ambiguous and inadvisable, but adequate to convict the defendant of first degree murder. He also said the court should not have heard the claim at all, because defense lawyers did not argue it in prior appeals. But the state never raised this argument to the inmate's claim; Judge Alito raised it himself. The court chided him for nearly crossing the line between a judge and an advocate.'"
"'06-01-14,'0','What Mr. Sigal discovered may be happening to other taxpayers this year. The most feared surprise tucked into the tax code is being socked with the alternative minimum tax, a tax intended to hit the very richest but that now applies to the middle-class taxpayer. But as home prices have risen so sharply in cities across America over the last five years, more homeowners may find themselves paying a bit more in taxes than they had anticipated because they keep a home office. They also might find themselves confused.The I.R.S. allows you to take a home office deduction if you meet certain conditions, and about 30 million taxpayers manage to meet them. The rules are pretty clear for the self-employed. The home office has to be the primary place of business, used exclusively and regularly for that business. If your office fits that definition, you can write off a percentage of the utilities, the mortgage, repairs and maintenance and, of course, all the office equipment and furniture stuffed into it.But for those who work for a company, some accountants see only a little wiggle room. If your employer provides an office for you, but you choose to work at home, you cannot use the home office deduction. You cannot write off an office even if it is used strictly to manage your stock portfolio, but you could if you were a day trader. If your employer's office is closed on weekends or does not have air-conditioning in the summer or heat in the winter on those weekends, you still cannot claim a home office, according to many -- but not all -- tax accountants contacted for this article.There is a lot of gray area when dealing with tax regulation, accountants said. But what is crystal clear is that when you sell your home for a profit you have to recapture the depreciation you took on that office and pay taxes on it. For example, say you bought a house for $500,000 and used 10 percent of it for an office. (You figure that out by measuring the square footage of the office and dividing that by the square footage of the entire house.) You are allowed to depreciate 10 percent of the purchase price of the house each year using what the government succinctly calls the ""39-year commercial property straight time depreciation schedule."" That adds up to about $6,000 in depreciation over five years.You later sell the house for $750,000. The $250,000 in profit is excluded from tax. But the $6,000 you took in depreciation over the years must be reported as a gain on Schedule D, in the gains and losses section. It is taxed at a 25 percent rate.What if you take other home office deductions and skip the depreciation? Nancy Mathis, an I.R.S. spokeswoman, says that will not help. ""Even if you don't take this depreciation, it will be treated as if you did when it comes times for calculating the basis of the home sale and capital gains exclusion."" The I.R.S. will not say why it makes that assumption, but accountants surmise it is because the government cannot keep track of home-office owners who might depreciate some years and then stop right before selling in hopes of avoiding the extra tax.Here's something to think about: If you rent, you avoid this entire frustration when claiming a home office deduction.Now for the more complicated question: Remember that the government allows a single person to exclude $250,000 of capital gains on a home sale and a married couple, $500,000. If you claimed 10 percent of your home as a home office and wrote that off over the years, when you sell the house, do you owe capital gains tax on 10 percent of the profit? This is what is tripping up Mr. Sigal, the chemical engineer.The government used to say, you owe the tax on the portion of the residence that is used for commercial purposes. But it gave taxpayers a little gift when a new rule took effect in 2002. The home office inside the structure of your house is no longer considered commercial property. Everything is covered under the capital gains exclusion. If your accountant is not up to date on that, ask him or her to check it out.Indeed, Mr. Sigal does not owe as much as he was told and a new accountant confirmed that he owes taxes on only the $2,000 of recaptured depreciation.But in changing the rules, the I.R.S. also made things more complicated. Funny how that happens. That no-tax rule applies only if the home office is part of the structure of the main residence. ""If it is a separate building,"" said David Gitel, a New York City tax accountant, ""you are out of luck."" When you work out of a detached garage or shed, you must compute the profit that is attributable to that structure and pay a capital gains tax of 15 percent on it, plus the tax on the depreciation recapture.In that case, what you can do is make what is called a 1031 exchange. Don't do it without guidance from an accountant, but buy another piece of commercial property within 190 days and you can avoid paying taxes.Given how complicated it is, many people might ask whether it is worth the bother to deduct a home office on Schedule C, the form for private businesses. Would it be easier to just write off most of the expenses as nonreimbursable business expenses on Schedule A?Matt Ryan, a certified public accountant with Blair Accounting Services in Lombard, Ill., said the home office deduction might be best avoided. It raises your accountant's bill and might raise your audit exposure. ""There is an added compliance cost,"" he said. (There is mixed opinion among accountants whether a home office deduction is a red flag to tax auditors, but the I.R.S. said it was not cracking down on home office deductions.)You probably are deducting your interest payments and your property taxes on Schedule A anyway. The benefit to using Schedule C -- you'll need two other forms, 8829 and 4562 -- is that the mortgage, the taxes and other costs of running the home office decrease the income you made from your home-run business. That means there is less that is assessed the 15.3 percent self-employed Social Security tax. ""You get more out of it on Schedule C,"" Mr. Gitel said.But if you don't qualify for a home office, Schedule A is the place to deduct business expenses. A good tax accountant will make easy work of this. Tax software, like the Premier edition of TurboTax, can doit, too, and will also walk you through the process of depreciation recapture in a series of interview questions.You can deduct other things if you have a home business. In addition to a share of utility bills, you can deduct an extra phone line, any business equipment you buy or the business use of the car.You can hire your spouse as an employee and provide medical insurance. He or she puts you on her medical plan and your business swallows the cost as a business expense, reducing your taxable income. Retirement accounts for private businesses are also quite generous and another good way to shield income.As for Mr. Sigal, he has a home office in his new condo. But this time he is cutting his taxes by deducting business expenses that were not reimbursed by his employer.'"
"'06-01-14,'0','""I don't think this is over yet,"" said Bruce Nudell, who follows the industry for Sanford C. Bernstein. He said he expected Boston Scientific to come back with another bid.At stake in the takeover battle is Guidant's share of the $10 billion market for implantable heart devices like defibrillators. The acquirer will also pick up valuable technology in another major device business: the $5 billion market for coronary stents that prop open arteries that feed blood to the heart.Guidant has consistently favored Johnson & Johnson's offers over higher bids from Boston Scientific because their merger, first arranged in December 2004, has cleared potential regulatory hurdles. It could close immediately after the shareholder vote at the end of the month.""This agreement with Johnson & Johnson provides significant financial value and certainty for shareholders,"" said James M. Cornelius, the chairman and chief executive of Guidant, in a statement issued jointly with Johnson & Johnson last night.By contrast, Boston Scientific first entered the bidding a month ago, and its deal could not close before the end of March at the earliest. In addition, Guidant and some analysts say the Boston Scientific bid could run into antitrust or other legal hurdles that could make it hard to project the value of the stock portion of its bid.Whoever ends up owning Guidant will also face questions about whether the prize is worth the price. While Guidant would immediately begin adding to revenue, it could be some time before the buyer would see an increase in profit from the large investment.Guidant's jewel is its lucrative position in defibrillators and other heart-regulating implants, the largest sector of the medical device market and one of the fastest growing.But the company lost market share last year after disclosures of product defects associated with at least seven deaths, related product recalls and negative publicity about its failure to promptly disclose its problems. Those problems led Johnson & Johnson to force Guidant in November to renegotiate their original merger terms down to $63.08 from $76 a share.The year ended with Guidant having roughly 25 percent of the market and still ranked second to Medtronic, but questions abound about how quickly -- if ever -- Guidant can regain the 35 percent to 40 percent share it previously held.Analysts following the back-and-forth struggle generally say they believe that Boston Scientific is a better strategic fit with Guidant, but that does not mean it can afford an all-out fight with Johnson & Johnson.Boston Scientific, based in Natick, Mass., had revenue last year of about $6.28 billion. Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., sells drug and consumer health care items in addition to devices and had revenue last year of more than $50 billion.Boston Scientific shareholders have become restless as growth in its blockbuster drug-coated Taxus stent leveled off last year because it will be several years before other products in its pipeline can hope to pick up the slack. Merging with Guidant would provide immediate growth opportunities and reduce its dependence on Taxus.As a result, many analysts and investors forecast that Boston Scientific's stock will rise after the merger, further rewarding Guidant shareholders who receive it.Boston Scientific's $73-a-share offer Thursday night would give Guidant shareholders $36.50 in cash and $36.50 worth of stock for each share.""Boston Scientific's shares go higher every time the market thinks it's going to win,"" said Matthew Halbower, portfolio manager of Deephaven Capital Management in Minnetonka, Minn., who said his fund was one of Guidant's 10 largest shareholders.Mr. Halbower said that in his view Guidant could have a much more positive impact on Boston Scientific than on Johnson and Johnson, so Deephaven will vote against Johnson & Johnson's latest offer.Johnson & Johnson, which is suffering from lackluster growth prospects in pharmaceuticals, its biggest business, could also benefit from Guidant's near-term growth potential. And it is just as eager as Boston Scientific to get into the heart implant business.But Johnson & Johnson's investors are generally more risk averse than Boston Scientific's, and analysts say the company has been under more pressure to show that it is a disciplined acquirer unwilling to overpay for growth.Johnson & Johnson's revised bid was the fourth improvement this week in the choices dangled before Guidant's shareholders. The bidding began in earnest Sunday evening when Boston Scientific, having completed its investigation of Guidant's books and operations, announced that it would go through with its preliminary offer of $72 a share in cash and stock, with a total value of roughly $25 billion.At the same time, Boston Scientific said it had an agreement for Abbott Laboratories to pay $3.2 billion for two Guidant divisions that overlap with Boston Scientific operations. That move, Boston Scientific said, should take care of any antitrust issues.Guidant's board said it would consider the offer but on Wednesday re-endorsed previously announced plans to merge with Johnson & Johnson after that company agreed to sweeten the terms of their agreement from $64 a share to just over $68 with a stock and cash combination valued that day at $23.2 billion.On Thursday, Boston Scientific responded by raising its offer to $73 a share, or about $25 billion, and introducing revisions aimed at reducing Guidant's concerns that its deal could take many months to close.Boston Scientific also promised to pay 1.2 cents a Guidant share -- the equivalent of 6 percent interest -- for each day's delay beyond March 31 in completing a merger. And Boston Scientific imposed a deadline of 4 p.m. yesterday for Guidant to respond.The deadline came and went without any public response.Shareholders anticipating a higher offer sent Guidant shares up 44 cents, to $70.84. Johnson & Johnson shares fell 39 cents, to $61.82. Boston Scientific rose 15 cents, to $25.20Boston Scientific's plans to sell virtually all of Guidant's operations outside of the electrical implants to Abbott introduced a wild card into the guessing game about what happens next.Abbott, which has been slowly making its way into devices, would become a major force in the industry under Boston Scientific's plan and may have a strong incentive to help Boston Scientific finance a higher counterbid.""I think Boston and Abbott have one more shot in them,"" said Mr. Nudell of Sanford C. Bernstein, ""probably raising the cash part of their bid.""But Mr. Nudell said Johnson & Johnson might decide to go higher not just to gain Guidant's assets but to keep them out of Boston Scientific and Abbott's hands.""I think that's driving them now,"" Mr. Nudell said. ""And they have the money to spend until the cows come home.""'"

HCA projected a profit of 72 cents to 76 cents a share for the fourth quarter and $3.17 to $3.21 a share for the year ended Dec. 31. Wall Street analysts have forecast earnings of 65 cents a share for the quarter and $3 for the year, according to Thomson Financial. Stock in HCA, which is based in Nashville, rose $1.75, or 3.6 percent, to $50.94. The quarter's forecast includes a pretax gain on an asset sale of $49 million, which will bolster profit by 4 cents a share, and a reduction in estimated liability insurance reserves of $47 million, which will help earnings by another 7 cents a share. The estimate also reflects hurricane-related costs of about $27 million, which will reduce earnings by 4 cents a share.

(BLOOMBERG NEWS)Samsung Posts 40% Increase in Quarterly Profit The Samsung Electronics Company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit rose 40 percent, helped by strong demand for flat-panel TV's and semiconductors. Samsung, South Korea's biggest company and the world's largest memory chip maker, said it earned 2.56 trillion won ($2.6 billion) in the three months through December, up from 1.83 trillion won in the period a year earlier, the first gain in five quarters. Sales rose 12 percent, to 15.52 trillion won ($15.9 billion). The strong earnings results were a result of growth in the TV segment, particularly large televisions, and semiconductors, Woosik Chu, senior vice president for investor relations, told analysts on a conference call. Samsung makes its own flat-panel televisions and is a major supplier of the liquid-crystal displays used in other manufacturers' TV sets, as well as in laptops and cellphones.

"'06-01-14,'0','WENGEN, Switzerland, Jan. 13 - Bode Miller was back to his usual self Friday, a day after making a sheepish apology for his comments about skiing while impaired by alcohol. He skied brilliantly, made an error and picked a fight with the biggest authority figure on the mountain. Twice.Miller was seconds away from handily winning a World Cup combined when he caught the tip of his ski on a gate near the end of his slalom race. He continued, finishing ahead of the rest of the field by more than a second, but was promptly disqualified for the infraction.Miller then had a hair-splitting argument, contending that he had not actually straddled the gate but had stepped on it. He parsed the rulebook wording, presented a dent on his ski as Exhibit A, and gleefully ran over to present his case to Günter Hujara, the chief race director for the International Ski Federation.""Bode is a smart guy, and I respect him very much,"" said Hujara, who has tangled with him many times during Miller's eight-year career on the circuit.

"'06-01-14,'0','This revolution in asylum law has not been widely recognized outside a very small group of asylum practitioners, and neither has Judge Alito gotten a whole lot of credit for garnering the votes of both of his fellow panelists for this decision, one of whom was a Nixon appointee.PROFESSOR CHEMERINSKY -- The key question for this committee is whether Samuel Alito will continue this tradition of enforcing checks and balances, or whether he'll be a rubber stamp for presidential power.I have carefully read the writings, the speeches and the decisions of Samuel Alito in this area, and they all point in one direction: a very troubling pattern of great deference to executive authority. I've closely followed the hearings this week, and I know you're familiar with the examples.To mention just a few: In 1984, while in the solicitor general's office, Samuel Alito wrote a memo saying that he believed that the attorney general should have absolute immunity to civil suits for money damages of engaging in illegal wiretapping, a position the Supreme Court rejected in language that seems so appropriate now and saying there would be too great a danger of violation of rights from executive officials, who, in the zeal to protect national security, would go too far.The next year, he said there should be increased use of presidential signing statements. He said, quote: The president should have the last word as to the meaning of statutes. There should be an increase in executive power.As you know, in a number of writings and speeches, he said he believed in the unitary executive theory. Now, there's a good deal of discussion this week as to what that means. But if you look at the literature of constitutional law, those who believe in a unitary executive truly want a radical change in American government. They believe that independent regulatory agencies like the Securities Exchange Commission or the Federal Communication Commission are unconstitutional. They believe the special prosecutor's unconstitutional. They reject the ability of Congress to limit the executive.PROFESSOR KRONMAN -- Sam was hardworking and ferociously bright; no one, I think, would challenge that. But that wasn't the first thing that impressed me about Sam. What impressed me first and most emphatically was his generosity and gentleness. When Sam spoke, in class or out, others listened; but when others spoke, Sam listened, and not just in the superficial sense of waiting politely until they had finished, but in the deeper and more consequential sense of straining to grasp the good sense of their position and to see it in its most attractive light.Sam always spoke with modesty, but, even when he was defending a position that he believed clearly to be right, did so with the knowledge that he might be wrong. Learned Hand once described the spirit of liberty as the spirit that's not too sure of itself. That's a phrase that's always had a special meaning for me, and it well describes the quality in Sam that I noticed from the start.I noticed something else and admired something else, as well, and that was Sam's faith in the law. Sam believed in the integrity of the law and in the essential fairness of its processes. Anyone who has studied the law knows that it is not a mechanical system. It requires moral judgments at many points.But there is all the difference in the world between a person who approaches the law from the outside and views it an instrument for the advancement of some program, of one kind or another and a person who approaches it from the inside and whose fundamental leading allegiance is to the law itself. Sam falls clearly in that second category.PROFESSOR FRIED -- The Reagan administration, no doubt, had a point of view about the law, just as did the F.D.R. administration in 1933 or the J.F.K. administration in 1961. That is not unusual. That's what elections are about. Part of that view encompassed the notion that the lower courts had gone too far in limiting the ability of law enforcement; that the lower courts had moved too far away from an appropriate view of affirmative action, as expressed by Justice Powell in Bakke, towards quotas; and, I suppose, emblematic of the notion that courts sometimes just make things up was the notion that Roe v. Wade was incorrectly decided -- a notion, which, may I say, was shared by people across the political spectrum: -- Professor Paul Freund; Archibald Cox expressed that view as late as 1985; and Dean Ely.Now, the first job of the staff of the solicitor general's office was to make sure that when the solicitor general presented the solicitor general's client's position to the Supreme Court this was done in a professional, correct and respectful way. That office had career lawyers, some of whom stretched back to the time of Lyndon Johnson. I, myself, appointed as deputies people who I knew to be Democrats -- liberal Democrats. None of that bothered me or bothered them because we were a professional office and they understood that their work was professional work. That is exactly how Judge Alito viewed his work.PROFESSOR TRIBE -- It is quite clear that there are two central concerns in the country and in the Senate with respect to this nomination. And they do not relate, honestly, to what a truly admirable collegial, modest, thoughtful and brilliant fellow Sam Alito is. I don't mean to call him Sam, I don't really know him the way that my colleague Charles does.They relate to whether Justice Alito might, by casting a decisive fifth vote on many cases, narrow the scope of personal liberty, especially for women, and broaden the scope of presidential power at a time when we see, dramatically, the dangers of an unfettered executive by weakening the ability of both Congress and the courts to restrict presidential assertions of authority.A word first about liberty: It is certainly true that in the solicitor general's office the memorandum that Judge Alito wrote for the solicitor general did not urge that the court be confronted frontally, overrule Roe. But he made it clear even then that the strategy he thought wise to pursue was a step-by-step process toward the ultimate goal of overruling Roe. That is the only prospect on the table.I assure you that if the Supreme Court actually overrules Roe, I will have thousands of students to tell that I predicted the wrong thing. That's not the danger. They won't say Roe v. Wade is hereby overruled. What they will do -- and I'm saying will because I am assuming that confirmation will occur. Maybe it won't. But with the vote of Judge Alito as Justice Alito the court will cut back on Roe v. Wade, step by step. Not just to the point where, as the moderate American center has it, abortion is cautiously restricted, but to the point where the fundamental underlying right to liberty becomes a hollow shell.MS. MICHELMAN -- Predicting how any given judge will decide any given case is a Washington parlor game, in my view, that distracts from the central issue. That issue is whether we any longer will recognize limits on the government's authority to reach into the most intimate areas of our private lives.There is nothing in Judge Alito's lengthy public record to suggest that he recognizes such limits for anyone and even less so for women. And there is much in his record that indicates, I think, clearly and beyond the boundaries of reasonable dispute that he rejects the idea of privacy, personal privacy as a fundamental American ideal.A woman's right to choose is a powerful manifestation of privacy, but it is one right among many and all of them should concern us. There is no sense in Judge Alito's writings or rulings that privacy is a fundamental constitutional right. In his record, not only are individuals often powerless against the prerogatives of the state, individuals are more often than not simply absent altogether.In many ways, what Judge Alito has written is less disturbing that what he omits, any sense of how his legal rulings bear on real people whose lives are shaped by his decisions. When he ruled that a Pennsylvania law requiring women to notify their husbands before obtaining an abortion was not, quote, an undue burden, there was no sense that a woman like me ever existed or even mattered. When he wrote that commonly used methods of birth control could be classified as methods of abortion, there was no indication he considered the women who would be forced into unwanted pregnancies.MR. WHITE -- In order to provide some context for my comments, I'd like to share some personal information about myself. I'm the son of African-American parents born in the segregated South. Their respect for the recognition of civil liberties that enabled them to succeed and raise principled children inculcated the same respect in me. This respect is what led me to become a member of the N.A.A.C.P. and the A.C.L.U.The same respect for our freedoms as Americans encouraged me to serve our country, after graduating from West Point, on active duty in the United States Army.Now, as I clerked for Judge Alito, I saw a deep sense of duty, diligence, humanity and respect for his role as a federal appellate judge. Judge Alito required searching analysis of the factual and procedural background of every case. He required thorough evaluation of the applicable law in every case. He required -- he -- he uniformly applied the relevant law to the specific facts of every case.Judge Alito recognized that every case was the most important case to the parties and attorneys with something at stake. There was no wavering from this consistent, predictable method of his judicial decision-making process. Working for Judge Alito, I saw in him an abiding loyalty to a fair judicial process, as opposed to an enslaved inclination toward a personal or ideological -- or to a political or personal ideology.What I found most intriguing and particularly exceptional about Judge Alito's judicial decision-making process was the conspicuous absence of personal predilections. I never witnessed an occasion when personal or ideological beliefs motivated a specific outcome in a case. Indeed, after a year of working closely with the judge on cases concerning a wide variety of legal issues, I left New Jersey without knowing Judge Alito's personal beliefs on any of them.MR. SHAW -- I want to be very clear because one of the members of this committee raised the issue of whether anyone was alleging that Judge Alito harbors a bias. I want to be very clear at the Legal Defense Fund -- on behalf of the Legal Defense Fund -- that we are not saying that he harbors racial bias or that he's a racist. That would, as I indicated before, diminish all of us.Whatever his reason for ruling the way he does in cases, the record is consistently clear, as my colleague and friend Reginald Turner has indicated and as our report has indicated. It is very difficult for African-American plaintiffs in civil rights cases to prevail. Now it's not limited to African-American plaintiffs, but those are the individuals whom we represent at the Legal Defense Fund. Certainly his view of the interpretation of civil rights laws extends to gender discrimination, some of the cases of which we've highlighted in our report. And it extends to other areas with respect to individual rights.Now, we believe that his views, with respect to reapportionment, which have been aired here are deeply troubling. We believe in the area of criminal justice, his views are troubling. But I particularly want to point to an area about which we have a deep concern.The analogy with baseball has been very popular -- and I want to end on this point -- before this committee and in these nominations. And Judge Alito at one time used to like to say about affirmative action that Henry Aaron would not be regarded as the all-time home run king and hero that he is if the fences had been moved in whenever he came to bat.I think that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding about affirmative action. The issue, with respect to civil rights and affirmative action advocates, is not asking -- is not about asking that the fences be moved in. It's about asking about an opportunity to take the field, to stand at the plate. It's about opportunity to play the game.'"
"'06-01-14,'0','MADRID, Jan. 13 - The United States will not allow Spain to sell military aircraft with American technology to Venezuela, saying the sale would aid the increasingly ""antidemocratic"" government of President Hugo Chávez and would destabilize the region, the American Embassy announced Friday.The Spanish government, led by Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, said it regretted the decision, but vowed to move forward with the deal after acquiring the necessary technology elsewhere.Under the accord, which was signed in November, Spain agreed to sell Venezuela 12 transport airplanes and 8 patrol boats for about 1.7 billion euros, or $2 billion.Because the airplanes, which are not yet built, were to contain American technology, Spain was required to obtain a license from Washington before completing the sale. Neither Spanish nor American officials would describe the technology.In rejecting Spain's request, American officials said the sale amounted to support for an oppressive government that threatened to spread instability.'"
"'06-01-14,'0','After she met for contract talks with city officials, Lillian Roberts, the executive director of the largest municipal union, declared yesterday that if the Bloomberg administration wants concessions on health premiums, it should negotiate them with all the municipal unions together, not just with hers.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has suggested that the city would ask the municipal unions, including the one Ms. Roberts leads, District Council 37, for concessions on health insurance similar to the groundbreaking ones that the transit workers' union accepted in its settlement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency.

"'06-01-14,'0','The expansion of low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines into more markets has forced traditional carriers, including American Airlines and United Airlines, to reduce fares, including those of business travelers. The Internet, which allows travelers to comparison shop far more effectively than in the past, helps, too. And financially desperate carriers, led by Delta Air Lines, abandoned past pricing models in hopes of avoiding collapse.Bob Harrell, principal in Harrell Associates, said domestic business fares fell about a third from their peak in 2000 and, despite recent increases, are still down 20 percent to 25 percent from the peak.For instance, one-way last-minute tickets on American Airlines from Boston to Dallas were 50 percent cheaper early last month than a year earlier, or $599 versus $1,193, Mr. Harrell said. United's one-way business fares from Chicago to Los Angeles fell 69 percent in that period, to $316 from $1,009. And Continental Airlines reduced its Houston-to-San Francisco one-way business fare 68 percent, to $319 from $999, according to Mr. Harrell.Over time, airline executives hope the new pricing will stimulate demand for travel and produce a more sustainable revenue base for an industry known for volatility.The airlines, said Michael Allen, a managing director at Back Aviation Solutions, a consulting firm in New Haven, ""were offending the traveling public by having such high walk-up fares."" His firm counts far fewer very high fares. The percentage of domestic city pairs -- heavily traveled routes, Dallas to New York, for instance, -- with average round-trip fares (including the cheapest and the most expensive seats) of more than $500 hit nearly 16 percent in 2000. But since then, it has plunged to less than 6 percent, according to Back Aviation.More people are able to travel at prices some regard as the reasonable middle range of fares -- $200 to $400 for a round-trip ticket. About half of domestic tickets were sold in that price range in the late 1990's, according to Back Aviation. Beginning in 2001, however, more seats fell into that middle range. And by the second quarter of 2005, more than 70 percent of tickets sold for $200 to $400, Mr. Allen said.After a sharp decline, fares on average began to rise again last May, according to figures compiled by the Air Transport Association, an airline industry trade group. Bankrupt airlines are now trimming the size of their fleets, reducing the number of seats for passengers, so domestic fares are expected to continue upward at least through the first half of 2006. At the same time, demand remains strong. So, unless fuel prices unexpectedly soar, industry results should strengthen in 2006.A combination of fuller planes and higher fares, on average, pushed fourth-quarter 2005 airline industry revenue up about 11 percent, estimated David Strine, an analyst at Bear Stearns & Company. He expects 2006 revenue to rise about 6 percent.The question now is whether airlines, as they have in the past, will try to take advantage of a favorable supply-and-demand situation by sharply raising prices for business travelers. ""Will it turn back up when the industry gets healthy, or are we in a new world now?"" said Steve Morrison, who, as a professor and chairman of the economics department at Northeastern University, follows the gap between business and leisure fares.Mr. Morrison said he thought the traditional carriers might at this point lack the market power to reinstate a system of significantly higher business fares. ""It sure seems like the low-fare carriers are sufficiently entrenched,"" he said. ""You would think it's a new world.""With stiff competition and the Internet making prices more transparent, Mr. Morrison said the gap between the highest and lowest prices should over time continue to narrow.A gradual narrowing of the range of fares was already under way, but got a real jolt a year ago when Delta, looking for some strategy to become more competitive and avoid bankruptcy, simplified its fare structure and capped one-way fares at $499, later raised to $599. Reluctantly, most competitors in most markets followed suit, though they feared they would not attract enough additional business travelers to offset the lower prices.Delta said the move was essentially neutral to its revenue. ""It came out to be almost a wash,"" said Glen W. Hauenstein, an executive vice president. But he hopes customers will feel better about pricing that seems less capricious than in the past. ""We're kind of considered untrustworthy in some respects,"" he said.Alaska Airlines, to make its pricing easier to understand, now presents fares on its Web site in a matrix that allows customers to easily compare the lowest and highest prices on a particular flight and the restrictions that go with each fare. Southwest does, too.US Airways, which operates the shuttles between New York and Boston and Washington that are used heavily by business travelers, has long charged a relatively high price. The former low price was $248 for a round-trip ticket, purchased 21 days in advance. The airline flew its planes on those routes nearly 45 percent empty, said Scott Kirby, an executive vice president.Last month, it began offering advance purchase fares as low as $138 round trip, hoping to fill some of those seats but not wanting business travelers to fly at the reduced rate. ""We sold a bunch,"" Mr. Kirby said. He is aiming to fly planes more than 70 percent full.While business fares are coming down, some leisure fares are rising. ""The absurdly low fares -- many of them are coming out of the system,"" Mr. Kirby said. Southwest's entrance into the Philadelphia market, where US Airways holds a large share, included some $29 one-way fares. ""They were introductory -- for a year and a half,"" Mr. Kirby said grimly. He said he was pleased that Southwest raised many of those fares to $49.But as Southwest and its low-cost competitors continue expanding, some fares that today seem very high will decline. ""We're the price policeman,"" said Keith Taylor, a Southwest vice president. ""We take that role very seriously."" It charged as little as $49 one way between Dallas and St. Louis, recently entering that market, deeply undercutting American.Southwest, long before Delta's cap, had set a $299 maximum on a one-way ticket. ""They're setting the pricing ceiling in the industry,"" said Kevin Mitchell, who operates a group called the Business Travel Coalition that advocates on behalf of corporate travelers. ""They're brilliant people.""With the very high fares, airlines were discouraging last-minute business travel. ""The airlines can't measure the number of times I may have gone,"" Mr. Mitchell said.Tom McCabe, global director of travel services at PerkinElmer, a medical and industrial instruments maker based in Wellesley, Mass., said: ""The trip not taken: why worry about beating up the airline for a 10 percent or 15 percent discount? Why go at all?""'"

"'06-01-15,'0','But the payoff at the end of the mission will be well worth the wait, said Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., the mission's principal investigator and team leader.""This is in a real sense the capstone of the initial missions to explore the planets,"" Dr. Stern said. ""Pluto, its moons and this part of the solar system are such mysteries that New Horizons will rewrite all of the textbooks.""Pluto, discovered in 1930 by the astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, turns out to be the first known example of a new class of planetary bodies called ice dwarfs, Dr. Stern said. Scientists think these cold bodies, which number in the hundreds and populate a region beyond Neptune called the Kuiper Belt, represent some of the original building materials of the solar system.Dr. Stern dismisses recent debate over whether Pluto is really a planet, since it and its ilk are so different from the solar system's two other major classes of planets, the four rocky inner worlds like Earth and Mercury, and the four giant, gaseous outer planets like Jupiter and Saturn. Ice dwarfs are the most populous group of major bodies in the solar system, he said.""Just as a Chihuahua is still a dog, these ice dwarfs are still planetary bodies,"" he said. ""The misfit becomes the average. The Pluto-like objects are more typical in our solar system than the nearby planets we first knew.""Once New Horizons completes its studies of the Pluto system, it will be redirected toward one or two other Kuiper Belt objects that will be selected later.The 1,054-pound spacecraft is about the size and shape of a grand piano. It was designed and built by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., which is also managing the mission for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The program's budget is about $700 million, including launching costs and 10 years of operations.Since the mission will operate too far out to use solar power, New Horizons will draw its power from a plutonium-fueled thermoelectric generator that produces 200 watts of electricity. The use of the highly radioactive plutonium is controversial: antinuclear activists picketed the base last weekend, as they have done before other launchings of nuclear-powered spacecraft, saying a launching explosion could spread dangerous amounts of radiation.But the space agency says that a launching accident is highly unlikely and that the fuel pellets in the hardened generator are designed to limit the spread of radiation. As a precaution, emergency management teams are to be stationed around the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at launching time.William Gibson, the mission's science payload manager, said the craft's instruments included three cameras to take visible light, infrared and ultraviolet images and three spectrometers to study the composition and temperatures of Pluto's thin atmosphere and surface features. The instruments are the most compact, energy-efficient designs ever flown on a planetary mission, he said.The spacecraft also carries a University of Colorado dust counter, the first experiment to fly on a planetary mission that is entirely designed and operated by students. This is the only experiment that will not hibernate during the mission. Mission planners said New Horizons would carry some commemorative items from Earth, including an American flag, a small piece of SpaceShipOne, the first privately sponsored manned spacecraft and a CD bearing the names of 435,000 people who signed up on the mission's Web site (http://pluto.jhuapl.edu).'"

""Use Monster and professional associations and local and state job boards and other things that target what you want. But if you're spending more than 15 minutes on the Internet, you're lost.""A proliferation of new sites -- many capitalizing on search engine technology to provide job offerings from across the Internet -- are giving job seekers some new alternatives to explore.Among them are JobCentral.com, a site developed for major corporations that carries their listings as well as direct links to the companies' Web sites to apply for jobs. The board was created after executives from corporations like I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Intel began exploring ways to deal with the ever-escalating fees charged by the largest job boards.Initially, 18 companies put in $60,000 each to finance the board. Now companies pay $12,500 a year to post all their jobs, or $25 a job (compared with as much as $400 a job on a major board), said Bill Warren, executive director of the DirectEmployers Association, the corporate group behind JobCentral. It now has 182 member companies. The site also acts as a search engine, scavenging job listings from about 1,400 nonmember companies.Taking a slightly different tack are sites like Indeed.com and SimplyHired.com, which rely on search engines to aggregate a vast array of listings from newspaper classified ads, job boards, corporate sites and trade associations.The field will expand again tomorrow, when JobCentral, Indeed, SimplyHired and Google Base, a database recently introduced by the search engine company, are to announce that they are teaming up to create a national labor exchange at JobCentral.com. The site, which has about 340,000 jobs posted, will incorporate jobs found by its partners and provide the technology to let those sites link to its information. Mr. Warren, creator of the job site that later became Monster, said the alliance would result in the amassing of information on about 4.5 million jobs.""The benefit to the job applicant is that they can go to one place and basically see all the jobs on the Internet,"" Mr. Warren said.How that will affect the three major job boards -- and the state of finding jobs on the Internet -- remains to be seen.Mark Mehler, a co-founder of CareerXroads, a New Jersey company that advises companies on using technology in recruiting, said the traditional job boards might find themselves at a disadvantage. It has become expensive for companies to post employment ads on the major boards, and the number of résumés posted can be overwhelming.At the same time, he said, it remains to be seen how useful and reliable the sites that pull job listings from across the Web will be.""They key is freshness and where the job is being taken from,"" he said. Despite such problems, studies indicate that an increasing number of people are being hired through Web postings and employee referrals, rather than through traditional methods like printed want ads.In 2004, a study by CareerXroads found that 61 percent of hires by the companies surveyed came from referrals or the Internet, up from 50 percent two years earlier. According to the study findings, Monster, CareerBuilder and HotJobs accounted for 22.8 percent of the hires attributed to the Internet; corporations also reported that a high percentages of employees were hired after filing applications on corporate sites.Eric Muller, a recruiting manager with the Southern Company, an energy company based in Atlanta, says his company initially began using JobCentral because it allowed the company to post all its jobs at a lower cost and because it provided a direct link to the company's site. While the company still uses big boards like Monster and CareerBuilder, he said, they do so more strategically -- if, for instance, a job needs to be filled immediately. ""We have to have a mix,"" he said. ""I can't have all my eggs in one basket.""The same holds true for job seekers, although there are increasing questions about the wisdom of posting résumés on the Internet.""Putting a résumé on an online job site is not the smartest way to go about getting a job,"" said Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit group that educates consumers about technology and privacy.The forum put hundreds of résumés on job sites and tracked them for a year. Ms. Dixon said many were stolen by either criminals or unethical recruiters.One common ruse preys on midcareer professionals whose résumé history can be combined with a Social Security number, resulting in identity theft.""The more detailed your résumé, the easier it is to do,"" Ms. Dixon said.Job seekers who posted online said they had also had problems with employment consultants seeking to solicit business. After arranging an interview, the consultants begin making a pitch for their services, which can cost as much as $10,000.Ultimately, Ms. Christiansen found exactly what she was looking for -- a human resources job near Chicago -- using JobCentral. She said the site helped her narrow her search, and after that she found a job quickly. ""It can work,"" she said, ""if you know exactly what you're looking for and you can find a place that will have it.""Correction: January 21, 2006, Saturday The Job Market column on Sunday, about online job boards, incorrectly described a national labor exchange set up by one site, JobCentral.com. Three others -- SimplyHired, Indeed and Google Base -- have agreed to share certain job information with JobCentral, but the four are not teaming up to create a national exchange.'"

Explaining New Line Cinema's decision to release the film in March, Russell Schwartz, the studio's president for domestic marketing, said: ""The worst thing you can ever do is to release a movie for academy play. You open the movie at the best time to open. Then you decide what to do.""As it turned out, deciding what to do wasn't hard. Though the overall reviews were mixed, the film's stars, Kevin Costner and Joan Allen, won raves.""The nice thing about all these awards and critics' groups is they do take a lot of the guessing out of the process,"" said Mr. Schwartz. ""Joan and Kevin are certainly the two elements that have come out of this movie that are soaring above everything else. And that's no disrespect to anyone else involved -- that's just the way it's played out. We know if there's money to be spent on an academy campaign, the wise money goes on Kevin and Joan, and the egocentric money goes to 'For all categories.' ""CINDERELLA MAN (June 3) -- With its serious themes and stellar cast, this movie seemed like a natural for the Oscar race. But the film appeared to flounder with a summer release date. Since then, with a limited theatrical re-issue and subsequent DVD release, Universal Pictures has pushed hard to make the film a contender, with mixed results.The writers, Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman, have been nominated for a prize by the Writers Guild of America, and Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti were nominated by the actors guild and Golden Globe voters. But the film hasn't gathered the kind of momentum that promises a strong showing at the Oscars.""There's a sense that Universal may have let down the side initially, with the way they marketed the film and the release date,"" said Anne Thompson, the deputy movie editor and columnist for The Hollywood Reporter, of the studio's insistence on going early despite the filmmakers' doubts. ""If you just look at the gross, it's a perfectly respectable gross for that kind of dramatic movie. But given how expensive the film was, it was considered a box office disappointment.""There are several theories explaining why the film has been perceived as an underperformer, everything from boxing-movie fatigue following last year's ""Million Dollar Baby"" to blow-back from Russell Crowe's infamous phone-throwing incident. The team behind the awards push at Universal, the studio that made ""Cinderella Man,"" declined to comment for this article, and seems to be battling a perception problem. ""They're putting on a big campaign and they're spending the money,"" said Ms. Thompson. ""And people do like the movie -- that's not the issue. The issue is whether it's a movie that can be changed from a loser to a winner.""MR. AND MRS. SMITH (June 10) -- The two big movie topics of the summer were the box office slump and the glut of remakes, sequels and television adaptations. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" defied both trends: it was based on an original screenplay and it was one of the best-grossing films of the year. But that was not enough to make it an awards contender, even at the audience-minded Golden Globes, which might have sneaked it into one of its very flexible best musical or comedy categories.""I never had any expectations that we'd be recognized by the 'grown-up' awards,"" the movie's screenwriter, Simon Kinberg, wrote in an e-mail message. ""I figured we had a shot at the People's Choice and MTV Movie Awards. But we have a few strikes against us when it comes to the fancier trophies. I think the action element is an especially big obstacle to overcome. When you read the positive reviews, the critics totally understood that we were trying to make a slightly subversive love story, wrapped inside the trappings of an action film. Some people saw the love story, some people just saw the cars exploding.""JUNEBUG (Aug. 3) -- Even as ""Junebug"" was being acquired, an awards campaign was already taking shape, according Michael Barker, a co-president of Sony Pictures Classics. ""It's definitely in your mind at that point,"" he said. ""Now it may evolve as you get the reviews and you play out your film that it falls by the wayside. But from the minute we saw 'Junebug' we thought the picture would have a shot, but we weren't sure in what categories. We felt very confident about best original screenplay or best first film from some critics groups. But Amy Adams's performance was singled out every time in every review.""Indeed, an actors guild nomination for Ms. Adams, who had received a prize at the Sundance Film Festival last year, has kept her in the running, even though the movie didn't get much of an audience when it was released on fewer than 150 screens.""When the picture opened, we felt immediately that our plan was we were going to be the first DVD that went to academy members,"" Mr. Barker said. ""And sure enough, there was a lot of press attendant to that. Hopefully that caused people to put the DVD on. The bottom line on these Oscar campaigns is getting academy members to see your film. The fact of the matter is, there isn't much more you can do beyond that.""THE CONSTANT GARDENER (Aug. 31) -- Coming out at the last possible moment before the awards-season onslaught, ""The Constant Gardener"" was intentionally positioned as a pace-setter. And the strategy has worked so far. The film swept up three Globe nominations, including best drama, and picked up recognition from the actors and writers guilds as well.""We wanted to raise our hand and plant our flag,"" said David Linde, the co-president of Focus Features. ""We were pretty confident about the reviews, and we always felt it was an all-categories campaign. Now if we hadn't gotten those reviews, we'd be having a different conversation.""Mr. Linde added: ""What we're trying to do is give each movie its moment in time without compromising its ability to shine at awards season. It's sort of like having a twofold release. You say to yourself, 'I think the film can really perform up to the expectations of the filmmakers and the expectations of the company.' At the same time we're always thinking, 'If it works, what's the campaign going to be?' ""'"
"'06-01-15,'0','The other day, I had an adventure with a dog. It wasn't my dog, but it was a dog that I liked as soon as I saw him. I was driving alone in my car one sunny morning when I noticed a Chihuahua running right down the middle of this two-lane highway. He had a collar and what looked to be a name tag around his little neck. Right away I felt sorry for him. He was helpless, about to be hit by a car. So, friend of the dog that I am, I stopped my car, put it in park and got out. There were no cars behind me. If one came up, I was pretty sure that the driver would see what was happening and wait patiently while I finished my mission: saving a life. Unless it was Ebenezer Scrooge or Simon Legree behind the wheel, I felt sure that the driver would instantly understand.I got out of the car and approached the dog. I decided to make comforting noises to ensure that he didn't bolt. This did not work. As soon as the dog heard me coming up behind him making the universally recognized puckered-lip sounds that everybody uses to be friendly to dogs, he turned around and stared. He did not interpret the puckered-lip sounds as friendly. Alarmed, he took off running at full speed down the middle of the car-filled street.I took a moment to absorb this, and then I decided that I would pursue him. As soon as I got back to my car, I noticed a car behind it. I could tell instantly by the driver's hand gestures that he was not a friend of Canine America. He had his hands spread on the sides of his face with an expression that I interpreted as ""How about it, Buddy?""I got back in my car and drove along, looking anxiously out the window, hoping to catch a glimpse of the dog. I was now very deeply involved. I was committed. I needed to see how this Chihuahua made out.In a couple of blocks, I spotted him. There he was, back in traffic, paused behind a huge S.U.V. I hesitated before stopping the car again. Two sides warred within me: on one hand I had the desire to help the little dog. On the other hand, I had the guy behind me in traffic. There was the dread of more-specific hand gestures -- and possibly of direct action. I had the guy pegged: Enemy of the Dog. He was now making a hand gesture that I interpreted as ""C'mere, you."" I determined that he was about 30 seconds away from getting out of the car and confronting me. I got out of the car and resolved not to look at him again unless I had to (like if he got in my face).'"
"'06-01-15,'0','""I don't necessarily believe that everyone here is 100 percent,"" Davenport said of the women's field. ""But everyone in the draw is really what we need. I think as the players get more healthy, and the top players get to compete against each other more and more, it's really going to help our sport. We've had a tough couple years.""Tennis times are still tough for some of the elite. Serena Williams has not reached a final since fighting through match points and a tricky draw to win last year's Australian Open. Now ranked 15th, she has not played a WTA Tour event in nearly four months because of ankle and knee problems and was hardly impressive in a round-robin exhibition in Hong Kong this month; she won just four games in a straight-set loss to Elena Dementieva before citing knee pain and withdrawing.Unflattering photographs of Williams practicing at well above her customary weight have been a staple of local news coverage since her arrival in Melbourne. In typically self-assured fashion, she insists that she is fit and a threat.""If I didn't like my chances of winning, I wouldn't be here,"" said Williams, whose victory here a year ago also came with less than ideal preparation.But even she expressed surprise at one of the photographs. ""I saw one of me running, and I was like: Wow. My hamstring muscle is that big?"" Williams said. ""I had no idea my muscle was like that. But that's about it.""Even with the top 20 women present and with top-seeded Roger Federer presiding over the men's field, it will be difficult for this year's Open to match the buzz generated last year, when the matches were routinely gripping and the Australians Lleyton Hewitt and Alicia Molik created more national interest than usual. Safin's upset of Federer in the semifinals was widely considered the match of the year, and the Safin-Hewitt final, which Safin won in four sets, was the most-watched TV program in Australia since the 2000 Sydney Games.One year later, Safin is still recovering from knee surgery, Hewitt is struggling with a stomach ailment and Molik -- a big server who nearly beat Davenport in the quarterfinals here in 2005 -- is sidelined indefinitely because of an inner-ear problem that has affected her vision and balance.On Friday, when Justine Henin-Hardenne of Belgium defeated Francesca Schiavone of Italy in the final of a tuneup event in Sydney, the 24-year-old Molik was working courtside as a television commentator.For the moment at least, Hingis's television duties are over. Her extended leave of absence ended this month, when she returned to the Tour at the Gold Coast event in Australia. After reaching the semifinals there and losing to 20th-ranked Flavia Pennetta of Italy, Hingis lost in the first round in Sydney in straight sets to seventh-ranked Henin-Hardenne, the reigning French Open champion who, in some senses, is an updated version of Hingis.Like Hingis, she is an all-court player with fine touch and a knack for changing tactics. Like Hingis, she is undersized at 5 feet 6 in what is increasingly a taller person's game. But she is quicker than Hingis and, at least for the moment, capable of generating more consistent pace with her serve and ground strokes. ""Playing her definitely showed me what it's all about,"" Hingis said. ""She hits it very fast and deep, and I think that's the difference in today's game. They are more relentless.""Yet as Henin-Hardenne pointed out in Sydney, it was still too early to judge Hingis's true level. Unless Hingis's level is high, she will not be playing singles in Melbourne for long. Her opening match is against 30th-seeded Vera Zvonareva, a Russian who reached the top 10 in 2004 and is eager to rebound from a difficult season. ""I was just hoping not to get Justine again in the first round,"" Hingis said. ""I think it's a very fair first round."" If Hingis gets past Zvonareva and her second-round opponent, she will probably face Mary Pierce, her former doubles partner.Pierce, seeded fifth, knows what the challenge of a comeback is like. She was close to retirement because of injuries in 2002, but she slowly rebuilt her game and fitness. Last season, at the advanced tennis age of 30, she made a tremendous run, reaching the finals of the French Open, the United States Open and the Tour Championships.""I think in about two or three months, it will be easier to kind of tell,"" Pierce said of Hingis. ""She's a champion.""It has rarely been this difficult to pick a winner. The top quarter of the women's draw alone has three former No. 1 players, with Davenport, Henin-Hardenne and Venus Williams. Venus appears to be in better shape than sister Serena, but she has not played a competitive match since mid-September.""I am fully fit,"" said Venus, who complained of a sore back during the Hong Kong exhibition. ""If I wasn't fully fit, I would still say I'm fully fit, so I'm fully fit.""Maria Sharapova, another contender for the title, was more forthcoming. There were concerns she might withdraw because of chronic soreness around her right shoulder, but she, too, made the trip to Australia. After undergoing extensive tests at the Cleveland Clinic, she said she had been reassured by physicians that she risked no further damage to the shoulder by playing, and that the pain was caused by her changing her stroke mechanics to compensate for a rib injury.""That makes me feel better,"" she said. ""I'm a tough girl. I can play with a little bit of pain.""In this grueling era, that may be the best that tennis and its stars can hope for.'"

"'06-01-15,'0','Most say their workload does not allow time to be absent, or they fear their job would be in jeopardy if they did not come to work. A substantial percentage also say they save their sick days to use when their children are sick.Lynda Ford, president of the Ford Group, a human resources consulting company in Rome, N.Y., and author of ""Transform Your Workplace"" (McGraw-Hill, 2005), says these reasons are symptoms of a work environment that is sick itself. ""Sometimes people show up sick because they are self-absorbed workaholics who don't consider that they are infecting everyone around them,"" she says. But more often, ""the organizational culture frowns on people taking time off when they are sick and in fact puts pressure on them to show up.""Wendy Hart Beckman used to work with a boss to whom being present was all-important. ""He didn't care if you were productive while you were there,"" she says. ""He just cared that you were there."" One memorable morning, she says, a colleague came in ""looking pale, sweaty and kind of glassy-eyed"" -- but when his co-workers urged him to go home, he refused. Shortly after he arrived, he threw up all over a secretary's desk, in the middle of the open office. Eventually everyone had to be sent home, because of the lingering smell.The manager's ""obsession with not missing work resulted in missing far more hours when about eight people have to leave,"" said Ms. Beckman, who has since switched jobs and now works at the University of Cincinnati as a public information officer.Ms. Beckman tries to stay home when she is sick, but says she feels guilty whenever she does. This, too, dates back to grade school, she suspects. ""Maybe it's left over from when some of us as children faked being sick in order to stay home from school,"" she said, adding, ""Not that I ever did that.""Ms. Heartlein has seen her share of that guilt. In her crusade against germs, she regularly sends employees home, and says that most apologize as they leave. ""They keep saying they are sorry they are sick,"" she says, as if it is under their control. ""It's bad enough to feel sick without also feeling guilty.""Mr. Nehmer wants to make it clear that he comes to work not because he feels pressured to do so, but because he is proud of his personal streak and is determined to keep it going. He is careful to wash his hands often when he's sick, he says, and not to breathe on anyone.Mr. Heartlein says that's not enough. And yet when we spoke, she admitted she was getting a cold. And that she was at work. ""It's just at the 'tickle in the throat' stage,"" she said, a touch defensively.

"'06-01-15,'0','She issued a few simple rules: Marry someone poorer or socially inferior; increase your tolerance of dust. And, as she puts it: ""Have a baby. Just don't have two.""On the Web and elsewhere, responses were quick, numerous and fierce. There were a few supporters, but many more critics. Conservatives saw her argument as another example of how feminists are intent on destroying the family. Liberals criticized her for being authoritarian and defining success only by money and status. Mothers denounced her for just about everything.What is perhaps most surprising, though, is not that feminists like Ms. Hirshman believe homemaking is second-class drudgery, but that so many people still get worked up over the issue. After all, feminist thinkers have been proclaiming the need to free women from the bondage of housework for a long time. It is, as Ms. Hirshman freely acknowledges, precisely what Ms. Friedan argued in ""The Feminist Mystique,"" first published more than 40 years ago.""The only kind of work which permits an able woman to realize her abilities fully,"" Ms. Friedan wrote, ""is the kind that was forbidden by the feminine mystique, the lifelong commitment to an art or science, to politics or profession."" Not homemaking, not motherhood.In an interview, Ms. Hirshman said that in the course of researching a book, she began to wonder when feminism switched from offering a clear blueprint for liberation to choosing from Column A and Column B.""I was curious to see when we got to the place when they decided to sidestep the definition of the good life by Friedan,"" she said, ""to whatever floats your boats.""She traced the change to the late 80's, when the women's movement decided to frame the debate over legalized abortion as a question of a woman's choice. The language, she says, ""spilled over.""That Ms. Hirshman's views on family life now sound so radical is a testament to how roundly the mainstream has rejected them. While rigid doctrines may have made sense in the early days, they don't now, when major goals have been won and a more diverse group of women are in the picture. Indeed, the common critique of the women's movement in the 60's and 70's was that it was too elitist and dogmatic, that it didn't respect women who wanted to stay home.Choice feminism was an adjustment to reality. But reality, of course, is messy and confusing. It's not clear what should give when women are still responsible for a disproportionate share of the housework, they miss their children while they're at work all day, good child care is expensive, and time off or part-time work hampers a career.In the continuing Web discussion about Ms. Hirshman's article, many women angry with her conclusions still agreed with her complaints about the unequal burden between men and women for home and family.A Web site called the Half Changed World, for example, written by a self-described mom and policy wonk, said: ""I honestly don't know what's going to break through the domestic glass ceiling. I used to think that it just was going to take time, that of course the younger generation would adopt a more equitable distribution of labor. I don't see that happening.""Choice feminism doesn't provide any formula or model for happily balancing family, work, love, chores, play, sleep and more. Nothing does anymore.. ""We've been living through this massive transformation where those predictable pathways have really eroded,"" said Kathleen Gerson, a New York University sociologist.That is why edicts that order women either to get out of the house or to stay there inevitably resurface. Issuing marching orders is simple. ""Viva la revolución!"" is a lot catchier than ""Muddle Through!"" It's just not helpful.THE NATION Correction: January 22, 2006, Sunday An article last Sunday about the debate over the concept of ""choice feminism,"" the idea that women can choose how to balance career and family, misstated the title of the 1963 book by Betty Friedan that proclaimed the need to free women from housework. It is ""The Feminine Mystique,"" not ""The Feminist Mystique.""'"

""Thanks,"" he mutters.Inside the cloakroom, he carefully tucks the bags out of sight on top of a shelf, then follows Lamont into a dining room with candles and white cloths and waiters in white jackets. He tries not to think about his spotted suit and soaked shoes as he and Lamont sit across from each other at a corner table. It is dark out, lamps along Quincy Street blurry through the rain and fog, people heading into the club for dinner. They don't have spots on their clothes, belong here, probably went to school here, maybe teach here, are the sort of people Monique Lamont dates or has as friends.""At Risk,"" she starts in.

""The way we play it is while you were attending the academy, you heard about the case and suggested Massachusetts could assist, try this new DNA analysis, help them out.. . .""""So you want me to lie,"" he says.""I want you to be diplomatic, smart,"" she says.Win opens the envelope and slides out copies of newspaper articles, the autopsy and lab reports, none of them very good quality, probably from microfilm.""Science,"" she says with confidence. ""If it's true there's a God gene, then maybe there's also a devil gene,"" she adds. Lamont loves her cryptic quasi-brilliant pronouncements.She is almost quotable.""I'm looking for the devil that got away, looking for his ancestral DNA.""""I'm not sure why you're not using the lab in Florida that's known for all this."" Win looks over the blurry copy of the autopsy report, adds: ""Vivian Finlay. Sequoyah Hills. Knoxville old money on the river, can't touch a house for under a million. Someone really beat the hell out of her.""Although there are no photographs included in the records Lamont has given him, the autopsy protocol makes several things clear. Vivian Finlay survived long enough to have substantial tissue response, her face lacerated and bruised, her eyes swollen shut. When her scalp was reflected back, it revealed huge contusions, a cranium with punched-out areas caused by the repeated violent blows of a weapon that had at least one round surface.""If we're testing for DNA, then there must be evidence. Who's had it all this time?"" he asks.""All I know is the F.B.I. did the lab work back then.""""F.B.I.? What interest did the feds have?""""I meant the state authorities,"" she says.""I don't think they were doing DNA back then.""""Nope.

What you've got is what Toby tracked down.""""Meaning what he had the M.E.'s office print out from microfilm. What a sleuth,"" he says sarcastically. ""I don't know why in the world you have an idiot like that.. . .""""You know why.""""Don't know how Huber could have an idiot son like that. You should be careful doing favors for the director of the crime labs no matter how great a guy he is, Monique.

We said we're honest tonight?"" She looks him in the eye, holds his gaze. ""It was a bad call on my part. You're right. Toby's useless, a disaster.""""What I need is the police file. Maybe Toby-the-disaster got a photocopy of that too in the course of his arduous and thorough research?""""I suppose you can take care of that yourself when you return to Knoxville. Toby just left for vacation.""""Poor guy. Probably exhausted from working so hard.""Lamont watches the waiter return with his silver tray and two glasses of wine, says: ""You'll like the pinot. A Drouhin, the daughter, actually.""He slowly swirls it, smells it, tastes it. ""Have you forgotten? You sent me to the academy because it's the, and I quote you, Harvard of forensic science. I've got one month left.""""I'm sure they'll accommodate you, Win. Nobody said anything about your dropping out. In fact, this is going to make the N.F.A. look good too.""""So I'll work it in my sleep. So let's see.. . ."" He sips his wine. ""You're using the N.F.A., using the Knoxville Police Department, using me, using everyone for political gain. Tell me something, Monique."" He pushes his luck, his eyes intense on hers. ""Do you really give a damn about this dead old lady?""""Headline: 'Big-Shot Massachusetts Detective Helps Out Small-Town Police Department, Solves 20-Year-Old Case, Vindicates Old Woman Murdered for Spare Change.' """"It's in one of the newspaper articles I gave you,"" she says. ""Mrs. Finlay collected silver coins. Had a box of them on her dresser. The only thing missing as far as anybody knows.""It is still raining when they leave the Harvard Faculty Club and follow old brick pavers to Quincy Street.""Where now?"" Lamont asks, half-hidden by a big black umbrella.Win notices her tapered fingers tightly curled around the umbrella's wooden handle. Her nails are neatly squared, no polish, and she wears a large white-gold watch with a black crocodile band, a Breguet, and a Harvard signet ring. Doesn't matter what she earns as a D.A. and for the occasional class she teaches at the law school. Lamont comes from family money, a lot of it from what he hears, has a historic home near Harvard Square and the British racing green Range Rover parked across the dark, wet street.""I'm all set,"" he says, as if she offered him a ride. ""I'll walk to the square and grab a taxi. Or maybe stroll over to the Charles, see if they've got any good jazz going on at the Regattabar. You like Coco Montoya?""""I didn't say he was playing tonight.""He wasn't inviting her either.She is digging into her coat pockets, getting impatient, looking for something, says: ""Keep me informed, Win.

""I don't see what good your At Risk initiative is going to do if we can't solve the case.""""At the very least, we'll get an ancestral DNA profile, say the case was reopened as a result.

"'06-01-15,'0','""The idea is that each homeowner will feel completely safe and secure in their modern luxurious surroundings,"" said Eugene Williams, who is director of marketing for the Empire View.It is something of a novel concept for East Orange, which has traditionally had a lower-income population and a relatively high crime rate. No other condos or co-ops in East Orange currently lay claim to being ""luxury"" buildings.After several decades when housing development was largely spurred by government subsidies, the current East Orange administration has imposed a moratorium on subsidies for builders. But the Empire View developers saw a niche: upscale condos designed to appeal to young professionals seeking starter homes.The building at 70 South Munn Avenue is well positioned as a commuter locale, Mr. Williams pointed out. It is between the Garden State Parkway and Interstate 280 and within a few minutes' walk to bus and train service to both Manhattan and Newark. Some trips to Penn Station in Manhattan take only a little more than a half hour with a transfer in Newark.It is also close to East Orange's most popular shopping strip, on Central Avenue, and to East Orange Hospital, at the corner of South Munn and Central.Formerly known as Andrea Towers, the Empire View structure started out 30 years ago as a rental apartment building. It was converted to condos in the early 1990's, and promptly went bankrupt when investors bought most of the units and rented them out -- to tenants who failed to pay their bills.The Andrea was condemned 10 years ago and has since been vacant, said the developer Justin Stein of the O'Neill Group, based in Rochelle Park.The developers bought the building -- or at least most of it -- out of bankruptcy. The Andrea had 202 units, but 15 were still in the hands of individual owners who had to be tracked down, and sales negotiated, over nearly three years, Mr. Stein said.The Empire View was designed with fewer studios and a higher number of two-bedroom units. It will offer 38 studios and 49 one-bedrooms, and the rest will be two- or three-bedroom units. There are a number of different layouts; some of the two-bedroom units have one bath and some have two.With very little advertising, but with model apartments to show on lower floors, 45 units have already been sold, Mr. Williams said. The building will not be open for occupancy until mid-November, he said.Mr. Williams said that word of mouth seems to be generating a flow of clients from places about as far away from Manhattan as East Orange that do not have comparably priced condos: Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens and Hillside in New Jersey.The taxes, however, are relatively high in East Orange, he noted. The city has a median income of $32,346, according to census figures, and a tax base starved for industry.The annual tax on a $200,000 home is about $6,000, Mr. Williams said, and the city is scheduled to reassess properties this year. As a result, the rate could rise for homeowners.""We are in conversations with the city to see whether some accommodations can be made,"" Mr. Williams said. Empire View developers are asking that their $17.5 million investment in rehabbing the building be recognized as a contribution to the general health of the city, and that taxes be capped in some way.Buyers at Empire View will also pay a maintenance fee of roughly $200 to $420 a month, Mr. Williams said. Buyers may purchase the deed to one or more parking spaces -- $3,500 for an outdoor spot; $5,500 for a spot in the garage under the building -- when they buy their condos.Condo owners will pay their own utility bills; each unit has its own meters.The building and model units are open for tours on Wednesdays through Saturdays; appointments can be made by phone or through the Web site at www.empireview.com.'"

"'06-01-15,'0','But while shareholder activism may be on the rise, it is still relatively rare among the 8,000-odd mutual funds in the United States. With $8.5 trillion in assets, mutual funds are a huge force in the market. Yet fund managers and industry experts say the funds are a meek presence in the boardroom because of cultural and structural factors.Some managers fear that companies will retaliate by restricting access to executives or not returning phone calls. And mutual funds, which like to diversify among scores of holdings, are reluctant to use a large chunk of their cash to build up a significant stake in a single company -- a prerequisite for forcing changes. Confronting management can also pose difficulties for consumer-oriented brands like Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund company.""Activism often requires nastiness, or at least the threat of nastiness, which makes average American investors nervous,"" said Whitney R. Tilson, a hedge fund manager based in New York who recently started two small mutual funds.Another factor weighs against involvement in shareholder battles: it's expensive. Running proxy contests to influence board elections involves hiring solicitation companies, buying advertising and paying lawyers and investment bankers. The group of shareholders at Time Warner, for example, has hired the investment bank Lazard to assist it. For all these reasons, if a mutual fund has an investment in a company that isn't working out, it generally cuts its losses and moves on. ""The attitude among mutual funds is that they vote with their feet,"" said Christopher J. Traulsen, a senior analyst at Morningstar. ""If they don't like what management is doing, they sell the stock and move on.""That is precisely the problem with mutual funds, say some activist fund managers: too many funds act like renters, not owners, of stocks. Robert A. Olstein, manager of the $1.9 billion Olstein Financial Alert fund, isn't shy about making direct recommendations to companies. ""They work for me, just as I work for my shareholders,"" Mr. Olstein said. ""And over the years, we have made recommendations to management in cases where we thought they were not taking the appropriate steps.""Mr. Olstein generally confines his activism to writing letters to management and boards and peppering them with advice. He has sent a pointed letter to the management of Jo-Ann Stores, the fabric and crafts chain in which the fund owns a 9.1 percent stake.""The company has the right model, taking their small stores and making them big, but they're screwing it up terribly,"" he said in an interview. Same-store sales, those for stores open at least a year, have been down. The company's stock has fallen nearly 60 percent since March.Like Mr. Olstein, most mutual fund managers who become involved with companies' governance have significant personal stakes in the ownership of the fund itself. ""The primary reason value investors are more often involved is that they tend to have longer holding periods than other types of actively managed mutual funds,"" said Christopher H. Browne, a managing director at Tweedy Browne.After all, proxy contests -- seeking to elect new directors or to gain approval of shareholder resolutions through annual shareholder votes -- can take several months, if not years. In 2004, Mutual Series became involved in a proxy contest at Potlatch, a forest products company, over what it regarded as the company's shareholder-unfriendly voting policies. Last year, Potlatch changed the voting policies and announced its intention to restructure into a real estate investment trust.Joining hedge funds and big investors who aim to shake up management isn't always profitable. Investors who followed Mr. Kerkorian's lead at G.M. have seen its stock rise in 2006, but it is still down nearly 30 percent in seven months. And despite Mr. Icahn's prodding and posturing, Time Warner's stock has barely budged in recent months.Mutual fund managers are certainly capable of dipping into the same acid inkwell that hedge fund managers use. Mutual Series is battling Sovereign Bancorp, a Philadelphia company in which it has a stake of about 5 percent. The fund and other investors have been angered by the bank's decision to acquire Independence Community Bank at a premium, and to sell a nearly 20 percent stake to Grupo Santander of Spain without asking for shareholder approval.""These transactions rank with the worst examples of management and board entrenchment and disdain for shareholder rights that we have witnessed in our history as public investors,"" Mr. Embler and Peter A. Langerman, chief executive of Mutual Series, wrote to the board in November. Citing what it called ""the board's appalling history of conflicts of interest,"" they contended that the proposed acquisition of Independence was ""driven more by empire-building and entrenchment than creating shareholder value."" So far, Sovereign has successfully deflected the criticism.Regardless of the success of individual initiatives, people in the industry say they expect an increase in funds' shareholder activism, and Europe is emerging as a new frontier. Tweedy Browne is now in a fight with the German automaker Volkswagen. Porsche, the luxury automaker that already has close links to VW, has bought a 20 percent interest in it. And Ferdinand Piëch, whose family controls Porsche, is the chairman of the supervisory board of VW. ""We question whether Mr. Piëch can represent the interests of VW at the table when it negotiates business transactions at Porsche,"" said William H. Browne another Tweedy Browne managing director.Tweedy Browne is trying to drum up support from other shareholders to vote Mr. Piëch out and to block the appointment of other top Porsche officials to the VW board.MORE activist-oriented funds are in the pipeline. David J. Winters, former president, chief executive and chief investment officer of Franklin Mutual Advisers, started the Wintergreen fund in October, saying: ""Our approach is to think like an owner and to be a constructive participant in how companies evolve.""Mr. Olstein says he is registering a mutual fund that will invest in companies with market capitalizations of less than $5 billion. ""We want to focus on a small companies, and have a lesser number of holdings where we can have more influence,"" he said.Over all, the climate seems to be growing more hospitable for activism. In 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule requiring mutual funds to disclose their votes on proxy issues to shareholders. ""I hope that will put more pressure on funds to be more activist, at least in terms of how they vote their proxies,"" said Mr. Traulsen at Morningstar.""I think it's going to be hard for mutual funds to avoid getting more vocal,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, mutual fund managers are ultimately beholden to maximize the value of the investments on behalf of their own investors.""'"
"'06-01-15,'0','This is the language that Bennett Holiday is studying; Jimmy Pope, for all his affectations of folksy directness, is a native speaker. And their colloquy echoes many others that Bennett has had, with men who are generally older and more powerful than he -- or else with his ruined, alcoholic father. Our first glimpse of Bennett is in the garden of his firm's senior partner, a gray eminence named Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) whose influence extends from the C.I.A. to the petroleum-rich kingdoms of the Arabian peninsula. Later we see Bennett with various mentors and superiors, and with a smug Justice Department heavy who wants him to turn on his colleagues and clients. These guys lecture Bennett, they condescend to him, they figure they can bully, bamboozle or use him. After all, he's not one of them: his youth, his race and his too-serious buttoned-up manner all mark him as an outsider, someone who doesn't understand how this game is played.The audience's view of him is a little different. In a movie like this -- a thriller that sets out to diagram a web of interlocking conspiracies -- an outsider like Bennett is the kind of person with whom we identify, the one who will expose wrongdoing, cleanse the system of the evil that taints it and explain exactly what is going on. Or so it appears. This character, slyly conceived by Mr. Gaghan and even more slyly incarnated by Mr. Wright, exists to be misunderstood and underestimated. As he endures slights and humiliations from his more comfortable, better-connected colleagues and antagonists, and listens politely to their self-serving guff, the audience relishes the anticipation of revenge. All this corruption, all this arrogance, all this smug Caucasian fat-cat privilege -- who better to deliver the necessary comeuppance than a young, serious, hard-working black man?But appearances can be deceiving. The development of Bennett's character -- or rather the revelation that his interests and motives are as ambiguous, as mixed as anyone else's -- represents ""Syriana's"" canniest subversion of the conventions that seem to govern its narrative. Bennett's job is not the unmasking of conspiracies but the delivery of fall guys, and his zeal to accomplish the task is not ethical so much as it is Oedipal. This movie is as much about paternal failure as it is about oil, and it is hardly surprising that Bennett, a disappointed son, should move, in concert with the big-brotherly Jimmy Pope, against one of his symbolic surrogate dads.The barbecue scene, which sets up the movie's swift, busy final act, is Bennett's turning point, the moment that his true nature -- a capacity for decisive action, and also for betrayal -- is revealed. He tells Jimmy Pope that Justice (the government bureaucracy, not the abstract ideal) requires ""the illusion of due diligence"" in order for the Connex-Killeen merger to proceed. In practical terms, this means that in addition to an oil executive, someone else big must be sacrificed, and Bennett does not blink when Jimmy Pope suggests selling out someone from his law firm. Will it be Whiting, the Great White Father who seems to pull every string and whose downfall would imply a measure of real (as opposed to merely governmental) justice in compromised, corrupted world? If this were a different kind of movie -- a more usual kind of political thriller -- that might be the case. But while Bennett may be inclined toward patricide, he is far from suicidal. Instead, he will sacrifice a less mighty mentor, serving the interests of free enterprise and his own career in a single clean stroke of the knife. It is not his job to fix the system, but to find a place within it.And why should Bennett Holiday be any different from any of the others? Why assume that he can't speak their language, or play their game? Maybe next time he's down in Texas for a barbecue at Jimmy Pope's place, he'll roll up his sleeves, loosen his tie and enjoy himself for a change.The Unforgettable Moment Correction: January 22, 2006, Sunday An article on Jan. 15 about the film ""Syriana"" misspelled the writer-director's given name.

The preening ""Mean Girls"" version of Hollywood -- ""Reese is so, so cute!"" and ""What in the world was Drew thinking wearing that!"" -- was everywhere to see and hear. At parties after the event on Monday night, replete with the vogueing action figures of Paris and Nicky Hilton, various studios and publications teamed up to serve up enough vodka, shrimp and bad D.J. music to make the Iraq war and a political culture beset by division and scandal seem distant.The industry and some of its increasingly important voices feel some dissonance, no doubt. Ang Lee, who received both a best director's Globe for his ""Brokeback Mountain"" and a handoff of the torch from the western icon Clint Eastwood, spoke from the dais with obvious sincerity about ""the power of movies to change the way we're thinking."" But in the pressroom afterward, when he faced persistent efforts to force him to declare his film -- it is both marketed and described as ""a universal love story"" -- as a Message Movie, he gently but firmly resisted.""We'll see how it plays out, but it's not why I made the movie,"" Mr. Lee said. ""Whether it's a cultural milestone, it's not for me to say.""Philip Seymour Hoffman confronted a similar gantlet of questions, about whether it was difficult to portray Truman Capote, a man who was out and gay when that was a difficult choice.""A role is difficult to play because of the internal drama of the character,"" he said. ""Those are the things that are scary, not his sexual preference. Later, when asked about the treatment of gays in America, he added, ""I don't think this film really takes a side.""But of course, we live in a time when taking sides is what people do. It is an odd moment in cultural history, with the year's string of weighty contenders, plus less-heralded efforts like ""Munich"" and ""Jarhead,"" doing their own form of reality programming. (Imagine: Only two years ago, our big Oscar-film issue was whether Frodo and Sam would destroy the ring.)The current movie mood was probably inevitable. In an atomized news media culture, Jon Stewart is not the only nontraditional source of political thought. His selection as host of the Oscars can be read as one more reaction to the shock of the election to the industry's liberal elite and perhaps a sign that it may be willing, for the moment anyway, to grab that opportunity with both hands.""With 'Syriana,' 'Good Night, and Good Luck' and 'The Constant Gardener,' some people are saying it is almost a 70's revival in terms of political movies,"" said Rachel Weisz, who won for her supporting role in ""Gardener."" She was asked about her wishes for the coming year.""A healthy baby, of course,"" said Ms. Weisz, who compared baby bumps with Gwyneth Paltrow when they saw each other in the restroom. What else? ""Hmmm. I feel like a candidate for Ms. World -- world peace and the troops to come home,"" she said, laughing at the cliché but maintaining the sentiment.What's easy to forget in all this is the fact that Hollywood -- with a lead time of well over a year when it comes to making a major film -- generally follows, but does not lead, cultural and political trends.That means the movies honored at the Globes offer a peek into the industry 18 months ago, when film executives were on high alert about the war, about the election, about the growing divide in the country.It was way back then that feel-good, the vibe that Hollywood is largely in the business of manufacturing, took on this new gravitas. After years of angst and conference calls over what 14-year-old males will come out to see, major studios like Warner Brothers were saying yes to films like ""Syriana,"" an ambitious, prismatic look at America's foreign policy means and objectives.We, the viewing public, now get to feel good about ourselves because we are watching movies that take on actual issues, and then take a stand, at least until its time to market the film or accept an award. ""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""TransAmerica,"" ""Syriana"" and ""The Constant Gardener"" -- all honored by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association -- reflect on hatred, greed and poverty. ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" and ""Capote"" use the past to reflect journalism's shortcomings. (Meanwhile, ""King Kong,"" the ultimate escapist fare with a Gable-Lombard overlay on an old-fashioned monster movie, has been all but ignored this season, and even ""Walk the Line,"" which surged at the Globes, carries a significant message abut the wages of fame.)But just as inevitably, the pendulum will swing back of its own accord. After all, portent and meaning do not always sell a lot of popcorn, and can create some indigestion along the way.So the new seriousness was probably at a peak, or close to it.Remember, in the 1980's, Hollywood was all about the Benjamins. In the 90's, it was more about the stars, who received a lot of Benjamins.The latest big thing has been true stories about real events that engage adult audiences. And the coming year will see a few more of those, including Oliver Stone's look at the attacks of Sept. 11; ""Sicko,"" another Michael Moore broadside; and the delayed ""All the King's Men.""But new versions of Superman, X-Men and Spider-Man films will soon swoop in to rescue the day, and perhaps the industry, from a persistent bout of heavy thought. It is fun, or at least interesting, while it lasts.'"

"'06-01-18,'0','The company did not explain, however, how this would work and whether radio ads would be sold through Google's signature auction process. ""The overall radio space looks similar to the way the Internet did five or six years ago,"" said Tim Armstrong, Google's vice president of advertising, referring to the fragmentation of stations and inefficient ways that advertisers buy commercial time.Mr. Armstrong said the company wanted to develop tools that would automate the creation of radio advertisements, although he declined to say how this might work. This would allow smaller companies, which have been a mainstay of Google's Internet ad system, to place radio ads easily as well.""The large advertisers are already well covered by the radio industry's sales force,"" Mr. Armstrong said. ""What we can do with the dMarc deal is bring the undiscoverable advertisers into the radio business.""The combination will also allow big companies to deploy many variations of radio ads. That way they could feature whatever product, or sales pitch, that they believed would most appeal to a given station's market. DMarc's system is already beginning to give radio advertisers a level of control they have not had before. The software can automatically send advertisements right into the systems of radio stations, bypassing the largely manual process currently used in the radio industry.Advertisers can specify the city, time, format and demographics of the audience they would like their commercials to reach, and dMarc's system will find available advertising time that matches those specifications. The advertisers cannot, however, specify an individual station, so dMarc does not compete directly with the stations' own sales forces.""You may have advertisers that see that it will be 40 degrees in L.A., and that it's time to advertise heating systems,"" said Val Maki, the vice president for radio operations at Emmis Communications, which is using the dMarc system in its two stations in Los Angeles and plans to use it at all 26 of its stations.Ms. Maki said Emmis was happy with the dMarc software, largely because it eliminated much of the paperwork involved in scheduling and billing advertisements.DMarc, based in Newport Beach, Calif., was founded in 2002 by two brothers, Chad and Ryan Steelberg, who had created AdForce, one of the earliest companies that provided software to display advertising on Web pages. They purchased two companies -- Scott Studios and Computer Concepts -- which both provided systems that radio stations used to automate their programming, music storage, announcements and advertising.So far, 500 stations of the 2,800 that use dMarc's station operation software have agreed to be in the advertising network, which began operations last year.Over time, Mr. Armstrong said, Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., hopes to extend the system to other forms of radio, including satellite systems, digital terrestrial systems and Internet Webcasts. All of these digital formats have potential to reach more tightly focused groups of prospective customers than radio stations do now.Media buyers were mixed in their response toward the prospect of Google automating the placement of ads on radio and perhaps television.""We like idea of online buying,"" said Mary Kang, an associate media director for StarLink, a media buying division of the Publicis Groupe. ""If all the inventory is online, you can do your schedule when you want, and you don't have to wait for a rep to get back to you.""But she said StarLink had not placed ads using dMarc because it objected to the policy that keeps buyers from knowing which stations the ads will run on in advance.""It's like Priceline,"" she said, referring to the online travel site where consumers bid for trips without knowing the airlines they will fly with. ""You can ask for a news talk station, but you don't know if it is the top station or the 20th in the market.""Others wondered whether traditional advertising spots could be sold by way of a giant automated system that Google runs for Web ads. ""Google's vision that they can rationalize what is an irrational industry -- because it is based on consumer irrational responses -- is a lovely dream,"" said Greg Smith, an executive vice president with Carat Fusion, a unit of the Aegis Group. ""But I don't think the world is up to it.""Shares of Google rose 86 cents, to close at $467.11.'"

"'06-01-18,'0','That decision, coupled with reports of abuses in places like the predominantly African-American community of Riviera Beach, Fla., where plans called for replacing thousands of homes with upscale condos, has prompted a onslaught of legislation, both federal and state.In November, the House of Representatives approved a bill by F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, that would penalize government agencies for using condemnation powers for private projects by denying them economic development funds for two years. Legislation has been introduced in 27 states, and more is coming, said Larry Morandi, the director of the environment, energy and transportation program of the National Conference of State Legislatures.In California, where eminent domain can be used only in urban areas -- and only when there is substantial evidence of blight -- four ballot initiatives have been filed with the state attorney general's office to further limit condemnation, said John F. Shirey, the executive director of the California Redevelopment Association, a trade group.The outcry has given heart to property-rights advocates. ""We lost the Supreme Court case, but we're ultimately going to win in changing the way that eminent domain is going to be used in this country,"" said Dana Berliner, a senior attorney for the Institute for Justice, the most prominent advocacy group.But around the country, developers and city officials say weakening or destroying the power to condemn property will seriously undermine efforts to rehabilitate decaying cities and might even hinder the rebuilding of New Orleans. Without eminent domain, the Inner Harbor, which played an essential role in Baltimore's success in building its tourist industry, could not have been redeveloped, said Ralph S. Tyler, the city solicitor.Yet many developers and politicians have been loath to speak up, said Jeffrey Finkle, the president and chief executive of the International Economic Development Council, a professional group. For example, the Real Estate Roundtable, which represents the nation's largest real estate companies, has refrained from officially opposing the federal bill, said Roger Platt, a senior vice president.Mr. Finkle also said the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group, had not put its lobbying muscle to work on the issue. But Herb L. Tyson, a lobbyist for the council, said he had privately urged lawmakers to preserve eminent domain for economic development. ""Our feeling is that land use is a local issue,"" he said.Mr. Finkle said that for many politicians, defending eminent domain was as perilous as endorsing gay marriage. ""This issue is the third rail right now,"" Mr. Finkle said. ""You step on it, you die.""One business group that has opposed restrictions on eminent domain is the Partnership for New York City, whose members include most of the city's top developers. Kathryn S. Wylde, the president and chief executive of the group, said her members opposed any efforts to alter condemnation procedures through federal or state legislation. ""When you add restrictions on development, you are never quite sure what the results are going to be,"" she said. ""We want to avoid political reaction to an issue that adds more problems and obstacles to economic growth.""Some lawmakers and public officials, however, are trying to carve out a moderate position, saying that reform is needed to address legitimate grievances. ""What you're seeing is a coherent attack by the right on the power of eminent domain,"" said Richard L. Brodsky, a New York State assemblyman from Westchester County who is seeking the Democratic nomination for state attorney general. ""It does no one any good to pretend that things aren't going to change. If we take that view, we're going to see the extreme position triumph.""Since June, three states have passed bills banning the use of eminent domain for economic development (though a measure in Texas exempts the new Dallas Cowboys stadium in Arlington). Michigan lawmakers have approved a constitutional amendment that is subject to a popular vote.In a more cautious vein, Ohio has effectively denied state funding for one year to private projects in nonblighted areas that involve condemnation. The state also created a bipartisan task force to study the issue. ""Ohio is saying, 'We need some breathing space,' "" Mr. Morandi, of the National Conference of State Legislatures, said.Mr. Brodsky's bills would increase protections for property owners. Homeowners, for example, would be guaranteed compensation equal to 150 percent of the value of their property. An ombudsman would oversee condemnation, which would be limited to projects that were part of a redevelopment plan approved by an elected local government. Government agencies would have to justify the taking of homes by weighing the benefits against the impact.But Ms. Berliner said that requiring city council approval would not cure the abuses. ""Cities know how to jump through their own hoops,"" she said.One issue that has divided advocates of eminent domain is whether its use should be limited to blighted areas, as in California and other states. John D. Echeverria, the executive director of the Georgetown Environmental Law and Policy Institute, views eminent domain as a critical weapon in fighting sprawl, but he said that a finding of blight should not be a prerequisite. ""Justifying eminent domain on a finding of blight invariably targets low-income communities,"" he said.The word ""blight"" is not mentioned in the Sensenbrenner bill, which does, however, allow condemnation of contaminated land, known as brownfields. The bill has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but no hearings have been scheduled.That may be because Congress has already passed stop-gap legislation. A vaguely worded rider to an annual appropriations bill in November restricts use of federal funds to support condemnation that ""primarily benefits private entities."" The measure also called for the Government Accountability Office to conduct a yearlong nationwide study.Economic development officials, who contend that property-rights groups have exaggerated the threat from eminent domain, said they welcomed the study. ""The public is understandably upset because they've not been told the whole story,"" said Mr. Shirey of the California Redevelopment Association.'"
"'06-01-18,'0','""It is unacceptable,"" said a German official, who described the letter as ""a lot of nice words without any concrete offer.""Indeed, Ali Asghar Soltaniyeh, Iran's representative to the international nuclear agency in Vienna, said in a telephone interview from Vienna that Iran's decision to resume nuclear fuel research was ""legal and irreversible.""He added: ""We are ready to negotiate with the Europeans and the Russians. It is now their turn to understand us.""He called it unfair that Iran's scientists had not been able to conduct their nuclear research under the freeze, saying, ""The philosophy of telling scientists not to think and research is contrary to human rights principles and the United Nations Charter.""The letter came on a day of intense diplomacy in several capitals.The United States and the Europeans have begun a campaign to lobby some of the 35 nations that make up the decision-making board of the international nuclear agency to support their position that the Iranian nuclear crisis should be dealt with by the Security Council. The board will consider the issue in a special session starting Feb. 2.France, Germany and Britain began drafting a resolution for consideration by the board that calls on Mohamed ElBaradei, the nuclear agency's director, to send a report about Iran's history of deception and lack of full cooperation with the agency to the Security Council, according to two European officials.The officials described the outlines of the draft on condition of anonymity because of normal diplomatic rules.In September, Iran was found in violation of its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty because of nearly two decades of deceiving the agency.The draft resolution also expresses regret that Iran violated its voluntary freeze on sensitive nuclear activities. It asks the Security Council to urge Iran ""to extend full and prompt cooperation"" to the agency. It also requests that the Council inform Iran that ""additional transparency measures are indispensable"" if it hopes to prove that its nuclear program is peaceful and not intended to produce nuclear bombs.The draft, which is in a very early stage, does not include a recommendation of punitive measures like sanctions, the officials said.The strategy of both the United States and Europe is to slowly ratchet up the diplomatic pressure on Iran. A number of governments, including Britain, Germany, France and Japan, have said talk of sanctions is premature, and Russia and China, which wield veto power in the Security Council, oppose sanctions.""We don't see this leading straight into sanctions,"" a senior British official told reporters under the condition that he not be identified, adding: ""We want to build gradual sustained pressure over time. This is a long-term issue.""The official described Iran's call for a renewal of negotiations as ""vacuous because the Iranians have created the conditions to make it impossible to talk.""China and Russia, meanwhile, have shown no willingness to take Iran's case to the Security Council.Asked in a news briefing in Moscow when Russia would be willing to refer Iran to the Security Council, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was vague, saying: ""This is a very schematic approach. Politics allow no such approach."" He added, ""I don't think the I.A.E.A. board of governors has run out of possibilities.""China on Tuesday called for a resumption of negotiations as the best way to defuse the crisis.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Beijing favored diplomacy and urged all sides to ""keep patient and make utmost efforts to resume negotiations"" between the Europeans and Iran.Russia is particularly keen on wresting the diplomatic initiative from the other Europeans by negotiating with Iran to accept its offer to allow Russia to enrich Iran's uranium on Russian soil and under strict Russian control to prevent diversion for a weapons program.Iran's letter to the Europeans also stated Iran's desire to pursue negotiations with Russia as scheduled next month in the belief that they ""will continue seriously and constructively.""Mr. Lavrov on Tuesday reiterated the offer to Iran to enrich Iran's uranium, but he also warned Iran to resume its freeze on all uranium work. ""Talks presuppose an obligation,"" he said. ""The Iranian obligation was to stick to the moratorium.""Iran, he said, ""must do much more than what it has done already.""Underscoring Russia's opposition to sanctions, however, he said: ""The question of sanctions against Iran puts the cart before the horse. Sanctions are in no way the best, or the only, way to solve the problem.""In London, the British official briefing reporters expressed skepticism that the Russian-Iranian talks showed promise.""I think Iran is playing with the Russia proposal for tactical reasons,"" the official said.'"
"'06-01-18,'0','Gustav Humbert, the chief executive of Airbus, said at a news conference here, that 2005 ""was a record year for our industry."" The airlines, he said, ""were ordering at levels never before seen in our history.""Soaring oil prices helped both companies, he said, because they prodded airlines to switch to more fuel-efficient planes. The industry was also buoyed by China and India, which are buying hundreds of planes. Airbus is negotiating with the Chinese to build an assembly line for single-aisle planes there.Mr. Humbert, a German engineer who took the helm at Airbus last year, avoided taking swipes at Boeing. He barely mentioned the trade dispute between the United States and the European Union over aircraft subsidies, currently before the World Trade Organization.But it is clear that Airbus still desperately wants to beat its rival. It trailed Boeing in orders for much of last year before going on a tear in December -- booking 40 percent of its orders in a single month.Boeing, which had predicted it would exceed Airbus in orders, said it would not be drawn into a ""numbers game.""""We had a tremendous year in 2005,"" said Charles Miller, a Boeing spokesman in London. ""We're very happy with where we are, and where we're headed. We wouldn't want to switch places with anyone.""Some analysts say Boeing has redrawn the competitive landscape with Airbus. For much of the last three years, Boeing trailed Airbus but has now regained the edge in a business increasingly dominated by two-aisle, medium-sized planes -- those with 200 to 300 seats.Boeing has 379 orders and commitments for its 787, while Airbus has 172 for its head-to-head rival, the A350. Airbus had predicted it would have 200 orders by the end of 2005. Airbus executives shrugged off the shortfall, saying some orders had been delayed by paperwork.""Counting airplanes is a lot of fun, but you can't pay wages with narrow-body planes,"" said Richard L. Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group, an aerospace consulting firm in Fairfax, Va. ""It was very much Boeing's year, and it raises questions about why Airbus felt they needed to do this.""""Maybe when you've had a decade of positive momentum,"" he added, ""taking a step backward sends a very bad signal.""Mr. Humbert acknowledged that Boeing outperformed Airbus in the wide-body segment of the market, particularly in long-range aircraft, where Boeing's 777 dominated the poorly performing Airbus A340.This has stoked rumors that Airbus may have to redesign the A340, which has four engines rather than two, like the 777. Airbus promotes four engines as safer for the longest flights, some of which go over the North Pole. But airlines find twin-engine planes easier to maintain.""We are not happy with the situation,"" Mr. Humbert said. ""But we should not panic. One year does not make a trend.""Likewise, he sounded relaxed about the A380, which added only 20 new orders in 2005. The double-deck plane, which seats 555 people, has been delayed by production problems. But Charles Champion, the head of the program, said the plane had made 220 test flights, and he expected no further delays.Airbus plans to deliver the first A380 to Singapore Airlines toward the end of this year, and to Qantas and Emirates next year.John J. Leahy, the chief operating officer and head salesman for Airbus, said the company expected to sign two new airlines for the A380 this year. After the A380 goes into service, he predicted, there would be a second wave of orders for the plane, which has 16 customers and 159 orders.Airbus officials were more cautious about the general prospects for 2006. Mr. Humbert said it was unlikely that the industry would enjoy two consecutive record years, though he did not rule it out.Privately, some executives said they worried that continued high fuel prices, and higher interest rates in Europe and the United States, would make it difficult for airlines to finance the purchase of new planes.'"
"'06-01-18,'0','These different types of fuels may have clunky nicknames, like G.T.L. and L.N.G. But they draw big money. Mr. Attiyah rattled off a roster of ventures with Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, Chevron and Sasol of South Africa to produce a new form of diesel from natural gas and said they were expected to invest more than $14 billion in capital over the next five to seven years.This new diesel fuel is far cleaner than the diesel commonly used in passenger cars in Europe and heavy trucks in the United States. Diesel is usually made from the sulfur-laden parts of crude oil and traces its origins to the sturdy 19th-century engine invented by Rudolf Diesel.Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum are working together on one venture to produce cleaner diesel from natural gas that is expected to require $7 billion over the next several years. It would be the single largest investment in Exxon Mobil's history.Qatar, a small peninsula nation off Saudi Arabia, is not alone in what may be the largest multination experiment with alternative fuels. Chevron is building another $3 billion complex in Nigeria to produce 34,000 barrels a day. Elsewhere, Syntroleum, based in Tulsa, Okla., is trying to advance similar ventures in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, while in Algeria, companies including Shell, Statoil of Norway and Sasol of South Africa are vying for a project focused on that country's Tinhert gas field. Energy companies are also looking at gas-rich nations like Australia, Iran, Egypt and Trinidad and Tobago for other projects.By 2015, overall production of this fuel may reach more than one million barrels a day, according to an estimate by Cambridge Energy Research Associates. That is roughly equivalent to Venezuela's current daily oil exports to the United States.Qatar has attracted the largest projects thanks to its plentiful natural gas reserves and an aggressive investment strategy that builds on a longstanding cultivation of American and European energy companies. Only Russia and Iran are believed to have more natural gas than Qatar, a nation of 800,000 people -- mostly foreign laborers -- that is already positioned to soon become the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas.The liquefied natural gas industry in Qatar, however, is much different from the wager on technology to convert gas to a liquid fuel. Liquefied natural gas is extremely complex to transport, requiring an elaborate system of cooling plants near gas deposits, double-hulled tankers and reheating facilities in the markets where the fuel is consumed. Liquefied natural gas is largely used to generate electricity.The gas-to-liquid method, on the other hand, provides an alternative to oil as a transportation fuel. Gas-to-liquids essentially transforms natural gas into liquid diesel that can be transported and sold using existing tankers, refineries and gas stations.Diesel is much more commonplace in Europe than in the United States, where consumers still think of it as a heavily polluting fuel used in big trucks and machinery. Two German scientists, Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch, developed the process in the 1920's after discovering a way of converting coal into a liquid fuel.Energy analysts say gas-to-liquid plants become competitive when oil prices climb above $30 to $35 a barrel, as they have during the last two years. [On Tuesday, crude oil prices closed at $66.31 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, more than double the price on Dec. 31, 2003.]Gas-to-liquid producers contend the fuel might attract a premium in nations looking for alternatives that reduce toxic diesel emissions. A report by the California Energy Commission recently recommended blending the cleaner diesel with existing fuel stocks to meet stringent fuel standards.""One key aspect of the fuel is its low smog formation,"" said Andrew Brown, Shell's country manager in Qatar, who has imported a gas-to-liquid-powered Audi sedan to Doha to show how the fuel burns quietly and without the smell of early forms of diesel.Transforming gas-to-liquids into an environmentally-friendly fuel source is new, even if production methods have already gone through several incarnations. During World War II, Germany developed methods to convert coal into fuel for their army. And, apartheid leaders in South Africa adapted methods to convert coal into a transportation fuel to survive economic isolation.The United States flirted with the method after the oil shocks of the 1970's, but eventually withdrew most funding of synthetic fuel research when oil prices fell. Then, breakthroughs enabled companies to use cleaner-burning natural gas instead of coal to produce a fuel that emits far fewer pollutants than diesel that is made from crude oil.Though methods vary, the process essentially combines natural gas with water and oxygen, then exposes that mixture to cobalt to produce a transparent liquid fuel. This fuel currently amounts to a minuscule portion of total global fuel production, with Shell operating the largest such plant in Bintulu, Malaysia, a pilot operation with output of about 14,700 barrels a day. Overall global oil production, by comparison, is more than 80 million barrels a day.A small experimental plant also exists in Ponca City, Okla., though gas-to-liquid production in the United States is likelier to one day come from coal since the nation's natural gas is expensive and in short supply.Still, worldwide gas-to-liquid production is set to grow rapidly over the next decade. It joins fuel sources like bitumen, which is mined in vast open-pit operations in Canada, and ethanol, which is widely consumed in sugar-cane-rich Brazil, in easing reliance on crude oil for transportation.Although the use of oil in factories and power plants has declined in the last two decades, the United States still relies on oil for more than 95 percent of its transportation needs. Qatar's projects capture the ambitions and risks of turning gas-to-liquid into an internationally viable fuel. The first shipments of gas-to-liquid out of the country are expected to be marketed this year with the opening of Oryx GTL, a venture by Chevron, Sasol and Qatar Petroleum producing 34,000 barrels a day.Shell is also forming a venture with Qatar Petroleum to produce 140,000 barrels a day of gas-to-liquid by 2009. Exxon Mobil's larger venture is aiming for production of 154,000 barrels.Wayne A. Harms, Exxon Mobil's country manager for Qatar, said in an interview in Doha that the company was drilling appraisal wells for the project in the North Field, the world's largest pure natural gas field. Qatar shares the field with Iran, and there are plans to start production by 2011.""Qatar is in a unique position,"" Mr. Harms said, ""in that it has a large field that's accessible, a politically stable government and a good vision of what it's doing.""The dizzying scale of these projects, though, presents challenges for Qatar and its Western partners. Construction costs, for instance, have been climbing in the last year as companies scramble to acquire building material not just in Ras Laffan but also in the capital, Doha, where dozens of skyscrapers are going up. The cost of a bag of cement is up more than 20 percent since the start of 2005, according to the Doha office of Davis Langdon, a construction consulting firm.Higher project costs, as well as concern over managing the extraction of gas from the North Field, weighed on Qatar's abrupt move last year to delay the start of other gas-to-liquid ventures with ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil of Houston.Still, huge projects are finally taking off here above all for one reason. More than any other gas-rich country, Qatar has aggressively seized on new ways of monetizing its natural gas. And Qatar's model is likely to be studied in a world that has more natural gas than oil, with global gas reserves expected to last another 67 years compared with 41 years of annual supply of crude oil, according to BP, the British energy giant.The ample supplies of gas, of course, are far away from the largest markets for the fuel, in industrialized countries. That explains why the investments in Qatar, Nigeria and other countries might signal an extension of the international trade in energy.Even as renewable energy captures the public imagination, hydrocarbons, whether found in oil or natural gas or bitumen, are growing more vital in meeting energy needs. ""It's simply a shift away from crude oil to natural gas,"" said Bernard J. Picchi, international oil and energy technology analyst with Foresight Research Solutions in New York. ""I'm not particularly concerned about the ability of hydrocarbons to survive, even thrive, well into this century.""'"
"'06-01-18,'0','In the last two years, as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen by 12 percent and Pepsi's stock has surged by 29 percent, Coke's stock has fallen by 20 percent.Meeting with investors last month, Mr. Isdell cautioned that Coke was still in the middle of a multiyear turnaround. He emphasized his efforts over the last year to create a strong leadership team, pointing out that half of the top 75 executives at the company were in new roles.While some analysts and investors have called for bold changes at the company, Mr. Isdell has favored a detailed and disciplined following of strategy within the existing framework.""It's a million little things every day,"" he said at the meeting.In an interview yesterday, Mr. Isdell called talk of a succession plan premature and said that Mr. Kent's appointment did not indicate he was being considered as a candidate.""This is a long-term turnaround,"" Mr. Isdell said. ""Muhtar's got a big challenge, and he's got to prove successful in this job before he's a candidate.""Other executives thought to be in line for the top job are Mary Minnick, who was promoted last March to run marketing and innovation; Donald R. Knauss, who heads North America; and Irial Finan, president of global bottling investments.Mr. Isdell said he opted to create the international role rather than fill the empty No. 2 slot, that of chief operating officer, which has been vacant since Steven Heyer left in 2004.Mr. Isdell called Mr. Kent a ""superb operator"" and said he had extensive international experience that would be valuable for the job.Mr. Isdell and Mr. Kent worked together in Eastern Europe in the 1990's and Mr. Isdell credits Mr. Kent with pulling off a turnaround of Coke's business in the former Soviet republics.""Right after the fall of the wall, Pepsi was outselling us in every single country behind the wall by three to one,"" Mr. Isdell said. ""Today we're the leader in all those countries. He was the one who led that charge.""Mr. Kent first joined Coca-Cola in 1978 and most recently oversaw operations in China, Japan, Russia and the Middle East.In 1999, Mr. Kent left Coca-Cola to run the Efes Beverage Group, the largest shareholder of the Coca-Cola franchise in Turkey. He returned to Coke last May. His new job starts Feb. 1.As head of Coke's international operations, Mr. Kent inherits several controversies, notably in Colombia and India. Last month, the University of Michigan became the 10th American university to stop selling Coke products on campus in protest over working conditions at a Coke bottling plant in Colombia and environmental practices in India.Correction: January 19, 2006, Thursday An article in Business Day yesterday about Coca-Cola's decision to appoint an executive to oversee its operations outside North America misstated the company's position compared with a rival, PepsiCo. Pepsi surpassed Coke for a time in terms of market capitalization; not market share.'"

"'06-01-18,'0','Colonel Hall immediately approached his superior officer, Gen. Charles H. Terhune, to ask him for three hours to brief top brass on a plan for a distinctive Air Force solid-propulsion intercontinental ballistic missile. With General Terhune, Colonel Hall briefed Gen. Curtis LeMay, the Air Force deputy chief of staff, on the potential of solid-propellant ICBM's, which he saw as a relatively light three-stage missile.General LeMay was so impressed he arranged for Colonel Hall to brief the secretary of defense, Thomas S. Gates, who supported acceleration of the Air Force effort with $50 million.""He really pulled together the concept for the Minuteman,"" General Terhune said.In 1999, J. D. Hunley, an Air Force historian, wrote that even considering the technical complexity of weapons programs, where assigning individual credit is exceedingly difficult, Colonel Hall was ""pivotal to the development"" of the missile.At the time of the Minuteman project, Colonel Hall had already led development of some of the principal liquid-fuel missiles, the Atlas, Titan and Thor.Edward Nathaniel Hall was born in Forest Hills, Queens, on Aug. 4, 1914. He was the son of a furrier who went bankrupt in the Depression, but he was able to attend the City College of New York, which was then free, where he earned undergraduate and master's degrees in chemical engineering. Later, while in the Air Force, he earned a master's degree in aeronautical engineering (propulsion option) from the California Institute of Technology.In September 1939, as war was beginning in Europe, he joined the Army Air Corps as an enlisted man. Engineers were not given automatic commissions at the time of his enlistment, but he was made a second lieutenant after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.He was sent to England to repair Boeing B-17 bombers and Martin B-24's, both used in the bombing of Germany. In 1943, as a captain, he was awarded the Legion of Merit, an unusual award for a junior officer, for devising a way to repair a bomber's fuselage rapidly.His introduction to missiles came near the end of the war, when he was assigned to acquire intelligence on Germany's wartime propulsion work. He analyzed parts recovered from exploded V-2 rockets or retrieved by spies.At war's end, he led a group to Germany to study underground missile assembly facilities at Camp Dora. He assisted in the division of captured missile equipment between England and the United States.After a second European tour, he was stationed at what is now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio to work on a variety of rockets, including the Bomarc, Navaho, Snark, Rascal and Falcon. In 1951, he was a leading instigator of what became the Atlas program.From November 1953 to February 1954, Colonel Hall served as Wright's representative at meetings of the Air Force group, overseeing ICBM development, popularly known as the Teapot Committee. In August 1954, he moved to Los Angeles.After Minuteman, Colonel Hall worked with NATO to develop an intermediate-range ballistic missile. The result was the only European version of such a weapon, the French Diamant.He retired in 1959, and the next year won a second Legion of Merit. He worked for the United Aircraft Corporation and several other firms, and in 1999 was elected to the Air Force Space and Missile Hall of Fame.In addition to his daughter, who lives in Calabasas, Calif., Colonel Hall is survived by his wife of 62 years, the former Edith Shawcross, and his sons, David, of La Crescenta, Calif., and Jonathan, of Kendall Park, N.J.When inducted into the hall of fame, Colonel Hall suggested that with the end of the cold war, the Minuteman should be used to carry conventional explosives. He said that with a satellite-guided final stage, it would hit with 10 feet of a target thousands of miles distant in less than 30 minutes.""Several of Hall's fellow inductees were not in favor of the proposal due to political considerations,"" the Air Force announcement said, ""but Hall remains enthusiastic.""Correction: January 25, 2006, Wednesday An obituary on Jan. 18 about Edward Hall, who supervised the development of the Minuteman missile, misidentified the developer of the B-24 bombers, which he repaired in England in World War II. It was the Consolidated Aircraft Corporation, which later merged with Vultee Aircraft to form Consolidated-Vultee Aircraft, or Convair, and not the Glen L. Martin Company, now part of Lockheed Martin, which developed other bombers, including the B-26.'"
"'06-01-18,'0','""Executives have richly rewarded themselves,"" Greg Davidowitch, president of the Association of Flight Attendants at United, said. ""In medieval times, people guilty of this kind of greed would have been boiled in oil.""United defended the plan as reasonable and customary for a company emerging from bankruptcy. It reduced the amount last week to 10 million shares, or 8 percent of the company, after creditors objected to the initial proposal of 18.75 million shares, or 15 percent.A United spokeswoman, Jean Medina, said the plan would help retain talented people. She added, ""The value of these grants is theoretical.""Indeed, the stock awards would vest over four years and the price of United shares can be expected to be volatile. According to the court filings, 20 percent of the grants will vest after six months, another 20 percent after one year and 20 percent in each of the following three years.As United prepares to exit bankruptcy, about $28 billion in unsecured claims held by workers, businesses and the federal agency that took over United pension plans will be converted into 125 million shares of common stock, including the shares that go to management.Trading in those claims is a way, before the bankruptcy exit, to invest in United stock. The airline earlier estimated, based on the expected overall value of the company, that the claims would be worth 4 to 8 cents on the dollar.But with the industry on the mend, investors have been willing to pay more. Last week, on behalf of about 2,000 United pilots, Athena Advisory Group auctioned unsecured claims with a face value of $720 million, receiving slightly more than 24 cents on the dollar, said Stephen Presser, a senior partner at Athena and the financial adviser for the pilots.That is up from about 11 cents on smaller sales by creditors other than pilots about six to eight weeks ago, Mr. Presser said.""We're happy with that result,"" he said. ""It probably means the stock is going to trade out of the box pretty robustly."" Old UAL shares are being canceled and have no value.The pilots' claim sale was earlier reported by a Standard & Poor's newsletter, Leveraged Commentary & Data. Mr. Presser said hedge funds interested in owning United shares had been buying the claims. Deutsche Bank bought the claims on behalf of clients. Deutsche Bank would not comment.The sale price for the claims translates into about $48 for each of the 125 million new shares to be issued upon exit from bankruptcy. That implies a value of about $6 billion for the company, Michael Linenberg, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, wrote after the pilots' claims sale. He added that the management stake of 8 percent would be valued at $480 million.A United adviser, Rothschild, had estimated the postbankruptcy value of the stock at $319 million to $3.45 billion.Mr. Presser said a senior United pilot could have a claim of as much as $600,000 for lost pension and wages and could have realized in the claims sale close to $150,000 cash.About 20 percent of the pilots holding claims chose to sell. The others are holding on, apparently hoping the airline does well enough to send its new shares higher. Other United workers also hold unsecured claims.Steve Derebey, 54, a union official who has been a United pilot for 17 years, said he sold his claims. Pilots formerly owned a big stake in United and watched it become worthless. Also, the termination of United pension plans means that Mr. Derebey will receive monthly payments of about $2,200 when he turns 60, mandatory retirement age for airline pilots, instead of the $6,000 he had anticipated, he said.""I have a bad feeling about airline stocks in general,"" Mr. Derebey said. ""I have no interest in it as an investment. I've been burned in the past. This is a lump sum I can put into my retirement account.""United has projected a modest profit for 2006, excluding one-time gains related to the bankruptcy, and rising profit each of the next four years.Other airline stocks have rallied in recent months on improved industry conditions, even as high fuel costs and bankruptcies have produced some big losses. But the industry remains highly vulnerable to any economic slowdown, labor battles, another surge in fuel costs or any terrorism event that frightens travelers.'"
"'06-01-18,'0','The charges are part of a broad investigation that Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the United States attorney here, says has lifted the veil of secrecy on organized crime in the city.Like Mr. Lombardo, many of the other 13 men charged last April in connection with a string of unsolved killings dating back four decades are older than most defendants. Two of them, including a 78-year-old, have died of natural causes since the indictments were handed up.Mr. Lombardo's lawyer, Rick Halprin, said Mr. Lombardo had also had health issues, hardening of the arteries, hearing loss and in recent months a gain of extra pounds around his midsection.""But his spirits are fine,"" Mr. Halprin said in an interview. ""He's full of fight. He thinks he's going to be acquitted, and so do I.""Still unanswered was where Mr. Lombardo had been since last April, and how he had managed to elude the authorities. As the search for him went on, many Chicagoans had speculated that Mr. Lombardo was long gone, in some other state, or, more likely, some other country.But his arrest on Friday night suggested that he might never have gone far at all. He was found in the passenger seat of a silver Lincoln, parked in an alley behind a home in Elmwood Park, a suburb 11 miles from Chicago's Loop. The driver of the car, an elderly man, was not arrested, but agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation said they were now trying to determine whether anyone had knowingly helped Mr. Lombardo avoid them.""Where he's been is something we're going to try to piece together over the next few weeks,"" said Ross Rice, a spokesman for the F.B.I. in Chicago.Aside from ""good investigative work,"" Mr. Rice would not say precisely how the agents arrived in the right suburban alley on Friday.That night, Mr. Lombardo's hair was uncharacteristically long, and he had grown a wild, snow white beard, a look agents likened to that of Saddam Hussein when he was captured in Iraq.In meetings with his client, Mr. Halprin said he had strongly recommended that he get rid of ""that horrible beard, perhaps with the help of a Weedwacker.""In court on Tuesday, Mr. Lombardo was cleanshaven, his hair trim. And between his blue prison sneakers, leg irons were visible.'"
"'06-01-18,'0','Mr. Dunn said the state saw no reason to adjust results and would continue to administer the second part of the test today. ""The test is valid,"" he said. ""To confirm this, we will review completed tests to determine whether there are any irregularities in the answer patterns."" Statewide, about 225,000 students are taking the seventh-grade test.Some parents said the glitch had caused additional stress for their already anxious children. ""My daughter was hysterical,"" said Andrea Lella, whose daughter attends Intermediate School 7 on Staten Island. ""She was convinced she messed it up and she was going to be held over.""But Ms. Lella also said her daughter had been given clear instructions on relabeling the answer choices. ""The school handled it wonderfully with the instructions, but it was overwhelming,"" she said.Critics of standardized testing and of Mr. Bloomberg's promotion policies immediately seized on the problem. ""We are sick and tired of these tests and especially the high-stakes nature of the tests when these tests are so deeply flawed,"" said Jane R. Hirschmann, a leader of Time Out From Testing, a group that has battled against standardized tests. ""The state needs to come forward and the city and say this test is invalid, and it will not be used.""Ms. Hirschmann also said the state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, should be dismissed or forced to resign.State officials have tangled repeatedly with Ms. Hirschmann and her group, and Mr. Dunn, the state spokesman, declined yesterday to respond to her comments.Mr. Dunn said that while the exam booklet had been prepared by CTB/McGraw Hill, the test publisher, answer sheets are devised regionally.He said that city officials had submitted the flawed answer sheet to the state for approval and that officials had not caught the error. ""It's a mistake that got past both of us,"" he said.City officials said yesterday that they did not receive widespread reports of confusion or complaints. ""We acknowledge that a mistake was made,"" said Stephen Morello, a spokesman for the city's Education Department. ""Given the steps that we took, to advise students through teachers, we expect that the error should not have a significant effect on student performance on the test.""City officials said they, too, would analyze the results to make sure there were no irregularities. In cases where students may have been confused by the answer sheet and instead circled answers in their test booklets, those answers will be noted, officials said.In 2004, the city had a similar problem on a makeup test for third graders. Officials said that on that test, even with much younger children, there had been no significant impact on scores.The answer choices on yesterday's seventh-grade test were supposed to alternate, with A, B, C and D as the choices for odd-numbered questions, and F, G, H and J as the choices for even-numbered questions, continuing on through the 28-question, 50-minute exam.But Question 17 was not a multiple-choice item. It required a reply to be written into the exam booklet, throwing off the pattern for five questions, until Question 23, which required another write-in response. As a result, the correct pattern was restored on Question 24.The president of the city teachers' union, Randi Weingarten, said she faulted state officials for the error. ""I may be old-fashioned, but what is so wrong with having a test booklet when you have multiple choice questions where the answers are consistently A through D?"" she asked. ""What is going on that people seem to feel the need to confuse children instead of just making it simple?""'"
"'06-01-18,'0','""They said it would be put on hold,"" said Nabil Fahmy, the Egyptian ambassador here.For several months, Egyptian and American officials have been in preliminary discussions. In October, Rob Portman, the United States trade representative, told Congress that the administration was considering negotiating trade agreements with Egypt and three other Middle Eastern countries.After that, an Egyptian official said, the administration promised that the beginning of fast-track, official negotiations would be announced this month with the goal of completing them by summer.But the senior administration official said while the trade agreement ""remains on the agenda, we are looking at it as part of our overall relationship, and issues of democracy are not unrelated."" He declined to be quoted by name, citing government rules.Vice President Dick Cheney was in Cairo on Tuesday, meeting with President Mubarak, and the Egyptian government said the subject of trade talks had come up. No details were made public. Separately, Egyptian authorities denied a request by Representative Frank R. Wolf, a Virginia Republican, to meet with Mr. Nour, Reuters reported. The congressman was informed Tuesday that the visit would not be allowed.Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, asked about the issue at a briefing on Tuesday, said that ""we have been working with them in the area of trade,"" but added that the administration was also talking to Cairo ""about our serious concerns regarding the recent elections.""During parliamentary elections in November and December, security forces opened fire on Egyptians while other attackers wielding machetes, knives and axes intimidated voters.Mr. McCormack added, ""We believe that these things are interlocked: democratic reforms, good governance going hand in hand with the expansion of economic opportunities and the expansion of trade.""Egyptian officials portrayed the decision as a result of concern about public perception. They declined to be quoted by name, saying they did not want to inflame the debate.The senior American official said in response that ""after the violent, flawed elections"" and then Mr. Nour's imprisonment, ""it is time to take a pause.""'"
"'06-01-18,'0','""What the court decision means is simply that you won't have federal agents trying to put an end to this in the state of Oregon,"" said Dr. Timothy E. Quill, a professor of medicine and psychiatry at the University of Rochester, who is a prominent supporter of physician-assisted suicide. ""We were very fearful of what might have happened had the ruling gone the other way.""Here in Oregon, the issue was initially contentious, passed by a bare margin in 1994. But the more that people outside the state criticized the law, the more support it gained here. When it came up for a second referendum in 1997, it was upheld 60 to 40.""I would not expect to see an increase in doctor-assisted suicides here,"" said Mary Williams, Oregon's solicitor general. ""But I do expect more states will at least have discussion now.""But states have been free to enact such laws, and they have not followed Oregon's example. Mr. Ashcroft did not issue his interpretation of the Controlled Substances Act until 2001, and it was soon enjoined. The federal government lost in the courts every step of the way.One question now is whether the debate will move from the court to Congress. Peg Sandeen, executive director of the Death With Dignity National Center in Portland, said her group would move to push legislation or voter initiatives in several states.But Ms. Sandeen said the organization was concerned that ""a Congress that would intervene in the death of Terri Schiavo"" might be galvanized into action by this decision.Still, Tuesday's decision may prompt lawmakers in some states to give the matter a fresh look.""This decision gives the green light to the rest of the nation to move forward with assisted-suicide laws,"" said Mathew D. Staver, president of Liberty Counsel, which filed a brief supporting the federal government in the Oregon case. ""This particular case was either going to close the door or to open it, and it opened it.""In the handful of states where a similar measure has been under consideration, supporters of assisted suicide said they hoped the court decision would give their fledgling efforts a boost.""This will be a tremendous momentum builder for Vermont and other states who want to bring compassionate care to end-of-life issues,"" said Dr. David Babbott, a board member of Death With Dignity Vermont.Lloyd E. Levine, a Democratic assemblyman in California who is a sponsor of a California bill that largely tracks the Oregon law, said he was hopeful that Tuesday's decision would help propel his bill into law this year.Opponents of assisted suicide said Tuesday's decision was a narrow and technical one that did not endorse any particular approach to these issues, but rather freed the states from one potential impediment to enacting whatever laws voters considered appropriate.""I don't think its impact will be great,"" Dr. Robert D. Orr, the president of the Vermont Alliance for Ethical Healthcare, said of the decision. ""Some have misunderstood the Oregon case as a challenge to the Oregon statute itself.""The Oregon law was initially held up by an injunction, and not fully put into effect until 1998. Since then, through 2004, a total of 208 people have taken their lives by lethal injection with a physician-prescribed drug, usually a barbiturate.Critics had said Oregon would become a suicide center, with people flying in to end their lives. They also predicted that the law would be unfairly used against uneducated people or those without health insurance or adequate medical choices.In the seven full years since the law has been in effect and records have been kept, more than 60 percent of those who have killed themselves have had some college education, the state reported.Nora Miller, whose husband, Rick, took his life here in Portland in 1999, after he was given less than six months to live with a diagnosis of terminal lung cancer, said the Oregon law allowed for a peaceful and relatively pain-free end to his life.""He was worried about being unconscious and completely out of it,"" said Ms. Miller, whose husband was 52. ""But it was as good a death as he could have hoped for.""She praised the court decision as a backing of individual liberty.""This country was founded on the idea that you should be able to make these kinds of decisions without government interference,"" Ms. Miller said.But the leader of a group of Oregon physicians who have long opposed the measure, Dr. Kenneth Stevens, said the medical community had long had ways to help people deal with pain at the end of their lives.""I've been taking care of cancer patients for more than 30 years,"" Dr. Stevens said, ""and I feel helping people kill themselves is not something doctors should be doing.""Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski of Oregon said one effect of the decision would be to allow innovative states like Oregon to continue to be laboratories for new ideas.""The U.S. Supreme Court recognized the delicate balance between our federal system and the right of the states to be the crucibles for new ideas and new ways to meet the changing needs of their citizens,"" Mr. Kulongoski said. ""Medical issues traditionally fall within the purview of the states, and today the U.S. Supreme Court strengthened that tradition.""News Analysis Correction: January 20, 2006, Friday A news analysis article on Wednesday about the Supreme Court decision rejecting the Justice Department's effort to block Oregon's assisted suicide law referred incorrectly to the use of drugs prescribed under the law.

But when it became clear that Ziggy could not be taught to stop saying ""Gary,"" Mr. Taylor found a new home for the bird through a dealer.""I felt like I'd been stabbed through the heart every time my phone rang or he heard the name on the telly,"" he said.As for Ms. Collins, she and Mr. Taylor split up the evening of the ""I love you, Gary"" incident.Tracked down by the newspapers at the home of friends, Ms. Collins (who has since split up with Gary, too) said that while she was not proud of what had happened, she and Mr. Taylor had been having problems and would have broken up anyway. Nor, she said, had she ever taken to the bird, resenting Mr. Taylor for preferring to stay home with Ziggy rather than go out with her.""I'm surprised to hear he's got rid of that bloody bird,"" Ms. Collins was quoted as saying. ""He spent more time talking to it than he did to me."" She added, speaking of Ziggy: ""I couldn't stand him, and it looks now like the feeling was mutual.""Editors' Note: January 21, 2006, Saturday An article on Wednesday about infidelity exposed by a chatty parrot described the way the parrot, owned by a man living with his girlfriend in Leeds, England, kept screeching the name of the woman's secret lover.

"'06-01-18,'0','Intel has been facing intense competition from Advanced Micro Devices, which reports its fourth-quarter results Wednesday. Mr. Bryant said Intel had probably lost about a percentage point of market share in the fourth quarter.But Paul S. Otellini, Intel's chief executive, told analysts that he felt Intel would regain market share as the company ramped up its dual-core processor line this year.""We will be able to retake share in 2006,"" Mr. Otellini said. ""We're starting out in more of a hole than we had thought.""The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said the shortage of chipsets meant it was not able to sell as many desktop computer processors as expected. Intel executives also blamed the revenue shortfall on lower-than-expected prices.Net profit was $2.45 billion, or 40 cents a share, for the quarter, up 16 percent, compared with a profit of $2.12 billion, or 33 cents a share, in the period in 2004. Wall Street analysts had forecast that the company would earn 43 cents a share on sales of $10.56 billion, according to a survey by Thomson Financial.The report drove Intel's shares down more than 9 percent in after-hours trading; they closed down 27 cents, or roughly 1 percent, at $25.52, at the close.Further disappointing Wall Street, Intel executives said first-quarter revenue was likely to be lower than expected as well. The company forecast first-quarter revenue of $9.1 billion to $9.7 billion, below the Wall Street consensus estimate of $10.05 billion.On Tuesday, Intel was buoyed by a Merrill Lynch analyst report that warned that A.M.D. might not be able to maintain its growth in the face of Intel's arsenal of new products. Merrill Lynch downgraded A.M.D. stock from neutral to sell. In his report, Joe Osha wrote that the ""Intel product road map should show improvement during 2006.""Shares of A.M.D. fell $1.27, to close at $32.86.But negative news about A.M.D. did not alter Wall Street's concerns about Intel.Tim Luke, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, called Intel's guidance for the first quarter ""disappointing,"" and he said it would lead investors to question whether Intel could stem the loss of market share as quickly as company executives would like.Intel's gross margin was 61.8 percent in the fourth quarter, below the company's expectation of 63 percent. The company said revenue in the Asia Pacific region was essentially flat from the third quarter, and that revenue in North and South America was down from the third quarter.The company expects gross margin for the first quarter to reach 59 percent.Intel's failure to meet expectations came as a surprise to investors on Tuesday because the company announced in December that it was narrowing its forecast to $10.4 billion to $10.6 billion, but did not lower the estimate.At the time, Mr. Bryant told investors that a shortage of chipsets had most likely caused A.M.D. to gain market share from Intel, but that Intel was benefiting from strong sales of notebook computers.Because the quarterly report proved to be a surprise even to Intel, the company said it would no longer provide midquarter financial updates as it has long done.'"
"'06-01-18,'0','Tongsun Park, a South Korean lobbyist who is facing charges in the United Nations' scandal-ridden oil-for-food program, told prosecutors more than a year ago that he would testify before a grand jury, but then they let him leave the United States and he did not return.Mr. Park, who was in court yesterday, was arrested Jan. 6 in Houston, after he was expelled from Mexico. New details on his whereabouts over the past year emerged during a sharp argument between the prosecutors and Mr. Park's lawyer over whether he would flee if granted bail.The government announced charges against Mr. Park in April 2005 for acting as an unregistered agent for the government of Saddam Hussein in talks to set up the United Nations aid program.Mr. Park ""is a guaranteed risk of flight,"" an assistant United States attorney, Stephen Miller, told Magistrate Judge Theodore H. Katz in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Miller said Mr. Park had ""fled back to South Korea"" after he was served in December 2004 with a grand jury subpoena at the Watergate hotel in Washington.But when questioned by the judge, prosecutors acknowledged they had allowed Mr. Park to return to South Korea for the 2004 Christmas holiday based on his pledge that he would return to face the grand jury.A business associate of Mr. Park's, an Iraqi-American businessman, Samir Vincent, pleaded guilty to illegal lobbying charges in January 2005. Mr. Park then withdrew his offer to testify and refused to return to the United States, saying he was too ill to travel, prosecutors said.'"
"'06-01-18,'0','THE specialty grocer Trader Joe's will open a store near Union Square in about three months, a spokeswoman said yesterday, confirming a year's worth of reports that the national chain would join a growing list of food stores along 14th Street.Trader Joe's, based in Monrovia, Calif., is best known for low-priced groceries and prepared and frozen foods. About 80 percent of what it sells carries the Trader Joe's label. A little more than a third of its merchandise is fresh, but also packaged.It is also known for selling cheap Charles Shaw wine, known as Two-Buck Chuck because it sold for $2 a bottle when it was first offered.The company, which has 250 stores in 19 states, will open at 142 East 14th Street, with a separate wine shop next door at 138 East 14th Street. It has 19 stores in the New York area, but none in New York City.The spokeswoman, Alison Mochizuki, said there were no plans for other stores in the city.At 15,000 square feet, including the wine shop, the new Trader Joe's will be less than a third the size of the Whole Foods that opened last year at 4 Union Square South. Balducci's recently opened a 10,000-square-foot store at Eighth Avenue and 14th Street, Garden of Eden has a store at 14th Street and Fifth Avenue, and four days a week, the city's flagship Greenmarket is in Union Square.'"
"'06-01-18,'0','Yahoo said yesterday that its profit rose 80 percent in the fourth quarter, but after deducting several special items, it fell short of Wall Street's expectations. Moreover, Yahoo, which runs the world's largest Internet portal, predicted slower revenue growth in the year ahead, with reduced profit margins.As a result, Yahoo's shares fell nearly 13 percent, to $34.96, as traders digested the results, announced after the regular market session. (Shares of its main rival, Google, fell as well, dropping to $449.20, down almost 4 percent, in after-hours trading.)In forecasting a slowdown in growth, the company said it would have to give other Web sites a greater share of the money it took in from selling ads on their sites.Yahoo faces vigorous competition in this area from Google, the leader in Internet advertising sales, and Microsoft, which is entering the area. Microsoft, in fact, had used Yahoo to sell search-related advertising on its MSN service, but is shifting to its own system. As a result, Yahoo, which earned $75 million selling ads on MSN last year, expects only $25 million from Microsoft this year as the deal runs out.Moreover, Yahoo has been forced to compete with Google, which it admits has better technology for selecting ads to place on a given Web page that will lure users to click on them. Since search advertisers pay only for an ad that gets a click, Google can earn significantly more money for each page than Yahoo does. So Yahoo has to make up the difference with Web site owners to win their business.'"

"'06-01-19,'1','Over all, the Consumer Price Index was up 3.4 percent in 2005, the highest since 2000, largely reflecting an increase in energy prices even before hurricanes hit the Gulf Coast in late summer. The core rate was up 2.2 percent, the same as in 2004.For consumers, 2005 was a year of price increases. Energy prices were up 17.1 percent for the year and transportation, which is heavily influenced by energy, was up 4.8 percent for the year. The price for medical care, a persistent source of worry for Americans and their employers, jumped 4.3 percent last year. Rents climbed 3.1 percent and the cost of sleeping in a hotel room rose 3.5 percent.Those cost increases wiped away the gains that many Americans saw in their paychecks. Average weekly wages in manufacturing and nonsupervisory jobs, which were up 3.1 percent in 2005 in nominal dollar terms, fell by 0.4 percent when adjusted for inflation, the Labor Department said in another report.But consumers could buy more clothes, cars and computers for their dollars last year, as prices for those goods fell.While the December consumer prices report puts to rest the worries about sharply higher inflation that flared up in the months immediately after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita disrupted energy supplies, they do not completely eliminate concerns for the coming year.Economists said policy makers at the Federal Reserve would view the increase in nonenergy costs with some anxiety, especially if the increases continue at their current pace. ""You are getting to a point where you are quite close to their toleration threshold on inflation,"" said David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley.Many investors and analysts expect that the Fed -- which is expected to get a new chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to succeed Alan Greenspan on Feb. 1 -- will raise its benchmark short-term interest rate, currently at 4.25 percent, to 4.5 percent or 4.75 percent and then stop. But Mr. Greenlaw and other economists said a continuation of 0.2 percent increases in monthly core prices, which when annualized amount to an inflation rate of about 2.4 percent, could prompt the Fed to raise rates above current expectations.The Federal Reserve will consult its beige book, the survey released yesterday that painted a broadly positive picture of the economy, when its interest-rate setting committee meets again on Jan. 31. On inflation, the survey characterized wage increases as moderate and raw material price increases as ""less intense at year-end than earlier.""The Fed also observed that most of the nation was experiencing a slowdown in housing, though sales and construction activity in Texas, parts of the Midwest and on the hurricane-ravaged Gulf Coast was ""brisk."" Holiday retail sales were described as higher than last year and manufacturing was experiencing a ""robust expansion,"" the survey said.'"
"'06-01-19,'1','The Italian dancer and choreographer Emio Greco and the Dutch director Pieter C. Scholten formed their Emio Greco/PC company 11 years ago, and on Tuesday night they presented their hit from 2001, ""Conjunto di NERO,"" for a week's run at the Joyce Theater.As European intellectuals, the two men are given to elaborate philosophical explications of their intentions. Without wishing to sound like some philistine Anglo-American pragmatist, I found it easier to enjoy their 70-minute piece (plus a prelude as the audience files in) on a visceral level. Where it works very well.The title translates as ""Conjunction of Black,"" and this is work that plays with darkness to compelling effect. The sides and back of the stage, until the end, are black, fading to infinity. In the prelude a dancer (Suzan Tunca) can be barely seen moving in a strip of light at the rear; you can make out her feet in silhouette, sometimes her hands. There is a low, mechanically repetitive throbbing sound.As the piece proper begins, Ms. Tunca is revealed facing the rear of the stage on pointe (Mr. Greco's early training was in ballet), wearing the same woolly black, dimly translucent shift they all wear (until Mr. Greco strips to his shorts).The piece consists of Mr. Greco, Ms. Tunca and four others -- Ty Boomershine, Sawami Fukuoka, Barbara Meneses Gutiérrez and Nicola Monaco -- dancing together in various combinations, in precisely rehearsed and executed synchronization. Their movements are intense and fierce, with lots of sharp leg thrusts, twists and flailing arms. At one point three of them lie on the floor, banging their heads on the ground.The movement is coordinated with the ambitious, brilliantly realized lighting (by Henk Danner), which sometimes crisscrosses the stage on the diagonal, sometimes consists of strips of light that gradually fill the floor, sometimes offers pale rectangles or rectangular black holes. Toward the end little red lights appear along the back, and finally the sides and rear are lighted to reveal more woolly black material.'"
"'06-01-19,'1','The sessions available from companies like iTrain and GYMp3 vary: some are tailor-made for certain cardio machines or for use with strength-training equipment. Some offer calisthenics that can be done with little or no gear. And others guide practitioners through yoga or Pilates routines. (Individual workouts cost $2 to $15; subscriptions are more.)Critics say that MP3 workouts can be risky, because not all of them offer clear and reliable advice on proper form. Still, with iPods commonplace among gymgoers, MP3 workouts stand to do as much as video workouts once did to reshape the way people exercise.""There is going to be an explosion of downloadable workouts,"" said Gregory Florez, a technology columnist for Fitness Business Pro, an industry magazine. ""The market is asking for them, because they are inexpensive, they make workouts less boring, make the time go faster, and you get some guidance"" to make workouts more efficient.Audio trainers offer many of the same benefits live trainers do -- tips on good form, coaching, encouragement -- without the expense or trouble it takes to meet a professional at a gym.Even a disembodied voice can provide ""companionship and connection,"" said Kate Hays, a sports psychologist in Toronto. ""There is another person with me, so I'm not all alone with the pain in my thighs."" And in the case of an audio coach, ""you are connecting with a someone who is nonjudgmental, supportive, informative and isn't going to laugh at you,"" she added. ""What more could you want?""MP3 exercise downloads are also convenient. Cheryl Gresham, 32, an associate media director for an ad agency in Los Angeles, takes a treadmill or cycling workout she has downloaded from i-train.com on business trips. ""I kind of like having that voice in your ear,"" Ms. Gresham said. ""It blocks out that voice inside your head that says, 'I'm going to stop now because I'm too tired.' ""Josh Phillips, 26, a model in Los Angeles, uses iTrain downloads too, not for the motivation but for the game plans they provide. Whether he is lifting weights or running on the treadmill, he said, ""I don't have to come up with something on my own.""ITrain offers 10 kinds of MP3 sessions, including the iStretch combination, which mixes yoga, Pilates and dance.Less than a year old, iAmplify offers more than 100 MP3 workouts, the most extensive library online. One best seller is a program called ""Tank Top Tone Up"" aimed at banishing arm jiggle. Exercise physiologists vet iAmplify's fitness tracks to ensure that they provide instruction in proper form. But iAmplify's production quality has come in for much criticism online. Several contributors to videofitness.com's forum have noted problems like background noise, ""popping"" sounds that come from talking too close to the microphone, and an instructor who sounds ""like she's in a wind tunnel.""Exercisers have also complained about the iAmplify programs that have no music. But Murray Hidary, a co-founder of iAmplify, said the company offers some voice-only workouts because most gyms play their own lineup of tunes, and some users ""don't want competing music.""Most makers of fitness downloads say that the music is a key to motivating people. ""The iPod or MP3 revolution allows people to work out longer,"" said Grace Lazenby, the personal trainer who co-founded iTrain. Exercise MP3's work best, users say, when the music is matched to the effort. ""I really feel that when I'm running, I'm running to the beat,"" said Ingrid Wollmer, a personal trainer at PowerHouse Gym in Bridgewater, N.J., who recommends Cardio Coach to her clients.Not all exercisers like the same music, but companies that make MP3 workouts generally let buyers sample the audios before they buy. Sampling also allows users to evaluate a trainer's style of coaching.Step-by-step picture guides accompany many complicated MP3 workouts, like those for yoga and Pilates or weight lifting. But if users do not bother to bring the visual guides to the gym, some exercise physiologists say, they may hurt themselves.Mr. Florez and others say that exercisers risk injury with all MP3 workouts because they involve no face-to-face assessments from personal trainers.Some strength-training moves are challenging to explain in words alone, said Jonathan Cane, a co-author of ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Weight Training."" He mentioned the diagonal lunge, for example. ""Even if you describe it perfectly, it's going to go over some people's heads,"" he said.Beginners may want to hire a personal trainer to learn the basics before doing a strength-training MP3 program, Mr. Cane said. Or steer clear of free weights in favor of a machine-only workout like Mike Cornell's Transformation, available at beitfit.com. ""If a person is deconditioned, in the beginning you want to have that support,"" explained Mr. Cornell, a personal trainer in Los Angeles who designed his first routine for novices.But some exercisers find that audio trainers help them prevent injury. Last year, after hurting herself by hoisting too heavy a weight, Colleen Van Rooyen, 43, from Johannesburg, South Africa, downloaded weight-training programs from www.muscleaudio.com. Four times a week she records her workout results on the site, and then David Greenwalt, the audio trainer, suggests appropriate loads. ""I've never hurt myself with what he's suggested I do,"" Ms. Van Rooyen said.Starting in mid-February, subscribers to podfitness.com will be able to download daily customized strength or cardio workouts for $19.95 a month. They will have the option of selecting their own music. ""If you want to do yoga to heavy metal, you can,"" said Teri Sundh, the executive vice president of strategic development.Mrs. Balasubramanian now uses Cardio Coach three times a week. Without listening to Mr. O'Malley's you-can-do-it support, she said, she would never be able to run as far. But when she hops on the treadmill with her brand-new iPod nano, she said, ""I feel like he's watching me, and I just have to prove I can do it.""'"

That's why the government is concerned.""Mr. McGuire was appointed by a court and said he left Oklahoma City for Tulsa in 1996 after repeated harassment for taking the case.The federal Bureau of Prisons sent a brief notification to survivors and victims' families this week that Mr. Fortier would be released on Friday after serving 10 1/2 years of his 12-year sentence. A spokeswoman for the bureau declined to provide particulars of the release, respond to questions or even confirm that the letters went out. The United States Marshals Service and Justice Department also refused to comment.Mr. McGuire would not say where Mr. Fortier had been incarcerated or where he and his wife, Lori, who also testified and has been living in Arizona with their two children, would go now. He described Mr. Fortier as ""tremendously thrilled with the prospect of finally being released"" and ""excited about his future.""""He's going to put all his resources into providing for his family,"" Mr. McGuire said.He said the Fortiers would not speak to reporters. Reached by phone, Mr. Fortier's mother, Irene, in Kingman, Ariz., said she had nothing to say and hung up.Mr. Fortier and his wife had advance knowledge of the plot by Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols to bomb the Federal Building in retaliation for the federal siege of the Branch Davidian complex near Waco, Tex., in 1993, the Fortiers' testimony later showed.As far back as the summer of 1994, some nine months before the truck bombing, Mr. Fortier testified, Mr. McVeigh, an old Army buddy, ""told me they were planning on bombing a building.""A few months later, Lori Fortier testified, Mr. McVeigh sat in their trailer home and diagrammed the bombing and on a later occasion set up 12 soup cans to show how he would rig the barrels of explosives.Mr. Fortier also testified to transporting stolen weapons that helped finance the scheme.With his wife, he initially lied to F.B.I. agents about their involvement. But after negotiations in the face of charges that could have sent him to prison for 23 years, he agreed to plead guilty to four counts involving transporting stolen weapons and concealing the conspiracy and become the star witness in the trials of Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols.Mr. McVeigh was convicted in the bombing and executed in 2001. Mr. Nichols is serving life without parole.While unease over Mr. Fortier's release had been on the minds of survivors and relatives of victims for months, the Bureau of Prisons notification that reached many families on Tuesday caught them by surprise.""I knew it was coming up, but I didn't know it would be the day before my birthday,"" said John Cole, who lost two godsons in the blast.Mr. Cole said he considered Mr. Fortier and his wife culpable for not exposing the scheme. As a result, he said, ""they should be right up there with Terry Nichols.""Ms. Hill, the survivor who took the coffee break, said she ""was fine"" with Mr. Fortier's plea bargain at the time it was reached, ""but now that I know he's wandering around, I'm wondering, are they monitoring him because of his past and beliefs?""""We don't know if any of that stuff has changed,"" she said.Ken Thompson, external affairs director of the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, the organization in Oklahoma City formed to commemorate the victims, said he understood the consternation but did not fully share it.""Most people understand that if it wasn't for him as a witness we might not have had these verdicts,"" said Mr. Thompson, whose mother was killed in the bombing.'"

Alienware, makers of high-end, U.F.O.-themed PC's, rises to the challenge with its ALX system.The ALX is a monster. Inside is a gigabyte of ultrafast memory and an Advanced Micro Devices Athlon 64 FX-60+ processor, a special chip with two separate processing centers. This splits up many processor-intensive tasks that are mostly required while playing games, modifying graphics or playing video, and leads to a substantial increase in performance. While the processor's clock speed of 2.6 gigahertz is about average for a modern PC, A.M.D. says the chip is 34 percent more efficient at rendering 3-D graphics.The ALX also has two graphics cards running in parallel, allowing all of the graphics processing to be handed off to two specialized chips. These cards alone have 512 megabytes of memory on board to handle 3-D games and video.Within its futuristic heart, the ALX beats with liquid coolant, which is needed because its components can give off as much heat as 10 100-watt light bulbs.A standard beige PC is fine for paying bills and surfing the Internet, but the ALX could come in handy when games and other important matters beckon.'"
"'06-01-19,'1','Not so much fun for those here who fought for the smoking ban -- one of the growing number of such restrictions around the country -- who said they found the lounge puzzling, disconcerting and possibly illegal.""This is not what I intended,"" Alderman Ed Smith, who led efforts to pass the ordinance here, said Wednesday. ""I am going to have to make some calls to find out if it's really allowed.""Some antismoking advocates nationally said they worried that the Chicago store might mark a new front in the tobacco industry's efforts to market their products as glamorous, particularly to a young, cutting-edge audience, despite efforts by the industry to comply with a 1998 settlement agreement with scores of states that limits advertising.""It's trying to get an 18-to-25 demographic here, to make smoking seem desirable, attractive, like a secret club,"" said Bronson Frick, associate director for Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, a group based in Berkeley, Calif.Regardless, on Wednesday afternoon, Sean Fahey, 29, wandered by, stood at the smoking bar and sucked deeply and quizzically on his first Oriental Rose -- a step up, he said, from his plain old Camels. (The Marshall McGearty cigarettes are sold by the pack for $8, about $2 more than most commercial brands, and carry the customary warning.)""More and more places like this are sure to open up,"" Mr. Fahey said. ""No one is going to stop smoking because of a ban, but maybe people can start treating cigarettes like this more like alcohol -- the kind of thing you savor.""That was just the image the creators of Marshall McGearty might have had in mind two years ago, when they began dreaming up the mixes of leaves (nine types described in a glossy lounge guide, a menu for cigarettes, in three categories, ""light and smooth,"" ""mellow and flavorful,"" or ""rich and full-bodied"") and, of course, dreaming up ways to market such an idea.The name, the lounge's press release says, was the ""brainchild"" of a partnership between Jerry Marshall, a ""senior staff blends specialist"" in R. J. Reynolds' research and development department, and Larry McGearty, a creative director at Gyro Worldwide, a Philadelphia advertising agency that has handled tobacco accounts.The partnership, like everything else about this brand, was portrayed as having an aura of mystique. ""And with that idea,"" the press release said of the two men, ""they set out to make some of the world's best smokes and to build unique sanctuaries where their works of art could be properly enjoyed.""But how, precisely, was such a sanctuary allowed in a city that had just finished its argument over where to ban smoking?As part of a compromise agreement among the city's aldermen, the ordinance ultimately included provisions that allowed bars and restaurants with bars to delay putting the rule into effect until July 1, 2008. And it included language to exempt a business that can prove its ventilation system is so efficient that its inside air is as clean as the air outside.But the lounge, Mr. Stebbins said, is relying on a different exemption. Chicago's ordinance excludes ""retail tobacco stores,"" places where 65 percent of the sales are of ""tobacco"" or ""tobacco accessories,"" according to the city's Law Department. Many cities include similar exemptions in their smoking ordinances, including New York, where sales of tobacco at exempted stores must account for more than half of sales.In the past, though, here and in other places, ""retail tobacco stores"" had usually referred to places like mom-and-pop tobacco shops or old-fashioned cigar shops, experts in other cities said. ""Come to think of it, I guess they could do this in New York,"" said Russell Sciandra, director of the Center for a Tobacco Free New York. ""But if customers are buying liquor and food, that starts to add up fast and that can't become the bulk of what they are selling.""The managers of the lounge said they were not worried: people would mostly come here to buy cigarettes, they said. What is more, only those 21 years or older will be allowed in -- one of many ways, they said, that the lounge does not violate the 1998 settlement agreement.""We are very serious to make sure we are complying, all with a goal to make sure we are not directly or indirectly advertising to minors,"" said Carole Crosslin, director of communications at R. J. Reynolds.Several antismoking advocates said the lounge, indeed, seemed to comply with the legal terms of the settlement, though some said they wondered whether it was truly meeting the intent of the agreement.""Glamorizing tobacco use will encourage young people who are smokers to continue doing so, and it will encourage some young people who don't smoke to do so -- just because it's a glamorous, upscale place,"" said William V. Corr, executive director of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. ""The question of whether this appeals to youth is a factual question we will have to watch.""But Richard A. Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University and president of the Tobacco Control Resource Center, said he was not bothered by the lounge, mostly because he believes the idea will not work.""It's a gimmick,"" he said. ""I certainly would be surprised if it's still in business five years from now. The problem is that their clientele is not this, but mainly working class and poor people.""For his part, Mr. Stebbins said he had not considered whether such smoking lounges might move elsewhere too. ""I'm focusing on Chicago right now,"" he said.""This is my place now,"" said Mr. Kittrell, who lives nearby. ""It's the only place around that I can drink coffee and read the papers and smoke my cigarettes anymore.""He was, in fact, smoking his own cigarettes, a box of ordinary Camels, but said he mighttry the Marshall McGearty mix sometime.'"

"'06-01-19,'1','Starting today and for the next 10 days, thousands of movie industry types, media purveyors and lookie-Lous will descend on the resort town of Park City, Utah, to partake in that collective fiction known as the American independent film movement. In other words, they will brave that annual combustion of hype, creative endeavor and wind chill called the Sundance Film Festival. They will elbow through overcrowded parties, gossip about and perhaps even broker backroom deals and gawk as starlets the size of swizzle sticks haul off bags of free jeans and other goodies. They may see Paris Hilton try to stop traffic. They will pretend not to care.And, oh yeah, some of these festivalgoers will watch movies, lots of movies. This year's roundup includes 120 features, both fiction and nonfiction, along with 73 shorts. Some of this work will have been shot on old-fashioned celluloid; much, if not most, will be shot in digital video and look it. As always, some of this work will be good, most will be adequate and the outright stinkers will be as modest in number as the gems. Some of the better entries will, as Noah Baumbach's ""Squid and the Whale"" did last year, secure sizable deals and enter the cultural slipstream. Other films, like Craig Brewer's ""Hustle & Flow,"" which made the loudest noise last year, will leave with big money and find an audience without ever finding a place in the zeitgeist.Because each Sundance is the same, only different, this year's selection hits familiar notes. The documentary selection includes a tearjerker about a wrongly convicted prisoner, ""The Trials of Darryl Hunt""; last year's entry on the same subject was the similarly affecting ""After Innocence."" Well-intended and formally bland, these are the kind of feel-good-about-feeling-bad movies that solicit the audience's righteous indignation, something always in supply at Sundance. As in years past there are also docs about dysfunction (""Thin""), Sudan's lost boys (""God Grew Tired of Us"") and America at war (""Iraq in Fragments""). There is the obligatory look at the black (bad) experience, this time courtesy of ""American Blackout,"" and a film about The New York Times crossword puzzle editor, Will Shortz, ""Wordplay,"" which occupies the fun-with-letters slot that should have been occupied by the former Sundance-reject ""Spellbound.""It's déjà vu all over again with the fiction films as well. This year's opening-night film, Nicole Holofcener's ""Friends With Money,"" is a touching ensemble piece about a group of entwined Angelenos, just like last year's opening-night film, Don Roos's ""Happy Endings."" Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the loner with love woes in Mr. Roos's film; Jennifer Aniston plays that same part in Ms. Holofcener's film. This year's closing-night film, Nick Cassavetes's ""Alpha Dog,"" centers on a group of young, morally vacant Southern Californians, most underage or barely legal, whose promiscuous drug use leads to a kidnapping. The same story line, idiot kids and wasteland milieu were in one of last year's premieres, Arie Posin's ""Chumscrubber,"" a strained social satire made in the key of ""American Beauty.""Many Sundance entries come to the festival looking for distribution (and leave still looking), while others are in attendance as part of their release campaigns. ""Alpha Dog"" will be released this spring by New Line, a division of Time Warner, so you will get a chance to watch this fitfully entertaining story based on the exploits of the F.B.I. poster boy Jesse James Hollywood, who was wanted on drug-dealing charges. ""Friends With Money,"" which was paid for by Sony Pictures Classics, a division of Sony Pictures Entertainment, will be released on April 7. The engaging British comedy ""Kinky Boots,"" which will be released by the Weinstein-free Miramax, comes via the division of Buena Vista that distributes films in the United Kingdom for Walt Disney, Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures, and will hit theaters April 14.'"

The outlook is far lower than the analysts' forecast of 48 cents a share on $4.67 billion in sales. Before the report, shares of Apple declined $2.22, to close at $82.49, and continued the decline in after-hours trading.The lower-than-expected outlook is because of a slight ""pause"" in sales as the company switches to Intel processors, the company said, starting with an Intel-based iMac that the company announced last week and that has just begun shipping. The new Intel-based systems run up to twice as fast as the current model for the same price. Apple plans to switch its entire Macintosh line to Intel processors by the end of this year.Apple executives said anticipation of the company's move to the Intel chip, a major strategic shift, also led some customers to delay Mac purchases during the holiday quarter. But Peter Oppenheimer, the company's chief finance officer, said Apple had expected an even greater effect. The company sold 1.25 million Macintosh computers in the quarter, a 20 percent increase over last year's first quarter.Timothy D. Cook, Apple's executive vice president for worldwide sales and operations, told analysts that the company was anticipating a shortage of MacBook Pro computers in the second quarter. The first of Apple's notebook line to use the Intel chip is expected to ship in February. ""We may not be able to meet demand for MacBook Pro,"" Mr. Cook said. He also said a version of the iPod Nano, the 4-gigahertz model, was ""lean"" in certain regions. ""We are working hard to get those out there.""Charles R. Wolf, an analyst with Needham & Company, said the pause in Macintosh sales was not worrisome, because the company's sales outlook was still encouraging. ""Am I disappointed? No,"" said Mr. Wolf, who owns Apple stock and currently has a neutral rating on it. ""They aren't talking about a big pause in units."" He added that he expected Apple to continue to release new products in 2006 that would have a positive impact on its performance.The 14 million iPods sold during the holiday quarter was a huge increase from the 4.5 million sold during the 2004 holiday season, and a figure that analysts said would be hard to sustain. ""It's a consumer electronics product that is highly seasonal,"" Mr. Wolf said. ""We've also passed the inflection point in the iPod story. Growth is going to slow because the numbers are so large, but it's still going to grow.""Apple music sales now account for 59 percent of the company's total sales. Mr. Oppenheimer told analysts that the company now has 83 percent of the United States market for downloaded music.Sales at Apple's retail stores rose to over $1 billion for the first time, the company said. It now has 135 retail stores, after adding 11 stores worldwide last year. Revenue per store increased 41 percent in the first quarter, to $8.3 million. It also sells its products at other computer retailers and on the Internet.Correction: January 20, 2006, Friday An article in Business Day yesterday about Apple Computer's quarterly earnings referred incorrectly to the iPod Nano music player that one Apple executive said was in short supply in some areas. It is a four-gigabyte version, not four-gigahertz.'"
"'06-01-19,'1','WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 - Human Rights Watch asserted Wednesday that the Bush administration had undertaken a deliberate strategy of abusing terror suspects during interrogations, in ways, the group said, that undercut broader American interests. The criticism drew an unusually direct rebuff from the White House.""In the course of 2005, it became indisputable that U.S. mistreatment of detainees reflected not a failure of training, discipline or oversight, but a deliberate policy choice,"" the rights group said in a sweeping critique in its annual report. ""The problem could not be reduced to a few bad apples at the bottom of the barrel.""The group said the United States' detainee practices, along with the accusations that torture has possibly taken place at secret camps, had, together with what it said was a tendency of some Europeans to put business ahead of rights concerns, produced a ""global leadership void"" in defending human rights.But Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said he was ""rejecting the description of the United States.""""When a group like this makes some of these assertions, it diminishes the effectiveness of that organization,"" he said. ""It appears to be based more on a political agenda than facts.""'"

"'06-01-20,'0','""Investors may hope that Mr. Jobs's successful track record at Pixar and Apple will rub off more broadly on Disney,"" said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at Pali Research in New York.Disney's board is expected to meet this weekend to discuss whether it wants to proceed with a merger, according to the people apprised of the talks. Two of those people said Disney and Pixar executives had not agreed on a price, and the deal could still be scrapped.The merger discussions were first reported on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.But if the two sides are able to agree on a price, something that those involved say is likely, Mr. Iger will recommend to the board that Disney buy Pixar. An announcement could come early next week.Many of the terms have been worked out. The new animation division would be overseen by John Lasseter, Pixar's chief creative officer and a former Disney animator, who would work with animators at Pixar's headquarters in Emeryville, Calif., and at Disney in Burbank.It is not yet clear if there would be layoffs, although they would be likely. While Pixar under Mr. Lasseter has thrived, Disney's animation division has floundered, burdened by its past and its inability to adapt to an environment where pens and paper are being replaced by computers.Analysts say a Disney-Pixar combination would be successful only if Pixar took the reins of animation at Disney, because the cultures are vastly different. ""John Lasseter's role in any new incarnation of Pixar will be crucial,"" wrote Katherine Styponias of Prudential Equity.Mr. Lasseter's involvement at Disney may end up contributing more to the merger's success than Mr. Jobs's, since it is likely that Mr. Jobs sees more of a future in Silicon Valley than in Hollywood. Mr. Jobs, said friends and associates, deeply believes the counterculture worldview that he articulated in Apple's ""Think Different"" advertising campaign.A child of the 60's counterculture, even though he arrived at the tail end of the movement, Mr. Jobs has told reporters that he has never felt close to the Hollywood moguls he does deals with.In his commencement speech at Stanford last year, after a bout with pancreatic cancer, Mr. Jobs told the graduating class: ""Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.""If he decides to sell Pixar -- and Disney agrees to buy it -- it is likely Mr. Jobs would be doing so because his inner voice remains closest to Silicon Valley. And there would be a lot of money in it for him. His 50.6 percent stake in Pixar would give him roughly $3.4 billion worth of Disney stock if the deal is priced at $6.8 billion, making him the biggest individual Disney shareholder.Those who are close to Mr. Jobs have said that despite his success in Hollywood and with animation, his heart has remained with Apple Computer, the quirky company that has established a loyal user base over almost three decades. Moreover, executives in the consumer electronics industry widely believe that Mr. Jobs is now positioning the company to repeat the iPod phenomenon in two markets: Internet TV and wireless smart phones.These projects, which would extend Mr. Jobs's computer base into new industries that he could potentially transform as thoroughly as he has the music industry, may not both be introduced this year.Mr. Iger began mulling a potential acquisition of Pixar last November when he concluded that distributing Pixar's movies was not of much value to Disney, according to a person who has discussed the matter with Mr. Iger.At the time, Mr. Iger and Mr. Jobs were talking about whether Disney would extend its agreement to distribute Pixar films past 2006. (The two are in a joint venture, which ends with the release of Pixar's coming ""Cars."")Mr. Iger, according to one Disney investor, was in a difficult spot. Since being named chief executive last year, he had told Wall Street that his No. 1 priority was reinvigorating Disney's animation business. But in saying so, said one Disney investor, ""Disney had boxed themselves into a corner."" Pixar, in recent years, has been a steady supplier of new characters and stories for Disney, which were adapted for use in Disney's theme parks and consumer products.Mr. Iger did not make Mr. Jobs an offer then. Price was an issue: Mr. Jobs wanted far more than $60 a share. Disney, for its part, wanted to see how its first foray into computer animation, ""Chicken Little,"" would fare when it was released in November. (It performed well, but not as well as Pixar movies.)""We suspect Disney was increasingly concerned with its upcoming internally generated animated films,"" said Mr. Greenfield of Pali Research. Indeed, last year Disney postponed one of the four computer-animated films it was betting on, ""Rapunzel Unbraided.""In December, Mr. Iger and Disney's investment bankers started to think about buying a stake in Pixar instead. But by January, the person who talked with Mr. Iger said, the Disney chief was anxious to acquire all of Pixar.Wall Street reacted positively to news of a potential merger. On Thursday shares of Pixar increased 2.8 percent, to close at $58.87. Disney shares rose 4 percent, to $26.24.""Perhaps Steve is selling at the top of the market,"" Mr. Greenfield said. ""He is finally ready to take a victory lap at what has become a successful company.""'"
"'06-01-20,'0','""I'm about as deep as a Dixie cup,"" Ms. Wilson announced during a discussion about acting approaches. When Method actors are backstage connecting with primal memories, she's reading Us magazine, she said.With four hours between last Saturday's matinee and evening performances, she talked about her life and career so far. She wore a turtleneck and tan cords but Diane's hairstyle; her own is usually curlier and looser.At 44, she is enviably thin. Good metabolism, she said, but also mentioned ""three floors of stairs between the dressing room and the stage."" That helps. And she smokes, although it's her New Year's resolution to quit.Ms. Wilson said she never had a master plan for success. Growing up, she did local shows, driving herself to auditions as a teenager. She acted in ""Two Gentlemen of Verona"" and ""Company"" in Austin community theater and attended Southwest Texas State University. (The University of Texas was ""too big."")Joseph Stein and Stephen Schwartz saw her in their musical ""The Baker's Wife"" and suggested she move to New York. She did, enrolling at Fordham University, but she started getting work and never graduated.Ms. Wilson made her New York stage debut in 1988 in ""Lucky Stiff,"" an Off Broadway musical. Her subsequent credits include Wendy Wasserstein's ""Heidi Chronicles"" (a small role) and ""Spike Heels"" with Kevin Bacon and Tony Goldwyn. She originated the role of Beth in Donald Margulies's ""Dinner With Friends."" Theresa Rebeck wrote ""Bad Dates"" for her.During the 1990's, she also played the wacky neighbor on the sitcom ""Grace Under Fire"" for four seasons. More recently, she was a memorable funeral home owner in several episodes of ""Six Feet Under."" She's headed to the West Coast again soon, even though ""The Little Dog Laughed"" may have a life beyond its current extended closing date, Feb. 26.She will be going with her husband of four years, Christopher Conner, an actor. Her 19-year-old daughter, Alexandra (from an early marriage to a New York restaurateur), is a freshman at the University of Southern California.With the flurry of attention being paid to her, Ms. Wilson said she was a little suspicious of real fame because ""people become big Macy's balloons of themselves.""There is certainly the danger of becoming typecast as a tough-agent type. She and her current character have some things in common, Mr. Beane said. ""Julie is a motormouth,"" he said. But she didn't fit his original concept of Diane. ""I had somebody completely different in mind,"" he recalled. ""But I decided to let go and let Julie.""Correction: January 21, 2006, Saturday An article in Weekend yesterday about the star of ""The Little Dog Laughed,"" at Second Stage Theater, misstated her surname at several points.

"'06-01-20,'0','The discrepancy among those figures presents a number of issues. First and foremost, investable indexes do not attract rock star performers. By contrast, noninvestable returns are better, but you can't get into them, so what's the point?As with all indexes, there are concentration issues. The Credit Suisse/Tremont investable index is smaller -- it includes 60 funds -- compared with its noninvestable index, which includes 413 funds. Wild outperformance or underperformance of one fund will more likely skew the results in the smaller universe.There are also weighting issues: hedged equity funds (also called ""long/short"" because the funds can buy stocks or bet against them by shorting them) represent about 27 percent of the Credit Suisse/Tremont noninvestable index but only 13.5 percent of the investable index. The performance of that sector, which tends to be highly correlated to the market, will also skew the results.Each index also includes different funds. The Hedge Fund Research composite hedge fund index is an average of about 2,000 funds. That makes it broadly representative of the sector, which is estimated to have about 8,000 funds. But it does not have a minimum track record requirement. The S.& P. hedge fund index includes only 42 funds, but the stringent reporting requirements for those funds have probably dissuaded many fund managers from revealing much. Many of the best-performing funds, like Renaissance, don't report to any database.Perhaps most troubling is the general upward bias that appears to exist in all the indexes.According to research by Burton G. Malkiel and Atanu Saha, both of Princeton, and the Analysis Group, an economic consulting group, the TASS database acquired by Tremont has overstated hedge fund returns by more than 4 percent a year from 1996 to 2003.The inflation is a result of various factors including survivorship and a lack of uniform reporting standards. The performance of hedge funds that fail are erased from the database. That's a big deal considering their research showed that of the 331 funds that reported returns in 1996, only 58, or fewer than 25 percent, still existed in 2004.According to exhibits in the research, the average return for all hedge funds included in the TASS database from 1996 through 2003 was 13.74 percent, not counting defunct funds. Accounting for those extinct funds, the average return was only 9.32 percent. The average return for mutual funds during the same period (using Lipper data) was 9.73 percent, not including defunct funds, compared with 8.49 percent when defunct funds were included.""The bottom line is, there is a lot of survivorship bias in many of the hedge fund indices that are used to sell hedge funds,"" Dr. Malkiel said in an interview.Since there are no requirements that all data since inception be included in any performance database, hedge funds can choose to report to a database when their returns start to look good, creating a natural upward bias. Aren't they all brilliant?Many sophisticated investors develop their own benchmarks, or they set an absolute return objective. Not all hedge fund investors are so sophisticated. For those who are not, and who happen to be piling into hedge funds, it is worth finding a reliable benchmark.INSIDER Correction: January 21, 2006, Saturday The Insider column in Business Day yesterday, about hedge fund indexes, misstated the affiliation of an author of a study on such indexes. Dr. Atanu Saha is a managing principal at the Analysis Group. He does not work for Princeton University.'"
"'06-01-20,'0','On Wednesday, the wave of selling overwhelmed the exchange, forcing officials to close 20 minutes early. But the day's volume, made up of 4.38 million transactions, was part of a steady rise in the average number of daily trades here since the summer. Over the last six months, that number has doubled.Individual traders are fueling this greater activity, their combined transactions increasing last month to 44 percent of the total value of trades from 18 percent in 2001. According to the leading daily Asahi Shimbun, 80 percent of individual trading is done on the Internet. And the larger share of individual investor transactions are thought to have contributed to the skittishness and the wide swings in the marketplace.""They make credit transactions in extremely short time,"" Seiichi Miura, investment strategist of Mitsubishi UFJ Securities, said in an interview on Thursday, ""and once the market starts falling, as we saw yesterday, the market wildly goes up and down. Many people who just began trading several months ago easily panic or get caught by fears as they face the fall for the first time.""Members of Parliament from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party gathered for an economic caucus Thursday and criticized Taizo Nishimuro, the stock exchange's new president, for tarnishing Japan's reputation.""A stock exchange that can't carry on trading simply doesn't deserve to exist,"" Kaoru Yosano, the financial services minister, told reporters later. ""The exchange should make it a top priority to bring business back to normal.""In November, a computer system failure knocked out the exchange, the second-largest in the world, for most of the day. Then in December, officials were embarrassed by an errant trade that cost a brokerage house about $330 million. The two incidents led to the resignation of the exchange president, Takuo Tsurushima, and two other executives.The new president, Mr. Nishimuro, comes with years of computer knowledge gained while serving as president and then chairman of Toshiba.On Thursday, he announced year-end goals of nearly doubling the exchange's daily trading capacity, to 8 million, and of increasing order capacity by about two-thirds, to 14 million. As a first step, trading capacity is to be increased to 5 million on Jan. 30. The New York Stock Exchange currently handles about 5 million transactions a day.Also easing market anxiety was a monthly government report saying that Japan's economy continues to recover, invigorated by personal spending and the growth of exports to Asia.""The economy is recovering at a moderate pace,"" the Cabinet Office said in its report for January. Private consumption is ""increasing moderately,"" and industrial production is ""picking up.""Some analysts also took a calm view of Livedoor, a 10-year-old conglomerate that many people say aggressively exploited loopholes but did not engage in significant fraud. After Takafumi Horie took his company public on the Tokyo exchange's start-up market in 2004, Livedoor acquired at least 18 other companies, largely Internet-related.""More and more, as the days go on,"" said Tatsuya Tamura, co-chairman of the Japan Independent Directors Network, a private group dedicated to improving corporate governance, ""people will begin to realize that this is not the big scandal that is the end of the world.""The company has been accused of massaging its 2004 financial results, turning a $8.7 million loss into a $12.2 profit. According to newspaper reports, prosecutors believe that the conglomerate also failed to disclose in a timely fashion its purchase of a publishing house last year.On Thursday, before trading started, Livedoor issued a statement denying all financial wrongdoing. But during the day, there were virtually no buyers for its shares, and they automatically fell by 80 yen, or 70 cents, the mandated amount for shares of their category. Since Monday, their price has fallen 40 percent, paring $2.6 billion from the company's market capitalization.The investigation of Mr. Horie does not seem to be politically motivated. In September, he was backed by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi when he ran, unsuccessfully, as an independent candidate in Japan's elections for Parliament. Prosecutors have said that they were acting on information from inside the company.On Mr. Horie's popular blog, 2,800 messages had been left by Thursday.Most were from fans. But one angry investor wrote: ""Idiot! Hurry up and get yourself arrested. Pay for the market's losses and never come on TV again.""'"
"'06-01-20,'0','""This is a historic day,"" said Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., the mission's principal scientist and team leader.Speaking at a news conference at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Dr. Stern said the timing assured that the New Horizons would arrive for its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015 -- the 50th anniversary of the first flyby of Mars by the Mariner 4, the mission that began the exploration of the planets.Yesterday's liftoff also paid homage to Pluto's discoverer, the astronomer Clyde W. Tombaugh, who in 1930 became the only American to find a planet in the solar system. (He died at 90, in 1997.) His widow, Patricia Tombaugh, 93, and other family members were present at the cape, and some of his remains were among the commemorative items aboard the spacecraft.""Some of Clyde's ashes are on their way to Pluto today,"" Dr. Stern said.The New Horizons is to reach Jupiter's gravitational field in 13 months. The trip to Pluto will take eight more years, most of which the craft will spend in electronic ""hibernation"" to save power and wear on the equipment needed for its seven experiments.The New Horizons is powered by a small plutonium-fired electric generator. Its instruments include three cameras, for visible-light, infrared and ultraviolet images, and three spectrometers to study the composition and temperatures of Pluto's thin atmosphere and surface features.It also carries a University of Colorado dust counter, the first experiment to fly on a planetary mission that is entirely designed and operated by students. This is the only experiment that will not hibernate during the mission.In addition to the two-hour delay, the launching was postponed twice in two days -- on Tuesday by strong winds at the cape and on Wednesday by a storm that caused a power failure at the spacecraft's control center at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md. Mission planners had until Feb. 14 to launch the mission this year, but only until the end of this month to use the gravity boost from Jupiter, which will shorten the trip to Pluto by five years.Once near its target, the New Horizons is to conduct about five months of studies, including a closest-approach dash that takes it within 6,200 miles of Pluto's surface and 16,800 miles from the planet's large moon, Charon. The craft will also study two smaller moons found late last year by the Hubble Space Telescope and any new features discovered while it is on its way, scientists said.The mission is to continue past Pluto, possibly visiting large objects in the Kuiper Belt, an outer zone of the solar system that includes Pluto. The belt is made up of thousands of icy, rocky objects that include comets and small planets. Scientists believe that this material is left over from the creation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago and that studying it will provide clues to how the Sun and planets formed.'"
"'06-01-20,'0','In recent years, the Port Authority has evicted the stevedores from two piers to make room for a cruise-ship port and a planned waterfront development that combines parkland and luxury housing and is favored by the city.Now, with the DS Freeway towering over Pier 9, the Port Authority says that American Stevedoring has once again overbooked its reduced space and does not deserve an emergency accommodation.""In the past we've been willing to help them out,"" said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority. ""But we're not willing to provide the additional space so that it can be mismanaged again.""American Stevedoring, the Teamsters union and political supporters of both say the Port Authority is keeping more than 100 dockworkers from earning a living this week and is threatening to drive shipping out of the city's only bulk commodity port altogether.""I believe the Port Authority's goal is to move all the shipping that is coming here to New Jersey,"" the local councilman, David Yassky, said yesterday at a shipside news conference against a backdrop of idled dockworkers leaning on their forklifts. ""They want to shut down the port. It's plain and simple.""In fact, American Stevedoring, at least, is on its way out of Red Hook. The Port Authority has said it will not renew Stevedoring's lease on five other piers when it expires next year. The authority and the city have said they want to keep shipping in Brooklyn but eventually move it a few miles downriver to the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal in Sunset Park.Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, a Democrat whose district snakes along miles of waterfront in Brooklyn and Manhattan, said the city and the port are going about the process all wrong.""They're correct that the better place for a port is Sunset Park,"" Mr. Nadler said. ""But don't close this one down until you have another place ready to go. People will take their business elsewhere, and you'll never get it started.""The customer for the Freeway's load, a leading cocoa processor who requested anonymity because he said he did not want to anger officials in the various ports with which he deals, said the impasse would drive even more business away from New York. In the last several years, New York, once the country's leading cocoa port, has fallen behind Philadelphia and Camden, N.J.""The cost for manufacturers to ship into New York will almost certainly go up on the shipping side,"" the importer said, ""because steamship lines will view New York as no longer consistent in being able to handle cocoa.""The cocoa sitting on the ship amounts to 10 percent of all the West African cocoa that has come into the United States this harvest season, which is now at its height and is about half over, the importer said.Redirecting it to another port is no simple matter.""It's a major interruption in your logistics,"" he said.There was another cocoa crisis in Brooklyn last week when an outbound barge carrying about 800,000 pounds of cocoa beans capsized off another American Stevedoring pier. The company's officials said yesterday that even had the barge not capsized, tying up a pier and a warehouse, their warehouses would still be far too jammed to hold the Freeway's load.Late yesterday afternoon, officials with the Port Authority and the city said they were working with American Stevedoring to resolve the conflict.Meanwhile, the clock is ticking.Ken Mistry, the port captain of the ship, said that the company that chartered the ship is losing $30,000 a day.""The Port Authority is sitting with an empty terminal on a wharf,"" he said.

"'06-01-20,'0','Merrill Lynch reported a 25 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings yesterday on robust trading, a surge in banking and strong expense controls.While other Wall Street banks have recently reported strong results for the quarter and for 2005, Merrill has in many ways progressed the most in the last year. It has been branching out globally, integrating various acquisitions and reaping the results of rebuilding businesses that it had scaled back in recent years.""The franchise itself is doing quite well,"" said David Trone, an analyst with Fox-Pitt Kelton.Merrill Lynch improved its return on equity -- a measure of profitability closely watched on Wall Street -- to an annualized 18.2 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 15.7 percent a year earlier, but the firm continued to lag its peers.""The R.O.E. is the last problem in the story,"" Mr. Tone said.Merrill Lynch earned $1.5 billion, or $1.51, in the quarter, compared with $1.19 billion, or $1.19 a share in the quarter a year earlier.

"'06-01-20,'0','In one of the museum's three galleries, with a permanent collection of original works by Mr. Carle, a step-by-step display shows how he creates distinctive three-dimensional art by first painting tissue paper and then assembling cutouts that exude a luminous warmth. ""Seeing the original artwork is a very different experience,"" said Alissa Imre Geis, an illustrator from Hatfield, Mass., as she bounced her 7-month-old son, Leo, on her knee. As an artist used to working in isolation, she said, she found the museum ""exciting.""Ms. Geis sat in the museum cafe with three friends, all illustrators and former classmates at the Rhode Island School of Design. Now scattered around New England, the group gathers at the museum periodically to see exhibits, discuss their work and catch up. ""This place is like a Mecca for us,"" said Linda Wingerter, an illustrator and children's book author from New Haven.Just across a cornfield from the Eric Carle museum is the National Yiddish Book Center, a place with its own kind of magnetism. It is the headquarters of a grass-roots organization of 30,000 that preserves, teaches and celebrates Yiddish, the everyday language spoken by most of the world's Jews for the better part of a millennium. On exhibit are expressions of Yiddish in literature, music, theater, art and film. About 10,000 people visit every year.The design of the center promotes the sense of journeying to another time and place. As you approach the building, its peaked roofs (dusted with snow on a recent visit) recall the wooden synagogues of an Eastern European shtetl, or town. To enter, you cross a wooden bridge leading into a darkened foyer.Then come the books.THE foyer overlooks stack after stack of them, all in Yiddish. Hanging from the rafters are colorful flags with the letters of the aleph bet, or Hebrew alphabet, in which Yiddish is written. The group has rescued 1.5 million Yiddish books -- once in danger of being discarded and lost forever -- since it was founded in 1980; 6 percent are here and the rest are in a nearby warehouse.As visitors can glean from the center's permanent exhibition, ""A Portable Homeland,"" Yiddish is part of a historical continuum. ""Jewish learning has always been based on layers, on text and then commentary on text, and then commentary on commentary,"" Aaron Lansky, the center's founder, explained as he ushered visitors through on a late fall afternoon. ""Yiddish literature was a lost layer in that continuum, which is odd because it is one of the most recent.""Mr. Lansky describes the quest to save Yiddish books in a recently published memoir, ""Outwitting History."" You can hear that same story, in brief, in a 13-minute film, ""A Bridge of Books,"" which prepared visitors to appreciate the permanent exhibition, which is in English.Among the books and artifacts on display is a Yiddish linotype machine once used to produce type for printing Der Forverts (The Forward), one of the last surviving Yiddish-language newspapers. One of the several Yiddish typewriters is hands-on: children who have grown up writing on computers hunted and pecked enthusiastically on its Hebrew-character keys, tapping out their names. In a temporary exhibit on display until April, ""The Wooden Synagogues of Poland,"" visitors peeked into a 12-to-1 scale model of the historic wooden synagogue of Zabludow, Poland.You can don headphones and listen to Yiddish radio programs, with music, dramas and commercials, and leaf through Yiddish sheet music, much of it with stylized illustrations. You'll also find an alcove where you can view an hourlong loop of clips from Yiddish films including ""Yidl Mitn Fidl"" with Molly Picon and ""Tevye Der Milkeger"" with Maurice Schwartz.For those who want to take home a piece of Yiddish culture, thousands of Yiddish publications, including novels, children's books, cookbooks and illustrated sheet music, are for sale. A bookstore and gift shop also offers English-language books with themes related to Jewish life and culture.If the children need a break between museums, have lunch in the cafeteria at the Carle museum or drive about two minutes to the Atkins Farm Market on Route 116. The Atkins family began farming on this property in 1887, and its farm stand has grown into a full-scale retail operation with homemade fudge, freshly made doughnuts and a cafe serving sandwiches and light meals. Don't miss the apple fritter.If you're more in the mood for ice cream, drive five minutes west to Cook Farm on South Maple Street in Hadley. Its store, Flayvors of Cook Farm, has ice cream made from the milk of its own Holstein and Jersey cows. French vanilla with orange zest and walnuts is a favorite choice, and in the spring, the adventurous can try asparagus ice cream, honoring the Hadley area's favorite crop.IF YOU GOArt and Culture In the CountrysideAMHERST, Mass., is eight miles east of Interstate 91 on Route 9.

"'06-01-20,'0','Such talk may turn out to be part of the negotiating tactics on both sides. But it is fanning waves of anxiety in oil markets, which have been rattled since Jan. 3, when Iran announced its decision to resume a nuclear research program that had been suspended since an agreement was reached with France, Germany and Britain in late 2004.The announcement led to a breakdown with European negotiators and raised the likelihood of international action against Iran.While American and European negotiators are campaigning to have the standoff handled by the United Nations Security Council, Russia and China are urging more talks.Oil markets have reacted strongly to the breakdown. Crude oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange have risen 9.5 percent since the beginning of the year. They closed yesterday at $66.83 a barrel, up $1.10, or 1.7 percent. Oil prices, which dropped to $55 in November, are again headed toward record levels.To be sure, other factors have contributed to the recent price rally. Nigeria's main oil-producing region is experiencing unrest, and forecasters expect strong growth in demand this year. But as the confrontation over the nuclear research program swells, Iran is turning out to be the biggest risk for oil markets this year.With 10 percent of the world's reserves, Iran is the second-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose pricing policy it helps shape (Saudi Arabia is No. 1).The country pumps four million barrels of oil each day and exports two-thirds of it, mainly to Japan and China. Analysts said Iran's standing in the oil markets permits it to assert itself more than others seeking to develop a nuclear program.""Why are the Iranians pushing so aggressively instead of biding their time, like North Korea did? The obvious answer is that Iran is in a far stronger position,"" said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, a political-risk consultancy based in New York. ""Iran can respond in ways that can be very painful to the international community. Iran has leverage.""Frank Verrastro, the head of the energy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the international community had to answer some very tough questions when it considered Iran's position.""How do you punish an international actor when it produces a commodity that everyone needs? What can get Iran's attention without inflicting pain on everyone else?"" Mr. Verrastro said. ""Up until now, it has been a huge game of chicken.""Given the overall tightness in global energy supplies, analysts said, it is unlikely that Iran's oil exports will be embargoed if the dispute is taken to the Security Council. But alternatives, like banning foreign investments in Iran's oil business or transfers of technology for that industry, might still cripple Iran's struggling petroleum sector.""The best punishment, because it would be the most effective, would be to deprive Iran of its oil exports,"" said Muhammad-Ali Zainy, an energy economist at the Center for Global Energy Studies in London. ""But the problem is that this would create a big shortage on the oil markets and lead to a price explosion. It would be disastrous. It is something no one can afford.""""On the other hand, Iran can't afford to use its oil weapon, either,"" he said. ""It relies on its oil revenue too much.""Iran derives about 50 percent of its government revenue and most of its foreign currency earnings from oil sales. Thanks to high prices, it is expected to earn more than $40 billion from oil sales in 2005.At the same time, the Iranian regime is betting that the global markets cannot afford to live without its oil. That may prove to be a miscalculation. While the world may go through a short spike in prices if Iran curbs exports, analysts say that oil markets have shown resilience, as they did last year after the loss of oil production from the Gulf of Mexico.In recent years, Iran has played on differences between the United States, which has barred its companies from doing business in Iran, and Europe or China, which have invested heavily in Iran's oil industry.Iran has also been paying close attention to Asian customers, particularly China and India, to offset the growing hostility from the West, and has awarded exploration licenses to companies from France, Russia, Japan and China.The strategy has not been completely successful. BP, which is based in London, said early last year that it would avoid doing business in Iran because of the American sanctions. Also, because of harsh contractual terms, oil companies have become wary of investing in Iran. The result has been sluggish production growth.While most producers are pumping at full capacity to meet record world demand, Iran has been unable to reach its nominal production quota assigned by OPEC, 4.11 million barrels a day.In the United States, the standoff is increasingly perceived as the top foreign policy and security challenge for President Bush's second term. On Sunday, Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, speaking on CBS's ""Face the Nation,"" said the United States should press for international sanctions against Iran. He added, ""If the price of oil has to go up, then that's a consequence we would have to suffer.""'"

"'06-01-20,'0','The title of Eugene Jarecki's ""Why We Fight"" sounds like both a declaration and a question. While variations on these three words are repeated throughout the film -- posed as a question to various Joes, Janes and sometimes little Timmy -- it is clear from the start of this agitprop entertainment that Mr. Jarecki has a very good idea why America has seemed so eager to pick up arms over the past half-century. Calvin Coolidge famously said that the chief business of the American people is business; 80 years later, Mr. Jarecki forcefully, if not with wholesale persuasiveness, argues that our business is specifically war.Another American president is critical to that argument. On Jan. 17, 1961, Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered his farewell address to the country. Writing in longhand -- one of the more arresting images in the film is the tablet on which he wrote his famous speech, scratched-out words and all -- Eisenhower took stock of the nation, its recent wars and its military might. ""In the councils of government,"" warned this president and former general of the Army, ""we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.""Mr. Jarecki borrowed the title ""Why We Fight"" from a series of films made by Frank Capra for the military during World War II, and it's after that war that the story of the military-industrial complex begins. It's a story Mr. Jarecki tells with appreciable energy, using images culled from newsreels, educational and military films, and original material. Bombs explode, wars are fought, and talking heads fill the screen. The editor of The Weekly Standard, William Kristol, waves the flag for the right, while Gore Vidal shakes his pompoms for the left, invoking American amnesia. Everyone sounds smart, if not always convincing, as when Mr. Vidal states that Truman dropped atom bombs on Japan only to frighten Stalin and declare war on Communism, even though the Japanese were trying to surrender.Mr. Vidal's assertion would give some historians pause and others an attack of apoplexy. Which raises a problem with films of this type: Who's telling the truth? Crammed with facts, or at least assertions of fact, ""Why We Fight"" presents a battalion of experts delivering what sound like reasonable historical overviews and political analyses. Given the sheer wealth of information, however -- more than 50 years of American military history and dozens of wars and military adventures are wedged into the film's 99-minute running time -- even an attentive observer of the geopolitical landscapes past and present might have a hard time separating the chaff from the wheat, ideologically framed arguments from those more empirically grounded.To his credit, Mr. Jarecki doesn't bother with the fig leaf of journalistic objectivity as far too many nonfiction filmmakers try to do; his political agenda in this film is as clear as Michael Moore's in ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" Unlike Mr. Moore, however, Mr. Jarecki eschews folksy populism to sell his message; instead, he employs his skills as an archivist, interviewer and researcher, as well as the talents of his editor, Nancy Kennedy, to sell the goods. He likes Ike -- or at least Eisenhower's powerful farewell speech -- and he clearly doesn't like the current president, or at least his doctrine. Using a former president to shore up an argument is very canny; using a former Republican president as ammunition against another Republican president is doubly so.One person's politically convincing argument is another's propagandistic screed, and whether you buy the film will doubtless depend on your existing beliefs. That said, even those of radical political persuasion might find it hard to accept Mr. Jarecki's argument that American militarism is, underneath the talk about freedom and democracy, a simple question of dollars. If nothing else, such thinking ignores that wars are fought not just by governments working in concert with big business and lobbyists, but also by people. In this respect, Mr. Jarecki's use of a retired New York cop named Wilton Sekzer, who lost his son on 9/11 and supported the invasion of Iraq because he believed President Bush's assertion that the two were linked, is problematic, and not only because one grieving father cannot represent an entire nation.'"
"'06-01-20,'0','The Stardust mission to bring back samples of comet and interstellar dust was more successful than they had hoped, scientists said yesterday.The 100-pound sample container from the seven-year mission, which landed on the salt flats of Utah on Sunday, captured thousands of particles, perhaps even a million, that originated at the edge of the solar system or from distant stars, they said.While they had expected mostly microscopic samples, the researchers said, a surprising number of the particles were large enough to be seen with the naked eye.""It exceeded all of our grandest expectations,"" Donald Brownlee of the University of Washington said in a televised news conference from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, where the samples were taken for study.The cargo in the Stardust's sample container, which was opened Tuesday, ""was an ancient cosmic treasure from the very edge of the solar system,"" Dr. Brownlee said. Scientists believe that these particles are the pristine remains of the material that formed the planets and other bodies some 4.6 billion years ago.'"
"'06-01-20,'0','State-controlled Rosneft, in particular, has been a lightning rod for criticism, after the company bought the biggest asset of Yukos at a depressed price last year, as part of the government's attempt to consolidate natural resources and seize power from Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the founder of Yukos. After the London offering, the state will retain control of Rosneft, raising concerns about corporate governance.""The only shareholder rights observed in Russia are the right of the state -- and would you trust that?"" said Geoffrey Wood, a professor of economics at Cass Business School in London. Recent events like Gazprom's temporary suspension of gas delivery to Ukraine are indicative of the unpredictability of these companies, he said. And even if banks and investors have performed proper due diligence, and have prospectuses that lay out minority shareholder rights, ""there is no safeguard against the rules being changed,"" Professor Wood added.Deloitte & Touche valued Rosneft at $48 billion in November, up from a $26 million estimate by Morgan Stanley earlier last year. The increase in valuation raised some eyebrows.""We believe that the Kremlin is fairly desperate to raise a large sum at the Rosneft I.P.O.,"" analysts from Rye, Man & Gor Securities in Moscow wrote in November. To be sure, investors who buy the Russian and central Asian stocks already listed in London consider them high risk.""We shouldn't forget that in the end, these are risky assets, and everyone should see that,"" said Tom Kirchmaier, a corporate governance expert with the London School of Economics. ""Corporate governance is not about de-risking equity, it is about regulating the market to see what is going on.""In 2005, emerging market companies raised more than $13 billion in London, according to Dealogic. They accounted for some of the stock exchange's biggest listings. In New York, primary and secondary listings of emerging market companies raised $15.4 billion in 2005, but the New York Stock Exchange stands to lag London this year.The New York exchange noted that many of the companies listing in London did not meet its listing standards. ""We can't compete for them, though we do wish them well,"" said Noreen M. Culhane, an executive vice president of the exchange.Besides Rosneft, the Kazakhstan state oil concern KazMunaiGaz and the Russian steel company EvrazHolding also are expected to have sizable initial offerings this year. It is not just energy and commodities companies: consumer products businesses are joining the rush as well.""One of the frustrations of international investors in Russia is that 80 percent of the market cap of the Russian stock exchange is energy and natural resource stocks,"" said Paul Raphael, head of Credit Suisse First Boston's European equity capital markets group. ""People are desperate to put money to work in Russia that gives them exposure to higher Russian growth, and to the Russian consumer.""Many advisers cite United States regulation as the reason that London is getting the edge over New York.""There is a perception that it is easier to do an I.P.O. in London, without compromising on standards of quality and investor protection,"" said Simon F. T. Cox, a partner with the law firm Norton Rose in London.Worries about shareholder litigation in the United States and London's role as a welcoming second home for Russians also are cited as reasons for the attraction of a listing on the London markets. The city already hums with Russian money -- wealthy Russians have bought up some of its most expensive real estate and its leading soccer team, and its high-end boutiques are now staffed with Russian-speaking employees.In addition, the London exchange has engaged in an aggressive marketing campaign to attract companies in Asia, Russia and Eastern Europe. The exchange has employees from 14 countries who speak 17 languages, said Tracey Pierce, head of company services at the London exchange and the executive responsible for attracting foreign listings. Although Russia may represent the biggest entrants this year, the London Stock Exchange has hardly limited itself to that region.""We're seeing wider opportunities across Asia, in South Korea in particular,"" she said.Most of the foreign companies listing in London, including Rosneft, plan to trade global depository receipts, roughly the equivalent of American depository receipts. Yet while A.D.R.'s require a company to adhere to United States accounting standards, companies with G.D.R.'s in London can use their local accounting standards, and do not need to file quarterly statements. (Rosneft, however, already files according to United States accounting standards.)""The G.D.R.'s are basically cowboyland -- you can get away with whatever you want,"" said one London-based banker who has worked on a number of emerging market issues in the last 12 months and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared for his job.Investors contend that they do not make a big distinction between foreign companies listed in the United States and those listed in London. ""We're extremely comfortable with the London listings,"" said Allan Conway, head of global emerging market equities at Schroders in London. ""We have no problem with a G.D.R. rather than an A.D.R.,"" he said, adding ""from a quality-of-investment point of view, there is no distinction between the two.""'"
"'06-01-20,'0','The franchise continues to struggle. The Penguins are 11-27-9, the second-worst record in the 30-team league, ahead of St. Louis. Lemieux, who overcame Hodgkin's disease earlier in his career, said he did not know if the stress surrounding the team had contributed to his health problems.""I'm not sure,"" he said. ""The thing that I have now -- atrial fibrillation -- might be attributed to stress, and I've been getting a lot of stress the last couple of years. But you can't say for sure that's the problem.""What he did say was that the time had come to sell the franchise. The team's future in Pittsburgh hinges on whether a coalition assembled by the Penguins is awarded a license to run a slots parlor that could finance a $290 million project to build a new arena.""I wanted to make sure, first of all, that we put the franchise in the best position to have a chance to stay here forever, and I feel that we're there,"" Lemieux said.The decision to award the slots parlor rests with a seven-member panel, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.Even though the team is struggling on the ice, its future -- headed by the top pick in the 2005 N.H.L. entry draft, Sidney Crosby -- appears bright. But that is why the franchise could also be attractive to buyers interested in moving it elsewhere. Among the cities that have been mentioned are Portland, Ore.; Houston; Kansas City, Mo.; and Las Vegas.The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported Thursday that Lemieux said the new owners would be bound by agreements that he and his partners had agreed to, including a promise to keep the team in Pittsburgh if the slot license were to come through.In early December, a frustrated Lemieux said the chances of the team remaining in Pittsburgh appeared to be slim because there had been no movement on building a new arena. Mellon Arena, which opened in 1967, is the oldest and most dilapidated arena in the league. The team's lease ends after next season.""I've said it many times in the past, but people didn't catch on,"" Lemieux said. ""I think when I said that in December it really got the attention of the people here in this city and the politicians, and people started to realize that there was a good chance that if we didn't make a deal for a new arena soon that they would be gone.""HOCKEY Correction: January 25, 2006, Wednesday A sports article on Friday about the sale of the Pittsburgh Penguins misstated the year that their home, Mellon Arena, opened.

""In some areas, illegal seizures of farmland without reasonable compensation have provoked uprisings. This is still a key source of instability in rural areas and even the whole society.""His statement amounted to a blunt admission that efforts by Mr. Wen and President Hu Jintao to address the country's yawning wealth gap and improve conditions for the majority of China's people had fallen far short of their goals, despite being a centerpiece of government policy for three years.'"
"'06-01-21,'0','""All the room service people, they want to be professional, but at the same time, they wish you good luck,"" said Alexa Jones, 24, sounding more like Eloise at the Plaza than Miss Alabama. ""They know who you are.""For the contestants, the slot machines have been little more than a blur en route to rehearsals in the Aladdin theater with its more than 7,000 seats. If they have stopped at all, it is usually at the request of George Burroughs, 27, who mans the guest services desk at the casino entrance and claims to have met at least 15 contestants. Mr. Burroughs said he had not placed a bet on who might win -- per Nevada gaming rules, none of the casinos are permitted to take wagers on the contest -- and was torn as to whom he favored.""I would have to go with the hometown girl, Miss Nevada,"" said Mr. Burroughs, who had nonetheless decorated his black vest with buttons featuring Misses Utah, Louisiana, South Dakota and Connecticut. ""But that Miss California is awfully, awfully pretty.""His enthusiasm notwithstanding, the calculated effort to soak up a little of this city's intoxication with glitz and risk -- the song that will open the pageant Saturday night is a remixed version of Elvis Presley's ""A Little Less Conversation"" -- has also come at a price, depriving Ms. Johnston and hundreds of other pageant devotees of nearly every external touchstone they have come to associate with Miss America.Gone, for example, is Boardwalk Bob, who had sold programs on the night of the pageant for as many years as anyone associated with it could remember. For that matter, there is no Boardwalk, its planks -- notorious for catching the high heels of contestants and spectators alike -- replaced by the drab sidewalks and scaffolding of the booming Las Vegas Strip.And, on the morning after Miss America has been crowned, she will not, as had been tradition, wade up to her ankles in the ocean. The closest major body of water probably lies at the base of the dancing fountains of a competing hotel, the Bellagio across the Strip.""Atlantic City grew up with the pageant, and the pageant grew up with Atlantic City,"" said Ms. Johnston, who has regularly escorted Miss New Jersey to the pageant as co-executive director of the Miss New Jersey Education Foundation, which administers the state competition. ""The people in the hotels -- the same bellhops, the same waitresses -- were excited to see us every year.""But, she quickly added, ""I think it is great for Miss America to make a statement that we are not going to be as complacent as we were.""The move here this year -- pageant organizers have not yet decided where next year's will be -- was driven largely by financial necessity. In 2004, ABC decided to drop the broadcast, making this year the first time in the pageant's 52-year history as a television event that it will not be shown on a major broadcast network. (While the competition drew a respectable 9.8 million viewers in September 2004, the last time it was staged, that represented a loss of more than half the viewers it had attracted a decade earlier.)Though CMT, a unit of Viacom, enthusiastically picked up the telecast and marketed it heavily, it could not match what ABC paid for it in its last year (more than $3 million). Among CMT's innovations was to move it from September to January, when it felt it could better promote it.As a result of a budget deficit -- the magnitude of which the Miss America Organization has yet to disclose -- the scholarship that will be given to this year's winner has been slashed from $50,000 to $30,000, not enough to cover even a year of tuition, room and board at many colleges or graduate schools.But for the competitors, neither the change of venue nor the shrunken purse has appeared to diminish their desire to don Miss America's crown.""My mother told me that for all these years, girls have been coming into our state and taking the crown away,"" said Julie Robenhymer, 24, of Moorestown, N.J. ""She told me, 'You go into someone else's state and bring it back.' ""'"

"'06-01-21,'0','The number of city schools put on a list for strict scrutiny by the state for poor academic performance went up slightly this year, and the number of city schools taken off the list by showing improvement dropped, the state's commissioner of education announced yesterday.Ten city schools -- now at risk of being shut down -- were added to the list of Schools Under Registration Review, known as SURR, bringing the total in the city to 40. Statewide, 61 schools are under review, said the commissioner, Richard Mills.The addition of 10 city schools reverses what had been a trend in the past few years: the number of schools on the list had been falling. There were 55 schools in 2003, 46 in 2004 and 35 last year, an all-time low.But this year a new factor was at work: The state raised the level of performance required to pass its standards. In addition, 6 of the 10 newly named schools are middle schools -- and those schools have for years confounded educators by resisting the improvements that have worked in lower grades and even in high schools. Three city schools were removed from the list this year for improvement in academic performance, but that number was significantly lower than the number removed in each of the past several years. For instance, 16 schools were taken off the list last year.Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein observed that the number of endangered schools still remains at a near-record low.""Nevertheless, we cannot accept failing performance by any of our schools for any reason,"" he said. ""If a school proves incapable of providing a high-quality education to our students despite efforts to improve it, it will be closed."" He said 8 of the 40 schools that have been on the list were scheduled to be closed this year and 5 more will be closed next year.

"'06-01-21,'0','For investors, who just two weeks ago were celebrating the Dow's climb above 11,000, there has been a marked shift in mood. The earlier optimism, fed by expectations that profit growth would remain strong as the Federal Reserve put the brakes on interest rate increases, has eroded in recent days.Market leaders like Intel and Yahoo have missed their earnings targets, and the rise in oil prices has revived concerns that higher energy costs could hold down economic growth.At the beginning of the year, ""people were more focused on the pluses,"" said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief investment strategist at PNC Advisors, a money management firm. ""And all of a sudden we were reminded of some of the minuses today.""Crude oil futures rose 1.52 percent yesterday, settling at $68.35 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil has gained 12 percent since Jan. 3, when the Iranian government said it would resume a nuclear research program suspended for 16 months.As the standoff between Iran and Western nations drags on, the concern among oil experts is that a diplomatic or military confrontation with a major Middle East oil producer will curb oil supplies at a time when all other producers are pumping at their maximum capacity.Unlike 2003, when Saudi Arabia and Kuwait increased their output to make up for the loss in production from Iraq after the American-led invasion, there is now little untapped production capacity left to make up for any loss of Iran's exports, which average 2.4 million barrels a day.""It's a very powerful bull market right now,"" said Thomas Bentz, an oil analyst with BNP Paribas in New York. ""The real concern is whether OPEC can make up for any interruptions in supplies. The problem is that we've lost our security cushion. A potential loss in Iranian oil would be impossible to replace and could send oil to $100.""In a sign of how it might use its influential position on oil markets for political ends, Iran indicated yesterday that it would seek an agreement from OPEC to cut the group's production by one million barrels a day starting in April, ostensibly to make up for a slowdown in demand in the second quarter. But analysts said the request was unlikely to be approved by other OPEC members at a time of rising uncertainty over supplies and continuing high prices.Samuel W. Bodman, the secretary of energy, told CNBC yesterday that he expected that OPEC would continue to supply the market adequately. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are scheduled to meet in Vienna on Jan. 31 to consider their policy for the first half of the year.Adding to these concerns, violence in the Niger Delta, Nigeria's main oil-producing region, has escalated in recent weeks after attacks by armed militants on major pipelines and oil platforms, forcing oil companies to cut production and evacuate some workers.Royal Dutch Shell has cut its output by 221,000 barrels a day, or nearly 10 percent of Nigeria's total production of 2.4 million barrels, after four oil workers were kidnapped on Jan. 11. Nigeria accounts for 3 percent of global oil production.""Such is the momentum and rigidity in views surrounding the Iranian issue, and such is the intensity of the attacks in Nigeria that we would have to say that we believe the supply threats are credible in both cases,"" Barclays Capital analysts said in a note to investors yesterday.The analysts raised their price forecast for 2006 by $7 a barrel, to $68 a barrel to reflect ""the sensitivity of the oil market to the situation in Iran, the strength of the global economy and demand for oil.""Oil touched a high of $70.85 a barrel in August when Hurricane Katrina battered the Gulf of Mexico. The storm shut the nation's top oil producing region and briefly led to gasoline lines in some places.The worries about oil supplies and the disappointing earnings news have got stock investors jittery, said William Gerlach, a senior portfolio manager at Gartmore Global Investments.""You add all those things together and it creates some uncertainty in a market that has done well for the last couple of weeks,"" he said.For the week, the Dow lost 2.67 percent, the S.& P. 500 was down 2.03 percent and the Nasdaq declined 2.99 percent. The Russell 2000 index closed the week down 0.54 percent.Yesterday, investors chose to focus on disappointing statements by a few big names. Shares of General Electric fell $1.31, or 3.8 percent -- its biggest one-day drop since March 2003.Citigroup fell $2.25, or 4.7 percent, to $45.69. Shares of other financial companies fell yesterday, including J. P. Morgan Chase, American Express and Goldman Sachs.The latest disappointment in technology was Motorola, whose quarterly sales fell short of forecasts. Its shares fell $1.87, or 7.7 percent, to $22.48.Despite those prominent misses, most of the companies that have reported earnings so far, about a fifth of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, have either matched or exceeded Wall Street's expectations, according to John Butters, an analyst with Thomson Financial.""When you have some of the big names lower numbers, it sets the mood for everyone,"" he said.'"

"'06-01-21,'0','OIL is on the move again, but that fact is only starting to attract the kind of attention that greeted the move last summer, when the nearby futures price briefly traded over $70 a barrel on concern about the impact of Hurricane Katrina.But this move may be more important, even though the price now is just $68.35, below the summer peak, because it reflects a market that is becoming more worried about the future.The first chart to the right shows the nearby crude oil future, as traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It shows the nearby future at all times, with the February contract being the earliest contract available now.The next chart paints a different picture. It shows the market forecast for oil prices in December 2007. And that price, currently $69.05, is above where it was last summer and is higher than the current spot price.The difference in the behavior stimulated by the summer run-up in prices, and the results of the current one, may yet be significant. That was widely viewed as a temporary event of uncertain duration -- the hurricane recovery -- added to a demand shock that had come from China's growing use of petroleum. Congress passed an energy bill with help for oil companies but little to encourage conservation.'"
"'06-01-22,'0','And then there is Angkor Wat. Foreign visitors are flooding in - 690,987 paid entrance fees last year, up from 451,046 in 2004. And while there are no official figures as to how much each spends in Siem Reap, the town's dizzying array of luxury hotels - at least 10 by my count, ranging from the Raffles Grand Hotel d'Angkor to quirky boutiques like Hôtel de la Paix - testifies to the emergence of a new generation of high-end travelers, who not only demand round-the-clock Khmer massage but are also willing to pay $400 a day to hire a BMW L7 or $1,375 an hour for a helicopter tour.Cambodia is not alone in its luxury revolution. Since the mid-1990's, the former French colonies of Southeast Asia have made enormous leaps in catering to tourists who prefer plunge pools to bucket showers. From the forests of Laos to the beaches of Vietnam to the ruins of Cambodia, you can find well-conceived, well-outfitted, well-run hotels that will sleep you in style for hundreds of dollars a night.Change has come at an amazing pace. Take Luang Prabang, in Laos. This tidy hill town feels like a Hollywood set, with painted lamps glowing in French restaurants and brick walkways brightened by a yellow glow emanating from knee-high terra-cotta pots. Even the bare fluorescent tubes draped over lonely late-night streets do their part to make visitors feel as if they've arrived at the end of the world.But it's not mere atmospherics they've found: Luang Prabang has high-end hotels to house a legion of W-worshipers, with enough bistros and boutiques to keep their credit cards on the verge of meltdown. There are spa treatments to succumb to, and Veuve Clicquot to toast with. This town of just 60,000 people is, almost all of a sudden, a luxury getaway.Less than a decade ago, there were no hotels with infinity pools, no restaurants serving fricassee of wild boar, no silk merchants who took Visa. (Also, no paved roads.) The foreigners who climbed the 328 steps of Mount Phousi were usually backpackers who sought guidance from Lonely Planet's ""Southeast Asia on a Shoestring."" Today, the traveler with a Lonely Planet in one hand is likely to have a Mandarina Duck carry-on in the other.Meanwhile, in Vietnam, well-heeled travelers are making pilgrimages to the Evason Hideaway outside Nha Trang, a coastal town 280 miles northeast of Ho Chi Minh City. The Evason, part of Six Senses, a small Bangkok-based chain of resorts, is without question Vietnam's top resort. The villas are enormous, with private plunge pools and wine cellars (and free Wi-Fi), and rock-star-style privacy is paramount: the mountain-backed resort is accessible only by boat.The Evason is not Vietnam's sole outpost of escapism. Along its 2,140 miles of coastline, there's La Résidence in Hue, the Life Resort in Hoi An and the Furama in Da Nang. You can tour Ha Long Bay in the Emeraude, a replica of a 1920's steamer, or in the Hai Huong, a reproduction of a classic junk. The Victoria chain has been setting up four-star hotels in unusual inland spots, such as Can Tho, Chau Doc and Sapa. And the Evason is already at work on a second resort, in the southern hill town of Da Lat.But in a country like Vietnam, still poor despite a vibrant economy, the luxury business is a tricky balancing act: How over the top can you go without seeming to take advantage?The Evason walks that line with the deftness of a tightrope walker. The 17 villas feel inserted into, not imposed upon, the landscape. Motor vehicles are nowhere to be seen: everyone walks or bikes. Is this eco-tourism? Maybe, but when you're at a wine-tasting in a rock cave, or scraping grilled curried lobster tail from its shell, or spotting parrotfish and sea urchins in the coral-lined bay, it feels like something else entirely.DESPITE all the changes in Cambodia, the immigration desk at Siem Reap International Airport remains a bastion of indifference. When I passed through in October, 10 officials sat behind the visa counter, wordlessly gazing at a mob of tourists, who were hurriedly filling in application forms, fumbling for passport photos and $20 bills, and in the absence of any signs or personnel to direct them, wondering where to go next.Outside, however, it was a different story: A guest assistant from Hôtel de la Paix carried my bag through the parking lot - past a new terminal designed to handle 1.5 million passengers a year when it opens this summer - to a Lexus S.U.V. As we drove into town, listening to Morcheeba on the car's iPod Mini, the driver and I discussed development on the airport road: I could remember when it had few hotels and restaurants; he could remember when it had none.At la Paix, an artfully serene white palace designed by the landscape architect Bill Bensley, another assistant led me into the expansive arts lounge, where I sipped fresh orange juice and split my attention between the movie ""Indochine,"" which was being projected on the wall, and the youthful staff members, who moved about with a surprising sureness of purpose.Soon, an assistant took me to my room - dark woods, creamy fabrics, functioning Wi-Fi and another iPod - and cheerfully helped me plan my stay: a trip to Angkor Wat (with an ""excellence guide,"" he wrote on his notepad) and, almost as important, a local SIM card for my cellphone (""first thing in the morning""). I wandered to the second-floor pool, which flowed like a river from the spa and down to the courtyard, at whose center grew a knotty ficus. Everywhere: calm. The hotel was aptly named.This was a Cambodia so far removed from the one I'd encountered when I first visited, in March 1997, that I began to wonder if I was even in the same country. Back then, Cambodia was the Wild West, with Phnom Penh its Deadwood. My hotel was the Morakat, which had two room-service menus, one for food, the other for girls. My spa treatment was an unceremonious ear-cleaning at a Vietnamese-run barber shop. (I still have nightmares.) I dined on streetside fried noodles and went to a pitch-black nightclub, where a friend and I were shown to our table by a tuxedoed midget with an enormous flashlight.Oh, and the day after I arrived, unidentified assailants threw grenades into a crowd of 200 people demonstrating outside the National Assembly, killing at least 16 and injuring more than 100.To say that Cambodia has come a long way is to state the obvious. Gone are the Khmer Rouge, the Vietnamese occupation, the United Nations democracy-restoration period and the era of warring prime ministers (the current prime minister, Hun Sen, came out on top in 1997). Angkor Wat has been swept clean of land mines, and it is generally safe to travel city streets at night.When I visited Siem Reap in December 1999, it was far from bustling, and visitors to the temples could climb atop the rubble of Ta Prohm unbothered by security guards. The Grand, which dates back to 1932, had been renovated and reopened by the Raffles Group only two years before, and Angkor Village was the resort for in-the-know tourists and expatriates who wanted something nicer than a guesthouse.Now more than 100 hotels serve tourists of all budgets. The Grand has been joined by a Sofitel, Le Meridien and the Sokha Angkor. On the boutique side, Angkor Village must now contend with la Paix, La Résidence d'Angkor, the FCC Angkor, the Shinta Mani and an Aman resort, the Amansara. By the end of this month, the One Hotel plans to open its doors - or, rather, its door: There's just one room, a duplex with flat-screen TV, iBook, Wi-Fi and a whirlpool.These changes are perhaps hardly surprising, given Angkor Wat's popularity and the increasing adventurousness of luxury travelers.""People want to take their lifestyle and life standard with them,"" said Grant Thatcher, the publisher of Luxe City Guides, a series of directories to chic treats in Asia. ""People don't want to just sit in a flea-bitten rat hole and get eaten by mosquitoes.""His guides - to silversmiths in Bali, Dutch colonial antiques in Sri Lanka, orchids in Bangkok - are fast becoming indispensable for their up-to-date intelligence (each is reissued every six months) and cheeky, Daily Candy-in-Hong Kong voice. (On the Metropole, in Hanoi: ""This grand old Gertie has finally got off her colonial bum and begun an upgrade."")Luxe does not yet offer a Cambodia guide, but the entrepreneurs of Siem Reap are doing their best to prepare for it. Want to see Angkor Wat by hot-air balloon? No problem. Is $1 too little to pay for a krama, the traditional Cambodian checked scarf? A crinkly silk boutique version can run more than $50. Want your entire stay videotaped, then edited into a feature-length film? Just ask the One's front desk.It's in the realm of culture that Siem Reap really excels, and to a degree that would be surprising in any tourist locale, let alone one dominated by one of the greatest and most perplexing artistic achievements of all, Angkor Wat. On weekends there are cello concerts, and in December ""Les Nuits d'Angkor,"" a blend of ballet and traditional Khmer dance, takes place in front of the temple itself. My October stay coincided with the Angkor Photography Festival, a week of exhibitions, workshops and exclusive soirées.Just add a soothing glass of pastis, and it's easy to imagine you're in a hub of sophistication, shuttling between cocktail parties, fancy restaurants and gallery openings with a crowd of like-minded travelers. Except that everywhere in Siem Reap - and throughout Cambodia - are reminders of the country's wretched history, crushing poverty and political mismanagement. Take two steps outside your hotel, and you'll find people sleeping in the streets, some of them missing limbs. (Still, there are fewer today than in the past.)Corruption is rampant. Villagers are routinely evicted at gunpoint from their land by the wealthy and well-connected, critics of Hun Sen's policies are liable to find themselves imprisoned, and the leader of the small political opposition, Sam Rainsy, who organized the tragic 1997 demonstration, lost his parliamentary immunity a year ago and fled the country to escape defamation charges; last month, a court convicted him in absentia. The belief among many foreigners living in Cambodia is that this constitutional monarchy is really a totalitarian kleptocracy, its officials enriching themselves at the expense of aid organizations (which heavily subsidize the government's budget), not to mention the long-suffering Cambodian people.Which makes it all the more stunning and delightful and sad that those Cambodians are, for the most part, some of the sweetest people you'll ever meet. Show kindness to a driver, to a bellhop, to the newly middle-class guy drinking a Heineken next to you at the FCC bar, and you'll have an instant friend. After all the dehumanizing treatment they've put up with over the last 30 years, Cambodians, it seems to me, just want to be considered human beings, equals despite the financial disparity between them and the average foreign tourist.It's enough to make you feel guilty as you soak in your freestanding terrazzo tub at la Paix, listening to Miles Davis on the iPod. But the high-end hotels are all too aware that their room rates - $200 to as much as $1,900 -can surpass what the average Cambodian earns in a year. La Paix and its sister, the Shinta Mani, a hotel and hospitality training institute, offer a menu of ""community-based activities"" that lets tourists finance anything from school supplies ($12) to a breeding pair of piglets ($60) to the building of a new house ($980). The One Hotel plans a similar ""Good Karma"" package.F OR some people, it may be hard to imagine Cambodia as a luxury traveler's paradise. Are there really tourists willing to shell out hundreds, even thousands, of dollars a night to see Angkor Wat - knowing that their fancy hotels will not be like Jamaican all-inclusives, conveniently keeping the gritty outside world at bay?I posed the question to Toby Anderson, manager of the Amansara, possibly the nicest - and, at $650 a night and up, definitely the most expensive - resort in town. A former royal residence, the Amansara, with its single-story modernist architecture, still feels like a swinging-60's pad. You can easily imagine Norodom Sihanouk, the former king, standing by the pool with a flute of Champagne in one manicured hand.I followed Mr. Anderson, a tall, fair-featured Australian, to the library, as he rebuffed my suggestion that his guests might have different expectations of Cambodia.""They're well read, they know the history and situation,"" he said. ""They're looking for a Cambodian experience.""I was a backpacker once,"" he added. ""I still like to backpack. I don't know whether the mindset is that different. Does being able to stay in the Amansara change what you experience?""Indeed, he was probably right. Once you ride the vintage Mercedes limo outside the gates of the Amansara compound, you are unmistakably, unavoidably in Cambodia: crumbling roads, frequent floods, implacable heat and tour guides who coolly unload personal tales of Khmer Rouge horror. It's not as if you can, by dint of a fat wallet, hide from this reality.And why would you want to? The draw for millions of people is not just plush beds and nimble-fingered masseuses; it's these three countries' uniquely messy histories and the ways all are struggling to move forward.In the end, what that fat wallet does get you is simply the opportunity to travel - which is, as Henri Mouhot understood, the greatest luxury of all. ""Even if destined here to meet my death,"" he wrote in his journals, ""I would not change my lot for all the joys and pleasures of the civilized world.""If You GoYou can fly from Newark to Siem Reap on Singapore Air, 800-742-3333, www.singaporeair.com, (with a stop in Singapore, a 22-hour trip). Fares start about $1,760 for executive economy and $6,365 for business, with taxes.The telephone code for Cambodia is 855.Since Siem Reap has no formal taxi service, the most common means of transport is the tuk-tuk, or motorized rickshaw, which offers little protection from rain, dust, noise and heat. Still, they're convenient. Most rides around town cost less than $2 (generally, dollars are preferred to riels).Renting a car is far more relaxing. Your hotel can arrange anything from a four-wheel drive to a vintage limousine. A Toyota Land Cruiser with driver will run $17 an hour at Hôtel de la Paix; the BMW at the Raffles Grand is $400 a day.To see the temples by helicopter, contact Angkor Scenic Flights, near the Old Market (12-814-500 angkorscenicflights.com). An eight-minute Angkor Wat flyby costs $68 a person (three to five people); a 14-minute flight is $120. Charter flights can get you quickly to temples that might take all day to reach by land, for $1,375 an hour, plus taxes.Outside Phnom Penh, Cambodians are not big on addresses. Once I asked a receptionist the name of the street her hotel was on. ""I forget,"" she said after a moment, ""because I don't care.""At the 74-year-old Raffles Grand Hotel d'Angkor, the past is on display everywhere you look: the white-gravel driveway, the iron-cage elevator, the colonial-style bathroom fixtures and ceiling fans. The restaurant requires men to wear jackets at dinner. Still, it's far from stuffy, with visitors drinking gin and tonics in the Elephant Bar. The hotel is at 1 Vithei Charles de Gaulle, Khum Svay Dang Kum, 63-963-888, www.raffles.com. Doubles start at $360, but for an extra-special time, book the 3,180-square-foot villa ($1,900 a night).Though Hôtel de la Paix (Sivatha Boulevard, 63-966-000, hoteldelapaixangkor.com) is new, its roots run back a half-century to the original Paix, an Art Deco hotel that stood on the same spot; its owner was a guerilla fighter -turned-businessman named Dap Chhuon. The $400-a-night duplex suites have rooftop terraces the size of a Manhattan one-bedroom and, of course, every room has an iPod. Standard doubles from $195.The Amansara, on the road to Angkor (63-760-333, amanresorts.com), may be the anti-Grand: Modern rather than Classical, intimate rather than sprawling, casual rather than formal. The suites, starting at $650, are big enough to have their own courtyards. Twelve new suites have plunge pools ($850). Two meals a day are included, as well as a car and driver for visiting the temples.WHERE TO EAT AND DRINKWhile Cambodian food looks a bit like that of neighboring Thailand and Vietnam - curries and stews, noodle dishes and lots of rice - it's rarely as tasty. Still, the most ambitious restaurants in town like Meric, at Hôtel de la Paix (63-966-000) are trying to resurrect Cambodian fine dining. Paul Hutt, Meric's chef (and a friend of mine) is devoted to digging up unusual ingredients, like dried snake, and glamming up traditional peasant food, like rice flakes and prahok, the ubiquitous and pungent fish paste. The Khmer set menu is usually $35 a person (many restaurants price in dollars).For classic Cambodian food, Khmer Kitchen, in an alley near the Old Market called the Passage (12-763-468), may be the best in town. It's not fancy, but the menu of simple curries, fried pumpkin and spicy meat salads called larb was good enough for Mick Jagger and, at about $12 for dinner for two, cheap enough for his fans.Dead Fish Tower (Sivatha Street, 12-630-377, talesofasia.com/cambodia-deadfish.htm) is a bizarre Cambodian take on dinner theater. Upstairs, you can watch traditional dancing and downstairs, you can feed the crocodiles. (They get their fish raw - happily, you get it curried.) Dinner for two is about $15.In a more modern vein, there's Abacus (Om Khun Street, 12-644-286). Get a table amid the silk lanterns in the garden, and sample entrees like the ostrich in red-wine sauce ($13).There are a million bars in Siem Reap, many of them on what has come to be known as Pub Street, and most filled with Australian backpackers. But nearby there's also Laundry Bart (276 Group 10, Module 1 Village, east of the Old Market, 16-962-026), a slick, dark lounge that feels like the East Village circa 1995.Linga, near the Old Market Across from the One Hotel (12-246-912, lingabar.com), is a straight-friendly gay bar with expertly mixed cocktails.'"
"'06-01-22,'0','Perhaps, demographers said. By some estimates, 300,000 people were displaced by the flood, and it is widely believed that a large majority of them were black. Though the floodwaters destroyed white neighborhoods, they were particularly devastating to the historically black areas of New Orleans East and the Ninth Ward, former swampland known collectively as ""the bowl.""""There is a legitimate fear on the part of some African-Americans that it is happening,"" said Elliott Stonecipher, a political pollster and demographer from Shreveport, La., referring to a permanent black depopulation of New Orleans. ""I don't know of a place where this kind of demographic shift has ever occurred. It is a huge, huge shift.""William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that New Orleans' black population has been extraordinarily rooted in the city, with many people tracing their ties to before the Civil War. Before Katrina, 88 percent of blacks in New Orleans were born in Louisiana. By comparison, just 57 percent of blacks in Atlanta were born in Georgia.Such statistics lead Mr. Frey to believe that many displaced blacks will come home. ""If the same thing happened to Las Vegas, you wouldn't have the same commitment,"" he said. But for many people, returning will depend on whether they see progress in reconstruction. ""That's why it's important for the mayor to come up with a concrete plan for rebuilding,"" he said.Paradoxically, it is a plan developed by the mayor's Bring New Orleans Back commission that is fueling concerns among some blacks that New Orleans will not emerge as a majority black city again. The commission's proposal, released two weeks ago, recommended a four-month moratorium on rebuilding in the most damaged neighborhoods to allow time for determining which should be left permanently fallow.The proposal was greeted by a torrent of protest, led by the N.A.A.C.P. and former Mayor Marc H. Morial, a scion of one of the city's most powerful black families and president of the National Urban League.For many blacks, the blueprint seemed to support a ""smaller footprint"" for the city, built mainly on higher ground. And in New Orleans, higher ground means more expensive ground, white ground, Mr. Stonecipher said.""In the eyes of the African-Americans in New Orleans, when you say smaller footprint you are saying that inside the bowl will not be rebuilt,"" Mr. Stonecipher said.Many political analysts said that the mayor's uncharacteristically impassioned speech about a ""chocolate"" city resulted from his recognition that his commission's proposal had infuriated many blacks.Mr. Nagin, who is black and a Democrat, has never had strong political ties to the city's black political elite. A former Cox Communications executive, he won election with overwhelming support from white voters and business leaders, and maintained closer ties to President Bush and Louisiana Republican officials than to his own party leadership.But he is facing re-election this year, and he cannot afford to lose too many black votes, political analysts said. Douglas Brinkley, a historian at Tulane University in New Orleans, said he believed that Mr. Nagin thought that ""Chocolate City,"" the title of a song by Parliament, the pioneering funk band, ""was a code word that would tap into getting African-American support.""Mr. Nagin is not the only politician whose fate could be determined by changes to New Orleans' population. The city has long been the backbone of Louisiana's Democratic Party, dominated by the Morial and Landrieu families. Black voter turnout there was crucial to United States Senator Mary L. Landrieu, the daughter of a former mayor of New Orleans, Moon Landrieu, in her narrow victories of 1996 and 2002.For those reasons, some blacks see a political conspiracy in the proposals for a smaller New Orleans, analysts said. Fears about New Orleans becoming majority white have also made some black politicians wary of proposals to revamp New Orleans' schools and city government, which are widely viewed as corrupt, bloated and inefficient.Advocates for overhauling the city government said such worries are misplaced, asserting that proposals to streamline it or fight corruption will help New Orleans win federal aid and lure back displaced residents who have witnessed better services in other cities.""These are the types of things that have been talked about for a long time, but we just couldn't do them politically,"" said Barry Erwin, president of the Council for a Better Louisiana, a nonpartisan public policy group.Though Mr. Nagin has apologized for his ""chocolate"" remarks, Mr. Stonecipher said they have injected some honesty into the debate over New Orleans' future, however inadvertently. A forthright discussion about race might ease tensions that are slowing reconstruction, he asserts.""There is an absence of frankness that keeps us from having the discussion and moving on,"" Mr. Stonecipher said. ""That's why everyone is scratching their heads saying, 'Why are we five months down the road and nothing is happening?' ""'"
"'06-01-22,'0','The driver is the shape of a head talking without turning around, a Middle Eastern accent.""Tre-mont and Broad-way, you can drop me off on the corn-er. You don't know the way, you can stop and I'm getting out.""""Tray-mont. Is close to where?""""In-man Square,"" he says loudly. ""Head that way. You can't find it, I'll walk and you don't get paid.""The driver stomps on the brake. He turns around, his dark face and dark eyes glowering at him.""You don't pay, you get out!""""You see this?"" Win snatches out his wallet, shoves his Massachusetts State Police shield close to the driver's face. ""You want tickets the rest of your life? Your inspection sticker's expired. You realize that? One of your taillights is burned out. You aware of that? Just take me to Broadway. Think you can find the damn City Hall Annex? I'll direct you from there.""They ride in silence. Win sits in back, his hands clenched in his lap because he just had dinner with Monique Lamont, who's running for governor and oddly expects him to make Governor Crawley, who's running for re-election, look good so she'll look good, the two of them looking good when they run against each other. Politics. Christ. As if either one of them really cares about some murdered old lady down in the boonies of Tennessee. He gets more resentful by the moment as he sits in the dark and the taxi driver drives, having no idea where he's going unless Win tells him.""That's Tremont there, take a right,"" Win finally says, pointing. ""Just up there on the left. O.K., you can let me out here.""The house pains him every time he sees it, two-story, paint-peeled wood siding that is overgrown with ivy. Like the woman who lives inside, Win's family home has seen nothing but bad times for the last 50 years. He climbs out of the cab and hears the chiming of wind chimes in the dark backyard. He sets his latte on the taxi's roof, digs in a pocket and throws a crumpled 10-dollar bill through the driver's window.""Hey! Get a G.P.S.,"" he says as the wind chimes play their magic, airy music, as the taxi speeds off and the latte slides off the roof and pops open on the road, and milky coffee streams over the black pavement, and the chimes sweetly chime as if excited to see him.The thick, moist air stirs, and sweet, light chimes sound from the shadows and the trees, from doors and windows he can't see, chimes sound from everywhere because his grandmother believes chimes should chime all the time to ward off bad spirits, and he's never said, Well if it really works, then how do you explain our lives? He digs a key out of his pocket and unlocks the front door, pushes it open.""Nana? It's me,"" he calls out.Inside the foyer are the same family photographs and paintings of Jesus and crucifixes crowded over the horsehair plaster, all dusty. He shuts the door, locks it, sets his keys on an old oak table that he's looked at most of his life.The TV is on in the living room, turned up high, sirens screaming, Nana and her cop shows. The volume seems higher since he was here last, maybe because he's gotten used to quiet. Anxiety touches him as he follows the sound to the living room, where nothing has changed since he was a boy except that Nana has accumulated more crystals and stones and statues of cats and dragons and St. Michael the Archangel and magical wreathes and bundles of herbs and incense, hundreds of all of it everywhere.""Oh!"" she exclaims when the sound of him finally jettisons her out of some ""Hill Street Blues"" rerun.""Didn't mean to startle you."" He smiles, goes to the couch and kisses her cheek.""My darling,"" she says, clasping his hands.He picks up the remote control from a table covered with more crystals and magical trinkets and stones and her deck of tarot cards. He turns off the TV and makes his usual assessment. Nana looks all right, her dark eyes alert and bright in her sharp-featured face, a face very smooth for her age, beautiful once, her long white hair piled on top of her head. She's wearing her usual silver jewelry, bracelets practically up to her elbows, and rings and necklaces, and the blaze orange N.F.A. sweatshirt he sent her a few weeks ago. She never fails to put on something he gave her when she knows she'll see him. She always seems to know. He doesn't have to tell her.""You didn't have your alarm on,"" he says, opening his gym bag, setting jars of sourwood honey, barbecue sauce and bread-and-butter pickles on the coffee table.It occurs to him that he left the bottle of bourbon in the faculty-club cloakroom. He didn't remember, and Lamont didn't notice that he didn't have it when they left. That figures.""What did you bring me?"" Nana is asking.""I don't pay the alarm company all that money for wind chimes. Some local stuff, made right there in Tennessee. If you'd rather have moonshine, I'll bring that next time,"" he teases, settling in a worn-out chair she keeps covered in a purple afghan that one of her clients crocheted for her a few years back.She picks up her cards and says, ""What's this about money?""""Money?"" He frowns. ""Now don't go doing your juju on me, Nana.""""Something about money. You were just doing something that had to do with money.""""That boss lady of yours, I suppose."" She slowly shuffles through the cards, her way of having a conversation, and she places a moon card next to her on the couch. ""You watch out for that one. Illusions and madness or poetry and visions. You get to choose.""""How are you feeling? You eating something besides whatever people bring you?""People give her food for readings, give her all sorts of things, whatever they can afford.She places another card face up on the sofa, this one a robed man carrying a lantern, and the rain has picked up again, sounds like a drumroll, tree branches scraping against window glass, wind chimes a distant frantic clanging.""What did she want with you?"" his grandmother says. ""That's who you were with tonight.""""Nothing for you to worry about. The good thing is I get to see you.""""She keeps things hidden behind a curtain, very troublesome things, this high priestess in your life."" She turns another card face up, this one the colorful image of a man hanging by one foot from a tree, coins falling out of his pockets.""Nana."" He sighs. ""She's the D.A., a politician. She's not a high priestess, and I don't consider her in my life.""""Oh, she's in it, all right,"" his grandmother says, looking keenly at him. ""There's someone else. I'm seeing a man in scarlet. Ha! That one goes in the freezer right away!""His grandmother's way of taking care of destructive people is to write their names or descriptions on scraps of paper and tuck them in the freezer. Clients pay good money to have her consign their enemies to her old Frigidaire, and last time he checked, her freezer looked like the inside of a paper-shredder basket. Win's phone vibrates, and he removes it from his jacket pocket, looks at the display, the number blocked.""Excuse me,"" he says, getting up, moving closer to a window, rain flailing the glass.""Is this Winston Garano?"" a man asks in a voice that is obviously disguised, a really bad fake accent that almost sounds British.""Who wants to know?""""I think you might want to have a coffee with me, Davis Square, the Diesel Café, where all the freaks and fags hang out. It's open late.""""Let's start with you telling me who you are.""He watches his grandmother shuffle through more tarot cards, placing them face up on the table, thoughtful and at ease with them as if they are old friends.""Not over the phone,"" the man says.The murdered old woman suddenly enters Win's mind.

He imagines her pitiful, brutalized body on a cold steel autopsy table, doesn't know why he's suddenly thinking about her, tries to push her away.""I don't meet strangers for coffee when they don't tell me who they are or what they want,"" he says into the phone.""Vivian Finlay ring a bell? I'm pretty sure you want to talk to me.""""I'm not seeing any reason at all why I should talk to you,"" Win says as his grandmother sits calmly on the sofa, going through cards, placing another one face up, this one red and white with a pentacle and a sword.""Midnight. Be there."" The man ends the call.""Nana, I've got to go out for a while,"" Win says, pocketing his phone, hesitating by the rain-splattered window, getting one of his feelings, the wind chimes a discordant banging.""Watch out for that one,"" she says, picking another card.Sometimes she forgets to put gas in it, and even divine intervention doesn't prevent the engine from quitting.""Was last time I drove it.

His headlights flash in the eyes of a dog wandering along the roadside.""Oh for God's sake,"" Win says loudly, as he stops the car and gets out.""Miss Dog, whatcha doing out here, girl?"" he says to the poor wet dog. ""Come here. It's me, come on, come on, that's a good girl.""Miss Dog, part beagle, part shepherd, part deaf, part blind, a name as stupid as her owner, creeps forward, sniffs Win's hand, remembers him, wags her tail. He strokes her wet, dirty fur, picks her up and puts her in the front seat, massaging her neck as he drives her to a run-down house two blocks away.

Win yells back at her.The door opens, the ugly, fat woman on the other side wearing a shapeless pink robe, has no bottom teeth, stinks like cigarettes.

"'06-01-22,'0','That would be fine if there was an agreement between the neighbors, known as an easement, that would protect the windows. But without an easement, Mr. Walentas or a future owner could build up to the lot line, blocking the windows and putting the apartments in violation of city rules requiring access to light and air.Mr. Boymelgreen said last Thursday he thought that an easement was already in place when he bought the building and that he didn't realize it was an issue until city officials reviewing the project asked to see the easement last summer. He said he sent his employees to look in city records, but all they could find was a 1997 paper filed with the Department of Buildings that cited a ""handwritten easement dated June 11, 1900."" The document was nowhere to be found.All this time, Mr. Walentas had been watching work progress on Mr. Boymelgreen's building. He said he was aware of the easement issue but he did not bring it up with his neighbor until last September, when his son and business partner, Jed Walentas, contacted one of Mr. Boymelgreen's employees. He offered to work out a deal for an easement, according to people on both sides of the dispute, provided Mr. Boymelgreen would allow Mr. Walentas to acquire a nearby property at 45 Front Street that he has long desired. Mr. Boymelgreen is currently in contract to buy that building, known locally as the Nova Clutch Building because of the business that occupies it.Mr. Boymelgreen refused to link the two issues and the stage was set for the developers' smackdown.Then, as buyers in Mr. Boymelgreen's building were hoping to close on their apartments last fall, Mr. Walentas had a lawyer, Jed S. Marcus, contact officials at the state attorney general's office, which regulates condos, and alert them to the absence of an easement.The attorney general began discussions with Mr. Boymelgreen, who responded on Nov. 23 with a proposal for several changes to his project. The units with only bedroom windows on the lot line would instead be designated as studios, he said, and the bedrooms would be renamed studies, which are not required to have windows under city law.For the apartments in the back of the building with all their windows on the lot line, Mr. Boymelgreen proposed to cut a notch in the back wall, 5 feet deep and about 15 feet across. Each apartment would have a window in the notch, so that if Mr. Walentas or some future owner built something on the adjoining property, a sort of air shaft would be left that would meet the city's light and air requirements. These apartments would also be designated as studios.Mr. Boymelgreen's submission noted, however, that by turning 12 one-bedroom apartments into studios, the building might fail to qualify for a city property tax break for future residents.As a result of the changes, Mr. Boymelgreen agreed to offer all the buyers in the building the chance to tear up their contracts and get their deposits back. Brad Maione, a spokesman for Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, said that Mr. Boymelgreen's proposed changes are being evaluated.But the submission to the attorney general included one more unusual detail. The developer had been notified, it said, that Mr. Walentas planned to install ""a steel sculpture"" in his parking lot ""that will substantially block all of the lot line windows on the property line.""In the meantime, none of the sales in the building have been permitted to close and the buyers who have been waiting for their apartments, some of them for more than a year, remain in limbo. Eight have already pulled out and gotten their deposits back, Mr. Boymelgreen said.Jason and Carrie Craig signed a contract in January 2005, to pay $825,000 for a fifth-floor one-bedroom apartment in the back of the building, which Mr. Craig said had ""a great view of Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge."" Buyers in the building had been promised closing dates as early as last summer, he said, but construction delays held up the closings at first and then gradually buyers like the Craigs began to suspect that there were other problems.Mr. Craig said that after pushing for information, he finally learned of the issues with the lot line windows. Theirs was one of the units with all the windows on the property line and the couple decided in December to pull out of their contract and take back their deposit.But Mr. Craig, a lawyer, said the damage has been done. The couple live in a one-bedroom rental in Battery Park City and would still like to buy in Dumbo, but Mr. Craig feels the market has ""run away from us.""""We basically are priced out of the market for what's available now and we wouldn't have been had we not been stuck in this predicament,"" Mr. Craig said. One of the developments that has gotten beyond their reach is 70 Washington Street, a condo conversion a block away from Mr. Boymelgreen's building. The developer there, of course, is Mr. Walentas.""I felt that we were caught in a turf war between the two big owners of that area while they were trying to work out their differences,"" Mr. Craig said.Mr. Boymelgreen said the problems arose from an ""honest mistake"" and said it would be wrong to suggest he was intentionally trying to push his project through without the proper paperwork. ""If I knew anything like this, if I knew I couldn't close with the buyers, why would I keep it this way?"" he said. ""It just doesn't make sense, the whole thing.""He accused Mr. Walentas of unfairly trying to pressure him into relinquishing the Nova Clutch Building and said he would not link that deal to the condo dispute.Mr. Walentas acknowledged his interest in acquiring the Nova Clutch Building. He filed a lawsuit two years ago against the owners, charging they had agreed to sell it to him before they signed a contract with Mr. Boymelgreen, but the legal action was unsuccessful. He owns several other properties on the block and if he were able to combine them into a single development parcel, he said he could build an apartment building of about 12 stories on Water Street.Mr. Walentas said there never was an easement with 57 Front Street, and he now plans to proceed with what he is calling a ""sculpture"" on the property line. ""It's steel columns in front of the windows with plates strategically placed where the windows are, just as a little negotiation,"" he said.Asked if that wasn't an extreme negotiating technique, he responded, ""To sell people apartments that can't be legally occupied is a little extreme.""Plans for the sculpture were first submitted to the city last February and a building permit was issued in October.""It frankly was designed to block those windows,"" Mr. Walentas said. ""So we torture him a little bit.""A Very Strong Start For the Very High EndIF you have your eye on that perfect $20 million co-op, you'd better hurry.Brokers and a leading appraiser say that the very high end of the Manhattan real estate market has been extremely busy in the last few weeks, after a lull in the second half of 2005.Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said he was involved in negotiating three deals at $20 million or more in the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, which is usually a quiet time. He said two of those deals have gone to contract and discussions are continuing on the third.Mr. Willkie said the activity was all the more extraordinary because there have been only about a dozen co-op deals for $20 million and above in the history of Manhattan real estate. Mr. Willkie said sales at the high end of the market dropped off after the middle of last year because there was a lack of inventory. The few listings available, he said, were often offered at inflated prices, even for that level. But more recently, a number of new listings have stirred interest.""It has been remarkable,"" said Kirk Henckels, the director of Stribling Private Brokerage, who tracks high-end sales. He said he was aware of six co-op listings with asking prices of $20 million or more that had either gone into contract since early December or had resulted in negotiations that are still under way with serious buyers. Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm based in Manhattan, said the number of very-high-end deals in late 2005 and at the start of this year appeared to be ahead of the same period a year ago. If several of these deals close in the next three months, Mr. Miller said, ""you could see a spike in the average sale price.""While brokers have expected high-end property sales to benefit from Wall Street bonuses, Mr. Willkie said the three deals at $20 million and up being handled by his firm were not connected to bonus money.'"

"'06-01-22,'0','I am a subspecialty physician without primary responsibility for patients. I consulted on the care of the C.E.O. of a major company, the seriousness of whose illness was not being fully disclosed to shareholders. I own stock in this company. Once I complete my consultation, may I ethically sell my shares, motivated by the information I gained as a doctor?Medical ethics do not forbid this trade, but investor ethics -- a curious phrase, given recent headlines -- do, so you may not make this sale.An essential question for a physician is this: Would my actions adversely affect patient care? In this case, I think not, unless you're hatching an elaborate scheme to short the stock and let the patient deteriorate, a dubious investment strategy but a great idea for a Michael Crichton story. And given that you don't actually treat this patient, there is even less likelihood of your undermining his health.But what the A.M.A. allows, the S.E.C. does not. Gregg M. Mashberg, an attorney specializing in securities law, notes that the legal issue is complicated (well, he would; he is an attorney, and one who's never even met you). ""The physician runs a very serious risk that his stock trade could be deemed illegal insider trading under what we call the 'misappropriation' theory,"" he notes. That is, material gained in a confidential relationship like that between a doctor and patient may not be used to trade stock. Mashberg's advice is prudent. While your risk of being prosecuted seems slight, the idea that underpins this stricture -- you should not trade on privileged physician's information -- is ethically sound.But why assume that the news of a C.E.O.'s ill health would depress a company's stock? The lachrymose shareholders of a struggling company -- an automobile manufacturer, an airline carrier -- might be delighted to learn that current management had contracted career-ending maladies, and wish them a full recovery and happy retirement.I am a design professor at a state university that is unable to adequately fund our graphics program and thus to provide the fonts we need to teach typography.

"'06-01-22,'0','Just across from Achilles that night was another G.P.O. named Mikala, their two tanks connected by an overhead, see-through passageway, the doors to which were closed. Mikala was a recent replacement for Helen, who had just been released back into the sea after a failed attempt by the scientists to mate her with Achilles. Anderson told me that they had left Achilles and Helen together in the same tank for a week, but, he said, ""there wasn't any chemistry."" In the coming months, they would be trying the same routine with Mikala, to see if anything clicked.At one point I decided to absent myself from Achilles' stare and walk around to the far side of his tank to look at Mikala in hers. Standing in the narrow space beneath the overhead passageway, I found her sound asleep, mushed between her tank's outer glass and some craggy rocks. I thought about tapping the glass to see if I could stir her, but decided to leave her be. When I turned around, Achilles was right there behind me, bobbing against the glass, bright red, his black eyes opened wide.""How do we even define what an emotion is in an animal?"" I recalled Roland Anderson asking earlier that day. ""And why do they even have these different temperaments?""It was back in 1991 that Anderson and Jennifer Mather, a psychologist from the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada, first decided to undertake a joint personality study of 44 smaller red octopuses at the aquarium as a way to begin to codify and systematize what they thought they had been observing. Using three categorizations from a standard human-personality-assessment test -- shy, aggressive and passive -- their data would ultimately show that the animals did consistently clump together under these different categories in response to various stimuli, like touching them with a bristly test-tube brush or dropping a crab into the tank.""The aggressive ones would pounce on the crab,"" Anderson told me. ""The passive ones would wait for the crab to come past and then grab it. The shy animal would wait till overnight when no one was looking, and we'd find this little pile of crab shell in the morning.""Anderson and Mather's resulting 1993 paper in the Journal of Comparative Psychology, entitled ""Personalities of Octopuses,"" was not only the first-ever documentation of personality in invertebrates. It was the first time in anyone's memory that the term ""personality"" had been applied to a nonhuman in a major psychology journal.Scientists are not typically disposed to wielding a word like ""personality"" when talking about animals. Doing so borders on the scientific heresy of anthropomorphism. And yet for a growing number of researchers from a broad range of disciplines -- psychology, evolutionary biology and ecology, animal behavior and welfare -- it is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid that term when trying to describe the variety of behaviors that they are now observing in an equally broad and expanding array of creatures, everything from nonhuman primates to hyenas and numerous species of birds to water striders and stickleback fish and, of course, giant Pacific octopuses.In fact, in the years since Anderson and Mather's original paper, a whole new field of research has emerged known simply as ""animal personality."" Through close and repeated observations of different species in a variety of group settings and circumstances, scientists are finding that our own behavioral traits exist in varying degrees and dimensions among creatures across all the branches of life's tree. Observing our fellow humans, we all recognize the daredevil versus the more cautious, risk-averse type; the aggressive bully as opposed to the meek victim; the sensitive, reactive individual versus the more straight-ahead, proactive sort, fairly oblivious to the various subtle signals of his surroundings. We wouldn't have expected to meet all of them, however, in everything from farm animals and birds to fish and insects and spiders. But more and more now, we are recognizing ourselves and our ways to be recapitulations of the rest of biology. And as scientists track these phenomena, they are also beginning to unravel such core mysteries as the bioevolutionary underpinnings of personality, both animal and human; the dynamic interplay between genes and environment in the expression of various personality traits; and why it is that nature invented such a thing as personality in the first place.Animal personality studies are only the most recent manifestation of the inroads that science is now making into what has long been uncharted terrain: the very inscrutability of our fellow creatures that has, from the dawn of human consciousness, both begotten and bound us to our wildest imaginings about them. All sorts of research has been done in recent years revealing various aspects of animal complexity: African gray parrots that can not only count but can also grasp the concept of zero; self-recognition, empathy and the cultural transference of tool use in both chimps and dolphins; individual face-recognition among sheep; courtship songs in mice; laughter in rats. This is no longer merely the stuff of anthropomorphism or isolated anecdote. As Jaak Panksepp, the neuroscientist who first discovered rat laughter, has pointed out: ""Every drug used to treat emotional and psychiatric disorders in humans was first developed and found effective in animals. This kind of research would obviously have no value if animals were incapable of experiencing these emotional states.""Now, with the emergence of animal-personality studies, we are gaining an even fuller appreciation not only of the distinctiveness of birds and beasts and their behaviors but also of their deep resemblances to us and our own. Somehow, through the very creatures we have long piggybacked upon to tell stories about ourselves, we are beginning to get at the essence of that one aspect of the self we have long thought to be exclusively and quintessentially ours: the individual personality. The octopuses' garden is proving to be quite deeply and variously shaded indeed.Appropriately enough for a newly emerging psychological science, the world's first Animal Personality Institute, or A.P.I., is still more of a proposition than a physical place. Indeed, outside of a newly established Web site with a flashy bright blue logo, A.P.I.'s only visitable locale can be found on the third floor of the psychology-department building at the University of Texas in Austin, in the small, book-crammed office of A.P.I.'s founder, Sam Gosling, a London-born, 37-year-old professor of psychology. ""This here is my collection of animal-personality literature,"" Gosling told me one afternoon in October, pointing to a long row of thick blue binders along the top shelf of his office's bookcase, including animal studies from fields as diverse as agricultural science, anthropology, psychology, veterinary medicine and zoology. ""We're trying to scan them all and make them available, because part of. . . I mean.. . .""A tall, gaunt figure whose flowing locks, untucked striped shirt, slightly flared bell bottoms and ankle-high leather boots give him the appearance of a 60's-era British rock star, Gosling is given to switching gears midsentence, his active mind going in a number of directions at once. ""Part of what we're trying to do here,"" he continued, ""is create a field.""Gosling, who often refers to himself as ""a bit of a fraud,"" being what he calls ""a personality expert who knows very little about actual animals,"" was a young graduate student in psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, when he first came upon Anderson and Mather's paper on octopus personality. It was not at all an area of research he expected to be poking his nose into, having originally attended Berkeley to pursue a degree in human personality. But in the course of one of his first seminars, he suddenly found his thoughts going in an unlikely direction, what he now refers to as his ""reductio ad absurdum moment.""""It was a basic seminar in human personality,"" he recalled. ""We were considering the question of what is personality. And I thought, O.K., let's try to push it to its limit. To find out what personality is, let's start by taking what's clearly outside that category and discover what's different about that. Let's take animals. They obviously don't have personality. So then I thought, O.K., if animals don't have it, then what is it that makes them not have it, and I couldn't come up with an answer.""A standard answer, of course, is that animals do not, as far as we know, reflect upon and argue with their experiences, emotions and behaviors in the way that we humans do. They do not possess, in other words, that dynamic, self-reflective, internal dialogue the very outcome of which is, many scientists say, our personality. Of course, whether or not self-knowledge is truly a defining characteristic of personality is a question scientists disagree on, as they do about much else in the field. Indeed, the whole notion of personality is one that we only began trying to measure and codify in the past century. Personality theory started showing up in the writings of Ivan Pavlov and Sigmund Freud as a somewhat vague, broadly drawn concept. It has only been in the last 60 years or so that the modern science of human personality began to emerge, a system of assessing distinct personality traits that has its roots in World War II, when the U.S. government assigned to the Office of Strategic Services (the forerunner of today's C.I.A.) the task of identifying which individuals had the right traits to be spies. A number of different personality-mapping methods and traits-assessment tests have been developed over the years, all of them pivoting around the principle that certain traits can be consistently observed in individuals across time and different situations. The most widely applied test today uses the categories defined by what is known as the Five-Factor Model (F.F.M.): openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Under each of these broad dimension headings are so-called clusters of recognizable traits: an extroverted person, for example, is more sociable, outgoing and assertive; a neurotic one, more anxious, moody and stressed.Gosling, however, was intent on exploring personality at its most rudimentary level -- below the radar, if you will, of human consciousness. Applying some of the very same personality assessments that we use on humans, he wondered whether we could observe in animals essential traits like fearfulness, aggressiveness, affability or calmness, traits that can exist outside of cognition and yet are clearly and repeatedly apparent in varying measures in different individual animals within a given species.Does one duck, in other words, behave consistently differently from another duck, over time and across situations? If so, why doesn't that meet the definition of personality as we apply it to ourselves, regardless of the presence or absence of self-awareness? In a sense, Gosling was posing a psychologist's rendition of that old philosophical query about whether the tree that falls in the forest, miles from anyone's ears, still makes a sound. That is, if an animal behaves in distinctly consistent ways but isn't fully cognizant of such behaviors, can the behaviors still be aspects and indications of its personality?One way Gosling set about answering that question was to focus on a colony of 34 hyenas being kept on the Berkeley campus by Steve Glickman, a professor of psychology. With Glickman's blessing, Gosling asked four caretakers of the colony to independently fill out questionnaires about each animal, using a modified version of the F.F.M. test. He soon found that the caretakers' assessments had the same level of agreement, or ""convergence,"" as is found in assessments done on humans, with such distinct human dimensions as ""excitability,"" ""sociability,"" ""curiosity"" and ""assertiveness"" being repeatedly observed.Gosling then reviewed 19 different previous behavioral studies of nonhuman species through the same F.F.M. framework and found a similar recurrence of those dimensions across a surprisingly broad spectrum of species. Among the traits remarked upon were such things as ""opportunistic, self-serving"" behavior in certain vervet monkeys; ""emotionality"" in rats; ""fear avoidance"" in some guppies and ""extroversion"" in others; and, in Anderson and Mather's 1993 paper, both ""boldness"" and ""avoidance"" in octopuses.""The evolutionary continuity between humans and other animals suggests that some dimensions of personality may be common across a wide range of species,"" Gosling wrote in the resulting paper he published in 1999 in the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science. ""Scientists have been reluctant to ascribe personality traits, emotion and cognitions to animals, even though they readily accept that the anatomy and physiology of humans is similar to that of animals. Yet there is nothing in evolutionary theory to suggest that only physical traits are subject to selection pressures.""Gosling told me that his seminar adviser thought the whole thing sounded a bit ""goofy"" at first. Some of his fellow students, meanwhile, were irked at him for trying to bring the field of personality to disrepute, as Gosling put it, by studying silly, trivial, frivolous stuff. The major sticking point, of course, was his insistence on using the obviously loaded word ""personality,"" a choice that he admits was purposefully provocative.In some quarters, the term still rankles. ""Personality ratings have been done with chimps where you can see in them intimations of human characteristics,"" says Jack Block, an emeritus professor of personality psychology at Berkeley. ""Now, where you want to take that, I don't know. Even with chimps, it is a big extrapolation from them to us. But personality in fruit flies or octopi? Heck, no. All living organisms do react to pain and seek what they have developed to want in terms of food or mating. But they cannot manifest the complexity of responses that human beings can.""John Capitanio, a psychology professor at the University of California, Davis, who does extensive behavioral studies with rhesus monkeys, is more willing to extrapolate. ""Animal behaviorists or behavioral ecologists are mostly interested in what the animal is presenting them with in terms of behavior,"" he told me recently. ""And yet the behaviors exhibited are not dissimilar from our own, and that's what causes us to infer these personality characteristics. Now do they really exist in animals? I think the answer is yes, they do in some form.""In many of his early talks, people would ask Gosling why he didn't use the word ""temperament"" instead of personality. His response was -- and is -- that temperament is always invoked as a purely biological, inherited quality, whereas personality is thought of as a ""higher order phenomenon"" that grows out of the interaction of our inherited temperaments and our experiences. If he used only the word temperament with animals, he would be dismissing the possibility that they may have some of the same personality processes as humans. ""I don't want to rule that out,"" Gosling told me. ""I also think the word personality is as appropriate for animals as it is for us. Of course, we still have to be suspicious. People will also rate the personality of a loaf of bread or a car. A colleague has poked fun at me about that: 'A temperamental car is difficult to start across time and situations. So why isn't that personality?' Well, the fundamental difference, of course, is that with an animal there is an underlying physiology and biology. Saying my car is temperamental is an analogy. And some people will rate dogs not only as friendly or fearful but as philosophical. Now, I do not believe dogs are philosophical, whereas I do believe in their fearfulness. So we have to be careful where to draw the line between what's reality and what's analogy.""Dogs, in a way, offer the most obvious proof of the existence of animal personality. They have long been bound to us and bred by us precisely for their very particular physical and temperament traits, and, of course, even among specific breeds there are all kinds of variation in the personalities of individuals. Indeed, animals like dogs and cats point up what often appears to be a paradoxically prodigious ""duh factor"" behind this otherwise cutting-edge science. While scientists may tussle endlessly over the validity of applying the word personality to nonhumans, for people in the everyday world -- especially those who spend any time around animals -- the assertion that they have distinct personalities seems absurdly obvious.Not so very long ago, concepts like animal sentience, emotion and personality were not merely the stuff of anecdotes told by farmers and pet owners; they were wholly embraced by the scientific community as well. In the late 19th century, animal emotion and behavior were integral aspects of the newly emerging science of human psychology. Charles Darwin devoted much of his time after the publication of ""The Origin of Species"" to researching ""The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals,"" published in 1872. Although that era's cross-species conjecturing and comparing was often naïve or intuitive, the impulse behind it went on to inform human psychological study well into the 20th century. Beginning with the appearance in 1908 of more sober, scientifically sound works like John Lubbocks's ""On the Senses, Instincts, and Intelligence of Animals With Special Reference to the Insects"" or Edward L. Thorndike's ""Animal Intelligence,"" animal studies figured prominently in standard human psychology textbooks well into the 1940's. And then, steadily, the animals began to disappear.At one point in his Austin office on the afternoon I met with him, Sam Gosling pulled from his shelves the 1935 edition of ""A Handbook of Social Psychology,"" a standard human psychology textbook of the time, and showed me the table of contents. More than a quarter of the textbook's chapters were devoted to studies of animals and other life forms, titles like ""Population Behavior of Bacteria,"" ""Insect Societies"" or ""The Behavior of Mammalian Herds and Packs."" There is even a chapter devoted to ""Social Origins and Processes Among Plants."" But in the 1954 edition of a similar work called ""The Handbook of Social Psychology,"" there is but one chapter devoted to nonhuman research. Titled ""The Social Significance of Animal Studies,"" it is essentially a desperate last plea to social psychologists not to abandon animal studies, arguing at one point that ""social psychology must be dangerously myopic if it restricts itself to human literature."" The warning clearly went unheeded. The most recent edition of the handbook, from 1998, is devoted entirely to humans.The banishment of our fellow beasts from psychological literature can be blamed by and large on that branch of psychology known as behaviorism. The field's major proponents, eminent psychologists like B.F. Skinner, stressed the inherent inscrutability of mental states and perceptions to anyone but the person experiencing them. And even though the behaviorists were themselves major proponents of the use of animals in behavioral research, they sought to rein in subjective verbal descriptions of the animals' mental states, as well as the sorts of experiments that relied on such necessarily vague data. If the human mind was, as Skinner famously referred to it, ""a black box,"" then surely the minds of animals were even further beyond our ken.""The great and enduring contribution of behaviorism,"" Gosling says, ""is that it introduced the scientific method to the study of behavior. They said, 'Let's get rid of the fuzzy, sentimental higher-level descriptions.' And they did. They went to great efforts to record specific behaviors, things like how many times a chimpanzee scratched its head or nose. But it's hard to study higher-order phenomena, things like personality and emotion, in just those ways. In the end, what you're left with is this long catalog of meaningless descriptions. If I need to know whether I can go into that cage or not to clean it, it's not useful to tell me the chimp scratched its nose 50,000 times in the past year. Just tell me, Is it aggressive or not?""In their dogged pursuit of hard science and their strict avoidance of what Sam Gosling referred to in his first published paper as the ""specter of anthropomorphism,"" the behaviorists, especially in the eyes of many who currently study animal behavior, greatly limited the field of psychology by ultimately outlawing things like intuition, inference and common sense. Now, however, the pendulum has begun to swing back in that direction, and it is a shift that has been impelled, somewhat surprisingly, by hard science.Advances in fields like genetics and molecular and evolutionary biology have lent to the study of psychology something that it really didn't have when behaviorism first came to the fore: a better understanding of the biological and bioevolutionary underpinnings of behavior. No longer is the study of animal behavior rooted in that inherently naïve and anthropocentric desire to see ourselves in animals or to project upon them our thoughts and feelings. Animal personality, along with such integral fields as animal behavior, behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology, all pivot now around what might be called deep analogies. The more detailed and specific our knowledge has become of the animals and of the many differences between them and us, the more clearly we can see what is analogous about our respective behaviors.Animal personality, in other words, is now redirecting psychology's focus in a direction the behaviorists would most appreciate: away from airy abstractions about personality and down to its very tangible and widely dispersed roots. It might be thought of as a kind of biological Buddhism or muscular mythologizing or armed anthropomorphism: a more disciplined and detailed form of that idle speculating we have all done in front of the head tilt of a dog or the sudden skyward shift of a flock of sea gulls or the comings and goings of ants around their respective mounds.""Now, those there I can almost guarantee you are females,"" Jason Watters, a behavioral ecologist at the University of California, Davis, told me one afternoon this past autumn. He was pointing to a cluster of water striders that had climbed up the side wall of one of the collecting pools in the artificial stream that Watters had erected at the far western edge of the Davis campus for a six-month study that he and his lab director, Andy Sih, recently completed on the role of genetic and environmental factors in the expression of behavior in water striders: those spindly black, surface-flitting wraiths whose indent on their tenuous native terrain is never more than four slightly concave, lunar-module-like landing cups.Watters personally reared several thousand water striders for the experiment and would come to know them about as intimately as any human can an insect. He knew each strider's parents and siblings. He photographed and marked each of them with paint-on numbers and then tracked them through more or less every circumstance and experience in their roughly yearlong lives: what and how they ate, their responses to new environments or to simulated predator attacks, their social interactions and mating practices out in the simulated stream.""I haven't gathered all the data yet,"" Watters said, grabbing one of the clustered striders and confirming his suspicion about its sex. ""But what we do know is that these water striders express consistent behavioral types. Like in the presence of a predator some individuals will run and get right out of the water. Others don't seem concerned whatsoever. Just sit there. Others get out and then get back in after a little while. So there's a great deal of variation in what they do. Especially in a mating situation, here in the stream we've found among the males that there is the consistently more aggressive guy -- so that's his type or his personality -- and then there are these very active, hyperaggressive males. They're the ones who are always forcing females to have sex and driving them out of the water and really messing things up for themselves and everybody. We don't know yet if this is really the best way to be or what the point of it is. We're working on that. But I've got to believe there's going to be some circumstances where it's a good idea to be a really mean, brutish type of guy and others where it's not.""A similar array of behaviors is now being encountered in other insects. In her current research at Davis, Judy Stamps, a professor of biology and animal behavior, has been looking into how early experience affects habitat selection in drosophila, better known to you and me as the common fruit fly. Stamps escorted me one afternoon to one of the biology department's ""animal rooms,"" where she and her students have been conducting their experiments. The room was the size of a small walk-in closet, barely large enough to contain the 11-foot-long metal table before us.To a tiny fruit fly, however, the strange, artificial fruit-bowl habitats of upward twisting wire set at either end of the table are separate universes, the various fruit-shaped planets of which, Stamps has discovered, fruit flies approach and settle in a number of ways, some of which depend on early experience and some on their distinct personalities. Fruit flies born and raised on a plum, for example, will seek out the next plum to settle upon, as will the offspring that they raise there: a ""no place like home"" impulse. But in the course of their research, Stamps and her students have also encountered everything from overly shy, timorous fruit flies to bold trailblazers to downright feisty and ultimately self-defeating bullies.""You don't think of drosophila in that way,"" Stamps told me. ""They can be very territorial, and some of the males are fairly aggressive. They tussle with each other. When we did our free-range fly experiments, we marked them individually. We put little colored paint dots on their thorax. The students loved it. They'd say: 'You know Blue? He's been attacking everyone this morning. He's on Banana A, and everyone else is on Banana B. He's the ruler of Banana A.' Of course, the other thing we've noticed is that individuals that behave like Blue get into trouble because, you see, they end up with nobody to mate with.""Another member of Andy Sih's lab, Alison Bell, has done extensive studies of the three-spined stickleback fish, a tiny prehistoric-looking fish with armorlike outer lateral plates and serrated, lancelike spines protruding from the dorsal region. As well as finding the same spectrum of behaviors in sticklebacks -- from extremely bold and bullying sticklebacks to extremely shy and timid ones -- Bell has found groups of sticklebacks that exhibit a similar type of behavior: tribelike populations of bold and aggressive sticklebacks, for example, or of extremely timid ones. Their collective disposition seems to have been shaped by the respective environment in which they were raised -- whether it was predator-free or predator-laden -- and their physical appearance reflects their environment as well: the timid sticklebacks having far heavier armor and longer, more serrated spines.The questions that scientists are now beginning to address are why evolution has wielded such a variety of temperaments in animals and why it hasn't weeded out the clearly deleterious ones: the shyness and timidity that deprives some members of a group of food or mates or the overaggression and extreme risk-taking behavior that can often result in both the disruption of the group's overall reproductive success and the aggressors' becoming some other creature's food.Roland Anderson sees the diversity of temperaments as a manifestation of that most basic biological imperative of survival, an array of personality traits being kept in play in a given species because of the differing, shifting environmental circumstances that groups may encounter. ""What happens,"" he asked, ""if a big school of herring comes along and eats all the aggressive, fearless males in a group of smaller fish? Well, there will still be some of the more passive or shy ones hiding under that rock that can say: 'Hey, they're all gone now. There's a nice-looking female over there. I think I'll reproduce with her.""'Andy Sih, like most of his colleagues at Davis, views personality differences in animals in a Darwinian context. He considers specific behaviors and preferences from an evolutionary perspective and tries to determine how various traits affect the long-term survival of a given species. And in the course of his research on everything from water striders to salamanders, Sih has become fairly obsessed with what he calls ""stupid behaviors,"" ones that don't seem to make any evolutionary sense whatsoever.""You'd expect animals to be doing smart stuff,"" Sih told me one evening over dinner. ""The whole tradition in most of evolutionary ecology has been to emphasize adaptation where organisms do smart things. But I've been making the case for a while that the most interesting behaviors are actually the stupidest.""It's typically the males of a given species that seem to figure most prominently in the stupid-behavior department -- the militant, mayhem-causing water striders and sticklebacks, for example, or fierce male Western bluebirds, who spend so much time defending nests or courting females that they completely neglect their own offspring. But perhaps the most glaring instance of dumb-animal doings is to be found in the female North American fishing spider. Studies have shown that a good number of female fishing spiders are from a very early age highly driven and effective hunters. It is a trait that serves them well most of their lives, particularly in lean times, but it wholly backfires during mating season, when these females can't keep themselves from eating prospective suitors.""Now why would anybody, why would any organism do that?"" asked Sih. ""If you look at these female spiders just in the context of mating behavior, you would conclude that they're doing something mighty stupid here. But their behavioral type is very good for them for much of their life growing up in a highly competitive world where food is often scarce. They're so geared up, though, that when mating season comes around, they really mess up. And experiments have shown that even if they're given a reasonable amount of food, they'll still behave this way.""These same hyped-up females have also been shown to be the most fearless in the face of predators. In simulated attacks, all fishing spiders retreated underwater. The overaggressive, ravenous females, however, were always the first to pop back up, giving them at once the greatest chance of getting available food and, if the predator was still around, of becoming its meal. Of course, a good proportion of female fishing spiders are able to make the distinction between sex and dinner and between finding and becoming dinner. But for Sih and others, the persistence in certain members of a species of these extreme behaviors and the inability of some to modulate that behavior give rise to a more profound question about the nature of personality types in general and how plastic or not they actually are, whether in animals or humans.In animals, it is now becoming evident, there is a certain degree of evolutionary inertia when it comes to their behavior, wherein the very behaviors that accord some members of the group a distinct evolutionary advantage in one set of circumstances can do them in in the next. They are stuck, to some extent, with their distinct ways of being. We humans, on the other hand, tend to think of our personalities as protean, mutable entities that, unlike our physical selves, we can shape to suit shifting circumstances. Sih disagrees. He says he thinks that our behaviors, no matter how complex the human social contexts that help to shape them, are not nearly as pliant as we believe them to be.""Behavioral ecologists actually tend to model animals and humans as both being very flexible, as being capable of changing their behaviors as necessary to do the right things in all situations,"" he said. But in our own day-to-day experience, he said, we recognize that humans don't really behave that way. ""We all know that overly bold person,"" he pointed out. ""We have friends like that. They do things that are just like: Hey, this can get you killed. What are they doing that for? And there are people that are shy, and they're missing out on opportunities they could have had.""There is currently a paucity of human studies along these lines, but a recently published human-personality study of 545 people by Daniel Nettle of the University of Newcastle in England shows a strong parallel with some of these recent animal studies. It found that the more extroverted and outgoing people were, the more sex partners they tended to have, an evolutionary edge that was mitigated by the fact that these were the same people who were most likely to end up in the hospital because of stupid risk-taking behaviors.Indeed, however elaborate an argument we humans may have with our own biology, we are each of us to some extent locked into a personality type, a consistent way of being without which we would each be, in a sense, unrecognizable to ourselves or others. The oft-heard comment ""Hey, that's not like you"" is a tacit acknowledgment of your recognizably consistent way of being. If, in other words, someone were to be entirely flexible and unpredictable in their behavior, were able to respond with any one of the full palette of behavioral responses in any given circumstance, they would be not only, as Andy Sih put it, ""scary to be around,"" but they would also be someone of whom you could say, they have no personality.This set of ideas, Sih told me, suggests new questions that are rarely posed about humans. ""Like why do we even have a personality?"" he asked. ""Why do we have a relatively narrow range of responses as opposed to a full range? Why can't we all be bold when we need to be and cautious and shy when we need to be? Then we'd have no identifiable personality, and that would free us all to become optimal.""For Sih, the answer seems to be that our personality is a manifestation of a complex interplay between genetic inheritance and environment and early-life experience. Bold people, for example, are both naturally disposed to boldness and, further, choose to be bold, becoming ever better at it, building from an early age a mountain of abilities and tendencies that become a personality. It might happen, as well, that an inherently shy person is induced by an early-life experience to venture away from his or her natural disposition and cultivate a bold personality. But whether a person ends up building and climbing a shy or a bold mountain, it may become increasingly difficult to come back down and build another one.""It's not impossible,"" Sih said, ""but it's not going to be easy. I'll give you another human example. It's always mystified me why anyone would be a pessimist. It seems to me like optimism has to be the way to go. But, in fact, there is some recent literature that shows that pessimists are good at being pessimists. And that when things go badly, they expected it anyway, and it doesn't hurt them. And so it's this notion that personality types build because of these feedback loops.""In human beings, of course, as with other highly social species, the shaping of personality entails a complex web of influences and imperatives. It is not merely about the acquisition of food or mates but involves as well issues of group interaction, cooperation, deception and so on. It is a dynamic that, in an ever more complex series of evolutionary feedback loops, at once impelled the formation of larger and more sophisticated brains and the more nuanced emotional responses to social interaction -- feelings of embarrassment, guilt, empathy, confidence, etc. -- that such a brain allows.The attempt to parse that web of entanglements has for decades been a motivation of fields like psychology, psychiatry and sociology. What seems so promising about the field of animal personality is that in the course of allowing us to better understand and more effectively conserve the animals themselves, it is also affording scientists new pathways of understanding ourselves and our behavior, through the kind of experimentation that we are unable to perform on humans.""Do thrill seekers thrive in certain speculative business or military environments?"" Sih asked. ""I don't know. But I can do experiments to look at analogous situations in animals, can take different animals with different personalities and see how they do in different environments -- in a high-predation-risk situation, in a cooperative situation, during a courtship-mating situation. Along similar lines, we can test ideas like, Are animals particularly aggressive when they invade new regions because it is primarily the bold, aggressive individuals that tend to immigrate to new areas? How does the personality of the immigrant pool in humans differ from those who stay behind, and does that difference influence success -- and does this basic view apply to the melting pot of America?""Alison Bell has done related experiments with sticklebacks. It has long been clear to researchers that fish that have lived for many generations in the proximity of dangerous predators are less bold and less aggressive than animals that have lived relatively risk-free. What Bell discovered is that those cautious tendencies outlast the presence of risk, even by a generation. When she moved sticklebacks who had always lived in a high-risk environment into a low-risk environment, she found that not only did they retain their cautious tendencies, but so did their offspring. Even fish raised from birth in a low-risk environment behave more fearfully if raised by a particularly vigilant father from a high-risk background.""There's definitely the effect of genetic difference,"" Bell explained, ""but there's also the effect of what is experienced as they grow up. Genotype and environment interactions make it difficult to detect the effects of genes, because you have to take the environment into account. This is annoying to geneticists."" To scientists like Bell who are studying the interplay of genes and environment, however, it is of profound interest.In the coming year, the sequence of the full stickleback genome will have been assembled, which will open doors into all kinds of cross-species research on the relationship between genes and environment. Alison Bell will be looking at such things as risk-taking behavior in sticklebacks -- which may, by extension, give us insight into the behavior of humans. The same genes and hormone receptor systems associated with such behaviors have been conserved across a broad spectrum of species from sticklebacks to rhesus monkeys to us. John Capitanio has already done a number of experiments with rhesus monkeys that look into how the manner of their rearing affects what Capitanio (in a hedge on the loaded P-word) calls an animal's ""biobehavioral organization"" -- and how, in turn, that biobehavioral organization affects everything from gene expression to immune-system function against ailments like simian AIDS.What once seemed the hopelessly subjective pursuit of understanding human behavior and personality is now increasingly being tied down to and girded by the objective moorings of our own and other animals' biology. The very names of newly emergent fields like biological psychiatry, molecular psychiatry and, of course, animal personality reflect this trend. It is not, as Capitanio points out, a reductionistic concept but more of a holistic one, one that allows for an unprecedentedly subtle reading of the integrative influences -- genetic, experiential and environmental -- that shape each individual's personality.Capitanio is currently writing, with Sam Gosling, the first chapter on animal personality to be included in ""The Handbook of Personality,"" a standard reference book of human-personality psychology. This week, he will be in Palm Springs, Calif., presenting a paper on personality in rhesus monkeys as part of an animal-social psychology symposium led by Gosling at the annual meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, the first symposium of its kind at a human psychology conference. For Gosling, it is the realization of the very thing he envisioned when he first started pursuing the possibility of personality in animals at Berkeley back in the mid-1990's.""What really got me interested when I started exploring this,"" Gosling told me, ""is I noticed that what the animal researchers were doing in practice was exactly what human researchers were saying would be the perfect study they could do in a perfect world. Like you ask a human personality researcher, they might say what we'd do is take a bunch of individuals, and we'd watch them from conception till death and record all the major events in their lives and know who mated with whom and who had a fight with whom. And if we wanted, we could give them frightening stimuli and so on. And a lot of my job is saying to those in human psychology: 'Hey, you should talk to these other guys. What they're doing is really relevant.' I'm like the middleman.""Looking through some of the animal-personality literature in Gosling's office that afternoon, I came upon an intriguing paper titled ""Microscopic Brains,"" published in the March 13, 1964, edition of the journal Science, in the midst of the great animal blackout from psychological literature. Written by a professor of zoology and psychology at the University of Pennsylvania named Vincent Dethier, the paper is at once a study of insect behavior and a remarkably prescient argument for a more intuitive, empathetic and integrative approach to the study of psychology.""The farther removed an animal is from ourselves,"" Dethier writes, ""the less sympathetic we are in ascribing to it those components of behavior that we know in ourselves. There is some fuzzy point of transition in the phylogenetic scale where our empathizing acquires an unsavory aura. Yet there is little justification for this schism. If we subscribe to an idea of a lineal evolution of behavior, there is no reason for failing to search for adumbrations of higher behavior in invertebrates.""Dethier concludes on a decidedly haunting note: ""Perhaps,"" he writes, ""these insects are little machines in a deep sleep, but looking at their rigidly armored bodies, their staring eyes and their mute performances, one cannot help at times wondering if there is anyone inside.""We will never know, of course, one way or the other. And yet somehow, science, of all things, is rendering the empirical answer to such a question incidental to a more felt and intuitive one. Perched now, like entranced children, along the banks of their respective simulated streams, scientists are staring for hours at the least human of creatures -- everything from bullying fruit flies to ravenous, oversexed water striders and fishing spiders to perilously fearless hordes of armored stickleback fish -- and are beginning to see in them not just their distinct patterns of behavior but also something deeply and distinctly recognizable. Something, well, not altogether inhuman.Charles Siebert is a contributing writer and the author most recently of ""A Man After His Own Heart: A True Story.""'"

"'06-01-22,'0','DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Jan. 21 - A succession crisis in Kuwait continued Saturday, as the country's cabinet began proceedings to remove the ailing new emir.The extraordinary move occurred amid growing concern over who should lead the oil-rich city-state after the death of Emir Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah last Sunday.The crown prince, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah , believed to be 76, immediately became emir under the Constitution, and he has insisted that Parliament call a special session to allow him to take the oath of office.But members of the cabinet say his poor health will keep him from governing properly. Recently, he has appeared in public in a wheelchair and has not spoken, raising speculation about whether he would even be able to recite the oath of office. His supporters have suggested that the procedure be done behind closed doors or shortened to prevent embarrassment.The cabinet is moving to transfer power to the prime minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, also thought to be 76. Sheik Sabah, who is the late emir's half brother, is in good health and has run the day-to-day affairs of the government for years. In announcing the move, the Parliament released a statement to Kuna, Kuwait's official news agency, specifically citing the emir's health. ""The Council of Ministers expresses its deepest sorrow and sadness about the health condition of His Highness Emir Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Salem al-Sabah, may God protect him,"" the statement said.Under Kuwait's Constitution, Parliament may declare the emir unfit to govern with a two-thirds majority. An article of the succession law says that if the emir fails to meet the conditions for ruling, or is incapable of carrying them out for health reasons, the cabinet may replace him.'"
"'06-01-22,'0','After reaching the fourth round here last year, Baghdatis failed to win another Grand Slam match in 2005. But he clearly thrives on this surface.On the women's side, top-seeded Lindsay Davenport defeated 14th-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia, 6-2, 6-4, in just under an hour Sunday to reach the quarterfinals.So much for the short version. This quick match, played under a closed roof in Rod Laver Arena while temperatures soared above 100 degrees outside, was not nearly so straightforward.Ahead by 3-0 in the second set and seemingly in command, Davenport lost her serve at love, then called for a trainer on the changeover at 3-2. Her left ankle, which she sprained Friday in the third set of her third-round match, was rewrapped.""It felt O.K.,"" she said later. ""Then yesterday morning when I woke up, it had changed dramatically in the hours after the match.""After her injury timeout, Davenport lost her serve again to make the score 3-3. In the next game, after a glaring forehand error, she began to limp noticeably between points. Kuznetsova held serve, and Davenport called for the trainer again.With Kuznetsova hopping about, understandably full of renewed optimism, Davenport quickly recovered in the next game. She hit a typically deep and convincing forehand winner down the line on the opening point and held serve at love.She broke Kuznetsova with ease in the next game. She then closed out the victory on her second match point, when Kuznetsova dumped a backhand into the net.Davenport looked relieved as she jogged to the net, but she was soon headed for more treatment.""I was like, 'You know, train really hard, try to get everything that I normally injure better, and then I trip,' "" she said. ""It's a little frustrating.""Davenport, who reached the final here last year, is still chasing her first Grand Slam title since winning here in 2000. To make it through the quarterfinals, she will first need medical reassurance (she was to have a magnetic resonance imaging scan later Sunday to determine if she could continue). Then she will need to beat eighth-seeded Justine Henin-Hardenne of Belgium.Henin-Hardenne, who has been in fine form, has beaten Davenport four times in a row. Henin-Hardenne, who won the title here in 2004, advanced with a 6-0, 6-3 victory over unseeded Virginia Ruano Pascual of Spain. Pascual came through the section of the draw that opened wide when Venus Williams lost in the first round to the Bulgarian teenager Tszvetana Pironkova.The tournament has heated up considerably since then, and on Sunday, for the third consecutive day, organizers invoked the extreme-heat policy. All of the singles matches were expected to be played indoors.The conditions helped Davenport, whose flat-hitting power game is ideally suited to indoor play. But the situation has proved more of a headache for those who run the Open.""The heat is much harder to handle than the rain,"" said Paul McNamee, the tournament director.With rain, the retractable roofs are shut on the two stadium courts -- Rod Laver Arena and Vodafone Arena -- so play can continue, but play stops elsewhere.Yet with the sort of heat that has been oven-roasting Melbourne since Friday, it becomes more complicated, according to the Australian Open's rules. Once the temperature hits 95 degrees and the humidity passes a pre-established limit, no matches are put on nonstadium courts.Matches that are under way are required to continue. If matches are under way at Laver or Vodafone when the extreme-heat policy kicks in, the roof is not closed.In theory, this allows the show to go on in some form without endangering the health of the world's top players. In practice, it creates some far-from-ideal situations.One such situation came Friday, when Davenport won a tough three-set match in the third round outdoors against Maria Kirilenko at Laver Arena. The heat policy went into effect shortly after they started the match. Meanwhile, Henin-Hardenne played her third-round match in pleasant conditions under the roof in Vodafone.Davenport ended up injuring her ankle. ""It's no question it was the court, but I've played on it many times before, and it's never happened,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, the other day I was playing when the court was at a ridiculous high temperature. With this surface, the hotter it gets, the stickier it gets.""'"

Mr. Manchin also said he would go to Washington to press the federal government for changes and vowed to ""make sure that every brave miner, every brave worker in this state knows they're in the safest conditions humanly possible.""Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, said: ""Today, West Virginia endured another unthinkable tragedy. We have known tragedy before, but the heartbreak of the last few weeks has had an enormous impact on the lives of all West Virginians."" He continued, ""We are in pain, but we are also angry, and this anger will change the future of mining.""Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a Democrat whose district includes the Alma mine, told reporters, ""The status quo is unacceptable.""""It's unfortunate that every coal mine health and safety law on the books today is written with the blood of coal miners,"" Mr. Rahall said. ""It takes a tragedy, unfortunately, to toughen these laws and to pass them in the first place.""The two missing miners were among a team of 12 who put on breathing gear and tried to escape to the surface, but only 10 made it out, said Doug Conaway, director of the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health Safety and Training. Nine others in another part of the mine also escaped, Mr. Conaway said. The mine is operated by Aracoma Coal, a subsidiary of the Massey Energy Company, based in Richmond, Va.Efforts to put out the fire had been hampered by the size and complexity of the mine, a labyrinth of cross-passageways spreading about six square miles. Rescue workers were not able to contain the fire until Saturday when efforts to find the miners expanded.""The teams kept up their spirits even up to the very last moment,"" said Rocky Adkins, county administrator for Logan County, who was in charge of keeping up morale and supplies for the 16 rescue teams. ""Naturally everyone is saddened by the outcome. We were prayerful and hopeful until the end, but I think a lot of people are in pain now.""Around 3:15 p.m. Saturday, the news that the miners' bodies had been found came from inside the mine to the command center, Mr. Adkins said. The command center was put on lockdown to prevent any information from leaving the site and to allow the governor and mine officials time to go to the church to inform the families personally, Mr. Adkins said. As the wait for news of the miners' fate stretched into a third day, frustration mounted and hope waned. Some residents and officials began asking tough questions.This was not the first such fire, said one Alma miner, who was granted anonymity because he feared reprisals from his employers. ""I work at the belt that caught fire and had to put out a fire at the same exact spot just a couple weeks ago when the sprinkler system didn't work,"" the miner said, referring to a fire he said occurred on Dec. 23. ""I reported the fire to my supervisor, and he ignored it.""Asked several times about the reported fire in December, Mr. Manchin and state and federal officials said they had no knowledge of it.In July 2002, the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration withdrew a proposal that would have required conveyor belts to be made with fire-resistant materials.Since last June, the Alma mine has been cited at least 12 times for violations involving fire equipment, according to government records.Local residents expressed frustration that no representatives from Massey Energy had been present at news briefings. Some pointed out that officials from the Sago Mine had been on the scene after the explosion there trapped 13 miners, killing all but one.""Representatives from the company were present answering hardball questions in the Sago disaster,"" said Chris Stratton of Logan. ""I don't see why Massey doesn't give us the same privilege.""Representative Rahall said he had grown increasingly dismayed by the budget cutbacks and layoffs of federal mine inspectors.""It's an absolute outrage to sacrifice the health and safety of coal miners on the altar of budget-cutting,"" he said.J. Davitt McAteer, a former assistant secretary for the Mine Safety and Health Administration who is Mr. Manchin's adviser on mine safety and the Sago Mine accident investigation, said that in 2001 he wrote a report on behalf of the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training assessing Massey Energy's safety record.""That report raised a lot of questions about Massey's use of contract workers and also whether the safety records it was keeping were accurate,"" Mr. McAteer said. ""When things settle down, these are some of the questions we are going to start asking the company.""Claude Ellis, 79, the mayor of Logan, a town about a mile from the mine, said: ""My kinfolk are all coal miners, and we know how dangerous the work is. But one never gets accustomed to this kind of thing.""CHARLESTON, W.Va., Jan. 21 (AP) -- Federal investigators entered the Sago Mine on Saturday for the first time since the bodies of 12 miners were removed earlier this month.It will probably be a week before they can reach the deepest parts of the mine to investigate what caused the explosion that trapped the men deep underground, said Ben Hatfield, chief executive of International Coal Group, which owns the mine.The mine has been idled since Jan. 4. Because potential dangers remain, a special team has begun the slow process of restarting water pumps and repairing damaged ventilation systems, Mr. Hatfield said.'"

""I didn't do that.""Syracuse repeated the kind of ugly start it had when it lost to Connecticut on Monday, falling behind by 12-0. By halftime, the Orange trailed Villanova, 39-20.Syracuse clawed back with a 17-2 run to start the second half. The highlight of that stretch came when McNamara did a full-body dive into his team's bench for a loose ball. That led to a Demetris Nichols layup.The run cut the Villanova lead to 41-37 and provided a sharp contrast to the first half. But the Wildcats sent the uninspired Orange home with a 14-2 run late in the second half.""I thought we got back on track today,"" Wright said. ""I thought we put it together.""Early in the game, Villanova's man-to-man defense gave Syracuse fits. The Orange turned the ball over on its first five possessions and trailed by 12 points before even taking a shot. Syracuse ended up with 10 turnovers on its first 12 possessions. By then, Villanova had a 20-4 lead.""Our offense is just killing us right now,"" Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim said. ""We started out down 12 the past two games. It's been ourselves on offense; we're just making bad turnovers.""Villanova played inconsistently in its previous two games, a loss at Texas and a lethargic victory at home over Seton Hall. The Wildcats shot 8 for 31 from 3-point range in those two games and struggled against zone defenses.Against Syracuse's trademark 2-3 zone, Villanova penetrated and kicked the ball out with ease, allowing the Wildcats to hit 7 of their first 12 shots from 3-point range.""They gave us a lot of open looks,"" Ray said. ""And when you give good players open looks, it's hard to miss.""Because of heavy pressure by the Villanova guards, Syracuse never had a chance to establish an inside game. McNamara and Devendorf combined for eight turnovers in the first half, many of them on futile attempts to drive and pass. As a team, Syracuse did not attempt a 3-point shot in the first half.Syracuse is still searching for its first victory over a high-caliber opponent. The Orange will have a chance on Monday night at Pittsburgh. The team's best victories so far have been against Notre Dame, Cincinnati and Manhattan. None of those teams are likely to make the N.C.A.A. tournament with at-large berths.Villanova, meanwhile, has settled near the top of the Big East standings and is primed for a high N.C.A.A. tournament seeding.'"

"'06-01-22,'0','Perhaps recognizing the innate limitations of his field, Mr. Drucker wasn't interested in forging ""brilliant"" executives, but in developing ""effective"" ones. Effective management is about picking the right battles and making sure that the troops are aware of the aims. It relies less on genius than on sound, well-practiced technique. Indeed, he wrote on the very first page, ""Effectiveness can be learned.""Mr. Drucker's foremost counsel was to stop wasting time, a problem he saw as endemic. He urged executives to monitor rigorously the hours and minutes they devoted to each task -- and to do so twice a year.Perhaps this dictum was the origin of the comical-seeming vogue, which I remember from my childhood in the 1960's, of efficiency experts traipsing behind the boss, stopwatches in hand.Mechanistic as the concept was, Mr. Drucker had a singular insight. It's not that necessary jobs were done too slowly, but that executives spent much of their time on functions that did not advance their goals. Indeed, the higher an executive climbed, the more their time was claimed by others.Nonetheless, Mr. Drucker aimed his prescriptions far beyond the circle of senior managers or, indeed, managers of any rank. After all, who among us does not waste time? To Mr. Drucker, an executive was any worker -- government official, advertising agent, senior clerk -- whose job required decision-making. He even had a name for this emerging class: the knowledge worker, who produces not tangible products but ""knowledge, ideas, information."" In effect, he had coined the first term for the information age.Mr. Drucker is most famous for asserting that labor should be viewed as an asset, not a cost. He thought that executives should focus more on what they, individually, can contribute and less on what is wrong with their staffs.Like other Druckerisms, this prescription would seem applicable well beyond the realm of management -- to members of a sports team, for example, or partners in a marriage. It is management science tempered by Zen, or at least an appreciation for one's fellow employees. Perhaps today he would be a guest on ""Oprah.""He prized Japanese managers for empowering their workers -- since they couldn't fire them, they had little choice -- but he recognized, even in 1967, that the Japanese model was too rigid. Eventually, it would calcify and rot. He did not quite describe the ideal model for decision makers because it did not yet exist. It is, of course, the knowledge company of today -- Google or Microsoft or, given its extensive use of data on inventory and the like, Wal-Mart.Mr. Drucker, however, was slow to grasp the effectiveness of smaller companies. This is curious, because he diagnosed the bureaucratic failings of large outfits adroitly. So ensnared were they in their own politics that (big-company) managers tended to ignore the outside world, or to see it ""only through thick and distorting lenses."" Office politics would come before customers.But it did not seem to occur to him, at least here, that there was an effective alternative to size. Perhaps that was because he was too much the social scientist, or the ""social ecologist"" as he elsewhere described himself. A Viennese Jew born in 1909 and forced to take refuge in California in World War II, Mr. Drucker nurtured a Teutonic affection for process and systematic thinking.Most business issues, he argued, were generic issues -- repetitions of familiar problems cloaked in the guise of uniqueness. Henry Ford, he argued, misread this by inventing a car, the Model T, that was intended to last forever. But its popularity was fleeting. Mr. Ford had arrived at only a specific solution. By contrast, Mr. Sloan at G.M. built an enduring organization. Mr. Sloan realized, Mr. Drucker maintains, ""that the problem was generic and could only be solved through a rule, a principle.""SIMILARLY, Mr. Drucker, who takes as many examples from government as he does from business, faults President John F. Kennedy's ""pragmatism"" for his various foreign policy blunders. For what is pragmatism but an insistence on meeting each problem as it develops -- that is, a ""refusal to develop rules""?Mr. Drucker believed that the executive who solves ""generic situations"" can handle most events as ""cases under the rule."" In a large organization, it then becomes a simple matter to extrapolate the rule, or to apply it across many situations. If only life were that programmatic.All too often, real life presents special cases for which no existing rule is applicable -- or, even worse, for which a number of contradictory rules seem to apply. Consider the decision of whether to hire consultants. Based on the fate of many ill-advised companies, one might decide to shun them. But that would not take into account the luck of those that hired Peter F. Drucker.'"

"'06-01-23,'1','After admitting their surprise that companies were reporting much higher sales prices for oil and gas to shareholders than to the Interior Department, the Minerals Management service supplied The New York Times with new statistics that seemed to make the gap disappear.In its new analysis, the agency said the published statistics for each year included scores of adjustments that companies had made to reports from earlier years. It then produced a markedly different new chart, saying it had put those adjustments into the proper years.In effect, the changes shifted about 15 percent of gas production from 2004, a year of high prices, to 2001, when prices were much lower. As if waving a wand, the statisticians declared that the government's average ""sales value"" for gas in 2004 and 2005 was actually ""very comparable"" to the sales prices that companies like Chevron had reported to shareholders.But the new statistics were wrong. They showed big swings in annual gas production that contradicted data compiled by the Energy Information Administration.Two days after being asked to clarify the discrepancy, a spokesman for the Minerals Management Service said the new numbers contained a huge error: the statisticians had erroneously shifted 800 billion cubic feet of gas from 2004 to 2001, when they should only have shifted about 8 million cubic feet. The error invalidated all the other new numbers.""It was the leaseholder's mistake,"" said Patrick Etchart, a spokesman for the Mineral Management Service, adding that an energy company had put down ""more zeroes than they should have.""'"
"'06-01-23,'1','Since then, the government has tightened its rules for oil payments. But with natural gas, the Bush administration recently loosened the rules and eased its audits intended to uncover cheating.Industry executives deny any wrongdoing, arguing that the disparities stem primarily from different rules for calculating the sale prices for paying royalties and the sale prices for informing shareholders.""The price of gas downstream is always going to be higher because you have costs that have to be recouped for getting it to the customer,"" said Robert H. Davis, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil. ""You have to process the gas. You have to transport it, and you have to sell it. There will always be a discrepancy there.""Companies that pump oil and gas on federal property are required to pay the government royalties, usually 12 percent to 16 percent of the value of what they sell.Royalties for natural gas have climbed sharply in the last three years. But while prices nearly doubled from 2001 to 2005, the $5.15 billion in gas royalties for 2005 was less than the $5.35 billion in 2001. When oil and gas are combined, royalties were about $8 billion in 2005, almost the same as in 2001.Because much of the information about specific transactions is kept secret, it remains unclear to what extent, if at all, the weakness in royalty payments stems from deliberate cheating or from issues with the rules themselves.But one major producer, Burlington Resources, admitted to shareholders last year that it might have underpaid about $76 million in gas royalties in the 1990's. And in Alabama, a jury ruled in 2003 that Exxon had cheated on $63.6 million worth of royalties from gas wells in state-owned waters. The jury awarded $11.9 billion in punitive damages, which a judge later reduced to $3.5 billion. Exxon disputes the charges and is appealing the verdict.The possible losses to taxpayers in gas could be even higher than the losses tied to the scandals over oil royalties. For one thing, natural gas production on federal land is worth twice as much as oil.Moreover, the Interior Department has scaled back on full audits, pushed out a couple of its more aggressive auditors and been criticized by its own inspector general for the audits that it did pursue.""We are talking about the same issues and in many cases the same players as before,"" said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group that exposed many of the oil royalty scandals.""These companies had knowingly been cheating on oil for years, if not decades,"" Ms. Brian continued. ""To ignore the likelihood that the same thing is happening on the gas side is absurd.""Johnnie M. Burton, director of the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, said the disparities were mostly the result of deductions that the regulations let companies take, reducing the sale prices they report to the government.But Ms. Burton said she had not known and could not explain why companies were reporting higher sale prices to their shareholders and to the Securities and Exchange Commission than to her office.""I can't answer because I don't know,"" she said in an interview. ""We don't look at S.E.C. filings. We don't have enough staff to do all of that. If we were to do that, then we would have to have more staff and more budget. You know, there is such a thing as budget constraint, and it's been real tough, let me tell you."" The contrasts between what companies are telling the government and what they are telling shareholders is stark.The Interior Department, using the numbers given by companies paying royalties, said the average sale price of natural gas on federal leases was $5.62 per thousand cubic feet in fiscal 2005, which ended Sept. 30.By contrast, Exxon told shareholders that it received about $6.88 per thousand cubic feet in the nine months that ended Sept. 30. Chevron said its average price in that period was $6.49. Kerr-McGee, which suffered huge losses from hedging against a drop in prices, nonetheless said it still received an average price of $6.59.""There's no reason why what the companies report to their shareholders should be higher than what they report"" to the Minerals Management Service, said Lee Helfrich, a lawyer who has represented California in many battles with the industry over royalties. ""The ultimate goals or mission of the S.E.C. and the M.M.S. are different, but the information reported to each should be the same.""In the scandals over oil royalties in the 1990's, government investigators, aided by industry whistle-blowers and investigation by the Project on Government Oversight, found that companies were using a host of tricks to understate their sale prices.These included buy-sell agreements in which producers swapped oil with each other at artificially low prices and then resold it at higher prices. Companies also sold oil at below-market prices to their own affiliates, classified high-priced ""sweet"" oil as much cheaper ""sour"" oil and padded their deductions for transportation costs.In the wake of the scandals, the outgoing Clinton administration pushed through tough new rules for valuing crude oil, which relied on comparing company reports with an index of spot market prices.But the Bush administration did not close any loopholes for valuing natural gas. Indeed, in March 2005 it expanded the list of deductions and decided against valuing sales at spot-market prices when companies were selling to their own affiliates.The industry-friendly stance was intentional. Mr. Bush and top White House officials also placed a top priority on promoting domestic energy production. Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force called for giving lucrative new incentives to companies that drill in the Gulf of Mexico and other high-risk areas.The Bush administration also took a much more relaxed approach to auditing and fraud prevention. In 2003, the Interior Department's inspector general declared that the auditing process was ""ineffective"" and ""lacked accountability"" and that many of the auditors were unqualified.In one instance, inspectors discovered that auditors had lost the working papers for an important audit and tried to cover up their blunder by creating and back-dating false documents. Rather than punish anybody, the inspector general recounted, the minerals service gave the employee who produced the new documents a financial bonus for ""creativity.""Administration officials said last week that they had addressed most of the criticisms and that the inspector general had since said its corrective actions were ""sufficient.""The Interior Department also fired two of its most aggressive and successful auditors. One of them was Bobby L. Maxwell, a veteran auditor who had recovered hundreds of millions of dollars in underpayments over a 22-year career and received an award for meritorious service in 2003 from Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton.Mr. Maxwell was fired in early 2005 after clashing with superiors over his belief that Kerr-McGee had shortchanged the government $12 million. Mr. Maxwell charged that he had been wrongfully fired, and the government paid him an undisclosed amount of money to settle out of court.Mr. Maxwell is now pursuing Kerr-McGee, which has denied any guilt, with his own lawsuit under the False Claims Act, which allows private citizens who prove fraud to collect some of the money they help recover.Patrick Etchart, a spokesman for the Minerals Management Service in Denver, said that Mr. Maxwell lost his job because of a reorganization and that he had declined an offer to move to a different city.But lawmakers who wrestled with the government over previous royalty scandals are dubious.""It's all gotten worse, not better,"" said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, who led Congressional investigations into cheating on oil royalties in the 1990's. ""They make the process so complicated that no one can really follow the money.""Perhaps the most striking example of sluggish auditing is the government's effort to collect back royalties from companies that blatantly ignored one of the government's basic rules.Under current rules aimed at promoting energy production in deep waters, companies can produce large volumes of oil and gas without paying royalties at all. But the rules also require companies to start paying royalties if market prices climb above certain ""threshold"" levels.As it happens, market prices have been above those levels since the 2003 fiscal year. But even though dozens of companies never bothered to start paying, Ms. Burton said earlier this month that the government had yet to demand repayment three months into the 2006 fiscal year.""It's more complicated than you might think,"" said Lucy Querques Dennett , associate director of the Minerals Management Service in charge of the issue.But enforcing the rules about price thresholds is easy compared with verifying the actual sale value of natural gas.Over the last four years, the Bush administration has ordered its auditors to move away from detailed inspections in favor of a more cursory approach of looking for anomalies in company reports. If a company in Louisiana, say, reported prices that differed from those of other companies in the same region, it would attract closer scrutiny.Mr. Etchart, the agency's spokesman, said that the number of full-scale audits had declined slightly over the past few years and that the budget for compliance had fallen.But he said the government still took a ""close look"" at 71 percent of oil and gas production. ""Our strategy would obviously be to focus on anomalies,"" he said, ""but it is also to focus on large producing areas.""The agency's strategy has drawn protests, however, from many states, which are entitled to a share of federal royalties, and from some of the Interior Department's most aggressive auditors.One of those auditors was Kevin Gambrell, director of the Federal Indian Minerals Office in Farmington, N.M. Mr. Gambrell fought with his superiors over many issues, one of which was their demand that he do fewer audits and simply monitor posted prices of companies in the same area.""Where the M.M.S. approach falls short is that there are so many different types of deductions you can take in getting gas and oil to the market, and there are so many premiums and bonuses in the contracts,"" Mr. Gambrell said in a recent interview. ""You have to take a detailed look at the contracts to know what's going on.""The Interior Department forced Mr. Gambrell out in 2003, charging that he had improperly destroyed office documents. Mr. Gambrell sued for wrongful termination, arguing that he had discarded only copies of documents. He also presented evidence that his office had recovered eight times as much money as offices that used the administration's preferred approach.The government settled his case in 2004 by clearing him of any wrongdoing and paying him an undisclosed amount of money.For practical purposes, the biggest cost to taxpayers may have less to do with cheating and fraud than with the government's inscrutable rules.Consider the case of Burlington Resources, a Houston-based producer that ConocoPhillips acquired in December for $35.6 billion. Burlington paid $8.5 million in 2001 to settle charges of cheating related to its oil royalties. Last March, Burlington disclosed that it might also have underpaid gas royalties by about $76 million during the 1990's. It set aside $81 million to cover possible litigation costs.Unlike others, Burlington executives provided information to The Times on the royalties it paid for natural gas and on the sale prices that it has reported to the Interior Department since 2002.During those four years, Burlington said it paid $627 million in gas royalties and that its annual payment shot up from $89 million in 2002 to $233 million in 2005.That surge in royalties does track closely with the rise in market prices. But Burlington's numbers also highlight the essential issue raised by many critics: the rules let companies understate the value of their gas sales by taking scores of deductions.Those deductions include the cost of transportation, processing, brokerage fees, pipeline reservation fees and even certain ""theoretical losses"" for companies that own their own pipelines.In 2001, Burlington reported an average price of $1.98 per thousand cubic feet to the government but an average sale price of $3.20 to its shareholders. In 2005, the company reported an average sale price of $5.75 to the government and $6.46 to shareholders.James Bartlett, a spokesman for Burlington, said part of the discrepancy resulted from the fact that much of Burlington's production is in the Rocky Mountains, where natural gas fetches lower prices.The federal government does not require companies to divulge the amount of royalties they pay or what they tell the government about sale prices. And unlike Burlington Resources, Exxon and most other major oil companies refused to disclose the information when asked.""It's not required information,"" said Mr. Davis of Exxon, echoing responses from Chevron, Royal Dutch/Shell and other big producers. ""We're not going to publish it.""'"
"'06-01-23,'1','The final episode of ""The X-Files"" was broadcast almost four years ago, as the F.B.I. agents Mulder and Scully stopped searching for the truth. Now the show's creator is searching for more money.Chris Carter, the creator and executive producer of ""The X-Files,"" which ran from 1993 to 2002, filed a lawsuit Dec. 30 claiming that 20th Century Fox Television, a division of the News Corporation, failed to honor an agreement to share profits from syndication rights to the series. The lawsuit was first reported by The Hollywood Reporter.""The X-Files"" first appeared in syndication on FX Network, a cable affiliate of Fox. In a 2001 agreement, Mr. Carter recommended that Fox terminate its deal with FX and begin a ""second cycle"" contract with other cable networks, hoping for higher competitive bids. According to Mr. Carter's lawsuit, Fox agreed to give him a 25 percent advance of the gross licensing fees over $300,000 per episode from a second contract, in addition to a profit guarantee that he had already negotiated.In April 2002, the USA Cable division of NBC Universal, a General Electric company, and Turner Entertainment Networks, a Time Warner company, received the syndication rights to all nine seasons of ""The X-Files,"" but Mr. Carter says that he did not receive his cable advance percentage or profit guarantee. According to the lawsuit, Fox claimed that the new syndication deal was a reassignment of the first contract rather than the beginning of a second. Both Fox and Mr. Carter's representatives declined to comment on the lawsuit.For the many online fans of ""The X-Files"" who were hoping to see the characters revived in a second feature film, news of the lawsuit was discouraging. It ""looks like the second movie won't happen for a while, if at all,"" wrote one poster on a Livejournal.com community.But ""The X-Files"" has survived messy lawsuits before. In 1999, David Duchovny, the actor who played Agent Fox Mulder, also filed a lawsuit against the studio, claiming that the FX syndication deal cheated him out of potential royalties and accusing Mr. Carter of accepting compensation for keeping quiet about the deal.The lawsuit was settled out of court in 2000 and Mr. Duchovny returned to the set. And in a coincidence that might have been taken from one of the show's plots, Mr. Duchovny's lawyer, Stanton L. Stein, now represents Mr. Carter -- proof that while the truth may be out there, as the show's tagline declared, it never hurts to have a good lawyer.'"
"'06-01-23,'1','WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 - Iran's chief nuclear negotiator said Sunday that if his nation is referred to the United Nations Security Council for its failure to fully cooperate with international nuclear inspectors it would resume full-scale production of nuclear fuel.The statement by Ali Larijani, the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, came in an interview with The Financial Times of London, which published a transcript of the discussion on its Web site. Mr. Larijani spoke in Persian, and the transcript was published after it had been translated into English.Mr. Larijani's comments appeared to be part of a broader effort by Iranian officials to warn the West of possible retaliation if the United States, France, Germany and Britain make good on their threat to have the issue sent to the Security Council. In the past week a succession of Iranian officials have threatened to cut oil exports, move Iranian assets out of European banks that might freeze them, and end what they termed ""voluntary"" compliance with an accord permitting international inspection of any site suspected to be part of nuclear operations.""If we are referred to the Security Council, the government is obliged"" by Iranian law ""to lift all voluntary measures,"" Mr. Larijani said. That would effectively blind the inspectors at a moment when they are seeking additional access to a number of facilities, and explanations about Iran's nuclear activities.Mr. Larijani spoke as both Republicans and Democrats appear internally divided about how to handle Iran's announcement that it is resuming nuclear research. Senator John McCain said on Fox News Sunday that while the United States had to pursue diplomacy, ""we cannot take the military option off the table, but we have to make clear it's the last option.""European and American officials say the initial action they are seeking would be deliberately undramatic, and well short of sanctions. Instead, they are likely to settle first for a statement from the president of the Security Council, which would amount to a warning to Iran to reimpose its freeze on nuclear activities and to resume negotiations with Europe.'"
"'06-01-23,'1','There were many cautionary lessons in what not to do. Years ago, marketers began randomly pitching products to teenagers who appeared to be popular, in the hope that the trendsetters would pass the information to others and create excitement about the product.That practice has become much more sophisticated, said Jamie Tedford, the senior vice president for marketing and media innovation at Arnold Worldwide in Boston, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas.""The search for the cool kids, the kind of cool hunting that we all used to be a part of -- it's just not that cool anymore,"" Mr. Tedford said.Marketers are now reaching out to ""evangelists,"" who are already die-hard fans of a brand, and persuading them to spread the word through their existing social networks.""A lot of our evangelists are evangelists because they simply love the product,"" said Laurie Weisberg, a senior vice president of Informative, a word-of-mouth marketing firm. ""They don't need to be rewarded with discounts or anything like that.""Loosely borrowing from Malcolm Gladwell's best-selling book ""The Tipping Point,"" Ms. Weisberg lectured on the importance of using ""influencers,"" or people who have large social networks and are good communicators, and ""promoters,"" people who talk positively about a brand.Word-of-mouth marketing makes it easier for people to do something they already do: share knowledge about new products so they can feel more important, said George Silverman, the author of ""The Secrets of Word-of-Mouth Marketing.""""People engage in word of mouth because they want to look good,"" Mr. Silverman said. ""Word of mouth is the most honest advertising medium there is. People don't want to hurt their friends and family and colleagues with bad information.""The importance of ethics and full disclosure was also a recurrent theme at the conference, as speakers repeatedly warned attendees not to misrepresent themselves when, for instance, pitching a product on an online message board. In other words, do not try to be stealthy, said Robert Ricci, the director of Web relations for Weber Shandwick, a public relations firm that is part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.""If you're working on a video game, and you go onto a video gamer's blog, let your contacts know that you are an employee of said company,"" Mr. Ricci said while leading a session titled ""How to Work with Bloggers and Communities, the Ethical Way."" ""Always let them know what your intentions are up front.""But replacing traditional advertising with word-of-mouth and viral marketing is an outlandish notion for most companies. A session devoted to integrating word-of-mouth marketing with traditional advertising drew a crowd, but the main lesson seemed to be how to persuade a C-list celebrity to market your product free. (In this case, the agency for Downy, the fabric softener from Procter & Gamble, enlisted Delilah Luke, a radio D.J., to rave about new Downy Wrinkle Releaser on the air.)Some word-of-mouth firms are hired as a small part of a company's complete publicity campaign, which includes traditional print and television advertising. Bob Hutchins, the owner of BuzzPlant, a marketing firm in Franklin, Tenn., was hired to help promote ""The Passion of the Christ"" and ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" to Christian markets.""Marketing to a Christian audience is no different than any other audience -- just that they exercise choice based on a value system,"" Mr. Hutchins said, adding: ""Once the faith-based community can get behind something and they believe in it, they will pass it along. The key to success to both of those movies was going to the gatekeepers.""The gatekeepers, in this case, were volunteers and other ""field agents"" who distributed promotions for the movies at church events, Bible study groups and youth organizations. (He said their compensation was often as minor as free movie passes.)As the conference concluded, some attendees sounded almost awestruck about the possibilities of word-of-mouth marketing. ""When you do word of mouth, you're finding out exactly what your customers are saying,"" said Parrish Johnson, the chief executive of Grapevine Marketing, a marketing and promotions firm in Atlanta. ""That's what's scary.""'"
"'06-01-23,'1','The first big test of the new strategy will be on Friday with the release of Steven Soderbergh's small, cinéma vérité-style film ""Bubble,"" a murder mystery with stars who have not acted before, in Parkersburg, W.Va.Financed by Mark Cuban and Todd Wagner, two former Internet entrepreneurs, ""Bubble"" will open in Mr. Cuban's chain, Landmark Theaters, as well as on his HDNet high-definition network. Even so, the DVD will not be available until the following Tuesday.In many ways, the independent film world is best suited for experimenting with these new distribution strategies, because of the large number of films that are not widely seen, and because the low budgets make them a less risky proposition.IFC's initiative will involve more films and almost certainly more viewers. Because the films will be made available on cable, far more subscribers will have access to the video-on-demand service than now receive the HDNet network. Mr. Sehring said IFC's research showed that DVD sales were not affected by the date of release, and decided to hold off there.The main idea, Mr. Sehring said, was to respond to the pent-up demand for art house-style films that are usually shown only in a few theaters in major cities, and even then only for a week or two.""Foreign films are not being released,"" he said, ""aside from Sony Classics. And low-budget American films -- they're nonexistent. It's left to the really small companies, and they can't afford to take on a lot of films and get them played outside of New York and L.A.""The rise of specialty divisions at major studios like Fox Searchlight and Focus Features has reduced the opportunities for art-house films, he said, because they now specialize in medium-budget, serious films for adults, once the purview of their parent studios.The IFC service will ramp up to making 10 to 15 films available a month, including some from other distributors, at a cost of $6.95 a month for subscribers or $5.95 per film.Mr. Sehring said the films would be released in about 10 theaters initially, including IFC's three screens in New York, and in independent chains like Mr. Cuban's Landmark theaters.How quickly other companies will jump in remains to be seen. Many pointed out that the initiative made sense for IFC's parent, Rainbow Media, which owns the Independent Film Channel, and for Mr. Cuban's company, which owns HDNet. It may make less sense for other film companies without those kinds of pipelines.And some said that those who move toward day-and-date releases are going to have trouble finding theaters.David Dinerstein, an experienced industry executive who recently ran Paramount Classics, said: ""It's absolutely imperative to the film business as we know it to not have windows that are day and date. I think they'll meet with resistance from exhibitors along the way, with the exception of the independent chains.""But the producer Steve Tisch said he considered the shift inevitable, especially since young moviegoers do not distinguish between different distribution modes. ""I think the industry will resist and resist some more, and then slowly embrace it,"" he said.'"

"'06-01-23,'1','Introducing the nudie part of the evening, for example, he said with aplomb: ""You know, the swimsuit competition has become a lightning rod for all kind of comments and controversy throughout the years. As someone who has taken his shirt off in front of 35 million people, I know how challenging that can be.""This was among only a handful of references to ""Desperate Housewives,"" the ABC hit. (CMT is owned by Viacom, which owns CBS.) The big show's name was hardly used. And when, in the small-talk portion of the night, one of the candidates named CBS's ""CSI"" as her favorite television show, Mr. Denton went so far as to say, ""I like it too, actually.""It was very sporting of him -- and of ABC, his employer. He also joked successfully about Ryan Seacrest, the ascendant megahost of Fox's ""American Idol"" and other broadcasts. In white tie, Mr. Denton seemed to think he had nothing to lose, and he kept nervousness about the goofy proceedings to a minimum.The fourth reason to watch is for the swimsuit competition itself. The bodies, though exceptionally slim-waisted and long-legged, were not very sexy; hardened to shells and doused in tanning potions, their armored forms made the women seem completely dressed -- or at least very far from naked. But a certain anxiety entered the swimsuit parade with one camera angle, which showed some of the women from the back. Would they have cellulite? None did, but the unforgiving scrutiny of that one camera added suspense.There is no fifth reason to watch ""Miss America."" The talent competition, which could promise laughs or even pleasure, was exactly mediocre this year, with two forgettable ballet routines (both described as ""en pointe"") and one serviceable ballad. The two other performances -- a goofy tap dance in homely tap-dance shoes and a nice piano recital -- were not quite bad or good enough to be exciting. Worse still, the ball-gown contest, in which each woman promenaded in her finery with a man of her acquaintance, was slow and disingenuous. Everyone selected her sexless, bald or gray father, it turned out, except one who took her goateed brother. None opted for a boyfriend, gay pal or unctuous manager-figure, which would have been more interesting.But four reasons is absolutely enough to keep the pageant on the air, on this channel, and in this format. It would be just too heartbreaking to condemn to extinction the hokey show, which has continued to smile and wave in spite of sanctimony from critics of every stripe. There's still plenty to learn from it. As Eudora Mosby, Miss Arkansas and my favorite contestant this year, said: ""Miss America is me. Miss America -- it's us. We are her.""'"

"'06-01-23,'1','There are still, as always, possibilities for delay, and nobody is rushing to take the plastic slipcovers off the 540 blue chairs in the hearing room. At one point, for example, an infestation of termites in the roof of the National Assembly building caused months of delay in the approval of a trial format.But most of the $56.3 million budget has now been secured and sometime soon the clock is expected to start ticking on a three-stage time frame: a year for investigations, a year for the trial and a year for appeals.The tribunal will target a small pool of senior figures and not seek to indict the many thousands of people involved in carrying out the Khmer Rouge's policies of forced hardships and summary executions.The top leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998. A half dozen of his subordinates are most often mentioned as likely defendants; two of them are in custody and the others are living freely among Khmer Rouge survivors.Although Cambodia's current leadership includes a number of former middle-ranking Khmer Rouge officials, experts say there is no reason to believe that Prime Minister Hun Sen was culpable.""We have investigated that back and forth and up and down, and there's just no evidence that he was involved in any prosecutable crimes during the period of jurisdiction for the tribunal,"" said Mr. Etcheson. ""He looks clean.""Experts say the evidence against the likely defendants is substantial, though mostly indirect.A private organization, the Documentation Center of Cambodia, has compiled a trove of tens of thousands of documents, interviewed hundreds of witnesses and identified thousands of mass graves.The center has set aside rooms in its headquarters for prosecutors and defense lawyers to study its archives and is putting together a rapid-response team to provide any requested materials.""We are ready,"" said the center's director, Youk Chhang.Sean Visoth, the tribunal's Cambodian coordinator, said that at its peak it would employ a staff of 200 Cambodians and 100 foreigners designated by the United Nations.Under the mixed structure of the tribunal, his deputy will be a representative of the United Nations, Michelle Lee, who was due to arrive here in February.Mr. Visoth, who survived the Khmer Rouge years doing hard labor, said the trial has three goals: to offer justice to the victims and survivors, to prevent similar atrocities in the future and to give the younger generation a clear picture of what happened.Interviews and polls in recent years have shown that most people are eager for a trial, although, according to David Chandler, a leading authority on Cambodia history, ""There is no real concept of accountability in Cambodia.""In interviews with rural people, the notion of justice often seems to be equated with revenge, and a proverb is sometimes cited: ""Do not answer hatred with hatred.""In a village near here, a woman making rice cakes by the side of the road, Phoung Vuthy, 53, laughed when she heard those words.""Don't tell me that stuff,"" she said. ""I hate them. I lost my husband and never had a chance to have children. I want to see them punished.""Her sister, Phoung Im, who said she was about 71, said: ""We want to see a trial now. When will the Khmer Rouge be put on trial? I heard there will be a trial. When? When?""But even now, as the process gets under way, it remains controversial among advocates of justice and human rights. The years of wrangling between the United Nations and the Cambodian government has produced an awkward hybrid format that raises questions about the quality of justice on offer.Unlike the United Nations tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, this one will include local judges and prosecutors who, critics say, are ill trained and subject to political manipulation.Under a complicated ""supermajority"" formula, the Cambodian officials will be in the majority but their international counterparts will have veto power over any disputed decisions.A recent wave of convictions of Mr. Hun Sen's political opponents on libel and related charges has highlighted the role of the courts in Cambodia as a political arm of the prime minister.""Clearly the way the judiciary is being used as an instrument against critics now is a real problem,"" said Brad Adams, the Asia director for Human Rights Watch, the New York-based monitoring group. ""It shows the problems for the trials and the problem for the United Nations to be mixed up with these people.""There is no real answer to the question of whether to proceed with a flawed formula, experts say. Only the outcome will show whether the process did more good than harm in its handling of one of the great atrocities of the last century.""Some people want a perfect trial,"" said Youk Chhang of the Documentation Center on a recent visit to the building where the aging Khmer Rouge leaders may be made to answer for their actions.""But this is what we have, and let's make the best of it,"" he said. ""Sometimes you have to be optimistic for a change.""'"
"'06-01-23,'1','When Ms. Carroll arrived in 2003 -- fresh from Arabic lessons and a job at an English-language newspaper in Jordan -- Iraq was wide open. Journalists drove around in their own cars, talking to Iraqis as they emerged in a daze from cramped lives under Saddam Hussein.""You were eating at restaurants,"" said Ashraf Khalil, a reporter for The Los Angeles Times who was working in Iraq as a freelancer at the time and knows Ms. Carroll. ""You were hailing cabs at night. You were speaking English on the street.""Freelancing was not easy. Mr. Khalil described how Ms. Carroll and he discovered a $5 special of Middle Eastern salad and a hard boiled egg with beef at a nearby hotel. Her hotel, the Musafir, was one of the cheapest frequented by Western reporters: two-room suites were shared for $30 per person per night.But Ms. Carroll, who graduated from the University of Massachusetts in 1999 with a bachelor's degree in journalism, was glad for the chance to work on such a big story.She described the motivation in an article for The American Journalism Review published last year. ""The cubicle walls are closing in,"" she wrote. ""You'd rather jump off a cliff than cover one more zoning board meeting and just when one of the biggest stories in years is developing in Iraq, those foreign correspondent aspirations seem ever further out of reach.""""There's only one way out,"" Ms. Carroll wrote. ""Pull up stakes, clean out that savings account and get on a plane to Baghdad.""As a woman, Ms. Carroll had a special advantage. She could dress in the Islamic head covering, a hijab, and the long black cloak, the abaya, and move around Baghdad's streets relatively unnoticed. Women who were reporters often saw themselves as less vulnerable to kidnappings than their male colleagues, partly because of the disguise afforded by Iraqi dress.""We can put on our scarves and abayas,"" said Jackie Spinner, a reporter for The Washington Post. ""She felt that it was an extra security blanket. I definitely felt that way.""Ms. Carroll got to know the story well. She went into Iraqi homes. She shopped for clothes in Baghdad. She used her Arabic and went by the name Zaineb.As the months passed, Baghdad became increasingly dangerous, and news organizations began to require reporters to travel with two cars -- a passenger car and a backup or ""chase"" car -- and armed guards. In September 2004, two American engineers and a Briton were kidnapped and beheaded. A month later, a British-Iraqi aid official and longtime Baghdad resident, Margaret Hassan, was kidnapped and later killed.But Ms. Carroll, who had begun to write regularly for The Christian Science Monitor, continued to work with her small team. She wrote in her Journalism Review article that it seemed safer that way.It is still unclear precisely what happened on Jan. 7. At least one witness said the kidnappers mistakenly drove down a dead-end street, suggesting that the seizure was not well planned and that another car could have helped stop them.In Iraq, danger presents itself on a daily basis, and the taking of Ms. Carroll, who was described by her colleagues as cautious, probably had as much to do with circumstance as anything else.The Monitor was one of the few American news organizations with a bureau in Baghdad that did not use a Western security adviser. The paper's Washington bureau chief, David Cook, said by telephone on Sunday that the paper left decisions of whether to use guards or a chase car up to the reporters, and that Ms. Carroll, as a freelance reporter, had the same access to these things as did staff employees.Still, Ms. Carroll talked to the paper's foreign editor about security issues on more than one occasion, Mr. Cook said. She is covered under a life insurance policy paid for by the paper while she is on assignment, he said.Freelance writers who have worked in Baghdad expressed concerns about returning solo. Kimberly Johnson, who worked here this summer, said she had been told by one large American news organization that it could not accept her articles because it could not pay for adequate security. David Enders, a freelance writer based in New York, said an assignment with an American magazine had fallen through, apparently because of security concerns.""You can go days and weeks and there's no significant event,"" Ms. Spinner said. ""Then something happens and you are reminded again that you are in the most dangerous place the press has ever known.""'"
"'06-01-23,'1','In her first legislative proposal since taking the helm of the City Council, Speaker Christine C. Quinn said yesterday that she wanted to require hospitals in New York to notify patients of financial assistance available to them.The proposal was motivated by the death of a Long Island man, Manny Lanza, last year; his parents say a lack of insurance delayed the scheduling of a lifesaving operation at a private hospital in the city. The bill would also require hospitals to report data on charitable care they provide and on the number of patients who receive it.For Ms. Quinn, who earned a reputation for aggressiveness as chairwoman of the Health Committee before becoming speaker earlier this month, the bill signaled her intention to continue pressing health issues, particularly for the poor and the uninsured.""It is really significant that the City Council has decided to put health care as the first thing on the agenda for 2006,"" said Ana Maria Archila, executive director of the Latin American Integration Center, an immigrant advocacy group.Ms. Quinn said that there were numerous forms of government aid available to eligible patients, but that hospitals had done a poor job making people aware of them. She said her bill would begin to address that, but acknowledged there was little the city could do to force hospitals to actually treat uninsured patients.""We unfortunately don't have that sole power,"" she said at a City Hall news conference yesterday morning. ""So in addition to this bill, we will work very hard with our colleagues in Albany to take further legislative steps to make that closer to the true right it should be in New York State.""'"

About 200 firefighters worked for three hours to extinguish the flames. Six firefighters received minor injuries.Most of the building's interior will need to be replaced, Deputy Assistant Fire Chief Ronald R. Spadafora said, but its brick facade escaped virtually unscathed. The fire's cause has not yet been determined, he said.The building was built in 1882 by the Astor family.Besides Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, tenants include the magazines Antiques; Art in America; and Interview; and American Eagle Outfitters, which lost most of its inventory to flames, water and smoke.""It's all ruined,"" said Frank Leimeister, a manager at Servpro Industries Inc., hired to clean the American Eagle store on the ground level.

""I'm also concerned and worried because the persecution is still going on and there are so many practitioners who have been physically and mentally tortured.""The Chinese government first detained Mr. Lee on Jan. 22, 2003, and he was later held near the coastal city of Yangzhou. The authorities put Mr. Lee on trial based on accusations that he tried to sabotage the government by disrupting broadcasts with videotapes showing government persecution of Falun Gong.The group drew international attention in 1999, when 10,000 followers peacefully protested in Beijing.In prison, Mr. Lee said, he was beaten, deprived of sleep and food, and handcuffed in painful positions. He said the government tried to ""force brainwash"" prisoners and subjected him to ""slave labor.""'"
"'06-01-24,'1','Kuwait has long been governed by a gentlemen's agreement in which rule switches back and forth between the Salem and Jaber branches of the Sabah family. Sheik Sabah presumably would have been crown prince under Emir Saad. But the political crisis had put even that tradition in question, as others vied for the post.""Everyone knows that that there's an old rivalry between Sheik Sabah and Sheik Saad; what you see is an outgrowth of that,"" said Muhammad al-Jasem, who recently stepped down as editor of the daily Al Watan and of Newsweek Arabic, the Arabic- language version of the newsmagazine.The current standoff, Mr. Jasem said, was essentially a case of old familial rivalries gone public. ""There is a total breakdown of trust between either side,"" he said.Deposing the emir would have required a two-thirds majority in the 50-member Parliament, which was far from guaranteed. The emir's backers, meanwhile, sought to encourage him to read the oath of office to stem the debate over his fitness for office and gain full powers.Over the weekend, the fight spilled into the streets of Kuwait City, with supporters of each sheik putting up posters and mysterious rumors circulating that foreign dignitaries were secretly landing in Kuwait to help end the standoff. There were reports of a video recording of Sheik Saad speaking, apparently to prove he was lucid.The standoff had begun to take a toll on the country. Concerns grew over security and stability, with the Kuwaiti stock market plummeting Saturday after Sheik Sabah's threat to depose the emir. Meanwhile, the succession crisis threatened to delay a parliamentary decision to allow international oil companies back into Kuwait to help develop its northern oilfields.Many Kuwaitis saw the crisis and its conclusion as a victory for Kuwait's Constitution and the rule of law. Despite the heated battle, they said, life went on as normal in the city-state, and its basic stability was never in question.""You have to be impressed that in a developing-world nation, built on tribalism and run by one family, you can go through something like this while life goes on outside, without security men or tanks on the street,"" Mr. Jasem said. ""Maybe in the gulf we look bad,"" he added, speaking of the unusually public nature of the battle, ""but to the world we should look good.""'"
"'06-01-24,'1','In his affidavit, Mr. Langone argued just the contrary. ""To date,"" it said, ""discovery has demonstrated that, far from misleading anyone about CAP (or anything else for that matter), I and others repeatedly disclosed Grasso's CAP to the board.""A spokesman for Mr. Spitzer's office said the attorney general expected to prevail in the case but declined to discuss details.Mr. Spitzer's suit against Mr. Langone involves only payments under the capital accumulation plan. Those payments, totaling just over $18 million from 1999 to 2002, are relatively small in relation to the $80 million that Mr. Grasso collected from a very aggressive benefit arrangement that was the core of his outsize pay package.In his defense, Mr. Langone cited statements taken in depositions from David H. Komansky, former chief executive of Merrill Lynch; Mel Karmazin, then president of Viacom; and Gerald M. Levin, former chief executive of Time Warner.In the statements, the executives said they had been briefed by Mr. Langone that Mr. Grasso would receive an additional 50 percent of his compensation in capital accumulation plan payments.Mr. Karmazin has been outspoken in his support for Mr. Grasso and cast a minority vote in favor of Mr. Grasso's staying on at the stock exchange when the board decided in 2003 that he should step down. Mr. Komansky and Mr. Levin, former members of the compensation committee, had left the board by then.Of more than 20 directors who at one time or another voted on Mr. Grasso's pay, Mr. Karmazin, Mr. Levin and Mr. Komansky were the only three cited by Mr. Langone as having been briefed about the capital accumulation plan payments.Mr. Spitzer argued in his suit that Mr. Langone did not make clear to directors that those payments were an additional 50 percent of his variable compensation, as opposed to being included in his regular pay.A majority of the directors and executives involved in the suit have now been questioned in depositions. But Mr. Grasso, Mr. Langone and John S. Reed, the stock exchange's interim chief executive, have not yet been questioned. Mr. Grasso's interview is scheduled early in March; Mr. Langone's on March 20. A trial in the case is expected to start later this year.'"

"'06-01-24,'1','The flow from Azerbaijan was switched on Sunday night. By nightfall on Monday, officials expected the pipeline to carry two-thirds of daily requirement of 4.5 million cubic meters for Georgia, said the deputy energy minister, Aleko Khetaguri.Mr. Khetaguri said, ""Hour by hour, the pressure is increasing.""The repaired pipeline, he added, was a remnant of a Soviet network that carried natural gas from Iran through Azerbaijan to Georgia before the 1980's.Officials appeared visibly pleased and said that whatever the cause of the sabotage, the disruption had been minimized by using the restored pipeline.""If this had happened one year ago, the whole system would have collapsed,"" President Mikheil Saakashvili said in an interview.The cut in Russian gas lines also severed the flow to Armenia, downstream from Georgia in the network. Armenia, however, had fuel reserves and reported fewer problems.There was no new insight into what caused the four explosions that toppled two power trellises and destroyed two pipelines in southern Russia.Islamic groups operate in the area, often in collaboration with Chechen separatist fighters and terrorists. Armed irregular formations also operate in Georgia, in the separatist enclave of South Ossetia.None claimed responsibility for the sabotage, which occurred in wintry mountainous terrain and at widely separated locations, suggesting technical sophistication and an awareness of the workings of the energy system.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered the Federal Security Service, the domestic successor to the K.G.B., to increase security at energy complexes in the region and instructed the chief of the country's police to help the investigation, Russian news agencies reported.Russian officials, who have suggested that militants might have been involved in the sabotage, offered no further suggestion about whom they believed was responsible.""It would be incorrect to jump to any conclusions before the end of the investigation,"" Mr. Putin's envoy to the region, Dmitri Kozak, said, according to Interfax.Mr. Saakashvili, who said Sunday that he suspected that Russia had orchestrated the blasts to put political and economic pressure on Georgia, repeated his remarks on Monday.""The whole circumstances look very dubious to us,"" he said, adding that, by his reading of the map, the areas of the explosions are under the control of Russian border guards and are not used by any one insurgent group. He presented no clear evidence, however, of Russian involvement.Mr. Saakashvili's government also called on Russia to turn over to Georgia two men who it says are members of Russian intelligence services and accuses of organizing sabotage against Georgian power lines in 2004. Russia has refused to hand over the men and seems unlikely to change its position.Demonstrators gathered outside the Russian Embassy here, carrying anti-Russian placards and an image of Mr. Putin that read ""Gasputin,"" a play on Rasputin.Although Georgia has broken from Moscow's sphere and pursued a distinctly pro-Western course, some residents expressed dismay at the latest sour turn in relations.In the Samgori district at the edge of Tbilisi, Ivetta Bakradze, a schoolteacher, sealed off most of her three-room apartment and limited herself to her kitchen. There Ms. Bakradze huddled in the chill, bundled beneath sweaters and a scarf, hoping to preserve the small bit of heat emitted by a single propane burner.She was less interested in the political exchanges, she said, than in having her utilities restored.Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, blackouts and heating shortages had been almost synonymous with Georgia. But this year, the problems had been almost forgotten, Ms. Bakradze said, as widespread repairs and upgrades had made gas and electric service reliable.The sudden loss of heat was an unwelcome reminder. ""We have been seeing Georgia getting revived,"" she said. ""Streets are lighted. The city looks different.""She pointed at the dim, cold room and said, ""Now, it's catastrophic.""'"
"'06-01-24,'1','People involved in the trade say activity will pick up again if fighting breaks out between Palestinian factions or if there are renewed conflicts with Israel, as everyone here expects.Yuval Steinitz, chairman of the Israeli Parliament's foreign affairs and defense committee, said 12,000 guns, several hundred antitank-rocket launchers, thousands of antitank rockets, tons of explosives and possibly even some shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles have entered the Gaza Strip over the last year, primarily through the tunnels.""We're not talking about weapons for terrorism but about weapons for an army,"" he said by telephone from Jerusalem.""Some of the tunnels were financed by the Palestinian Authority itself, and some of the weapons smuggled through them were bought by the P.A., although most of them went to Hamas, Islamic Jihad or other terrorist organizations,"" Mr. Steinitz added.He complained that Egypt, too, bore responsibility. ""The smuggling doesn't begin in the tunnels,"" he said. ""Egypt is doing to Israel exactly what Syria is doing to the Americans in Iraq, putting troops on the border and then succeeding not to succeed.""He said that Israel asked both Egypt and Jordan to stop weapons smuggling into the Palestinian areas five years ago and that Jordan, with a longer border and larger domestic Palestinian population, had managed to do so. ""But Egypt did almost nothing, and today 90 percent of the Palestinians' weapons and arms are coming from Egypt,"" Mr. Steinitz said.Since the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement last year promising to police the border more vigilantly if Israel stopped destroying houses, the Palestinian's Preventative Security Service has filled more than 10 tunnels with concrete. But people involved with the tunnels said the Palestinian Authority's ability to close all of the tunnels was limited because of the militia's greater firepower.The first smuggling tunnel was dug in 1982 after the border fence left extended families split between the Gaza Strip and Egypt when the border was re-established upon Israel's withdrawal from Sinai. The tunnels were used primarily to smuggle cigarettes, hashish, gold and car parts in those days, residents say.But after the first intifada broke out in late 1987, the tunnels were also used to smuggle weapons and people who were wanted by the Israelis.The first tunnels were about 200 feet long, dug from house to house under the twin border fences and the ""Philadelphi"" patrol road that ran between them. In those days, the houses were close enough to the fences that the families could shout to one another across the Israeli-patrolled no man's land.But after Israel began destroying houses from which the tunnels started on the Palestinian side and Egypt, too, began cracking down, the narrow tunnels grew longer and longer, some eventually reaching three-quarters of a mile.The activity increased during the second intifada of 2000 when the incentive for taking such risks was high: a Kalashnikov that cost $500 in Egypt fetched as much as $2,500 in the Gaza Strip at the time. Each shipment included hundreds of guns.People with no smuggling experience joined in and charged smugglers a fee for using the tunnels. One Rafah resident involved in the tunneling estimated that as many as 30 main tunnels snaked beneath the border. Others put the number even higher. As Israel destroyed the tunnel entrances, other people burrowed new channels to what remained of the existing tunnels from houses farther away.In the beginning, the tunnels started from both sides, each team heading at an angle -- northeast from Egypt, for example, southwest from Gaza -- digging in the soft sand just beneath the region's sedimentary layer of hard clay that formed the tunnels' natural ceiling. eventually, the two channels crossed.Since Egypt began cracking down, though, the tunnels have been dug from the Palestinian side, heading several hundred yards into Egyptian territory before surfacing in a pasture or olive grove. The tunnelers send up a pipe for their accomplices in Egypt to locate and break open the tunnel's ""eye"" from below with a car jack at night when the shipment is ready.The tunnels are used only a handful of times before they are abandoned because of the quickly increasing risk of getting caught once it is opened on the Egyptian side.Israel tried to foil the tunneling by installing an 25-foot concrete or iron wall along the border that extends 10 feet underground. But the tunnels are typically 20 to 65 feet deep. It also used sonar and other sensors to hunt for the tunnels, occasionally setting off charges in the ground to cause undiscovered tunnels to collapse.Now, with the Israelis gone, evidence of those tunnels is not hard to find among the bullet-hole peppered houses facing the border and in the collapsed concrete and rebar remains of the destroyed homes. Another member of Mr. Qishta's clan -- the largest of those living here along the border -- recently led a visitor through the wreckage, pointing out rubble-filled tunnel openings.Mr. Qishta said he had been earning less than $10 a day working on construction sites for his father when a friend recruited him to help dig a tunnel in June 2003.""He told me that I was going to disappear, that I couldn't even tell my father,"" recalled Mr. Qishta, a tall, muscular man with a short, sandy-colored beard. Tunnel workers often remain in hiding for the months it takes to finish because neighbors who discover the digging may demand a share of the profits to keep quiet.His cousin said there were many telltale signs that tip people off, including the smell of clay, traces of sand indoors or dirt under fingernails.It is a claustrophobic, dangerous business, with the tunnels only large enough for a slight man to squat in. About 250 yards into the project, Mr. Qishta said, he was almost buried alive in a partial collapse while drilling upward. A colleague dug him out.Many others have not been so lucky. In 2001, two brothers, Suleiman and Muhammad el-Sharr, hit a 50-inch water pipe while drilling toward the surface.The rush of water collapsed the tunnel, burying them in mud. Their mother, with a dirty apron over her robe and a white knit shawl over her head, said that it took three days to get the bodies out.That tunnel ran hundreds of yards into Egypt and was particularly deep, 50 feet in some places. Members of the family say it was intended to move tons of arms into the Gaza Strip, including Katyusha rockets, mines, mortars, grenades and assault rifles. The weapons were later seized in the Red Sea aboard a ship named the Karine A before they could reach Egypt.The seizure of the Karine A was a turning point in the West's post-Oslo disenchantment with the Palestinian Authority under Yasir Arafat, which was clearly implicated in the shipment. The captain of the ship was an employee of the Palestinian Authority's transport ministry, and the man behind the tunnel is now a captain in the Palestinian security forces.Mr. Qishta said his team had continued well beyond the border before digging upward in Egypt. In May 2004, they finally opened the ""eye"" and brought four shipments into the Gaza Strip, totaling 900 Kalashnikovs, 400 handguns and 200,000 rounds of ammunition.The guns, tied into bundles and packed in empty flour sacks, were pulled through the tunnel with the same cables and electrical motors that the tunnelers had used to remove the sand while they were digging. Each shipment took about an hour to move through the tunnel.""Everyone got $23,000 and a Kalashnikov,"" Mr. Qishta said, adding that the tunnel's initial investor made $150,000.

"'06-01-24,'1','WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 - It takes longer to get to work without the subways, no one disputes that. But just more than a month after a 60-hour transit strike crippled New York City, other lessons are becoming clear, according to data collected by city officials while the subways and buses were shut down.Among the findings: The number of pedestrians entering Manhattan skyrocketed during the walkout; bicycles and ferries were not used as much as officials had expected; and vehicle restrictions -- including a cordon that blocked cars with fewer than four occupants from entering Manhattan south of 96th Street for six hours each morning -- may have been harsher than necessary.While the transit strike of Dec. 20-22 was a nuisance for riders and a hardship for businesses, it also presented an opportunity to gauge how the habits of New Yorkers have changed since the last such walkout, in 1980. The new data suggest that New Yorkers are more inclined to walk than they were 25 years ago.""It's not uncommon for New Yorkers to walk a mile a day,"" said Iris Weinshall, the commissioner of the city's Department of Transportation, who intends to release the research here on Tuesday, during the annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board, which is part of the National Research Council.Ms. Weinshall said she considered the city's response to the strike a success, but noted, ""In attempting to minimize congestion, perhaps we were more cautious than we should have been.""'"
"'06-01-24,'1','OUR rat terrier, Winchell, used to travel with us everywhere we went -- on family vacations, business trips, even on tour with Van Halen. When we moved to Maui, we didn't think twice about taking him along. The problem was the six-month quarantine for animals entering Hawaii. We couldn't imagine being separated from him for that long, so we devised a plan to smuggle him into the islands.My wife, Kari, consulted with several veterinarians to determine how to tranquilize Winchell. We needed to give him just enough doggie-downers to sedate him for the five-hour flight without killing him. After feeding Winchell the pills, we slipped him into a little carrier and he fell fast asleep. Then we boarded our flight.Halfway through the flight, we also took a nap. I woke up to the sound of Bill Cosby saying, ""What a cute little dog.""It wasn't the inflight entertainment system. Bill Cosby was on the plane -- and Winchell wasn't in his carrier. The dog had woken up, clawed his way out of the carrier, staggered down the aisle, and made Mr. Cosby's acquaintance.I looked around to see if anyone else had met Winchell. The flight attendants were nowhere to be seen, so I scooped him up and returned him to his carrier. For the next few hours, Winchell didn't make a sound -- he was still dazed -- and we hoped no one would say anything about our illegal dog. I was stressed out. I imagined being met by authorities at the airport and paying a huge fine or even being sent to jail for breaking quarantine laws.Just after landing, we learned our fate. A flight attendant made an announcement: ""Whoever let the dog on board, please ring your call button."" We knew Winchell had been busted.Fortunately, Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead happened to be on the plane with his wife, Carol, who is a lawyer. The couple stayed with us and offered to help. Eventually, a flight attendant took pity on us and made arrangements to ship Winchell back to the mainland, where friends picked him up at the airport.'"
"'06-01-24,'1','In upholding the electioneering-communication provision ""against a facial challenge in the 2003 decision,"" the justices said, ""we did not purport to resolve future as-applied challenges.""The disposition of the case bought the justices, who are closely divided on campaign finance issues, some time during a period of transition, and might have represented a strategic choice that appealed to both sides. The same might be said of the court's unanimous opinion last week in an abortion case from New Hampshire.Many people who heard the argument in the campaign case last week came away with the impression that given the imminent departure of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who might not have been able to cast a final vote, the decision could well have been a 4-to-4 deadlock.Election law specialists said the likely impact of the decision, Wisconsin Right to Life Inc. v. the Federal Election Commission, No. 04-1581, would be to reopen the issue of how to administer the law. It invites new litigation, they said, over whether specific advertisements fall under the law's definition of those that may not be broadcast within 60 days of a federal general election with money from a corporation's treasury.Under the definition, an ""electioneering communication"" need not use words like ""vote for"" or ""vote against."" Rather, the law covers advertisements that refer to a clearly identified candidate for a federal office and are ""targeted to the relevant electorate."" Corporations must pay for such advertisements with money raised through a political action committee, which is subject to strict limits and reporting requirements.In its lawsuit, Wisconsin Right to Life described itself as a grass-roots lobbying organization and said the advertisement it wanted to broadcast was part of a constitutionally protected lobbying effort.The advertisement urged Wisconsin residents to call their senators, Herb Kohl and Russell D. Feingold, both Democrats, and encourage them not to filibuster President Bush's judicial nominees. Mr. Feingold was seeking re-election at the time. Wisconsin Right to Life has a political action committee, but it had only $13,000 in its account at the time, and the group sought to use money from its general treasury.Edward B. Foley, an election law specialist at Ohio State University, said in an interview that while the court's action on Monday appeared narrow and procedural, it was actually neither in its practical impact.The Supreme Court was telling the district court to define both the scope of a constitutionally required exemption from the law and the standard for winning such an exemption, Professor Foley said. If the standard proves ""unworkable and messy,"" he said, that might give the law's opponents on the court a basis for re-examining the 2003 precedent itself.Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said the decision on Monday created new uncertainty about the court's campaign finance jurisprudence. ""It puts the Federal Election Commission and the courts back in the business of evaluating the subjective intent of each ad,"" he said, adding that the law's sponsors had hoped to avoid that possibility by writing a broad but clear definition.James Bopp Jr., who argued the case for the anti-abortion group, said the lower court ""must now confront the real merits of this case, namely, that there is no constitutional justification for prohibiting grass-roots lobbying about upcoming votes in Congress just because we are in an election season.""'"
"'06-01-24,'1','But according to several former executives and industry analysts, the reasons for Mr. Perez's abrupt resignation -- which Mr. Knight effectively ordered -- say as much about the inability of Mr. Knight to adapt to his role as chairman as it does about Mr. Perez's ability to fit in.""It is more about Phil Knight's ego than Perez's performance,"" said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, an associate dean at the Yale School of Management who had spoken to Mr. Perez about once a month over the last year. ""It is a question about identity. Some people won't relinquish until they die.""For his yearlong tenure, Mr. Perez will receive a compensation package worth more than $14 million, with Nike reimbursing him $150,000 for club memberships and spending $3.6 million to buy his house in Oregon and pay for remodeling.Mr. Perez quarreled with senior executives over several issues, but at the heart of the disputes, according to several people briefed on the matter, was his failure to adapt quickly to a culture that prizes product innovation and the sanctity of the Nike brand.Mr. Perez, for example, believed that the Nike brand had largely saturated the high-end market -- Nike controls 90 percent of the market for sneakers priced over $100 -- and should grow by introducing more exclusive lines to lower-end retailers.So he lowered the minimum purchase requirement for chains like Famous Footwear and Shoe Carnival to 10,000 from 25,000. But some Nike executives believed the move ""cheapened the brand,"" said John Shanley, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group who tracks the company closely.At the same time, Mr. Perez upset both of Nike's co-presidents, Mr. Parker and a fellow veteran of more than 25 years, Charlie Denson, by seeking a review of the company's operations, particularly its European businesses, which have lagged behind those in the United States.""Anything he was asking, anything he was looking at was upsetting the two co-presidents,"" Mr. Sonnenfeld said. ""Basically, anything he did was not the way it was done.""Mr. Perez, the former head of S. C. Johnson & Son, the consumer products company behind Ziploc bags and Windex glass cleaner, was credited with trimming expenses at Nike while cultivating its brand in China, where Nike made products but had not sold them.His short-lived tenure sheds some light on the cult of personality around Mr. Knight, who has become as much an icon of Nike as the swoosh that appears on its shoes. He stepped down as chief executive in 2004, but executives said he remained a dominant figure behind the scenes.As a result, outside executives have been kept on a short leash -- and, when they challenge the Nike orthodoxy, find themselves sidelined or forced to leave.Ellen Turner, recruited by Mr. Knight in 1999 from Kinko's to become Nike's chief marketing officer, lasted six months. George Porter, persuaded to leave his job as president of Levi Strauss in 1997 to run Nike's American operations, only made it 11 months.""It is a very insider culture,"" said one former Nike executive, who left the company within the last five years and spoke on condition of anonymity, citing a new employer's rules prohibiting media interviews. ""If you don't win them over quickly, you're in trouble.""Mr. Parker, who succeeds Mr. Perez, is a consummate insider. He joined Nike in 1979 and has crisscrossed the company, holding management positions in design, product development and marketing.Mr. Knight, who acknowledged that he sought the resignation of Mr. Perez, said that Mr. Perez's trouble fitting in at Nike ""led to confusion.""""We were operating at 80 percent, and I did not see that getting any better.""'"

It then announced a hostile takeover bid of $37 a share on Jan. 4, an offer that the Engelhard board is urging shareholders to reject.The chief executive of Engelhard, Barry W. Perry, termed the BASF bid ""opportunistic and inappropriate"" and said Engelhard was exploring ways to maximize shareholder value.""We see a bright future from new sources of growth at Engelhard that clearly make this price inadequate,"" Mr. Perry said. ""I'm not putting a price tag on the company, but we have a sense of value and we are talking to multiple people who have expressed interest in maximizing that value.

Mr. Cardinale asked.Ms. Farber apologized for her driving history but offered no specifics. ""I know very well I have had some personal difficulties with driving,"" Ms. Farber said.Then, drawing applause from her supporters, she added, ""And I thank the governor for giving me a job with a driver.""When Mr. Cardinale noted that Ms. Farber had been issued speeding tickets 13 times, she responded: ""I let the record speak for itself. I'm sure you have it.""At one point, she said her driving trouble ""probably requires psychoanalysis"" but did not reflect what she described as an otherwise law-abiding life. ""It is an embarrassing topic for me,"" she said.Mr. Cardinale asked Ms. Farber about the bench warrants; state records show warrants were issued against her in 1996 and again three years ago.Mr. Cardinale, one of two Republicans to oppose Ms. Farber's nomination, said that he was concerned about the state appointing someone who had been repeatedly accused of breaking traffic laws as its top law enforcement official.""Your record taken in its totality does not support the notion that you have respect for the law,"" he said. Later, he said that approving Ms. Farber's nomination might send a message ""to young people, to the whole population of the state of New Jersey, that it's O.K. to offend the law repeatedly time after time. To have bench warrants issued for your arrest is not an impediment. I cannot bring myself to vote for you.""Ms. Farber, who was a prosecutor in Bergen County and worked as the state's public advocate and public defender, was also questioned on legal matters.She said she opposed the use of deadly force to protect property and the use of mandatory minimum sentences, which she said takes away discretion from judges. She also promised to vigorously pursue allegations of public corruption. One criticism of the state's current attorney general, Peter C. Harvey, is that he has been reluctant to pursue such cases.'"

Cowher has taken a Steelers team there before; they lost to Dallas, 27-17, in Phoenix in January 1996.So someone asked whether Cowher based his decision on his team's wearing dark shirts that day a decade ago. ""I have no idea!"" Cowher said, feigning exasperation. ""Want to know what shoes I'm wearing, too?""Cowher said he chose the jersey color without consulting the front office or the players. ""I guess it was my decision,"" he said. ""I didn't consult with anybody. They asked me, and I told them. I didn't think too much about it.""The discussion rambled to other, peripheral subjects. Cowher was asked whether he was disappointed that he would miss the Rolling Stones concert at halftime. Cowher said that he had seen the band four times and that he would record its Super Bowl show for later viewing. ""I saw them when I was actually a player with the Cleveland Browns,"" Cowher said.On a more pressing subject, Cowher discussed Seattle running back Shaun Alexander, who was the league's most valuable player with 28 touchdowns and 1,880 rushing yards.""He's a different-style back,"" Cowher said. ""Shaun is a very patient runner and a very strong runner. He's got great balance. He's got great vision. He's one of those guys who doesn't look like he's going very fast, but he just keeps going. He's a big guy who can break tackles. He's going to be a big challenge.""The Steelers, who were 7-5 in early December, have won seven consecutive games. Cowher said he had been telling his players to keep their focus.""The deal's not done,"" he said. ""We've created a golden opportunity for ourselves. But we have not done anything. We aren't suddenly this great team that's the best team in football. It's the same group of guys. Don't underestimate what we have in front of us. It's a stiff opponent, well coached, and they are as hungry as we are.""Cowher said he was pleased that his team kept its equilibrium when it lost three consecutive games and seemed in danger of missing the playoffs.""You're probably never as good as you think you are, and you're probably never as bad as they say you are,"" Cowher said. ""It's very important that you keep the proper perspective. You don't take yourself too seriously when you're winning, and you don't beat yourself up when you lose some games.""'"
"'06-01-25,'0','Strengthened by a United States Supreme Court ruling last summer that approved the condemnation of private property by New London, Conn., for resale to other private interests for what the court called ""public purpose,"" municipalities around the country are considering similar forced takings, to a chorus of opposition by local interests and state legislators.Bills to block such seizures are on the docket in Oklahoma and many other states, along with other ballot initiatives. Last summer, the Texas Legislature banned the taking of private property for more lucrative public ventures.Here in Sand Springs, a city of 17,600 on the Arkansas River founded by Charles Page, the oilman, industrialist and philanthropist, the redevelopment plan dates from 2003. County voters agreed to add fractions of a penny to the sales tax for special projects, in the Sand Springs case $14.5 million to acquire private tracts on 96 acres along the highway for redevelopment.But the project was thrust into the national spotlight on Jan. 17 with an article posted on National Review Online by a conservative group, Americans for Limited Government, based in Glenview, Ill., that has been working with Oklahomans in Action and other groups to gather signatures for the ""Protect Our Homes"" movement and budget-curbing measures on state ballots.""It's not just grandma's house we have to worry about,"" wrote Heather Wilhelm, communications director for the limited government group. ""Now it's God's house, too.""The Sand Springs Leader stepped up coverage of Mr. Gildon, and a local radio host, Dillon Dodge, broadcast a program on the dispute. ""Hannity and Colmes,"" the talk show on the Fox News Channel, plans a program from Sand Springs on Wednesday, Ms. Wilhelm said.City officials, mortified at being portrayed as villains, protested that they had not seized any property and might not. ""Eminent domain is not being used at this time to acquire property,"" City Manager Loy Calhoun said in a statement Friday. ""Media reports to the contrary are inaccurate.""But in interviews, Mr. Calhoun and Mayor Walker acknowledged that it remained a last resort if the city and property owners could not agree on price.Mr. Gildon, sitting in a pew of the church that he has led for 14 years, the last seven in a new building that cost $90,000, said he and other leaders of the congregation met last week with a relocation agent working for the city, the Cinnabar Service Company, and came away believing that they had little choice but to sell.""If you tell me this is going to happen,"" he said, ""that tells me it's eminent domain.""He said the offer of $142,000 for the church and two extra lots was not enough to move to a new location where he could serve his 50 or so regular members. He said he was ""praying over"" the question of a counteroffer. ""If I have to move,"" he said, ""we're not going out of existence.""Mr. Gildon, 48, who works full time for a machine tool manufacturer and is paid $520 a month by the church, said he was not leading a crusade on the issue and made a point of not bringing it up it up in his sermons.""I've had to say, 'Don't let it go to your head,' "" he said he told congregants. ""We're not celebrities. We're here for God.""But he said he was no pushover, either. He taped the meeting with the Cinnabar agent, John Thomas, and said he told city officials, ""The Lord did not lead me here to sell out the church.""If the parties cannot agree, a team of three appointed appraisers devises a final offer, and whether or not the seller is happy, the city can take it for that price -- and sell it to someone else.Other property owners in the first 25-acre redevelopment zone said they felt that the city's initial offer of $1 a square foot was far too low. A fairer figure, several said, would be $8.50.""I don't have a problem with the city,"" said Joe Harrison, who runs the Firestone dealership downtown. ""I just don't want them stealing my land.""In the Muffler Stop a few blocks from the church, Ernie Nanney said the city first offered him $65,000 ""which is less than I paid 25 years ago."" He said that he counteroffered $350,000 and that the city came back with $85,000.In her small wood-frame house on Oak Street, Ray Jean Smith-Knight, 72, said that when she grew up a few houses away the neighborhood was ""a little old Wall Street"" of black professionals, and survivors of the Tulsa race riot of 1921 were welcomed to Sand Springs by Charles Page.Ms. Smith-Knight said that she had yet to receive a buyout offer and that despite the deterioration of the area did not relish leaving.""I'm not happy about it but I don't have a choice,"" she said. ""So many people have passed away that used to be fighters. One or two cannot fight.""Ruth Ellen Henry, founding director of the Sand Springs Cultural and Historical Museum, recalled a cleanup of the neighborhood a dozen years ago that removed a million pounds of debris but failed to halt its slide.

""I think the first one is that I can no longer play at the level that I was accustomed to in the past.""""The second one is realizing that my health, along with my family, is the most important thing to me in the world,"" added Lemieux, who had 7 goals and 15 assists in 26 games this season. ""I also realized that the new N.H.L. is really for the young guys. And I think that these young guys are really the future of the N.H.L.""Lemieux -- who battled through numerous debilitating back and hip injuries, and overcame a form of Hodgkin's disease -- ranks sixth on the National Hockey League's career list with 690 career goals, 10th in assists with 1,033, and seventh in points with 1,723. He played in 10 All-Star Games.Lemieux led the league in scoring six times and was the most valuable player three times. He was selected the M.V.P. of the playoffs twice, in 1991 and 1992, when he led the Penguins to consecutive Stanley Cup championships.""He was the best player I've ever seen, I've ever played with,"" said the Rangers' Jaromir Jagr, who played with the Penguins from 1990 to 2001. ""I didn't have a chance to see Wayne Gretzky much, because I came in 1990. But Mario was probably the most gifted. He had everything: size and strength and skill and how smart he was. There's nobody going to be like him, not another player, not right now, I don't see anybody. Not even close.""Lemieux, the No. 1 pick in the 1984 draft, broke into the league that fall at age 19. He played in 915 regular-season games and 107 playoff games. His career 0.75-goals-a-game average is second only to Mike Bossy. His 1.13-assists-a-game average and 1.89-points-a-game average are second only to Gretzky.The 6-foot-4, 230-pound Lemieux scored 50 or more goals in a season six times, including a career-best 85 in 1988-89.""I have a lot of great memories from the past 20 years or so,"" the Montreal-born Lemieux said yesterday. He listed winning the two Stanley Cups, a gold medal for Canada at the 2002 Salt Lake Olympics, the 2004 World Cup and the 1987 Canada Cup as his greatest highlights.The only time Lemieux, who never seemed to fully relish his first stint in the league, choked up during his 20-minute news conference was when he said: ""All I can say to the young players is enjoy every moment of it.

"'06-01-25,'0','""It's a very flexible and powerful program,"" said Robert Poznanski, president of the New Markets Support Company, one of the main recipients of credits from the Treasury Department, which administers the program.""It's driven by market forces. The federal government doesn't say, 'Use it for this type of business.' It can be used for commercial real estate, a charter school or a community center, as long as the application is competitive and the project is in a low-income area as identified by census tract data.""Tax credits make riskier projects more viable by reducing the debt associated with development costs. Private investors pay less in taxes and the developer passes the savings on to the community by, for example, lowering rent per square foot.The federal program will allocate up to $15 billion in tax credits to community development groups over seven years to make businesses or commercial real estate projects in low-income areas more attractive to private investors. Applicants vie for the credits, and so far the process has been highly competitive. In the first three rounds of allocation, beginning in 2003, demand for the credits has outpaced supply by 10 times, according to figures provided by the Treasury Department. Though the tax credits can be used for business development, the majority are used for commercial real estate because of the way the program is structured.The most recent allocation was completed last fall, bringing the total disbursement to $8 billion to date. Recipients have five years to use the tax credits to attract private investment, or they are withdrawn and can be reissued elsewhere through 2014.Dennis Sturtevant, president of Dwelling Place, a nonprofit community development organization, spearheaded the Martineau Division-Oakes project in Grand Rapids. The project used historic tax credits and other grants, in addition to new-market tax credits, to generate $2.2 million in equity from National City Bank.""When you're talking about tough neighborhoods and all the costs associated with renovating dilapidated, obsolete buildings with lead and everything else,"" Mr. Sturtevant said, ""you need to combine all these resources to make it work.""Sean P. Welsh, regional president of National City Bank, said: ""It required a lot of creativity. It's complicated, but it's really driving a lot of the urban redevelopment in this and other areas around the country.""One deal that most everyone agrees would have never happened were it not for the tax credits is Plaza Verde in South Minneapolis. Formerly an abandoned building in a low-income Hispanic neighborhood, it is now a 43,000-square-foot business incubator, with locally owned retailing on the ground floor, office space on the second level and a theater company on the top floor.JoAnna Hicks is the director of real estate for the Neighborhood Development Center, the nonprofit organization that spearheaded Plaza Verde. Even after expenses were deducted, including legal fees, new-market tax credits created almost $1 million in equity for a project that cost $4.2 million total.""Because it's such a complicated financial tool, it's hard for small nonprofits to use,"" Ms. Hicks said. ""But now that we understand it better, we're able to apply it to other projects as well.""Using another allocation of the tax credits, Ms. Hicks's organization has also undertaken the development of a nearly completed public market, called Midtown Global Market, a $17 million project that will be home to more than 60 vendors selling fresh and prepared foods, as well as handmade arts and crafts.As the program has only begun to mature, larger projects are just getting under way. Bridgeport, Conn., is undertaking a major redevelopment of its downtown, with approximately 25 percent of the financing coming from new-market tax credits. The total project is estimated to cost up to $150 million.""If structured properly, it makes a real difference between a scary development and the deal not being done at all,"" said Kevin Gremse, director of the National Development Council, which provides financial advice and services to municipalities.Mr. Gremse used his organization's new-market tax credit allocation to attract a New York City-based private developer, Eric Anderson of Urban Green Builders, to take on the task of reviving downtown Bridgeport, which has suffered years of decline.Advocates are cautiously optimistic that the program will be reauthorized in 2007. Congress recently passed a bill to assist Gulf Coast states with rebuilding efforts after Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, which included $1 billion more for the new-market tax credit program geared toward that region.""The fact that Congress expanded the program is a good sign,"" said Robert Rapoza, who manages the New Market Tax Credit Coalition, an advocacy organization pushing for the program's reauthorization. ""But we have work to do. This is a new tool and government-sponsored finance is relatively uncommon. We're continuing to put together data to strengthen our case.""Of course, it helps to have banks advocating for the tax credit as well. As one of the more active players in the tax credit industry, Zachary Boyers, a senior vice president of US Bank in St. Louis, closed more than 50 deals involving new-market tax credits in 2005 alone.""The banking community is behind this,"" Mr. Boyers said. ""We are deeply involved in spreading the word. We are working on ways to quantify its impact, which is not easy to do. But other investors, including banks and large corporations, would confirm that they would never be investing in these projects without it.""'"

The president called the countries' relationship ""vital"" while Mr. Aziz called it ""multifaceted.""The two leaders took no questions, and afterward the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, sidestepped queries about whether Mr. Bush had spoken in private to Mr. Aziz about the airstrikes.The airstrikes have infuriated Pakistanis, even as Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, said Tuesday in Oslo that there were indications that some of those killed were members of Al Qaeda. Last week Pakistani officials said two senior Qaeda members and the son-in-law of its No. 2 leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, were among those killed.American officials have said Mr. Zawahiri was the target of the raid, but they have acknowledged that he was not killed in the attack.

Yet all five pieces presented by John Eliot Gardiner, the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique and the Monteverdi Choir over two days at Lincoln Center were composed for reasons we don't quite understand, though one is a subject of romantic speculation.The last three symphonies, at Alice Tully Hall on Monday night, represented instrumental Mozart at its peak, yet no one seems to have asked for them. The C minor Mass, at Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday afternoon, was likewise not music on order. Mozart began it because he wanted to, and never finished it. The Requiem, its companion piece on Sunday, was commissioned anonymously, fertilizing the enduring legend that Mozart's patron was death incarnate. Death, at any rate, left the Requiem incomplete as well.Everywhere, Sir John and his faithful period-instrument band seemed to back away from the breathless, fleet-of-foot performances that have been so much a part of the early-music credo. Tempos in the wonderful E flat Symphony (No. 39) were spacious and relaxed. The opening Kyrie of the C minor Mass almost dawdled in its stately Furtwänglerian way. The G minor Symphony (No. 40) insisted but never rushed.The fast finales were just fast enough. Mozart's father, Leopold, once wrote that the key to correct tempo was finding the passage that could not move in any other way and then adapting the rest of the movement to it. Sir John is good at this. He also understands just how much room his fine players need to articulate small notes clearly.Sir John, I am told, thinks the ""Jupiter"" Symphony (No. 41) sounds better played standing up, and so it did on Monday. There may be other reasons it worked so well: the bluntness of period-instrument sound and the less strident pitch levels both remove the uncomfortable glare of modern orchestras playing in Mozart's brand of C major. It was nice to hear the timpanist almost as soloist, cutting through ensemble sound, not disappearing into it. Still, I think Mozart, given the chance, would have abandoned the wooden flute he knew for its valves-and-metal successor, and have done it in an instant.But attribute the successes of these two concerts to musicians and singers caring deeply at every moment, as well as to Sir John's deft and animating use of accents. Sunday's soloists stepped out of the chorus. The Mass's ""Laudamus Te"" is one of Mozart's truly operatic virtuoso soprano pieces, but even it was done with modest vibrato and touching simplicity. Katharine Fuge, Miriam Allan, Jeremy Budd, Matthew Brook, Elin Manahan Thomas, Claudia Huckle and Andrew MacKenzie-Wicks were the soloists.'"

"'06-01-25,'0','But much of the material in the latest audit is new, and the portrait it paints of abandoned rebuilding projects, nonexistent paperwork and cash routinely taken from the main vault in Hilla without even a log to keep track of the transactions is likely to raise major new questions about how the provisional authority did its business and accounted for huge expenditures of Iraqi and American money.""What's sad about it is that, considering the destruction in the country, with looting and so on, we needed every dollar for reconstruction,"" said Wayne White, a former State Department official whose responsibilities included Iraq from 2003 to 2005, and who is now at the Middle East Institute, a research organization.Instead, Mr. White said, large amounts of that money may have been wasted or stolen, with strong indications that the chaos in Hilla might have been repeated at other provisional authority outposts.Others had a similar reaction. ""It does not surprise me at all,"" said a Defense Department official who worked in Hilla and other parts of the country, who spoke anonymously because he said he feared retribution from the Bush administration. He predicted that similar problems would turn up in the major southern city of Basra and elsewhere in the dangerous desert wasteland of Anbar province. ""It's a disaster,"" the official said of problems with contracting in Anbar.No records were kept as money came and went from the main vault at the Hilla compound, and inside it was often stashed haphazardly in a filing cabinet.That casual arrangement led to a dispute when one official for the provisional authority, while clearing his accounts on his way out of Iraq, grabbed $100,000 from another official's stack of cash, according to the report. Whether unintentional or not, the move might never have been discovered except that the second official ""had to make a disbursement that day and realized that he was short cash,"" the report says.Outside the vault, money seemed to be stuffed into every nook and cranny in the compound. ""One contracting officer kept approximately $2 million in cash in a safe in his office bathroom, while a paying agent kept approximately $678,000 in cash in an unlocked footlocker in his office,"" the report says.The money, most from Iraqi oil proceeds and cash seized from Saddam Hussein's government, also easily found its way out of the compound and the country. In one case, an American soldier assigned as an assistant to the Iraqi Olympic boxing team was given huge amounts of cash for a trip to the Philippines, where the soldier gambled away somewhere between $20,000 and $60,000 of the money. Exactly how much has not been determined, the report says, because no one kept track of how much money he received in the first place.In another connection to Iraq's Olympic effort, a $108,140 contract to completely refurbish the Hilla Olympic swimming pool, including the replacement of pumps and pipes, came to nothing when the contractor simply polished some of the hardware to make it appear as if new equipment had been installed. Local officials for the provisional authority signed paperwork stating that all the work had been completed properly and paid the contractor in full, the report says.The pool never reopened, and when agents from the inspector general's office arrived to try out the equipment, ""the water came out a murky brown due to the accumulated dirt and grime in the old pumps,"" the report says.Sometimes the consequences of such loose controls were deadly. A contract for $662,800 in civil, electrical, and mechanical work to rehabilitate the Hilla General Hospital was paid in full by an American official in June 2004 even though the work was not finished, the report says. But instead of replacing a central elevator bank, as called for in the scope of work, the contractor tinkered with an unsuccessful rehabilitation.The report continues, narrating the observation of the inspector general's agents who visited the hospital on Sept. 18, 2004: ""The hospital administrator immediately escorted us to the site of the elevators. The administrator said that just a couple days prior to our arrival the elevator crashed and killed three people.""'"

"'06-01-26,'1','Marley was, in a way, a dog who loved too much. He would hurl himself through screen doors to get to Mr. Grogan or his wife, Jenny Vogt. When they locked him in a metal dog crate, he separated the steel bars.""It looked like the Jaws of Life had pulled it open,"" Mr. Grogan said. Marley flung drool on guests. He stole Ms. Vogt's underwear. He ate her jewelry. Thunderstorms gave him anxiety attacks, and then he would chew through things, mattresses, the couch.But ""Marley & Me"" is not just a book about a dog. In fact, it is a love story, of Mr. Grogan and his wife, a young married couple contemplating having a family. ""We were young,"" the book begins, irresistibly. ""We were in love."" Ms. Vogt was nervous about caring for a baby and thought a dog ""would be good practice,"" Mr. Grogan writes. A breeder offered them a discount on a puppy. ""The little guy's on clearance,"" Ms. Vogt begged her husband as Marley somersaulted into their laps, gnawed on their fingers and clawed his way up to lick their faces.Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Janet Maslin called it ""a very funny valentine to all those four-legged 'big, dopey, playful galumphs that seemed to love life with a passion not often seen in this world.' """"It's a book with intense but narrow appeal,"" she continued, ""strictly limited to anyone who has ever had, known or wanted a dog.""The book follows the couple through their efforts to have a child. When Ms. Vogt suffered a miscarriage, Marley seemed to mourn with her.""His tail hung flat between his legs,"" Mr. Grogan writes, ""the first time I could remember it not wagging whenever he was touching one of us. His eyes were turned up at her, and he whimpered softly.""When their three children did arrive, he became their guardian, delicately licking their faces and ears, allowing them to crawl all over him. The problem, Mr. Grogan writes, was not keeping Marley from hurting one of the babies, but keeping him out of the diaper pail.After Marley died in 2003, Mr. Grogan wrote a column about him for The Inquirer and was stunned when he got 800 responses from other dog owners. He thought Marley's story might make a book and wrote a proposal; the final manuscript was sold to Morrow for $200,000.Lisa Gallagher, William Morrow's publisher, said she began to suspect the book would do well when she noticed staff members passing it around among themselves. Morrow printed nearly 6,000 readers editions and sent them to booksellers. It also gave away copies at last June's BookExpo America, the industry trade show, in New York. In a nod to the book's tearjerker qualities, the company distributed tissue with Marley's image on it at regional bookseller meetings; it also sent Frisbees with the book's title on them to stores.Dan Mayer, who buys pet books for Barnes & Noble, was enthusiastic about the book because, he said, it is ""more of a memoir."" And then there's the book's cover, a photograph of Marley as a puppy looking appealingly up at the reader. ""It's really hard to walk past the cover of this book and not want to pick it up,"" Mr. Mayer said. Barnes & Noble chose ""Marley"" for its Discover program, which earns a book prominent display space in the company's stores and on its Web site, reviews in in-store brochures and often priority for advertising and author readings.Of course, a large part of the book's appeal is that Marley was a very, very bad dog. And the book is a lesson in unconditional love. The Grogans tried obedience school, but Marley was expelled. They sent him again, and this time he came in seventh in a class of eight. The dog behind him was ""a psychopathic pit bull,"" Mr. Grogan writes. Marley ate his own obedience certificate.These days, Marley lies buried in an unmarked grave in the garden at the edge of the woods. The Grogans now have a successor, Gracie, who is 18 months old. She is a female Lab. Like all Labs, she is exuberant and high-spirited.""But what she has is what Marley didn't have,"" Mr. Grogan said, ""the ability to calm down.""""We call her the anti-Marley,"" Mr. Grogan said.'"
"'06-01-26,'1','""I think he's a smart, honest guy,"" said Marc Lasry, founder of Avenue Capital, a prominent hedge fund, who has, along with his wife, contributed more than $25,000 to Mr. Spitzer's campaign.Of Mr. Spitzer's investigations of the financial world, he said: ""I have a very simple view toward life: If you do things that are wrong, they're wrong, whether you're a hedge fund or not. I just like the fact that he's bright and committed.""The most vociferous voice against Mr. Spitzer on Wall Street has been Kenneth G. Langone, a former director of the New York Stock Exchange and co-founder of Home Depot. He has dedicated himself to raising money for Mr. Spitzer's potential Democratic rival, the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi.One civic group that supports Mr. Spitzer recently calculated that friends and relatives of Mr. Langone, who is a constituent of Mr. Suozzi's, have already contributed more than half a million dollars.""Ken is reaching out to as many friends and associates and New Yorkers as he can,"" said a spokesman for Mr. Langone, Jim McCarthy, in an interview Wednesday.A case in point appears to be Stanley Druckenmiller, the hedge fund manager who was once the top lieutenant of George Soros, and who joined Mr. Langone in an attempted takeover of the stock exchange last year. In 2003, Mr. Druckenmiller and his wife, Fiona, contributed $50,000 to Mr. Spitzer.More recently, however, the couple have contributed to anyone but Mr. Spitzer, giving $32,000 to Mr. Suozzi this month and, late last year, more than $48,000 to the leading Republican candidate, William F. Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts.There was no response to a message left at Duquesne Capital, Mr. Druckenmiller's hedge fund.Mr. Langone's pique stems from the suit filed by Mr. Spitzer's office against Mr. Langone and Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the stock exchange. Mr. Spitzer has said Mr. Grasso's $139 million compensation package over eight years violates a state law related to oversight of nonprofit institutions. In a court filing on Tuesday, Mr. Langone asked that the suit be dismissed.In a speech last month, Mr. Langone said Mr. Spitzer was motivated by ""raw ambition for pure political gain"" and said his actions had harmed New York's economy.But Mr. Spitzer's donor list shows that he has found a wide range of supporters in the financial community: $5,000 from Nelson Peltz, the billionaire investor who has become a major investor in Wendy's; $40,000 from Lewis S. Ranieri, the chairman of Computer Associates and of the American Ballet Theater; $37,500 from Paul Fribourg, the chairman and chief executive of the commodities giant ContiGroup.John Hummer, one of Silicon Valley's best known venture capitalists, has contributed $5,000, while Ira Rennert, the financier known for bringing the megamansion to the Hamptons, has given $50,000. Among real estate barons, Howard Milstein, a former owner of the New York Islanders, has given $50,000 since 2003, while Robert K. Futterman, who owns a leasing company, has given $5,000. Mr. Spitzer himself comes from a wealthy real estate family.""The business community around the state has always been supportive of Eliot, and they are excited about the prospect of him as the next governor,"" said Ryan Toohey, Mr. Spitzer's campaign manager.Among Mr. Spitzer's corporate donors are Wal-Mart, the insurer Aflac and even Taser, the maker of stun guns. Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped an investigation of Taser related to statements it had made about the safety of its stun guns, but the S.E.C. continues to investigate trading in the company's stock.Mr. Spitzer has also taken contributions from TD Waterhouse, which, as a discount brokerage, has not had the conflict-of-interest issues related to stock analysts, which have plagued the large investment banks.Mr. Weld, whose most recent job has been at a Manhattan private investment firm, has raised his share from Wall Street in building a campaign balance of $1.8 million.Among Mr. Weld's donations are $25,000 from Stephen A. Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, and his wife; and $7,500 from John C. Whitehead, the former Goldman Sachs chairman, who has his own feud with Mr. Spitzer.Several of the biggest names among hedge fund managers are backing Mr. Spitzer, including Mr. Lasry as well as Richard Perry and James Simons, three of the 25 best-paid hedge fund managers, according to Institutional Investor, which tracks the industry.But other hedge fund managers are looking elsewhere. Among Mr. Weld's contributions is more than $48,000 from one of the deans of the old guard among hedge investors, Julian H. Robertson Jr.Mr. Suozzi's hedge fund backers include David Einhorn, who, along with his wife, has poured $100,000 into his campaign coffers, while another manager, Daniel S. Loeb, has contributed $50,000.'"

He said the Hassards were ""coping as best they can under the circumstances.""The Hassards live in a relatively new Suffolk County subdivision of well-kept homes, with S.U.V.'s in driveways and picket fences closing in spacious backyards.Mr. Talamini said the family got Jessy about a year ago and had never had any problems with her playing too roughly with the children. He said Kaitlyn had just turned 6 last Saturday. ""She was a bright, smart, energetic, beautiful 6-year-old,"" he said.The dog was taken to the Brookhaven Animal Shelter. Town officials said that family members had decided they did not want the dog back in their home, but had not requested that it be destroyed.""The animal is gentle and is showing no signs of aggression at the shelter,"" said Mark Grossman, a deputy supervisor for the Town of Brookhaven. He said the shelter had already received dozens of calls from people asking to adopt the dog. An adoption seems likely, he said.Roy Gross, chief of the Suffolk County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said that golden retrievers were generally not aggressive dogs. ""But they can be very playful, and I would guess that the dog didn't mean to harm the girl in any way,"" he said. ""There was probably a one-in-a-million chance for something like this to happen.""He said that golden retrievers were so gentle and affectionate that the society used them as therapy dogs, taking them to nursing homes and hospitals to cheer patients up.Janet Leek, a board member of the Long Island Golden Retriever Club and a dog breeder, said the average weight for an adult female golden retriever was about 65 pounds. She said that dogs younger than 2 years could be rambunctious.""If I have puppies to sell, I usually will tell people to wait until their children are at least 6 years old,"" she said. ""Because they are a retrieving breed and they might take the kids' toys or take a child's arm in their mouths, just playing with them.""'"
"'06-01-26,'1','In periods when consumer spending is slow, ordinary retailing acts as a brake on the luxury assets of PPR, burning up profits that luxury goods, which are international attractions, bring in. The luxury brands in particular have done well lately in North America and Asia.But Mr. Pinault shows no sign of jettisoning his father's idea. ""Always the philosophy of the business has been not to put all your eggs in one basket,"" he said recently.Over the years, Mr. Pinault's father, a high school dropout, switched the baskets frequently, moving from wood and building materials to retailing to luxury. The words that come to people's lips when the elder Mr. Pinault is mentioned are ""instinctive,"" ""visionary"" and sometimes ""genius.""He never ran the operating company, PPR, himself, preferring to delegate. And he had a reputation for hiring strong managers, like Serge Weinberg, who preceded the younger Mr. Pinault at the helm of PPR, and Domenico De Sole, the former lawyer who engineered the rebirth of Gucci in the 1990's.Slender and sandy-haired, the younger Mr. Pinault, 43, earned a degree from HEC, a French business school. His first practical experience came in the United States, where in place of French military service he spent 18 months working in a French government trade office promoting haute couture.Mr. Pinault, a collector of luxury watches who favors Gucci suits, joined the family company in the 1980's, rotating through various subsidiaries, like a unit that specialized in African trade; Fnac; and the company's Internet business. He was considered a success at each, expanding the business at every stop.After his father handed him control of the group in 2003, Mr. Pinault tightened his grip, dismissing both Mr. Weinberg and Mr. De Sole, and bringing in other HEC graduates. Among them are Valérie Hermann at Yves Saint Laurent; Jean-François Palus, PPR's financial director; and Christophe Cuvillier, head of Conforama, a furniture unit.Yet Mr. Pinault denies there is a fundamental difference between his and his father's philosophy. ""It has always been the balanced approach,"" he said, over breakfast in his wood-paneled office. ""We always thought in sectors, when they had a chance for growth. Hence, in wood products, we went into parquet, distribution, rather than just investing."" Château Latour, the Bordeaux winery, also seemed a good real estate investment.While PPR's retail activities may be widespread, it is also true that they are overly dependent on the domestic French market. Antoine Belge, an analyst at HSBC, said in a report that department store retailing was hampering PPR's overall earnings growth, noting that the division accounted for 67 percent of earnings, before interest and taxes, last year. The French market, he said, ""accounts for 58 percent of the business.""Mr. Pinault acknowledges the problem. ""We are very subject to the French economy,"" he said.Mr. Pinault said it was his goal over the next three years to increase the share of non-French markets to 60 percent, notably by expanding PPR's activities in southern Europe, including Italy, Spain and Greece, where it is opening Fnac stores and Conforama furniture showrooms. In the United States, beyond the luxury brands like Gucci, he hopes to expand the activities of Redcats, the third-largest home-shopping network in the country, which owns brands like Lerner, Chadwick's and Lane Bryant.Quick results are all the more urgent for multibrand conglomerates like PPR, because they risk over-reliance on a single brand. While Gucci has been the powerhouse of PPR, much of the cash it generates has gone to shore up less fortunate relations, like Yves Saint Laurent.""Gucci is definitely very, very good in both turnover and profitability,"" said Armando Branchini, president of InterCorporate, a fashion consulting firm in Milan. The challenge facing Mr. Pinault, he said, was to make money in the lesser brands.Discussing the luxury brands, Mr. Pinault gave the impression of a man in charge, listing the company's four main luxury brands and commenting on their prospects, a bit like a bookmaker reviewing his horses.Gucci, he said, which generated roughly 1.5 billion euros in sales last year, could be expected to double that amount in the next three years. The struggling Yves Saint Laurent, he said, showed impressive results with its most recent November collections, and had generated double-digit revenue growth in recent months. He set Saint Laurent's revenue target at 300 million euros by 2009, after what analysts estimate was revenue of roughly 160 million euros in 2005.Balenciaga, which the company was ready to shut down several years ago, was lauded. ""We underestimated its potential,"" Mr. Pinault said, praising the way its designer, Nicolas Ghesquière, exploited the archives of Cristóbal Balenciaga, the brand's creator.But Mr. Pinault came closest to fervor when he discussed Bottega Veneta, the Italian brand that Gucci acquired in the 1990's.""Last year it was profitable, and it continues to grow,"" he said, adding that revenue grew more than 50 percent in 2005, albeit from a low base. ""Bottega is almost where Saint Laurent is now,"" he said, referring to its revenues.Mr. Pinault was largely echoing projections given last year by Gucci's chief executive, Robert Polet, for the company's smaller luxury brands to become profitable within the next three years.""Individual brands are more limited in their influence on the market,"" Mr. Pinault said, defending the company's strategy. ""The only way to do it is with a portfolio of brands.""'"
"'06-01-26,'1','""Silicone is a time bomb,"" said Dr. Marvin J. Rapaport, a dermatologist in Beverly Hills, Calif., who has collected case reports on 80 patients who have had side effects from silicone shots since 1974. One of these patients had 50 inflamed nodules at injection sites on her face, and she needed injections of steroids several times a year to reduce the swelling, he said. ""Delayed reactions to silicone can happen 1 to 25 years after treatment,"" he said. ""You can't predict who is going to react or when.""Silicone has been used in the body since just after World War II, when doctors in Japan and Las Vegas began injecting it to enlarge women's breasts. Initially they used the industrial kind of silicone that goes into making furniture polish and transformer fluid. Complications like cysts, sores and painful hardening of the breasts were in some cases so severe that women needed mastectomies. Three women died when silicone obstructed their blood vessels and lungs. In the 1960's the breast injections fell out of favor.In the 1950's Dr. Norman Orentreich, a dermatologist in New York City, pioneered the use of tiny amounts of silicone to fill facial wrinkles. These injections became popular with celebrities like Helen Gurley Brown, the editor of Cosmopolitan. In 1992, however, the F.D.A. ordered a number of prominent doctors to stop using liquid silicone in the face. At the time the agency's commissioner, Dr. David A. Kessler, warned that ""people who undergo these injections are exposing themselves to unknown, potentially dangerous risks.""Then in 1997 the agency approved a purified form of liquid silicone called Silikon 1000 for correcting detached retinas. Because a material that is approved for one medical purpose can legally be used off-label for another, some dermatologists picked up the silicone syringe again.Liquid silicone, also known as silicone oil, has the consistency of motor oil. When injected into the skin, it causes the body to surround the foreign material with collagen. The new collagen, in turn, bulks up the skin.Doctors use the so-called ""microdroplet technique,"" which calls for only one- to two-tenths of a teaspoon of silicone per treatment. It is injected droplet by droplet into lips, acne scars, hollow cheeks, sunken chins or furrows like the nasolabial folds that descend from the nostrils to the outer corners of the lips. Each treatment costs $500 to $800. And several treatments may be needed before the collagen builds up enough for effects to show, dermatologists say.Temporary wrinkle fillers like collagen and Restylane are made of organic materials that eventually break down. But silicone is inorganic; once put in the skin, it stays there. And that makes it more convenient.Arlene Louis, 61, of Fort Lee, N.J., tried both fat and Restylane injections in the two deep folds called marionette lines that ran from the corners of her mouth down to her chin. But the injections did not fully erase her lines, and she didn't like the prospect of repeating them. So five years ago she went to Dr. Rhoda S. Narins, a dermatologist in New York City, for a series of eight monthly silicone treatments.""My puppet lines are gone. I look 10 years younger,"" Ms. Louis said earlier this month when she returned to Dr. Narins's office for silicone injections in her cheeks.Before Dr. Narins gives silicone shots, she has patients sign a consent form that describes the possible side effects. Permanent lumps or inflamed nodules in the skin, intermittent swelling at the injection sites, and permanent red or brown patches can occur years after treatment. But Dr. Narins said that among the several hundred patients she has treated with silicone since 1998, she has never seen a problem.""Most of the side effects you hear about are caused by nonphysicians injecting an impure substance in nonmedical settings,"" like spas and hotel rooms, Dr. Narins said. When it is administered correctly, she said, ""silicone is a superior product that gives you fabulous results.""But Dr. David M. Duffy, a dermatologist in Torrance, Calif., has found that liquid silicone can cause problems even when administered by a master injector. He said he has treated about 4,000 patients with silicone in the last 22 years, and he has seen one serious complication (a patient's face became extremely swollen and purple from inflammation) as well as some ""lumps and bumps that are a nuisance.""""In good hands the ballpark complication rate could be 4 in 1,000"" patients, Dr. Duffy said. ""In bad hands there are horror stories.""Lindsay Taylor, a country-western singer in Toronto, said she has a line of bumps from silicone injections that look ""like tiny rice grains"" running along her forehead. She also has a walnut-size bump between her eyebrows and a raised line along her top lip, she said.""I paid money to a professional to improve my looks,"" Ms. Taylor said. ""But instead I got disfigured as if I'd been in a car accident.""Ms. Taylor is one of 450 patients participating in a class action suit against Dr. Sheldon V. Pollack, a Toronto dermatologist who injected them with silicone. The complaint alleges that Dr. Pollack failed to inform them that Canada's health department prohibits the cosmetic use of injectable silicone, according to J. Adam Dewar, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. About 75 of the patients have cosmetic problems including lumps and raised lines on their faces, Mr. Dewar said.Even if no direct side effects occur, the silicone can migrate inside the face. ""Gravity changes your face over time, and the filler does not end up in the place you started,"" said Dr. Arnold W. Klein, a dermatologist in Beverly Hills.But other doctors are learning to like silicone. Dr. Jeffrey S. Dover, a dermatologist in Chestnut Hill, Mass., first tried the injections as part of a clinical trial. From 2002 to 2004 his practice treated eight volunteers with a new kind of liquid silicone called SilSkin. Each patient had silicone injections in one nasolabial fold and collagen injections in the other. Eighteen months later all the volunteers preferred the silicone, he said.Dr. Dover found it so ""spectacular"" for both deep furrows and acne scars that he has started injecting liquid silicone occasionally in his own patients. Still he worries that injectable silicone may prove to be the Russian roulette of cosmetic dermatology. ""You do wonder,"" he said, ""whether this is the patient who is going to come back in 10 or 15 years asking you, 'What are these bumps in my face where you injected the silicone?' ""'"
"'06-01-26,'1','WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 - The Environmental Protection Agency has asked DuPont and seven other chemical companies to stop using a toxic substance in the making of everyday products, including Teflon-coated pans, that has been linked in some studies to cancer, strokes and other health problems.Announcing the voluntary program, officials of the agency said Wednesday that full compliance by the companies and their overseas affiliates would lead to a 95 percent reduction by 2010 in use of the substance, perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and to their total elimination by 2015.DuPont immediately pledged to join the program, saying it had already reduced its PFOA manufacturing emissions by 94 percent and had developed new technologies that could reduce PFOA content in products by more than 97 percent. The other companies are expected to commit to the program as well. They are 3M/Dyneon, Arkema, Asahi, Ciba, Clariant, Daikin and Solvay Solexis.PFOA makes high-performance plastics resistant to fire, grease and stains. Its presence may be best known in Teflon, made by DuPont, but it is also found in fabrics, leather, automobile parts, wire insulation and microwave popcorn bags.Uncertainties still surround the way PFOA exposure affects humans, and as part of the new program, the companies will provide test data so that those questions can be explored.""The science is still coming in, but the concern is there, so acting now to minimize future releases of PFOA is the right thing to do,"" said Susan B. Hazen, acting assistant administrator of the agency's Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances.'"

The poll's margin of error was about 3 percent.The tax study and poll were commissioned by the Rauch Foundation, based here, as part of its Long Island Index reports on public policy issues.""Long Islanders are really struggling with the cost of local government, and it's worse than ever,"" said the foundation's president, Nancy Rauch Douzinas. ""The good news is, for the first time ever, people are open to -- even requesting -- innovation. The surprise was their willingness to consider new remedies.""Tax rebellions emerged last year when Long Island voters defeated 36 percent of first-time school budgets, compared with a statewide rejection rate of 12 percent.The island's two county executives, Thomas R. Suozzi of Nassau and Steve Levy of Suffolk, praised the study and said they wanted to harness public opinion to make changes. ""It cries out for action,"" said Mr. Levy, who relishes the role as a penny pincher. ""Affordability has reached crisis proportions.""Mr. Suozzi is trying make local taxes a statewide issue as he explores whether to seek the Democratic nomination for governor. Local taxes in New York are the highest in the country, 72 percent above the national average, he said.On Long Island he pointed to school taxes as ""the No. 1 culprit."" Though the county has no control over schools, he recently called school officials together to seek solutions. One problem is that Nassau's schools get only 17 percent of their budgets in state aid, while the statewide average is 37 percent and the national rate is 57 percent, he said.Long Island is notorious for balkanized government -- 901 entities at last count. Together they spent about $16 billion in 2003, the report said. ""That's a huge amount -- it really hits you between the eyes,"" said Charles Zettek Jr., director of the Center for Governmental Research in Rochester, a nonprofit group that did the study.Salaries and benefits accounted for more than half the spending. Rising pension and health care bills pushed up benefit costs by 30 percent from 1998 to 2003, the study found.To finance their budgets, local governments levied $7.2 billion in property taxes and $1.9 billion in sales taxes, the study said. The rest came in state and federal aid, fees and other income.Schools accounted for half the local spending. The rest was spent by the counties, towns, villages, two small cities and various special districts, the study said. Schools were also the fastest-growing segment. From 1998 to 2003, their spending jumped 26 percent, twice the rate for all local government on the island.Fifty-five percent of those polled supported a local income tax, posed in the survey as a tax that would ""would increase by up to a maximum of 9 percent for the wealthiest households"" and replace two-thirds of the property tax for schools. But most public officials consider income tax proposals political suicide.Seventy-six percent favored taking tax revenue from commercial properties and sharing it evenly among school districts, the survey found. The present system funnels that money to the districts where they are located.Although Long Island has 126 school districts, residents split on the idea of combining districts to economize, with 48 percent against and 46 percent in favor. Short of consolidation, Mr. Suozzi urged school officials to seek savings in cooperative efforts like joint purchasing of supplies.""It's a dramatic sea change that people are talking about subjects that historically have been taboo,"" Mr. Suozzi said of the tax issues. ""Everybody finally agrees this is a problem, and everybody agrees something has to be done.""'"
"'06-01-26,'1','TRENTON, Jan. 25 - New Jersey law enforcement officials did such a poor job handling a corruption case involving one of the state's top Democratic power brokers that the federal authorities have decided against filing charges, according to a letter that was made public on Wednesday.The case involved allegations made by John Gural, now the mayor of Palmyra, that he was pressured into firing a defiant municipal employee at the behest of George E. Norcross III, the powerful Camden County Democrat. But Mr. Gural had secretly recorded his 2001 conversations with Mr. Norcross, and Mr. Norcross was heard on tape boasting of his ability to destroy his enemies and provide jobs and contracts to allies.In a letter dated Tuesday, Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney for New Jersey, wrote that the state attorney general's office -- under both Republican and Democratic administrations -- had made a series of legal errors and questionable judgments. As a result, Mr. Christie concluded, ""a federal indictment is not appropriate now, in part because the state investigation was materially hampered by poor oversight, inexplicable strategic decisions and a failure to fully develop potential evidence.""For example, Mr. Christie said, the state passed up an opportunity to strengthen its hand when it offered plea deals on unrelated tax evasion charges to two figures in the investigation without securing their cooperation in the corruption case.When asked about the findings, Paul Loriquet, a spokesman for the state attorney general's office, said, ""We have received the letter, and we are reviewing it.""Mr. Norcross's lawyer, William M. Tambussi, said the letter had essentially cleared his client's name. ""He's been enduring baseless attacks by political manipulators,"" he said. ""Nowhere in this letter is there any suggestion that a crime has been committed.""Mr. Gural was frustrated, too, but for entirely different reasons. ""They compromised this investigation from the start for two reasons -- No. 1, they're inept, and No. 2, they're corrupt,"" he said.'"
"'06-01-26,'1','""Today we are putting our most valuable intellectual property on the table so we can put technical compliance issues to rest,"" Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said at a news conference in Brussels.The company will offer licenses to examine the code that controls communications between servers, which rivals could use to develop Windows-compatible software. The rivals will not be allowed to copy the code and it will not be available for open-source platforms, like Linux.""We're not open-sourcing Windows,"" Mr. Smith said.The office of the spokesman for the European Union's competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said it would study the announcement once it received the full details. The European Union said it still required a response to the objections raised in December.At his news conference, Mr. Smith acknowledged that the offer to license some Windows source code ""doesn't lay to rest all the issues,"" referring to the pricing of licenses. The source code would be offered in addition to the other technical information the company has already agreed to supply at no extra cost, he said.""There will be no impact on the price, but the value of the information will be greater,"" he said.Microsoft would be open to negotiating prices for the package of technical information and the source code details with companies or developers interested in buying the license, he added.Rival software developers contended that access to the code would not restore competition to the market.John Loiacono, executive vice president for software at Sun Microsystems, which has in recent years been promoting a strategy of open-sourced software, called Microsoft's decision a small improvement but one that does not go far enough.Two years ago, Sun settled antitrust and patent lawsuits against Microsoft for $1.6 billion, after trying for years to get access to its underlying technology. ""This is Microsoft fighting, kicking and screaming, to deliver the bare minimum,"" Mr. Loiacono said.Far from restoring competition, disclosing the source code could make life even harder for free software developers, said Joaquim Jakobs, head of media relations at the Free Software Foundation, a grass-roots group that is supporting the European commission in its fight with Microsoft.Developers want access to protocols hidden within Windows, not the source code, Mr. Jacobs said. ""Source code is like a completed university thesis, whereas the protocols are like grammar and vocabulary books you need in order to understand the thesis,"" he said.""Because that source code is under Microsoft copyright, developers who have seen the source code could not reimplement it in free software for fear of copyright violation.""Microsoft has appealed the overall antitrust ruling, and the Court of First Instance, Europe's second-highest court, said on Wednesday that it would hold a public hearing on the case from April 24 to April 28.'"
"'06-01-26,'1','The New York-based rights group said in its report that Libya had abolished its ""people's court,"" infamous for trying political cases against government critics; promised to review its penal code to reduce use of the death penalty; and said it had investigated complaints against 48 security officers accused of torture, though it made no information available on the outcome of those cases.Opening itself to scrutiny by watchdog groups like Human Rights Watch is part of Libya's efforts in recent years to rebuild its image and attract Western oil investments. But Libya remains on the State Department's list of countries that sponsor terrorism.Human Rights Watch representatives say reformers are clashing with an old guard that seeks to retain its power.""It is a combination of image and real intent,"" Mr. Abrahams said of Libya's policies. ""They realize that in order to be part of the international community, protection of human rights is part of that, but others in the government believe all they need is a show with no substance.""""But people are increasingly demanding their rights,"" he added. ""We heard critical views of the system. People took the opportunity to push within the limits.""The group called upon Western governments, and the United States in particular, to be more critical of Libya's human rights record and not to ignore problems because of recent cooperation by Libya in the American effort to reduce the threat of terrorism.Mr. Abrahams has just returned from a visit to Libya, where his group presented government officials in Tripoli with an extensive report on the status of human rights in Libya and recommendations to improve it.He emphasized, however, that many political prisoners -- ""perhaps hundreds"" -- remained behind bars, and he urged the Libyan authorities to deliver on the promises regarding human rights that they have made in recent years.Libyan dissidents attending the news conference voiced concern over the warming American-Libyan ties, contending that Colonel Qaddafi had cracked down again after allowing small gains in political freedoms in the last few years.""Qaddafi does not care about the opposition,"" said Mujahid El Boussifi, editor of Haqiqa.com, a London-based opposition Web site, who fled Libya in 1996.

"'06-01-27,'1','AT&T and Verizon Communications, the nation's largest phone companies, erased some doubts about their health yesterday as they reported better-than-expected sales for the fourth quarter that were bolstered by continued demand for their wireless and broadband services.Their improved finish to 2005 lifted the share prices of all the Bell companies and removed some of Wall Street's concerns about the steady loss of local phone customers to rival cable providers and upstart Internet phone companies like Vonage.In an effort to stem that tide, the Bell companies have been heavily discounting their high-speed data services and wireless plans. The promotions led to record numbers of new subscribers at Cingular and Verizon Wireless, the mobile phone subsidiaries of AT&T and Verizon.""Investors were overly pessimistic on the entire industry,"" said Doreen A. Toben, Verizon's chief financial officer. ""They thought the consumer business would crash and fall. But the cash flow we're spinning off is amazing.

"'06-01-27,'1','UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 26 - Human rights organizations and the co-chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus protested Thursday against a decision by the Bush administration to back a measure introduced by Iran denying two gay rights groups a voice at the United Nations.In a vote Monday, the United States supported Iran's recommendation to deny consultative status at the United Nations' Economic and Social Council to the Danish National Association for Gays and Lesbians and the International Lesbian and Gay Association, based in Belgium.Nearly 3,000 nongovernmental organizations have such status, which enables them to distribute documents to meetings of the council.Among countries with which the United States sided were Cuba, Sudan and Zimbabwe, nations the State Department has cited in annual reports for their harsh treatment of homosexuals.Representative Tom Lantos, a California Democrat who is co-chairman of the caucus, wrote a letter to John R. Bolton, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, saying the move was ""a major setback"" for ""a core component of our nation's human rights diplomacy.""Matt Foreman, executive director of the Washington-based National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, said, ""It is an absolute outrage that the United States has chosen to align itself with tyrants -- all in a sickening effort to smother voices of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people around the world.""'"
"'06-01-27,'1','On Tuesday, when Ms. Horne first appeared onstage, she received an immediate standing ovation from the audience, which nearly filled the hall. Determined, it seemed, not to let the evening become an emotional tribute to her, she thanked everyone for coming and got right to work.Ms. Leemhuis, a mezzo-soprano with a warm, dusky voice, began by singing Brahms's ""Von ewiger Liebe"" (""Of Everlasting Love""). It's a complex song about a young woman in love with a ""guy from the other side of the tracks,"" as Ms. Horne put it. The young man is worried that their affair will cause his beloved disgrace. But she, the ""strength in the relationship,"" Ms. Horne said, affirms her love, though with a fervor surely meant to seem sadly naïve.Ms. Horne emphasized that there are three voices in the song: the boy, the girl and the narrator. She wanted Ms. Leemhuis to do much more to differentiate them, to find distinctive vocal colorings and inflections for each one -- ""your sweetest sound for the girl, of course,"" a somber color for the narrator and perhaps a virile sound for the boy.But Ms. Horne mostly concentrated on helping Ms. Leemhuis make the words crisper and more dynamic. From the first word, ""Dunkel"" (dark), sung mysteriously on a low note, Ms. Leemhuis's mellow sound was somewhat muffled. Ms. Horne wanted something less rounded and more energetic. ""Put more sound here,"" she said, pointing to her nasal cavity. ""Put more ping in the vowel. You're keeping it to yourself instead of sending it out to the public.""Projecting the voice, as she emphasized all evening, is not simply about singing loudly, but about making the words vivid, exaggerating the ""glottals,"" as singers call the sound of consonants when made by the glottis in the throat. ""I need more glots, more glots,"" Ms. Horne kept shouting playfully at Ms. Leemhuis.Despite the time limits, each singer improved noticeably after some coaching. There was Sidney Outlaw, a lyric baritone; Matthew Peña, a sweet-voiced tenor; and Edward Parks, a robust baritone, who gained an entirely new insight into Schumann's ""Die beiden Grenadiere"" (""The Grenadiers""), which Ms. Horne sees as a bitter antiwar song. She helped Jeremy Little, a bright-voiced tenor, bring a warm, lyrical glow to Schubert's wistful love song ""Ständchen"" (""Serenade""). Kisma Jordan, who has a shimmering soprano voice that she is still learning to control, was able with Ms. Horne's exacting guidance to sing Brahms's melancholic ""Die Mainacht"" (""The May Night"") with more emphatic enunciation and, consequently, greater subtlety.Ms. Horne started her foundation because she grew worried that the tradition of the song recital was in trouble and that the best young singers were being enticed, even cajoled, into careers in opera. And in the early 1990's, opera in the United States was gaining popularity, despite the challenges facing classical music because of inadequate music education in the public schools, the graying of audiences, cuts in government arts financing and other woes.That opera was doing well was fine by Ms. Horne. But what about the intimate art form of the song recital, which in many ways is like a dramatic recitation of musicalized poetry? There still seemed to be eager audiences for song recitals in cities like New York. But at the time, as Ms. Horne noted with alarm, institutions and organizations around the country that used to present song recital series regularly started dropping out of the business.Opera buffs who know Ms. Horne mostly from her stellar operatic career, especially her trailblazing advocacy of Rossini and Handel operas, may not realize that she also gave more than 1,300 song recitals. Passing on this tradition has become her daily work.Each season the Marilyn Horne Foundation selects 16 to 20 young singers. Working with presenting institutions across the country, the foundation sponsors residencies for the chosen singers, who give recitals and visit local schools. The foundation pays the fees and expenses of the singers; the presenters pay for marketing, renting the halls and setting up the school programs. Of the foundation's annual $750,000 operating budget, 72 percent is spent on programs, said the executive director, Barbara Hocher.The foundation also presents its artists in ""On Wings of Song,"" a series of Sunday afternoon recitals at St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue in New York. These concerts are taped and broadcast by WQXR-FM (96.3). Since last April, in cooperation with WFMT in Chicago, a broadcast series of foundation artists has been made available in radio syndication. ""Some 96 stations have picked it up,"" Ms. Horne said.Past Horne Foundation singers include the leading countertenor of the day, David Daniels; the powerhouse mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe; and the radiant lyric soprano Heidi Grant Murphy. Though the student singers who participated in Tuesday's master class are not yet ready for the foundation residencies, they were a talented and promising group. (The able pianists who shared the accompaniment were Ines Irawatiand Marie-Ève Scarfone.)Tonight's concert features the baritone Nathaniel Webster, the tenor William Ferguson, the mezzo-soprano Katherine Rohrer and the soprano Nicole Cabell (who last year won the prestigious BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition). Frederica von Stade appears as a special guest artist.As always, Ms. Horne will preside like a proud den mother, introducing the artists and songs. She may, as in past years, sing something as well. Judging from the singing she did on Tuesday night to illustrate countless points, the great Marilyn Horne, though retired, still sounds pretty great.About her illness she remains positive. ""I'll be home in New York for all my treatments,"" she said. ""I have lots of friends, lots of love, a wonderful daughter and people who are there for me.""""The Song Continues 2006,"" the annual recital of emerging talent sponsored by the Marilyn Horne Foundation, takes place tonight at 7:30 in Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall. The mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade will be a special guest. Tickets, $35 and $42; (212) 247-7800.""On Wings of Song,"" another Foundation series, continues on March 12 at 3 p.m. with a performance by Jesse Blumberg, baritone, and Martin Katz, pianist, in the chapel at St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 51st Street.

"'06-01-27,'1','It was Thomas who hired Brown last summer to coach the Knicks. It was a widely popular move, since the perception was that Brown, as one of the most respected coaches in basketball, would find a way to mold the Knicks into a winning team. Instead, Brown finds himself in an uphill battle on the court and in a tense atmosphere off it. Asked if he was bothered, Brown said no.""I don't get caught up in the other stuff because Mr. Dolan and Isiah allow me to coach,"" he said. ""I don't answer to anyone but Isiah and Mr. Dolan and I have a great staff.""Gesturing to the thicker than usual scrum of reporters around him, Brown did add a caveat. ""Obviously, this doesn't take place everywhere I've been,"" he said. ""A lot of things that happen off the court or that I think aren't big deals, here seem to be magnified a thousand percent.""And he allowed that while he felt he was able to suppress or ignore such clamor, not everyone could.""I do think it's different for the players,"" he said.One of those players, Marbury, is cited in the lawsuit as making derogatory comments about Browne Sanders. It has been a rough week and a half for Marbury, who sat out three games with a sprained shoulder, missed a potential game-winning shot Wednesday night and showed up for practice Thursday with a stitched lip and a sore jaw incurred in the defeat.When he was asked about the lawsuit -- which also contends that two ""completely unqualified"" cousins of Marbury were put on the Garden payroll -- Marbury shrugged and said he did not feel tainted or preoccupied.""It's really not hard because we know the truth,"" he said.""I laugh at it,"" he added, in reference to the lawsuit and the furor it has created. ""It's a joke to me. I pretty much laugh at it.""And while Marbury said that his teammates were not as concerned about the lawsuit as one might think, he said they were getting a lesson on what he said was the overly intrusive treatment that professional sports teams receive in New York.However the legal dispute plays out, the Knicks, who have looked frozen on defense and sloppy on offense, have plenty of work to do. They are, said Brown, having trouble with the most rudimentary aspects of the game.""We watch every film and it seems like the same things are prevalent every night,"" Brown said. ""Blocking out, getting loose balls, making hard cuts, setting good screens, everyone running back -- offense to defense and defense to offense. Every night.""When they won six games in a row to start the month, there was a sense that the Knicks were developing a core rotation. But Wednesday night again had a seat-of-the-pants feel to it, with Qyntel Woods playing meaningful minutes and the three rookies -- Channing Frye, David Lee and Nate Robinson -- seeing big reductions in playing time. In fact, Lee did not play at all.Brown said he liked the matchups that Woods and Maurice Taylor, who both played well, gave the team against the Sacramento Kings. And Brown said that the rookies were a touch fatigued -- at least one traditional problem for a team that seems to copyright its own problems all the time.'"

"'06-01-27,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 26 - Microsoft said on Thursday that its quarterly profit rose 5 percent, matching Wall Street's forecasts, as the high cost of introducing the Xbox 360 game console was offset by strong sales of servers and software tools.The company said net income was $3.65 billion, or 34 cents a share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, a period that included 1 cent a share in tax benefits. That compares with net income of $3.46 billion, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier.Despite a shortage of units in the holiday season, Microsoft said it was able to ship 1.5 million Xbox units between the product's release Nov. 22 and the end of December. That figure, while below Microsoft's early projections, was better than many Wall Street analysts had expected.""The quarter was pretty much in line, but despite all the hoopla the Xbox sales turned out to be better than we thought,"" said Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs. He said investors would probably breath a ""collective sigh of relief"" at the generally positive outlook. Microsoft also raised its profit and sales forecasts for the fiscal year.Revenue in the period, the second quarter of Microsoft's fiscal year, rose 9 percent, to $11.84 billion from $10.82 billion, and was slightly below the company's October forecast of $11.9 billion to $12 billion.'"

"'06-01-27,'1','Sometimes this convergence can yield surprising results. ""God Grew Tired of Us,"" directed by Christopher Quinn, is a documentary about a group of young men who fled civil war in southern Sudan and lived for years in a refugee camp in Kenya. The film follows a few of these ""lost boys"" to Pittsburgh and Syracuse, where they adjust to a life that is infinitely safer and more comfortable than what they had left, but hard in its own ways. After one screening, one of the film's subjects, John Bul Dou, whose calm resilience is at the heart of the film, talked about his efforts to raise money to help the thousands of lost boys still in Africa. A member of the audience handed him a check for $25,000.Utah is among the most reliably Republican states in the union, which lends a certain piquancy to the fact that the surest way to elicit boos from a Sundance audience is to put George Bush's face on the screen. Al Gore was here, warmly received and celebrity-spotted at a few parties; Ralph Nader, meanwhile, was the subject of a probing and informative documentary called ""An Unreasonable Man."" As ever, political subjects pervaded the documentary categories, nearly always addressed from a left-of-center perspective. It would be nice, if only for variety's sake, to encounter a pro-war or pro-death-penalty documentary here, but that seems unlikely. Some of the topics included the recent Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the unsettled state of the border between the United States and Mexico, the cruel vagaries of the criminal justice system and the sufferings of wounded soldiers returning from Iraq.All matters much in need of illumination, from whatever angle. And, in any case, it is not such a bad thing for an event like this to have a point of view. Documentary filmmaking is, at the moment, a mode of argument, and it is possible to learn a great deal from films that forgo objectivity in favor of polemic.""The Death of the Electric Car,"" for instance, a work in progress by Chris Paine (shown out of competition), is a prosecutorial examination of the role of oil companies, the automobile industry and the Bush administration (them again) in stymieing the development of emission-free electric vehicles. The film does give some time to the other side, but its intentions are overtly activist, and its interviews with scientists, engineers, regulators and executives provoke as well as inform.The Sundance audience, one of the most passionate I've ever encountered here, was certainly fired up by the story of a promising technology quashed, in the filmmaker's view, by greed and timidity. As the film chronicled General Motors's shutdown of its electric car line -- the company reclaimed every single vehicle it had sold, and destroyed almost all of them -- a woman behind me exclaimed, ""That's crazy!""But pointing the camera need not always involve pointing a finger. James Longley's ""Iraq in Fragments"" is the latest entry in the crowded field of documentaries from that war. It is also one of the best, partly because it is more concerned with exploring daily life and individual destinies than with articulating a position. The title has several meanings, referring both to Mr. Longley's collagist method and to the communal fractures that threaten the country's stability. It takes the form of a trilogy, with one section devoted to Sunnis, one to Shia and one to Kurds, but it also reminds us that we generalize about those groups at our peril. Whether you think the war is right or wrong, ""Iraq in Fragments"" is a necessary reminder of just how painful and complicated it is.Which brings us to another paradox, one not unique to Sundance. Film festivals are artificial ecosystems, sealed off from the rest of the world, in which you can encounter a new painful and complicated reality on screen every two hours. A good laugh can seem as rare as a parking space or a restaurant table, which may be why comedies attract inordinate attention, as well as big money. So far this year, the noteworthy deals have been Fox Searchlight's purchase of distribution rights for ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris's crowd-pleasing family road farce starring Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette and Steve Carell, and Warner Independent's pickup of ""The Science of Sleep,"" Michel Gondry's whimsical, trilingual surrealist romance with Gael García Bernal and Charlotte Gainsbourg.But in the American dramatic competition, trouble -- especially the trouble facing young people in small towns and tough neighborhoods -- predominates. The earnest, closely observed coming-of-age story is one of Sundance's defining genres, represented this year most notably by Dito Montiel's ""Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"" and So Yong Kim's ""In Between Days.""Mr. Montiel's film, his first, is both an autobiography -- the main character, played as a young man by Shia LaBeouf and in later life by Robert Downey Jr., is named Dito -- and a mostly successful attempt to breathe fresh life into the ""Mean Streets"" tradition of volatile neighborhood drama. The film succeeds not just because the material is so close to the director's heart, but also because his loose, fluid directing style and his easy way with actors make it feel lived in, rather than merely familiar.""In Between Days"" is a quieter film, a wisp of a story about a young Korean girl living in a wintry American city and trying to figure out her feelings about her best friend, a boy named Tran, and herself. Ms. Kim generates an extraordinary sense of intimacy without seeming invasive or prurient, and without insulting the audience or the character with too much explanation. It's a small, serious film that shows great promise and that may have a hard time being seen outside this festival. So maybe not much has changed, after all.'"
"'06-01-27,'1','MEXICO CITY, Jan. 26 - The United States and Mexico exchanged diplomatic broadsides on Thursday over border security and drug-related violence in another sign of their deteriorating relationship.The American ambassador, Antonio O.

""In the past there has been a tendency to focus on public relations instead of public security.""Hours later the Mexican foreign minister, Luis Ernesto Derbez, suggested that it was Mr. Garza who appeared to be playing to a crowd for political reasons. ""What he says is that one should not feed this discourse in the media, but find a real solution,"" Mr. Derbez said. ""I would hope that he would apply his own recommendation."" Not to be outdone, Mr. Derbez announced that Mexico would send its own diplomatic note responding to Mr. Garza's criticisms. He also said Mexico would demand an explanation for the lack of progress in an investigation of the fatal shooting of a Mexican immigrant, Guillermo Martínez, by a Border Patrol agent on Dec. 30 near San Diego.'"

They said they would file an application in the next few months for government approvals.The site is 13.5 miles south of Long Beach and 19 miles east of Sandy Hook, N.J. Company officials chose the Boardwalk here for a news conference that displayed a large plastic panel with a small gray mark representing the artificial island, to show that it would be barely visible. The mark appeared to be about a third the size of cargo ships on the horizon.""This removes us from populated areas and shipping lanes,"" the company chairman, Howard Bovers, said of the site. ""We don't have any of those problems."" Terminals are safe, he said, adding, ""We don't think we are a target for terrorists."" But critics have raised concerns over the floating Long Island Sound terminal, proposed by Broadwater Energy.The Long Island Power Authority would be the major local user.A leader of the coalition against the floating terminal, Adrienne Esposito, was dubious of the island proposal, saying ""the more we learn, the more it sounds like the island of Dr. Moreau,"" referring to the H.

They expressed concern for his safety, saying he had been threatened to keep silent.""Right now he's a missing person,"" said Jay Salpeter, a private investigator and former New York City homicide detective who uncovered what Mr. Harris says was his link to the killings of Seymour Tankleff and his wife, Arlene, in Belle Terre.Mr. Salpeter has been reinvestigating the murders for the couple's son, Martin, who was imprisoned for the crimes but insists he is innocent and is appealing his convictions.Mr. Harris has acknowledged being in and out of jail and drug addiction treatment most of his life, but acquaintances say he normally keeps in touch.""I don't know where he is,"" said his mother-in-law, Susan Lampert, who takes care of his two children. ""He doesn't pick up the cellphone. It was very shocking he didn't call at Christmas."" She added, ""There was absolutely nothing.""Since Thanksgiving, Mr. Salpeter said, he has not been able to reach Mr. Harris at his apartment in the Selden area. Before this, the longest gap in contact was a week or two.'"
"'06-01-27,'1','In all, 586 temporary stands have opened inside the city's Fifth Ring Road, or beltway, to sell more than 600,000 boxes of fireworks for the holiday this weekend. Demand is so great, The Beijing News reported, as many as 1,000 stands were needed inside the Fifth Ring Road.Inside Mr. Dai's small shop, Yang Chunxiang, 42, picked out his holiday arsenal as his daughter, Mengke, 15, watched silently, if expectantly.""She was only a baby when it was forbidden,"" said Mr. Yang as he carried off three shopping bags of fireworks. ""At my age, I don't care, but my child is excited. Everyone is buying them, especially people with children.""The process of repealing the ban started last year and offers a small example of how city governments in China are increasingly soliciting public opinion on certain nonpolitical issues. Newspaper editorials as well as individuals had complained that the ban deprived ordinary people of an ancient Chinese tradition, which holds that lighting fireworks scares away evil spirits and heralds the New Year.Practically speaking, the ban was regarded as ineffective, since many people surreptitiously set off fireworks inside the city anyway. Out in the fast-growing suburbs, where restrictions on fireworks have varied, the cannonade of explosions has been so thunderous during recent Lunar New Year celebrations that it can seem like the People's Liberation Army is conducting war games.Last August, the legal committee of the Beijing People's Congress, the city's legislative body, convened a hearing in which 16 citizens were selected from people who had applied to speak on the fireworks issue.Opinions covered the gamut, with a doctor and a few others pointing out that several hundred people are killed or injured nationally each year by fireworks. Beijing's ancient buildings also present serious fire hazards, fireworks opponents argued.Supporters argued that the ban was already ineffective and that extra tax income from fireworks sales could help pay for fire, medical and cleaning expenses. But, most of all, advocates argued that the Lunar New Year, which is also called the Spring Festival, was incomplete without the bang of fireworks.""We think of Spain when seeing bulls, and Italy when hearing operas,"" said Wei Qi, according to a transcript of the hearing. ""Losing our culture is like losing our territory."" And, he added, the holiday was boring otherwise. ""People do nothing apart from eating dumplings and watching TV.""Last September, the People's Congress adopted new regulations that allow fireworks for restricted times during the holiday period, from Jan. 30 until Feb. 12. The laws prohibit fireworks near hospitals, kindergartens, historic buildings, bus stations and other locations. There also is a ban on tossing them from rooftops or balconies.And, the regulations helpfully note, ""When you set off fireworks, do not throw them at people.""Beijing's decision to allow fireworks came after more than 100 other cities, including Shanghai, had already repealed their bans. Legal fireworks went on sale last weekend, though, not surprisingly, illegal, unregulated fireworks had already appeared. State-controlled news media reported that 78 million illegal firecrackers were destroyed after a police raid last month.In the Meizha Hutong, one of the city's old neighborhoods not far from the Wangfujing shopping street, signs with the new fireworks regulations are taped inside apartment lobbies and on walls outdoors. As he entered his building, Li Xu, 26, said ""most people welcome the new regulations.""""Spring Festival started to lose its atmosphere without fireworks,"" Mr. Li said. ""I think the government is following the wishes of the people."" And, he added, ""I think it helps the economy.""Down the street at a small public park, Wang Chuncai, 66, worked out on the outdoor exercise machines. He said he thought allowing fireworks was appropriate and would please the younger generation. Even so, he said he intended to gauge the behavior of the revelers before venturing outside on Sunday.""Old people don't want it,"" he said. ""They just want peace.""Curious, Li Mingying had walked over to join the conversation. She lives in a ground-floor apartment in an old building that is to be razed after the holiday, one of the thousands of historic buildings in Beijing that are being bulldozed to make room for new development. ""I will worry about that later,"" she said.Her more immediate concern is surviving the holiday onslaught. She, too, lit fireworks as a child, but is now worried about all the noise and danger. Furthermore, she added, she can think of better ways to spend her money than on fireworks, which can cost about 10 yuan, or about $1.25, for a large package of firecrackers.""I used to like to watch them,"" Ms. Li said. ""Now, I'm old. I would rather spend the money on a pancake. It's only 1 yuan for a large pancake.""'"

"'06-01-28,'0','As the war of words escalated, Mr. Knight issued a biting statement: ""While Bill believes that the reasons for his termination were as he described, and it may be in his personal interest to portray it that way, I and the board decided that the company could be better managed with a proven, seasoned industry veteran who has a much greater understanding of our industry and credibility among employees, customers and consumers.""In a telephone interview from his home in Florida, Mr. Perez, 58, discussed his short tenure at Nike, his rocky relationship with Mr. Knight and the future of Nike. Following are excerpts:Q: Why were you ousted?A: It's simple. Phil didn't back off. He hired me to replace him and he never left. His level of interaction with employees was the same on my last day as the day before I got there.A: As Phil often says, he is not the greatest communicator. I would hear that he had a different position from mine -- not from him but from another person I talked to at Nike. That leads to confused employees and a very frustrated guy named the C.E.O.Q: You and Phil clashed over how senior executives should spend time. What was your position?A: Phil was more in the meeting mold. I like to get things done and move on to the next subject. People are spending a load of time in meetings -- and I think frustrating meetings, where decisions are not being made.Q: You pushed to sell Nike at lower prices in midtier stores, which upset some of your colleagues, who think it will cheapen the brand. What was your logic?A: The lower-price-point segment was the fastest-growing segment of the footwear market. Where you sell your products is all about the selling environment. Apple is for sale in Apple, Best Buy and Wal-Mart. If you can sell a brand as powerful and important in Wal-Mart points of distribution, you can sell any brand.Q: Your dismissal is blamed on a cultural gap. Can you give an example of this?A: I am a data man -- I like to know what the facts are. If you come from the world of packaged goods, where data is always valuable, Nike is very different. Judgment is very important. Feel is very important. You can't replace that with facts. But you can use data to guide you.Q: You still speak highly of Phil even after he forced you out. Why is that?A: I wanted him to be involved. He is the man. I wanted the man there. I wanted him to inspire and energize, not run the business. I didn't expect him to get involved to the extent he did.Q: Your severance package from Nike, totaling $14 million, has raised eyebrows given that it amounts to more than $1 million for every month you were C.E.O. Did you earn it?A: I am sure that many people would find the package excessive. Look at it from my perspective. I left a 34 1/2-year career, my wife [a teacher] left a 19-year career. We left friends, lived separately for six months while she finished the school year. And needless to say the year at Nike, while it had its ups, had many days of frustration accompanied by sleepless nights. I think the package was fair, and proof of that is that if Phil really wanted to step aside I would gladly trade the comp package for the job.Q: What do you think of your replacement, Mark Parker, who has spent 27 years at Nike?A: Parker is talented, but they are back to the old flying formation. They will be very influenced by Phil. If I was a Nike shareholder I would say, This sounds fine, but what happens after Phil Knight?'"
"'06-01-28,'0','JOHANNESBURG, Jan. 27 - Zimbabwe's security minister was quoted Friday in a government-controlled newspaper as saying that ""the net will soon close"" on those remaining journalists whose criticism of the government threatens the nation's security.The warning from the official, Didymus Mutasa, followed the arrest this month of employees and directors of Voice of the People, a news organization based in the capital, Harare, that had broadcast uncensored reports into Zimbabwe via a shortwave transmitter in Madagascar operated by the Dutch government.The police in Mutare, in eastern Zimbabwe, also seized a well-known journalist on Jan. 18 and held him for three days on charges of violating the state's media laws. The journalist, Sidney Saize, was released last Saturday, but prosecutors indicated that he would still face charges.Mr. Mutasa suggested that more arrests were coming, saying that some Zimbabwean journalists have worked for foreign news organizations under pseudonyms but that the government ""had since identified them from their closets.""The journalists were ""driven by the love for the United States dollars and British pounds, which they are paid by the foreign media houses to peddle lies,"" he was quoted as saying in a report in The Manica Post, a state-run newspaper in Mutare.'"
"'06-01-28,'0','Mr. Knight, in discussing the ouster, said that Nike was operating at 80 percent efficiency under Mr. Perez -- an awkward position to be in when its biggest rivals are ganging up on it. ""I did not see that getting any better,"" Mr. Knight said.While the famously competitive Mr. Knight made no mention of his rivals, John Shanley of the Susquehanna Financial Group said, ""There is no way they can overlook a threat this serious.""Adidas, the No. 2 footwear company, and Reebok, the No. 3 company, have proved to be nimble competitors. In China, for example, Adidas spent an estimated $80 million to secure the sponsorship of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing while Reebok has sewn up an endorsement, valued at $70 million, from Yao Ming, the Chinese basketball sensation.In Japan, the second-biggest market for sporting goods after the United States, Adidas has just overtaken Nike in sales, a coup that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.To be sure, Nike firmly dominates the athletic footwear business and is unlikely to lose its grip anytime soon. In the United States, where the sneaker market has remained flat for the last decade, it controls 36.3 percent of the market, compared with 21.1 percent for Adidas and Reebok combined, according to Sporting Goods Intelligence, a trade publication. But the gap is far narrower in the faster-growing international market, where Nike controls 30.9 percent of sales, compared with 28 percent for Adidas and Reebok combined. ""In every single region in the world, it is now a two-horse race between Nike and Adidas,"" said Jan Runau, a spokesman for Adidas.Analysts and executives agree that the biggest battle will unfold in China, the world's most populous country, where Nike, Reebok and Adidas are scrambling to nail down sponsorships, endorsements and store locations before the Olympics.Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., has sponsored 21 Chinese sports federations and has endorsements from top Chinese athletes, including Lui Xiang and Xing Huina. Both won gold medals during the Summer Games in Athens: Mr. Lui in the 110-meter men's hurdling competition and Ms. Xing in the 10,000-meter women's race.It has even built a sprawling outdoor sports center, called Nike Beijing Park, which has soccer fields and basketball courts used by 5,000 children a day.The company does not break out sales by country, but says it has been helped by the growth of a middle class in China that is willing to pay for $250 Limited Edition Zoom LeBron III sneakers; they sold out across the country in just two hours when introduced this year.But Adidas, based in Germany, has also made strong inroads in China. Besides sponsoring the 2008 Olympics, the company has sponsored the country's women's World Cup soccer team, its football federation and its volleyball team.During a recent conference call with investors, the chief executive of Adidas, Herbert Hainer, said, ""I am absolutely convinced that Asia and especially China will be the growing force in the next few years"" for both Adidas and Reebok, which is based in Canton, Mass.Nike has had less luck in Japan, a market that apparel and footwear companies covet because trend-setting Japanese consumers are highly influential across Asia. After dominating the footwear business there for years, Nike has begun to falter, missing trends and marketing opportunities, company executives said. Its chief financial officer, Don Blair, called Japan Nike's ""most significant and the most difficult"" market.That has opened the door for Adidas, which despite entering Japan only seven years ago now controls its footwear market. While Nike has struggled to excite finicky Japanese consumers, Adidas created a hit this year with the adiZero, a lightweight, thin-soled sneaker designed for Asian consumers.Adidas credits much of its success to the sponsorship of the Japanese national soccer team during the 2002 World Cup competition, which resulted in a 30 percent sales increase. ""Adidas has really stuck it to them"" in Japan, said John G. Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence.Nike has also experienced sluggish growth in France and England, where high unemployment and a weak economy are crimping consumer spending. Nike recently began pulling some products from chains like the footwear retailer Decathlon, saying the chain's tendency to deeply discount sneakers was hurting Nike's image as a premium product.""We are not going to chase bad business,"" said Charlie Denson, president of the Nike brand.Nike's challenges in established markets explains, in part, why it is so eager to break into an emerging market like India, where the population tops one billion. Mr. Denson called the company's business in India ""the least developed of the big emerging markets,"" which include Russia, Brazil and China.Nike's $44 million bid for the sponsorship of the Indian cricket team -- $16 million higher than the next biggest offer -- ""shows that we obviously felt very strongly about India,"" Mr. Denson said. Cricket, he added, ""is the sport of choice in India and inspires a passion that exceeds everything else by tenfold.""And so far, it is Reebok, not Nike, that dominates the footwear market in India. Shoes for cricket, as it happens, are a top seller. (The Nike cricket team endorsement will put a swoosh on every player's jersey, but under an existing endorsement deal, six players will slap a Reebok sticker on their wickets. No one company owns the rights to the shoes.)The big question is whether Reebok and Adidas can do more than just challenge and even beat Nike in a handful of countries, but perhaps overtake it in global sales. ""The reality is that even together, they lack the clout of Nike,"" said Stephen A. Greyser, a professor who teaches sports marketing at the Harvard Business School.Nike executives privately argue, with some hope, that the merger could prove a tough fit, distracting employees at Adidas and Reebok at a time when they are trying to establish themselves in crucial developing markets. Unlike Nike's purchase of Converse, for example -- a relatively small retro fashion label -- the combination of Reebok and Adidas brings together two enormous worldwide brands that compete for the same athletic audience.In an interview, Mr. Perez, the departing Nike chief executive, said Reebok and Adidas represented two very different cultures at corporations based in two different continents. ""This is going to be a tough acquisition for Adidas to pull off,"" he said. ""A lot of people may be underestimating the challenges associated with the merger.""'"
"'06-01-28,'0','Go ahead, indulge in feeble wordplay if you want -- ""Reality television goes to the dogs!"" -- but you'll be guilty of misleading punning. Because ""Underdogs,"" an installment of the PBS series ""Nature"" tomorrow night, is actually a vast improvement on most human-centered reality shows.This sweet, simple program follows Herbie and Holly, dogs with serious behavioral problems, as trainers take one last shot at making them bearable. Holly, a bloodhound, is ""a misfit with little hope of finding another home,"" Henry Winkler, the narrator, says in his voiceover; she has already had six in her one year of life. And Herbie, a 3-year-old bearded collie, has a problem with sheep: he attacks them, Mr. Winkler says, and ""he's been lucky to escape a farmer's bullet."" As pets, they're both failures.The dogs, the program explains, are victims of their own genes: bloodhounds are built for tracking, and bearded collies were herders of sheep before border collies became more popular for that task. Could their juvenile delinquency be a result of the stifling of their primal natures?""Underdogs"" finds out by pairing Holly with Larry Allen, an experienced bloodhound trainer in West Virginia, and Herbie with Barbara Sykes, a sheepdog trainer with a working farm in England. The program puts them on a clock, reality-television style: can the animals be reformed in 12 weeks?The genes may be there, but the trainers quickly discover complications with each dog. Holly, for instance, is inexplicably terrified of loud noises, a problem if she is going to be used for hunting or police work, because of the likelihood of gunfire.The contrasts between the two trainers make the program doubly interesting. Ms. Sykes is the more amusing: as previous tele-trainers have shown, there's nothing like a British accent to make doggie discipline fun. (""That's not good,"" she says when Herbie chomps down on a head-size ball early in his training. ""That tells me straight away how naughty he could be with sheep."")If this were a human reality-television show, the goings-on would be stretched out over a season, far too long to sustain interest, but here they are condensed into an appealing hour. For the trainers, the barometer of success is whether the dogs can be sent along to new, more productive lives. Without giving too much away, there is a parting at the program's end that is painfully beautiful to watch. It puts those made-for-TV farewells at the end of episodes of shows like ""Supernanny"" to shame.'"
"'06-01-28,'0','""The first thing we all have to do is become more aware,"" said Janet A. Jenkins, administrator of the division of trade and consumer protection for the state of Wisconsin.Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois, who has proposed a law to prevent what he calls ""consumer scamming,"" cites two studies to support the need for the legislation. In one, researchers at the Center for Urban Economic Development at the University of Illinois-Chicago and at the University of California, Berkeley, found that Wal-Marts in four states committed pricing errors in excess of federal recommendations.The study, commissioned by the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which has tried unsuccessfully to unionize Wal-Mart, found scanners rang up the wrong price for 6.4 percent of the items purchased for the survey in Illinois, Indiana and Michigan and for 8.3 percent of the items purchased in California. The errors were both higher and lower than the listed price.In another study, the Department of Consumer Services in Chicago found that at 78 percent of drugstores in the city, including three major chains, scanning errors occurred more than 2 percent of the time. The errors ranged from a nickel to $35.""I think it's negligence on the stores' part; I don't think they assign employees to put the wrong prices out,"" Mr. Quinn said. ""There's a lack of paying attention. It's not a high priority for the retailers.""Nate Hurst, a Wal-Mart spokesman, called the studies ""paid attacks by our union critics."" He noted that the studies themselves said the results should not be used to generalize about the price accuracy for Wal-Mart Stores nationwide. He said the company's last internal pricing audit revealed an error rate of 2.4 percent on a check of 15,791 items.Consumer Services surveyed scanner pricing accuracy in 1990, Mr. Quinn said, and found that 80 percent of the drugstores overcharged customers. It did another survey 12 years later, and the figure was still 80 percent.""Our view is every company and retail firm should have somebody who is responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the advertised prices,"" Mr. Quinn said.The proposed law in Illinois -- the Retail Consumer Protection Act of 2006 -- would establish fines of up to $5,000 for each price scanner incident and require every store to name one employee to verify that shelf prices and checkout prices are the same. If the mispriced item is under $3, the customer gets the item free. If the item is over $3, the customer pays the correct amount and gets $3 back -- in essence a $3 reward for being overcharged.The law, he said, is modeled after one in California, which has some of the most stringent regulations in the country when it comes to overcharging. On the federal level, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a nonregulatory agency responsible for weights and measures, along with the National Conference on Weights and Measures, a standards development organization made up of regulatory officials, business representatives, trade associations and consumer groups, created a handbook outlining inspection procedure for price verification. According to those guidelines, the retailer fails if more than 2 percent of the items tested ring up incorrectly.John Blair, a spokesman for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, noted that pricing errors were often made in favor of the consumer. A federal study in 1996 found an error rate of 4 percent when testing scanner devices, but more than half of those went in the consumer's favor. Another study two years later, found an error rate of 3 percent, with half of those benefiting the merchant.""Many times when we find inaccuracies they kind of even out,"" Ms. Jenkins said. ""But that doesn't help the consumer who was overcharged.""While some states, including Wisconsin, rely on the federal provisions when monitoring , some, like California, allow for no mistakes.San Diego County has even gone beyond what's required by the state, initiating fees paid by businesses that use price scanners to cover the cost of three full-time inspectors who check scanning equipment. Merchants can be fined $100 for an error of a dollar or less and there is a sliding scale for inaccuracies above that.Kathleen Thuner, San Diego County agricultural commissioner and sealer of weights and measures, said her battle against overcharging began in 1984 when, as a young mother (and as director of weights and measures for one year), she was charged for a six-pack of baby formula when buying only one can.Ms. Thuner said in 2005 she levied $60,400 in penalties for scanner violations not counting the larger cases handled by the county district attorney's office, which included a $540,000 settlement in November with the parent company of Sports Authority and SportMart. The company took immediate steps to correct the problems that resulted in the overcharges, the district attorney said.Ms. Thuner says her office relies heavily on consumers who alert her office when overpricing occurs.She said nearly 20 years of dealing with the issue has helped her to identify a few situations where consumers need to be particularly aware of the potential for overpricing:More mistakes are found during holidays like Christmas when sales volumes are at high levels.Many mistakes occur when sales promise a percentage taken off at the register.""Oftentimes, we have found the math is not done correctly in the computer,"" she said.While most of the concrete information available about overcharging involves scanner machines that can be readily checked, consumer advocates said the problem could be found in a variety of areas.""We've found -- and this is anecdotal -- that in some restaurants they'll charge you for something you didn't get, not charge you for something you did get or you might even get someone else's bill,"" said Linda Golodner, president of the National Consumers League.Consumers should be diligent about checking and be pushy if the price is not the one advertised , advocates say. Still, consumers often feel embarrassed or don'ttake the time to deal with mistakes, the advocates say, particularly if the mistakes are just a few cents.""I shop with my husband,"" Ms. Thuner said. ""He unloads and I check the scanner. When I used to shop with my daughter, I taught her to write down the actual price and check it with the receipt.""The more items a person buys, experts note, the less likely they are to remember the price.Ms. Golodner suggests shoppers take along advertisements with sale prices, jot down shelf prices or photograph them with camera cellphones and pay attention at the checkout stand to assure prices are ringing up correctly. She also suggests reviewing the register receipt before leaving the store and complaining at that time if necessary.""I know we don't want to hold up people behind us, but I think it's critical for consumers to insist on their rights at the point of sale,"" said Ms. Jenkins of Wisconsin's consumer affairs office. ""So many of us will go home and say, 'Ah, I'm not going to make this call for 12 cents.' We tend to put it aside. But, by dealing with it, even though we might temporarily annoy people in line behind us, we're actually helping them.""'"

"'06-01-28,'0','A spokesman for Guidant, Steve Tragash, said yesterday that the company had no comment on the latest document request. Guidant has said that it did nothing wrong and that it made all required reports about product problems to the F.D.A.Jeffrey N. Wasserstein, a lawyer in Washington specializing in health cases, said, ""I'd be a little worried."" The lawyers said neither was involved in the Guidant case.The latest disclosure comes amid a turbulent rush of news involving Guidant, the nation's second-biggest maker of heart devices after Medtronic, just days after it agreed to be acquired by Boston Scientific for $27 billion, or $80 a share.Yesterday, Guidant reported that its fourth-quarter earnings fell sharply from the year-earlier period, a result of heart defibrillator recalls and lost sales. On Thursday, Boston Scientific received an unusually strong warning from the F.D.A. about some of its procedures, which could result in the delayed approval of new products.In trading yesterday, Guidant shares fell $1.54, to close at $73.72. Boston Scientific fell $1.62, to $21.63. Because of considerations involving the value of Boston Scientific stock that underlie the Guidant plan, the deal's value has dropped somewhat.The newest Justice Department subpoena was sent to a plaintiff's lawyer, Robert Hilliard of Corpus Christi, who is representing two heart patients in a claim against Guidant. He provided a copy to The New York Times and said in a telephone interview that a federal investigator had asked him to retain all Guidant documents produced in the case.A spokeswoman from the United States attorney's office in Minneapolis did not return a telephone call yesterday seeking comment.The Justice Department's inquiry, which began in October, is focusing on Guidant's handling of safety issues related to defibrillators known as the Prizm 2 DR, the Contak Renewal and the Contak Renewal 2. Small numbers of the devices have short-circuited, a malfunction related to the use of insulating material known as polyimide that can deteriorate when exposed to moisture.In October, Guidant disclosed that it had received a federal subpoena, but it is not clear whether it received the latest document request.A defibrillator is a life-saving device intended to sense and electrically disrupt potentially fatal heart rhythms. A short circuit can render the device useless. At least seven patients are known to have died in incidents in which the devices shorted, though the number is probably higher because physicians only recently became aware of the problem.Guidant first became aware of polyimide-related failures in early 2002 in the Prizm 2 DR, but the company waited until May 2004 to notify doctors about the flaw, after it became aware that The New York Times was about to publish an article about the device.The Justice Department subpoena specifically mentions Guidant documents that relate to a more recent episode involving the Contak Renewal and Contak Renewal 2.The records were initially produced under seal in the Texas lawsuit but they were released this month by the case's presiding judge, Judge Jack Hunter of State District Court in Corpus Christi, who cited a Texas law barring the sealing of court records related to safety issues. The Times obtained the documents after it filed a motion seeking the release of all safety-related records in the case, and it published a recent article about them. Guidant has appealed Judge Hunter's decision.The records released by Judge Hunter indicated that in October 2004, more than two years after the Prizm 2 DR problem, Guidant confirmed that a small but growing number of Contak Renewals were also shorting out because of polyimide degradation.The documents include a hand-written annotated chronology related to the Contak Renewal that was apparently composed by the head of Guidant's cardiac unit, J. Frederick McCoy Jr. It suggested that Guidant executives debated in January 2005 whether to alert doctors to the Contak Renewal problem.At the time of the debate, one entry also states ""Informed Ron Dollens: Guido Neels of the development,"" an apparent reference to Guidant's chief executive and chief operating officer at the time; both men have since retired. Mr. Dollens declined, through a company spokesman, to comment. Mr. Neels, reached by telephone, also declined to comment.The released documents, hand-dated Oct. 20, 2004, apparently projected that existing inventories of Contak Renewals would run out in mid-November 2004. The company did not disclose the Contak Renewal problem until June 2005, after the F.D.A. had opened an inquiry.Guidant has previously said that it did not issue earlier alerts about the devices because the number of failures had been too small.Asked this month about the Texas documents, Guidant issued a statement about the records, stating that they showed that the company had, among other things, taken ""responsible action during an ongoing investigation"" of the devices and that it had ""aggressively evaluated product performance and communication thresholds.""Yesterday, Mr. Tragash, the company spokesman, declined to respond to more questions on the documents.Correction: February 1, 2006, Wednesday Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Saturday about a federal subpoena seeking information on Guidant heart devices misstated the date that the company told doctors about a defect in one product. It was May 2005, not 2004.'"

"'06-01-28,'0','An American freelance journalist, Jill Carroll, was kidnapped in Baghdad on Jan. 7. She appeared 10 days later in video that also was broadcast on Al Jazeera. In the video, her captors threatened to kill her in 72 hours if the American military did not release all Iraqi women from its jails. That deadline passed, and nothing more has been heard from her captors.On Jan. 18, two African engineers were seized in a gun battle in central Baghdad that left at least 10 of their Iraqi guards dead.""The German government condemns this cruel kidnapping in the strongest terms,"" Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Berlin, according to Reuters. She said the government was trying to secure the captives' release. ""The lives and the safety of our compatriots is of the highest priority,"" she said.Elsewhere in Iraq, a bomb exploded in an outdoor market in Basra, critically wounding five people, the Iraqi authorities reported.In Baghdad, two police intelligence officers were found dead in a luxury German sedan in the volatile western neighborhood of Ghaziliya. Also, two more bodies were found in the same area where corpses were discovered on Thursday in water filter pools in southeast Baghdad. The victims had been blindfolded and their bodies bore marks of torture, an Interior Ministry official said.Truckloads of police commandos fanned out on foot and in vehicles through the streets of southwest Baghdad, checking identifications and looking for insurgents and weapons. The Associated Press reported that about 60 people were taken into custody in several hours of raids.Sunni Arabs oppose the frequent roundups and arrests in their neighborhoods, saying they are unfairly singled out as targets of the raids by the predominantly Shiite police forces.

Georgian officials declined to discuss the price for the new supply or whether transit fees would be paid to Azerbaijan.Instead, they said it was a temporary agreement that diversified Georgia's sources of energy and would help end the crisis that began on Sunday when saboteurs destroyed gas pipelines and an electric power line that brought energy to the Caucasus nation. The anticipated Iranian supply of gas, two million cubic meters a day, would provide slightly less than half of Georgia's needs.""This is a deal that is suitable for Georgia,"" George Arveladze, chief of staff to President Mikheil Saakashvili, said by telephone from Tbilisi, Georgia's capital. ""Bringing in the alternative source is what matters most, and the deal is good.""The announcement of the agreement came as Russia's effort to repair the damaged pipeline into Georgia continued to suffer delays, and as a Web site representing Islamic insurgent groups posted a message that claimed to be from the rebels saying they were not involved.'"
"'06-01-29,'0','A similar story is playing out in Massachusetts, where a large offshore wind farm proposed for Nantucket Sound has attracted growing opposition, much of it from people who ordinarily favor development of renewable energy, like the Kennedy family. By all means develop wind energy, these opponents say, but do it somewhere else.The question then becomes, where?Could Long Island's wind project be built someplace less aesthetically objectionable -- say, the Babylon town landfill, or Plum Island, or someplace far enough out to sea to be invisible from shore?The first thing a wind energy project needs is wind, steady and moderately strong. The turbines provide no power in a calm, of course, or when winds exceed about 50 miles an hour, for safety reasons. They need average winds of at least 18 miles an hour to be productive enough to be worth building, LIPA officials say, and reach peak output at about 30 miles an hour.The winds on the Long Island Sound are too light and variable, they say, and many suggested sites on land do not make the meteorological cut, either, including most of Plum Island.Wind turbines also need a lot of room. The blades are almost 180 feet long and sweep around a central mechanism 260 feet above the ground or water. They must be placed far enough apart not to interfere with one another. Daniel Zaweski, the power authority's wind-turbine project manager, said that building the proposed 40-turbine project on land would require about 1,600 open, contiguous acres of land.No such site is available on the Island, he said, except in the protected core of the Long Island pine barrens, a state preserve.The spinning turbine blades are a potential hazard to anything in flight, so they must be kept away from the approaches to airports and from flyways of migratory birds.That factor has kept wind turbines off Plum Island before. According to Larry Orluskie, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which now controls the 740-acre island, the government considered placing several smaller wind turbines on the island in 1998 to help power the animal disease laboratory there. The plan was abandoned because of the threat to migratory birds.Mr. Orluskie said that any talk of a commercial-scale wind farm on Plum Island was premature and that it remained closed to the public and to any development other than the lab.The 212-foot-high Babylon town landfill, another alternative site some opponents mention, also appears to be ruled out. Vanessa Baird-Streeter, a spokeswoman for the town, said that the Federal Aviation Administration found the landfill to be too close to Republic Airport for tall structures like the turbines to be built there.Getting the wind power to customers is another issue, with distance an important factor in the cost. Mr. Zaweski of the power authority said that dozens of miles of major transmission line upgrades would be needed to connect turbines on, say, Plum Island or Gardiners Island with Long Island's power grid.Attaching wind turbines to existing tall structures on the Island, like cellular phone towers or the Jones Beach tower, would also run afoul of engineering or aesthetic constraints, engineers and utility executives said.That leaves the waters off the South Shore as the only practical place to put the turbines, power authority officials say.Under the LIPA-FPL proposal, the nearest turbine to shore would be 3.6 miles out in the ocean, visible from the beach in much of Nassau and western Suffolk. Each turbine tower would rest on a single piling about 18 feet in diameter, sunk between 70 and 120 feet into the ocean floor. A nine-mile transmission line would connect the wind farm to a substation in the Amityville-Massapequa area.Moving the turbines farther offshore would diminish their visual impact and give them even better wind conditions. But Mr. Zaweski said that it would also put them in major shipping lanes, where they are not allowed for safety reasons, or in water deeper than 100 feet, where the cost to build them and connect them to shore would be prohibitively high.Still, project opponents said the power authority was rushing ahead with the project, which would be the nation's first offshore wind farm, even as new technology that would make it economically feasible to place the turbines out of sight of land was advancing.FPL, which is completing its design for the project, would build the turbines and sell their output, up to about 3.6 megawatts per turbine in ideal weather, to the power authority under a 20-year contract. The average output of 140 megawatts would be enough to power about 44,000 homes.The power authority and FPL hope to complete construction in 2008; the cost has yet to be determined, but is sure to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.A federal law enacted in August shifted responsibility for licensing offshore wind turbines to the Minerals Management Service, an agency of the Interior Department, from the Army Corps of Engineers. The agency also reviews applications for offshore oil platforms.Though the agency is expected to speed up the approval process, it is still devising guidelines for evaluating wind turbine projects, including the LIPA-FPL project and the other major proposal before it, the 130-turbine complex planned for a 24-square-mile area of Nantucket Sound and known as Cape Wind.LIPA said its project would also require state permits.In Massachusetts, Senator Edward M. Kennedy; his nephew Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is an environmental lawyer and professor at Pace University Law School; and many Cape Cod residents have spoken out against Cape Wind.The younger Mr. Kennedy has said that private energy companies should no more put wind turbines in Nantucket Sound than in Yosemite National Park. Mr. Kennedy said he had no position on wind turbines off Jones Beach.Opponents of the Long Island project say the same logic Mr. Kennedy applied to Cape Wind should apply to Jones Beach. They argue that the cost would be too high and the power yield too small to justify the visual desecration of a national treasure.They also say the computer images LIPA and FPL have displayed understate how large the turbines will loom in the view from shore.Philip Healey of Massapequa, a co-chairman of Save Jones Beach, said LIPA was ""playing on the fact that people don't really understand distance over the open water."" Though the turbines would be more than three miles out, ""the horizon is 11 to 12 miles,"" he said. ""People think three miles is far away, but over the open ocean, it's right in front of you.""Still, the project has broad support among environmental groups, and adamant backing from LIPA's chairman, Richard M. Kessel.Mr. Kessel, who lives in Merrick, said he believed there was strong public support, even on the South Shore, for a project that would begin to wean Long Island off fossil fuels.""We have got to start somewhere,"" Mr. Kessel said. ""And if we can't put these up, it signals we are going to continue to be captives to the oil barons. I understand that there is an aesthetic issue, but there are pros and cons to whatever we do.""Opponents of the turbines said it was inconsistent for environmental groups to oppose the Broadwater Energy plan for a $700 million floating natural gas plant in the Long Island Sound but support the wind turbines.""They don't want to industrialize the sound, but they're in favor of industrializing the ocean,"" said Richard Schary of North Bellmore, who is opposed to the turbines. ""And if they were trying to pick the worst place on Long Island to site these things, they've done it. You are ruining Jones Beach and it's known all over the world, it's our most famous landmark.""Wendy Gibson, a spokeswoman for the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, which operates Jones Beach, said in an e-mail message that the state would ""certainly assess the potential impact"" of the project on the beach, which was added last year to the National Register of Historic Places. But she said that her office supported development of renewable energy and had not joined in objections to the plan.Adrienne Esposito, the executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment in Farmingdale, rejected the comparison between the Broadwater project and the wind turbines.""One blows up, one doesn't,"" she said. ""One is a terrorist risk, and the other isn't. One gives us clean, safe, domestically produced energy, the other gives us dirty, dangerous foreign energy once again.""The wind project faces opposition on other grounds besides the view from the beach. Wally D'Amato, the president of the Nassau Shores Association in Massapequa and an opponent of the turbines, questioned whether they were a wise energy investment given their cost.""They don't make sense,"" Mr. D'Amato said. ""If anything, we have to get started with the solar again.""But Gordian Raacke, the executive director of Renewable Energy Long Island, a Bridgehampton advocacy group, said solar energy, while promising, held little immediate prospect of matching wind power on a large scale.""Solar panels are great,"" he said, adding that his home was one of about 600 on the Island equipped with solar installations. ""But given their relatively high cost, we won't see 44,000 homes equipped with solar panels by 2008.""Mr. Raacke noted that use of wind energy was growing rapidly around the world, and that several European nations had made great strides in using it. Denmark gets almost one-fifth of its national electricity supply from wind, and turbines have become a common sight in Mr. Raacke's native Germany, which produces more than 16,000 megawatts of wind power, one-third of the world total.Opponents warn that the 40-turbine LIPA-FPL project may be just the first of many that would eventually line the whole South Shore. ""This could be the beginning of the end for our shoreline,"" said Mr. Schary of North Bellmore.But Mr. Kessel said LIPA had no plans now for more turbines. ""That's for a future LIPA to look at,"" he said.'"
"'06-01-29,'0','TORONTO - Paul Martin, the prime minister of Canada, ran an attack ad during his unsuccessful campaign that said: ""A Harper victory will put a smile on George W. Bush's face. Well, at least someone will be happy, eh?""Well, Mr. Bush probably did smile. Stephen Harper -- the Conservative Party leader, free-enterprise economist, skeptic of the Kyoto climate change protocol and supporter of the American-led invasion of Iraq -- won the national elections on Monday. This might be the first time an American administration took serious notice of a Canadian election since 1988, when Brian Mulroney, a Progressive Conservative, campaigned in support of free trade with the United States and won.But how much of a difference will the change in government make to the United States? Probably, not a whole lot.Liberal Americans will still be able to point to Canada's liberal social programs. With only 124 seats out of 308 in the House of Commons, Mr. Harper won't be able to end same-sex marriage or national health insurance, even if he wanted to.Mr. Harper has already promised not to send troops to Iraq, and the basic bilateral trade and immigration arrangements will probably not change much either, although the Bush administration may help Mr. Harper by working to reduce United States tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber, which would also make building a home south of the border a bit cheaper. Mr. Harper can also be expected to boost border patrols and intelligence sharing with Washington.'"
"'06-01-29,'0','It's been nearly two years since the United States lifted restrictions on travel to Libya, and a host of tour operators are now offering trips to the formerly off-limits North African nation. But actually getting into the country is another matter.Libya doesn't have an embassy or consulate in the United States, so many tour operators help clients obtain visas through the Libyan People's Bureau in Ottawa, Canada. But in recent months, a number of travel agents and tour operators say Libya, which remains on Washington's list of states that sponsor international terrorism, stopped issuing visas to American tourists altogether. And some Americans have been blocked at the border, according to the State Department.""It used to take two to three weeks,"" said Barbara Banks, the marketing director at Wilderness Travel in Berkeley, Calif., which was forced to cancel December and February trips to Libya because it couldn't obtain visas. ""In December, even though we followed the process, visas weren't being issued. Ottawa said we needed a letter of invitation. We'd say, 'But you've got it, and here's another copy, and another.' But they just wouldn't issue them.""Similarly, Travcoa, a high-end tour operator offering a 13-day excursion to the region, had to cancel its December, January and February trips because the Ottawa office would not issue visas to its clients. Abercrombie & Kent also said it has been waiting since mid-December for visas for a tour stopping in Libya in March.Despite these complaints, the Libyan People's Bureau in Ottawa said it continued to issue visas to Americans so long as they had a letter of invitation from an accredited tour company in Libya. Ali Aujali, chief of the Libyan Liaison Office in Washington, said he could not explain why some American tourists had not received visas but had plans to meet with some U.S. tour operators to discuss the problem. ""I'm very optimistic all these issues will be resolved the best way they can,"" he said. Libyan citizens have been having problems getting into the United States, Mr. Aujali added. ""This is not reciprocity, but there are some difficulties,"" he said. ""We've been away from each other for a long time. There are some obstacles to smooth.""Despite the setbacks, many travelers continue to sign up for excursions to Libya's substantial collection of Greek and Roman ruins, like Leptis Magna, above; its vast desert landscape; and the miles of Mediterranean oceanfront. Demand is particularly high for March because of a total solar eclipse on March 29, which will cast a shadow directly over Libya.'"
"'06-01-29,'0','If previews are to be believed, President Bush will devote a significant portion of his State of the Union address this Tuesday -- the sixth of his presidency -- to the issue of health care in America, pushing for modest, market-driven solutions like targeted tax breaks and expanded health savings accounts. This is not the most comfortable terrain for a Republican president. For the last decade, Republicans have overtaken Democrats at the federal and state levels and nearly pulled even in voter registration, wiping away some 60 years of minority status in the space of several elections. And yet, despite all that, polls have consistently shown that Americans still trust Democrats more on the domestic issues that were the basis of the New Deal and the Great Society.Nothing better illustrates why than Bush's plan to provide prescription drugs under Medicare, which the federal government is now clumsily inflicting on the states. Somehow, in trying to solve a pressing crisis, the Republicans who designed the new program in 2003 managed a spectacular feat of alchemy: they created a benefit that perfectly embodies the worst aspects of both dominant ideologies of the 20th century, combining an expensive and impenetrable government bureaucracy with an unseemly concern for corporate profits. Even Republican lawmakers and governors are now professing fears that the program has become an unsalvageable fiasco, with senior citizens panicking over a panoply of complex and confusing choices. All of which suggests, perhaps, that it is far easier to rail against government's rampant inefficiency, as Republicans have skillfully done for decades, than it is to devise creative solutions of one's own.When it comes to health care, however, Bush's true failing, to this point, is not the poorly conceived prescription drug plan; it is a more general absence of ambition. In a climate of cresting urgency on health care, Bush has been handed a rare opportunity to achieve something truly transformational. Between the time that the Clintons submitted their ill-fated health-care plan in 1993 and Bush's re-election to the presidency in 2004, the overall cost of health care in America doubled and the number of uninsured Americans continued to rise; business leaders who in the 1990's had been merely concerned about rising medical expenses now see them as the single greatest threat to American competitiveness. It is increasingly obvious, at least to all those who do not inhabit the extreme reaches of the ideological spectrum, that the employer-based health-care system that functioned so well during the last century is impractical, if not unworkable, in a global marketplace. Unlike Bill Clinton's, Bush's stature in the business community is such that he could have enticed distrustful C.E.O.'s to form a partnership with the government on a search for what comes next. And, unlike Clinton, Bush had the benefit of a sympathetic Congress and -- for most of his presidency, at least -- a healthy store of political capital.You can only imagine what Bush's predecessors might have done with this emerging consensus. There are nonideological, creative ideas that might have been explored or tested. John Kitzhaber, the former Democratic governor of Oregon and a doctor himself, recently proposed that his state take the radical step of casting aside both Medicare and Medicaid and asking the federal government to give the state a block grant instead, which would then be used to subsidize a basic health-care plan available to every resident. Others, like Mitt Romney, the Republican governor of Massachusetts, and the New America Foundation have adopted versions of an ""individual mandate"" plan that would essentially force state residents to buy private insurance plans that would, in turn, be subsidized by the state, possibly by eliminating the tax breaks that now flow to companies who insure their workers. Both of these approaches could have the ultimate effect of disentangling employers from health care, transferring both government dollars and the responsibility for making choices to the consumer.The president, though, continues to focus on modest initiatives that don't begin to address the structural deficiencies in the system. The health savings accounts that are the centerpiece of his reform agenda, for instance, will help some families afford their doctors' bills -- but that's assuming they already have enough money to both buy a plan and save extra money in the first place. That Bush embraces such proposals, at the expense of more lasting reform, fits the larger pattern of his presidency, and it says more about his overarching governing philosophy than it does about his commitment to health care in particular. Unlike most of his Democratic detractors, Bush has shown the vision to rethink time-honored orthodoxy, even at his own political peril; no matter what his critics may say, it took no small amount of courage to ask if Social Security could be stronger than it is or if the tax code could be simpler and less punitive. He recognizes that government should be more flexible and more consumer-oriented. But in every specific case, it seems, Bush has quickly settled on solutions that aim to dismantle government rather than to improve it and that leave the average family more insecure rather than more enabled. In Bush's version of the ""ownership society,"" those who already own nice homes and stock portfolios get to make more choices about their health care and retirement, while everyone else gets to take his chances.The tragedy of this approach is that it discredits the very idea of modernizing government, driving Bush's liberal critics deep into their own bunker of ideological orthodoxy. The president's address comes just a few weeks after Maryland became the first state to force Wal-Mart to set aside a certain percentage of its payroll for health care. It makes perfect sense for unions to agitate for such measures; millions of American workers are uninsured, and right now, employers are the only ones who can reasonably be expected to fill the gap. But laws like these will not return us to a time when the private sector could be expected to provide lifelong security for American workers. It will take dynamic leadership to usher us into a century in which employees do not have to depend on their bosses for the ability to see a doctor and in which businesses will not be forced to buckle under the soaring costs of what should be an American birthright. It is possible that the president intends to show such leadership when he comes before the nation. In Bush's Washington, however, the possible and the actual grow ever more estranged.'"

Ask him about his childhood and he talks about the movie, ""A Bronx Tale,"" in which Robert De Niro plays an Italian-American bus driver trying to keep his son out of trouble. Minaya played baseball in Italy and knows Europe. His wife, Rachel, is American and does not speak Spanish. It would be foolish to pigeonhole Minaya.But it is a decided advantage to have a bilingual general manager like Minaya these days, when a quarter of major leaguers come from overseas. The United States has no lock on the first World Baseball Classic, for 16 teams in March.Latin America is a huge source of talent. Children there play baseball on their own -- imagine that -- and hang around the gates of baseball academies, trying to get inside. What general manager would not want to tap that hunger?Too many generations of players of color never got to the major leagues. While nondescript white guys kept getting managing jobs, Jim Gilliam, John Roseboro and Vic Power died without ever managing in the majors, and Felipe Alou couldn't get a managing job until he was 57.Ozzie Guillen, who just won the World Series with the White Sox, is a piece of work in any language. A generation ago, he would have been an untouchable. That motor mouth?We've come a long way to have a general manager out of the Corona section of Queens.The Wilpon family empowered Minaya to visit Martínez in the Dominican Republic after the 2004 season. Martínez had a reputation -- in Boston -- as a disruptive force, an egomaniac, but Minaya had reason to think he would pitch hard and set an example in Queens, which is exactly what Martínez did.I don't worry about Minaya's eye for talent and temperament. We'll find out if he was wrong about Seo, but he did the right thing in getting Benson out of town. I've met some bright and outspoken baseball wives, like Arlene Howard, who raised racial issues that her husband, Elston, could not afford to bring up when he broke in as a catcher with the Yankees in the 1950's. Anna Benson is no Arlene Howard.She went on Howard Stern and talked dirty, which is what passes for independence these days. She became known for her racy talk as well as the low-cut dress she wore to the Mets' Christmas party. A model who does not know how to dress around children is going to be a liability to an organization that likes to think of itself as a family operation.When the Mets obtained Delgado, Anna Benson could not resist speculating that fans might boo him because he had criticized United States policies in Iraq. I also caught her on a television talk show saying female reporters should not be allowed in men's locker rooms because they just wanted to peek at the players.This was not a liberated woman but somebody with a low opinion of women, including the professionals I see on the sports beat.Her husband could have told her that players can avoid modesty problems with a towel or a robe, but it sounded as if he had never told her the facts of life. Omar Minaya traded them? Good riddance.Anybody can feel free to question Minaya's judgment in not bringing back two useful players, Roberto Hernandez and Miguel Cairo, for this season.But he did bring in Paul Lo Duca, with roots in Brooklyn, and Billy Wagner, from the southwest corner of Virginia. Last time I listened, neither of these dudes was speaking Spanish.'"

"'06-01-29,'0','The first time the Meran Variation of the Slav Defense was used, by Akiba Rubinstein against Ernst Grünfeld, two of the foremost theoreticians of the day, in the Meran Tournament of 1924, Rubinstein showed its great promise. Alexander Alekhine, who loved the kind of boisterous attacking positions that White could get, reveled in its possibilities. Rubinstein, one of the strongest players who never got to vie for the world championship, was its chief supporter. He was noted for his remarkable skill with black formations, handling them sharply and aggressively. The Meran was made for him.No one doubted that the objectives of this variation were praiseworthy: to open the central position by exchanges for the sake of mounting thrusts against the enemy. If that could be realized safely, it might kill off the Queen's Gambit as a powerful weapon. But the key term here is ""open."" What's open for the goose is sauce for the gander. And since White is quicker to mobilize in the opening, Black must play with tactical precision to ward off the slings and arrows of the outraged attacker.So the Meran Variation is not the strategic weapon that it first appears to be, but the introduction to a demanding series of tactical blows. When it succeeds, it looks like the ideal counterweapon, but there are days when White looks more like Alekhine than Black resembles Rubinstein. That is what happened in the game between Alexey Dreyev and Evgeny Bareyev in the first round of the Championship of Russia Superfinal in Moscow.Maybe Bareyev hoped to find Dreyev a little off his game, but not so. Dreyev was prepared with the latest white fighting method against this belligerent counter and showed clearly what Black has to look out for. A sharp attack.The Slav Defense begins with 2 c6, a bolstering of the black center. Its initial appearance is stodgy and looks even more so after 3 Nc3 Nf6 4 e3 e6.

"'06-01-29,'0','MEN and women may be from different planets, but do the differences show up in how they manage mutual funds? A new study says that they do, though you may not know it from a quick comparison of the returns of the funds they manage.The study, ""Sex Matters: Gender and Mutual Funds,"" was conducted by Stefan Ruenzi, an assistant finance professor at the University of Cologne in Germany, and one of his Ph.D. students, Alexandra Niessen. A version is at http://www.cfr-cologne.de/downloads/workingpaper/cfr-06-01.pdf.Before their study, very little research attention had been paid to gender's role in mutual funds. That is surprising, because behavioral differences between men and women have been studied extensively in other parts of the financial services industry. Psychologists have found, for example, that among individual traders, men tend to make riskier bets than women. For the new study, the researchers looked at all actively managed domestic equity mutual funds in the United States over the 10 years through 2003. They eliminated from their database any funds that were managed by teams. Instead, they focused exclusively on funds managed by one man or one woman; about 11 percent of those were run by women.Just as the previous research had shown for individual traders, the study found that male fund managers took more aggressive bets. The men, for example, were more likely to invest in stocks that had little in common with the other stocks they already owned. And they were more likely over time to change the dominant investment style of their funds, a phenomenon called style drift.In other words, a man tends to be less predictable as a fund manager. As a result, the researchers say, ""investors preferring moderate and stable investment styles should invest in female-managed funds, while more daring investors interested in funds that take more active bets should choose male-managed funds.""'"
"'06-01-29,'0','Indeed, Mr. Uys, the expatriate, can often sound like a man in the full bloom of a head-over-heels romance with New York -- in contrast to the old-married-grouchiness that passes for affection among most residents.Mr. Uys's apartment does not feel like a homage to his adopted home. If anything, it's a box of madeleines for his African boyhood.Interspersed among his chic modern furnishings are a Somali ceremonial mask, a pair of eight-foot wood giraffes, several majestic figural sculptures and the requisite kiss-me-I'm-African zebra-skin rug. He also has a pair of etchings of African landscapes, tiny, dusky images that look like snapshots of remembered dreams. None of this was brought over from his Johannesburg home; he has acquired every item since moving here.For Mr. Uys, this apartment is not just a place to retreat into nostalgia. He is a restaurateur, after all, and entertains frequently. ""I love having people around me,"" he said. ""It makes me happy.""So the primitive/modern décor gives way here and there to stagy, theatrical touches, like a pair of giant topiaries and a glossy black baby-grand piano that is often played at parties but never by Mr. Uys; he doesn't know how.All of this, and two bedrooms, too, fit together very snugly in just over 1,000 square feet, which he rents for $2,500 a month. For an additional $120, Mr. Uys also rents a storage space nearby, where he keeps the supplies for his dinner parties: napkins, vases, flatware. ""I can walk over there and come back with everything I need to do a safari-style service with wooden chargers and giraffe-shape napkin holders, or silver service with silver chargers and Waterford crystal,"" Mr. Uys said.Is it surprising to find an entrepreneur living in a rental apartment during the biggest real estate boom in history? Mr. Uys shrugged. ""It has always been more important to me to use whatever capital was at my disposal to start a business that would generate more capital,"" he said. Or, anyway, that's the rational explanation.In truth, he lives here because he made a snap decision in a panic one afternoon, and it became an enduring condition of his life. ""On the day I had to move out of another apartment where I was staying, I didn't have a place to go,"" he said. A friend noticed a listing in the paper and called the landlord; Mr. Uys moved in that afternoon.That was in 1999, when the financial district still went dark at night. The neighborhood's deserted streets didn't spook Mr. Uys. Compared with the lawless Johannesburg he knew as a child, New York seemed fundamentally safe -- and it continued to even after 9/11, whose horrors he witnessed at close range from his living room window. These days, the neighborhood is ""festive and phenomenal, especially in summertime,"" Mr. Uys said.""I love living here; if you offered me a nice one-bedroom in the West Village in exchange, I wouldn't take it,"" he said.Over the years, Mr. Uys has invested in some modest renovations. He rewired the lighting and buried sound-system cables in the walls. He stripped the paint from wooden pilasters framing the windows. And, most impractically, he tore out the apartment's only coat closet, depriving himself of a feature most hosts find indispensable for dinner parties. In its place is a doorless nook that now houses an enormous 800-year-old granite statue with a wry, peaceful smile, whom he calls Susie. ""I don't know why,"" he said of the name.Susie is from China, not Africa. But she has one important thing in common with all of Mr. Uys's art: she captivated him the moment he saw her. ""I immediately fell in love,"" he said. ""To me, art is something you buy because you look at it and it does something to your soul, not because you think it's an investment whose value will increase.""""I'm a caretaker,"" Mr. Uys added. ""I want people who come to my house to feel loved. When they walk in and see Susie, it's as if someone has said: 'Welcome. There is peace in this house.' "" Which is just what the big stone towers of New York said to Mr. Uys when he came to this town not so long ago.'"

She moved out of the apartment in the late 1990's, after her health declined, and her family briefly put the apartment up for sale in 2000, according to the book, but then took it off the market. At that time, its worth was estimated at $18 million.Ms. Haupt's relatives have now decided to price the apartment above a neighboring penthouse that sold in June 2004 for $25 million. That apartment, a triplex, was bought by George David, the chief executive of United Technologies. Mr. Gross said that Mr. David's apartment had been gutted on two occasions by previous owners and so lacked the original detail of the Haupt apartment.""By 740 Park standards, this a teensy little apartment,"" Mr. Gross said. ""But by your standards or mine, it's probably the single best two-bedroom apartment in New York.""LAST Halloween, Tone N. Grant, the former chief executive of Refco, the scandal-plagued brokerage firm, transferred ownership of Apartment 3B at the Parc Vendome, at 353 West 56th Street, to a woman named Jody Watkins, the owner of Apartment 3A, next door. A deed filed with the city calls the transfer ""a gift"" and says that Ms. Watkins will own the apartment jointly with a trust created in her name.A day later, in Chicago, public records indicate that Mr. Grant transferred the ownership of a condo at 680 Lake Shore Drive to a trust in the name of his wife, Kathi S. Grant. The apartment previously was listed as being owned jointly by Mr. and Mrs. Grant. The new deed names each of them as a ""conservator"" of the trust.While both transactions may seem innocuous, they might be of interest to lawyers for Thomas H. Lee Partners, a private equity firm in Boston that has sued Mr. Grant and other former Refco executives in an attempt to recover hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr. Grant's real estate moves came less than two weeks after his name surfaced in news reports about the implosion of Refco, which filed the fourth-largest bankruptcy case in American history on Oct. 17 .The reports revealed that insiders had taken more than $1 billion in cash out of the company in the year before it went public in a stock offering last August. A large chunk of that money reportedly went to Mr. Grant, who shared in a $550 million cash payment after Thomas H. Lee bought a stake in the firm in August 2004. As part of that deal, according to the Thomas H. Lee lawsuit, Mr. Grant ""agreed to personally guarantee"" the company against losses that might arise as a result of false or inaccurate financial statements. That would seem to apply to the scandal that attended Refco's collapse.And that is where Mr. Grant's assets, including his real estate, might be expected to draw some scrutiny. City records in New York show that Mr. Grant paid $470,000 for the one-bedroom apartment at the Parc Vendome in July 2003. He bought the apartment with a mortgage, but he paid off the loan in September 2004, a month after the Thomas H. Lee deal, according to public records.So why did he give the apartment away? Mr. Grant did not respond to a message left at his home in Evanston, Ill. Ms. Watkins, reached at home at the Parc Vendome, refused to discuss the deal or her connection to Mr. Grant. Mr. Grant's lawyer, Michael Hannafan, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.But at the very least, it would appear that Mr. Grant and Ms. Watkins had known each other before he bought the apartment. Howard Schwartz, a lawyer who represented the family who sold the apartment to Mr. Grant in 2003, said he was told at the time that Ms. Watkins had brought Mr. Grant into the deal. City records show that Ms. Watkins has owned Apartment 3A since 1993.George Sard, a spokesman for Thomas H. Lee, said in an e-mail message that the company was ""suing Tone Grant under the indemnification he signed -- and the firm will pursue all of his assets to obtain the maximum possible recovery for our investors.""JOE ROTH, the movie director who was formerly chairman of Walt Disney Studios, paid $13 million for a penthouse at One Beacon Court on Dec. 15, according to a deed filed with the city.The 3,779-square-foot top-floor apartment has four bedrooms and four-and-a-half baths, with 13-foot ceilings and views to the north, south and east, according to the online listing posted by Robert Browne and Maria Pashby, brokers at the Corcoran Group.The seller, an overseas investor, went into contract for the apartment in July 2004 and paid $9.45 million when he bought it from the developer, Vornado Realty Trust, in August. Mr. Roth was represented by Deborah Grubman, also at Corcoran. The brokers said they were not permitted to discuss the deal.Mr. Roth directed the film ""Freedomland,"" which opens next month.'"
"'06-01-29,'0','How many volunteers? Mr. Dong referred the question to the academy's publicity office. A spokeswoman there declined to answer. So it could be two people? she was asked. ""I hope not,"" she answered. For years, accusations of cronyism and bad taste plagued the selection of Oscar documentaries -- in the 1990's, films that were denied nominations included the epic basketball documentary ""Hoop Dreams""; ""Crumb,"" the portrait of the maverick cartoonist R. Crumb; the true-crime documentary ""Brother's Keeper""; Michael Moore's debut, ""Roger & Me""; and ""The Thin Blue Line,"" in which Errol Morris (who finally won for his 2003 documentary ""The Fog of War"") dismantled the case against a man on death row in Texas.Moreover, films with Holocaust or other Jewish themes were seen to have a lock on the category: Between 1995 and 2000, the winners included ""Anne Frank Remembered,"" three other Holocaust films -- ""The Long Way Home,"" ""The Last Days"" and ""Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport"" -- and ""One Day in September,"" about the 1972 Munich Olympics murders. ""There are not many sure things in life, but that was a sure thing,"" Spike Lee said in 1998, when his ""4 Little Girls"" -- about the 1963 Birmingham church bombing -- lost to ""The Long Way Home.""What Mr. Morris once referred to as the ""Mother Teresa school of filmmaking"" -- the perception that if a film's subject is exemplary, the film must be, too -- has always held sway at the academy. So has the voters' penchant for movies about the mentally or physically disabled. This year seems no different: both ""Unknown White Male,"" about a man who loses his memory, and ""Murderball,"" a forceful movie about wheelchair-bound rugby players, are on the shortlist. So is ""39 Pounds of Love,"" about the painfully wizened Ami Ankilewitz, a victim of spinal muscular atrophy, who seeks to travel across the United States. It is said to be his long-held dream, but there is nothing in the film that does not feel stage-managed.However the documentary nominations are ultimately decided, some films -- as usual -- were out of the running before the shortlist voting even began. Others were considered certainties, including ""After Innocence"" by Jessica Sanders, whose mother Freida Lee Mock, is the head of the documentary branch. Mr. Dong said Ms. Mock had recused herself from the voting, just as she did when her own 1994 film, ""Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision,"" won the Oscar.There's an inherent conflict between how the academy determines eligibility and how most documentary filmmakers make money. Because European television has government money and spends it on films that tackle controversial subjects, American documentarians often look there for financing, in exchange for the chance to show the film on the air.To be considered for an Oscar, however, a documentary must have made its debut in theaters and played for at least a week in New York or Los Angeles, and films that appeared only on television -- or even those that appeared on television before moving to theaters -- are disqualified.Some -- the BBC in Britain, HBO in the United States -- have been willing to delay broadcast to preserve a film's Oscar eligibility. But that doesn't mean that they are happy about the rules.""I do not think it should matter whether films have been broadcast on TV outside the U.S.,"" said Nick Fraser, editor of the BBC's ""Storyville"" series. Agnès Varda's meditation on aging and eating, ""The Gleaners and I,"" was cited as one of the best films of 2000 by many of the major American critics' groups, but it was ineligible for an Oscar because it had been broadcast in Italy and France before opening in the United States. And last year, ""Control Room,"" in which Jehane Noujaim examined American and Arab news coverage in the opening stages of the Iraq War, was similarly shut out, even though it was shelved by its producers for six months before being shown on European television; in the interim the required blackout period had been extended to nine months.That rule has since been eliminated. But it doesn't help Eugene Jarecki.The director of ""Why We Fight,"" which opened on Jan. 20, Mr. Jarecki has produced an ambitious treatise on the American military-industrial complex, the philosophy of perpetual war and the prescience of Dwight D. Eisenhower. It won him the prize for best documentary at the Sundance Film Festival last January -- just as the documentary branch announced another set of rule changes.Ms. Mock said in an academy press release that ""films with a true theatrical rollout would be 'exempt' -- in quotes -- from the television blackout provision,"" said Mr. Jarecki, whose previous documentary was ""The Trials of Henry Kissinger."" Mr. Jarecki's legal counsel, John Sloss; members of the Sundance Institute; and executives at the BBC concluded that the academy had at last recognized that a television debut is sometimes a financial necessity for documentaries. Mr. Jarecki allowed ""Why We Fight"" to be shown on British television.But according to the academy, Mr. Fraser said, the film violated the broadcast ban. ""We were informed that these clauses had been dropped,"" he said. ""Had we known that the rules had retained some obligation to show first in a cinema in America, we would have rescheduled our screening.""Mr. Dong said the rule banning broadcast before theatrical release applies to all Oscar contenders, not just documentaries. But he conceded that some of the documentary branch rules are about survival -- at one point the academy's board of governors wanted to eliminate the short-documentary category altogether and banish documentary features to the science and technical awards, which are presented in a separate ceremony.""I think the academy, with the best of intentions,"" Mr. Jarecki said, ""sought to make the rules evolve in a way that recognized the realities facing the financing of certain documentary films, to make it more relevant whether a film had a theatrical life in America than what its television pedigree was. That was clearly the direction they were moving in.""'"
"'06-01-29,'0','He walks back, grabs the pool cue out of the punk's hands, says, ""My turn to break."" He snaps the pool cue in half over his knee. ""Now then. You said something to me?""""I didn't say anything!"" the punk exclaims, glassy eyes huge.Win tosses the broken halves of the pool cue on top of the table, strides off, ignores the girl behind the counter, who has been staring at him ever since he got here. She's blasting steam into a big coffee cup and says excuse me as he reaches for the door. ""Sir?"" she calls out above the noise of the espresso machine.He walks over to the counter and says: ""Don't worry. I'll pay for it."" He pulls a few bills out of his wallet.She doesn't seem interested in his pool-hall vandalism, says, ""Are you Detective Geronimo?""""Where'd you get a name like that?""""I take that as a yes,"" she replies, reaching below the counter, retrieves an envelope, hands it to him. ""This guy came in earlier, asked me to give this to you when you were about to leave.""""How much earlier?"" He slips the envelope into a pocket, mindful of who might be watching.So the man with the fake accent called Win after the letter was dropped off here, never intended on a meeting.""What did he look like?"" Win asks.""Nothing special, kind of old. Had on tinted glasses, a big trench coat. And a scarf.""""Of course."" A man in scarlet, just like Nana said.Win walks out into the rain, and the dampness of the night makes him feel sticky and wilted. His grandmother's car is a dark, finned hulk on Summer Street, in front of the Rosebud Diner, and he walks along the wet pavement, looking around, wondering if the man in scarlet is nearby, watching. He unlocks the car, opens the glove box, finds a flashlight and a stack of napkins from Dunkin' Donuts, wraps several of them around his hands and slits open the envelope with one of the keys dangling from the steering column. He slips out a folded piece of lined paper, reads what's neatly printed on it in black ink: ""You're the one AT RISK, half-breed.""He dials Lamont's home number, and she doesn't answer. He tries her cellphone. She doesn't answer. He doesn't leave a message, changes his mind and tries again, and she answers this time.""Hello?"" Her voice doesn't have its usual energy.""You want to tell me what the hell's going on?"" He cranks the engine.""No need to be upset with me,"" she weirdly says, sounds strained, something off about her.""Some wacko with a wacko fake accent just called me about the Finlay case. What a coincidence. Somehow the guy has my cellphone number, another amazing coincidence, and coincidentally said he'd meet me and didn't show up, left me a threatening note. Who the hell have you been talking to? You send out a press release or something. . .?""""This morning,"" she replies, and a muffled male voice in the background says something Win can't make out.""This morning? Before I even got to town! And you couldn't bother to tell me?"" he exclaims.""That's fine,"" her non sequitur follows.The person Lamont is with -- some man at almost 1 o'clock in the morning -- says something, and she abruptly ends the call, and Win sits in the dark inside his grandmother's old Buick staring at the lined piece of paper in his napkin-wrapped hands. His heart pounds so hard he can feel it in his neck. Lamont alerted the media about a case that's now supposed to be his and didn't ask his permission or even bother telling him. She can take her political machinations and shove them.I quit. See what she does when he tells her that. I quit!He has no idea where to look for her. She didn't answer her home phone, only her cellphone. So she probably isn't home. Well, it's hard to say. He decides to cruise past her Cambridge house anyway. In case she's there. The hell with who else might be there, and he wonders who Lamont sleeps with, if she's one of these alpha-dog women who don't like sex or maybe the opposite. Maybe she's a piranha, eats her lovers to the bone.He roars away from the curb, fishtails -- damn rear-wheel drive -- skids on the slick pavement, and the windshield wipers drag loudly across the glass, driving him crazy because he's already feeling crazy, as if he's in the middle of something crazy that he was crazy to get in the middle of, dammit. He should have refused to fly back up here, should have stayed in Tennessee. It's late to call Sykes. It's rude. He's always doing this to her, and she always lets him. She won't mind, and he enters her number, remembering it's Tuesday night, and usually on Tuesday nights at this late hour the two of them are dressed like preppies, listening to jazz at Forty-Six-Twenty, drinking fruit-infused martinis and talking.""Figures the one time I was actually sleeping,"" says Sykes, an agent with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, and an insomniac, her hormones hateful these days.She sits up in bed, doesn't bother with the lamp. For the past six weeks she has spent a lot of time talking to Win on the phone, in bed in the dark, alone, wondering what it would be like to talk to him in bed, in the dark, in person. She listens for her roommate through the wall, doesn't want to wake her up. The odd thing is, when Sykes drove Win to the Knoxville airport, she said to him, Well for once our roommates will get a full night's sleep. Since she and Win began their training at the National Forensic Academy, they've talked the nights away, and since the student apartments don't have thick walls, their roommates get the wrong end of that deal.""I think you miss me,"" Sykes says, joking but hoping it's true.""Need you to do something,"" Win says.""Are you all right?"" She switches on the lamp.""You don't sound fine. What's going on?"" She gets out of bed, stares at herself in the mirror over the dresser.""Listen. An old lady was murdered in Knoxville 20 years ago, Vivian Finlay. Sequoyah Hills.""""Let's start with why the sudden interest.""""Something damn weird's going on. You were in Tennessee back then. Maybe you remember the case.""Sykes was in Tennessee, all right, yet another reminder of her age, and she looks at herself in the mirror, her silvery-blond hair sticking up everywhere, like ""Amadeus,"" is the way Win once described it. If you saw the movie, he said. She didn't.""I vaguely recall the case,"" she is saying. ""Rich widow, someone broke in. An unbelievable thing to happen in Sequoyah Hills in the middle of the day.""The mirror is especially unkind at this hour, her eyes puffy. Too much beer. She doesn't know why Win likes her so much, why he doesn't seem to see her the same way she does, maybe sees her the way she used to be, 20 years ago when she had creamy skin and big blue eyes, a tight round butt and perky boobs, a body that flipped the finger at gravity until she turned 40 and gravity flipped the finger back.""I need the original police file,"" he is saying over the phone.""By chance you got the case number?"" Sykes asks.""Only the autopsy case number. Just microfilm printouts from that, no scene photos, no nothing. Got to have that file too if we can ever find it in the Bermuda Triangle of storage. You know, when the old morgue moved. Or at least Lamont said it did. I'm assuming she's right.""Her again. ""Yeah, it moved. O.K., one thing at a time,"" she says, getting stressed, irritable. ""First, you want the police file.""""Got to have it, Sykes.""""So, I'll try to track it down first thing in the morning.""""Can't wait. Whatever you can get your hands on now. E-mail it to me.""""And who do you think's going to help me out at this hour?"" She is already opening her closet, yanking a pair of blue cargo pants off a hanger.""The academy,"" Win says. ""Call Tom, get him out of bed.""He drives fast toward Mount Auburn Hospital, turns off Brattle Street, headed to Monique Lamont's house so he can ruin the rest of her night.Maybe he'll sign on with the T.B.I., the F.B.I., the F.Y.I. -- for your information, Monique, nobody jerks me around like this.Then why are you sending Sykes on a mission in the middle of the night? another part of his brain asks him. A minor technicality. Just because he quits Lamont doesn't mean he'll quit the Vivian Finlay case. It's personal now. Some man in scarlet screws with him, insults him, and it gets personal. Win drives through an intersection, barely slows at the stop sign, turns left near the fire station, onto the narrow street where Lamont lives on a sliver of an acre in a 19th-century pale plum house, a Queen Anne Painted Lady, showy and intricate and formidable, like its owner. Her property is dense with crepe myrtles, oaks and birch trees, and the dark shapes of them rock in the wind and water drips from branches and leaves.He parks in front, turns off his headlights, cuts the engine. The front porch light isn't on, no lights along the property are on and only one window is lighted up, the one on the second floor to the left of the front door, and he has one of his feelings. Her Range Rover is in the cobbled driveway, and his feeling intensifies. If she's not home, somebody picked her up. Well, big deal. She could have anybody she wants, so her date du jour picked her up, maybe took her to his place, big deal, but the feeling persists. If her date du jour is inside the house with her, where's his car? Win tries her home phone and gets voice mail. He tries her cellphone, and she doesn't answer. He tries it a second time. She doesn't answer.Some man in a red scarf sending him on a wild goose chase, making a fool of him, threatening him, taunting him. Who? Win worries about what's going to appear in the news. Maybe Lamont's idiotic press release is screaming through cyberspace, landing all over the Internet. Maybe that's how the man in the red scarf found out about At Risk, about Win, but it doesn't make sense. As far as he knows, Vivian Finlay wasn't from New England, so why is some man in New England interested enough in her to go to all the trouble to call Win, set up a phony meeting and taunt him?He continues staring at Lamont's house, at her densely wooded property, looking up and down the street, for what, he doesn't know. For anything. He grabs the flashlight and gets out of his grandmother's prehistoric-looking car, keeping up his scan, listening. Something doesn't feel right, feels worse than not right. Maybe he's just rattled, expecting something not to feel right, getting spooked the way he did as a boy when he started imagining monsters, bad people, bad things, death, having premonitions because it's in his blood, as his grandmother so often declares. He has no gun. He follows the brick walk to the front porch, climbs the steps, looking, listening, deciding that what he's really uneasy about is Lamont.She won't be nice about this. If she's with someone, she'll have Win's head. He starts to ring the bell, looks up at the same time a shadow moves past the curtained, lighted window directly overhead. He stares up, waiting. He shines the flashlight at the brass mailbox to the left of the front door, lifts the lid. She didn't pick up her mail when she came in, and he remembers what she said about a key box. He doesn't see anything like that.Water drips in big, cool drops from leaves and smacks the top of his head as he goes around to the back of the house, where it is thickly wooded and very dark, where he finds the key box open, the key still in the lock, the door ajar. He hesitates, looks around, listening to water dripping, shining the flashlight in the trees, the shrubbery, directing the beam back to something dark red between two boxwoods, a gas can with rags on top of it, wet from the rain but clean. His pulse picks up, begins to race as he silently steps into the kitchen, hears Lamont's voice, then a male voice, an angry male voice, on the second floor, the room with the lighted window above the front door.He moves fast up wooden stairs that creak, three stairs at a time, cuts across a hallway that creaks. Through an open doorway he sees her on the bed, nude, tied to the bedposts, a man in jeans, a T-shirt, sitting on the edge of the bed, stroking her with a pistol.""I'm a whore,"" she repeats in a shaky voice. ""Please don't do this.""Left of the bed is the window, the drapes drawn. Her clothes are strewn on the floor, the same suit she had on hours earlier at dinner.""'I'm nothing but a filthy whore.' Say it!""Overhead is a large art-glass chandelier with painted flowers, blue, red, green, and Win hurls the flashlight and it crashes into the chandelier and it shatters and sways, and the man jumps up from the bed, whips around, and then Win has him by the wrist, struggling to get the pistol away from him, the man's breath in his face, reeking of garlic, and the gun fires into the ceiling, just missing Win's head.His voice sounds muffled and distant in his ringing ears as he struggles, and the pistol fires again and again, and the man's grip suddenly goes limp. Win grabs hold of the gun, shoves him hard and he collapses to the floor, blood flowing out of his head, pooling on the hardwood, quiet on the floor next to the bed, bleeding, not moving, a young Hispanic-looking man, maybe in his teens.Win yanks a comforter over Lamont, frees her from the electrical cords lashing her to the bedposts as he repeatedly says: ""It's all right. You're safe now. It's all right."" He calls 911 on his cellphone, and she sits up, pulling the comforter around her, gasping for breath, shaking violently, eyes wild.""Oh God,"" she says. ""Oh God!"" she screams.""It's O.K., it's O.K., you're safe now,"" he says, standing over her, looking around, watching the man on the floor, blood and bloody shards of colorful art glass everywhere.""Is he the only one?"" Win yells at Lamont as his heart pounds and his eyes dart around, his ears ringing, the pistol ready. ""Is there anybody else?"" he shouts.She shakes her head, her breathing rapid and shallow, her face blanched, her eyes glazed, about to pass out.""Deep, slow breaths, Monique."" Win takes off his suit jacket, places it in her hands, helps her hold it up to her face. ""It's all right. Breathe into it like it's a paper bag. That's good. Good. Deep, slow breaths. No one's going to hurt you now.""Next week: Lamont and Win learn about her attacker.THE FUNNY PAGES: III: SUNDAY SERIAL Previous chapters are online at www.nytimes.com/funnypages.'"

"'06-01-29,'0','Traffic noise grew worse, ""or maybe I got more sensitive to it,"" she said. A hydrant outside her window attracted idling traffic, where buses sat throbbing for hours, waiting for students at the high school down the street.It was hard to cook in the kitchen, which was built into a wall, and also hard to wash up. ""A big pot or a big plate didn't fit in the sink,"" she said.Ms. Falotico, 42, longed to spread out and settle in. So she started the hunt for a co-op apartment selling for $350,000 to $400,000.""I really had no idea what to expect,"" she said. ""I never had done anything like this before."" She checked out a few open houses in her Chelsea neighborhood. One agent she met referred her to Farrah Mogh of Manhattan Apartments, who took her by the hand.What Ms. Falotico wanted: Enough space for her stuff. A quiet location, preferably in the back of the building. A normal kitchen. Ideally, she would remain on the West Side, convenient to Lincoln Center, where she volunteers at the City Opera Gift Shop, and to Pennsylvania Station, where she catches the train to visit her parents in Commack, on Long Island.""Her price range was really down there,"" said Ms. Mogh, who showed her apartments in four Lincoln Towers buildings before realizing she might not meet the financial requirements. That was discouraging, Ms. Falotico said: ""They wouldn't even let me get to the point of rejecting me.""The dozen other Upper West Side apartments she saw seemed no bigger than her rental. They were ""disjointed, with a couple of small rooms,"" she said. A small one-bedroom in a nondescript building on West 84th Street was $395,000 with a monthly maintenance of $500. Nothing seemed worth the price.So Ms. Mogh suggested she look in Murray Hill, where she could get more space for the money. Coincidentally, she works in that neighborhood, in the corporate office of an automotive retailer. But she had never considered living nearby. Walking home on Third Avenue, she would think, ""It gets an awful lot of traffic around rush hour.""Two sponsor units were available in a 35th Street co-op building near Second Avenue. One was listed at $389,000 and the other at $385,000, with maintenance in the high $700 range. Both were big, sunny studios in the back of the building.Ms. Falotico took along her friend and colleague, Stacey Yonkus, who loved looking at homes.After renting in White Plains, Ms. Yonkus had looked at dozens of houses before buying one in Larchmont, N.Y., two years ago. ""Gail is a laid-back person and I wanted to be sure she knew what she was looking for and she was asking all the right questions,"" Ms. Yonkus said.Though Ms. Falotico was interested in both units, they were expensive for her. The sponsors ""wouldn't budge on price, so we knew it was not going to work,"" Ms. Mogh said.But a few weeks later, Ms. Mogh showed her an even bigger place in a co-op on East 36th Street. It was an alcove studio, around 600 square feet, facing a back courtyard, with a separate kitchen.This one was substantially bigger and cheaper than anything she had seen. The asking price was a suspiciously low $329,000, with maintenance in the low $700's.What was wrong? Ms. Mogh knew. The street out front fed into the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.Ms. Falotico didn't care. Her concern wasn't traffic, but traffic noise. She stood silent for quite a while in the apartment, listening.The owner, who was marrying and moving to California, was eager to sell. ""She wanted the asking price because it was so well priced,"" Ms. Mogh said. ""So if somebody didn't care about that traffic block, this was a great deal.""Ms. Falotico had two walk-throughs. The first time, the place was still filled with furniture, all of which the seller was leaving behind.Her friend Ms. Yonkus insisted she return when the furniture was gone. When Ms. Yonkus bought her house, she found that furniture hid an indention in the wood floor, dug by a dog. ""You don't necessarily know what's underneath,"" Ms. Yonkus said. ""You just want to be sure.""Ms. Falotico kept only two of the seller's items -- a chandelier and a computer table -- and the building's superintendent removed the rest. After all, she had plenty of her own stuff. Most of it came with her, because she didn't have time to sort and clean before she moved.Now, in her new home, Ms. Falotico luxuriates in the space. Even amid her unpacked boxes, ""it is great to be able to spread out,"" she said. ""Sometimes I sit there, a little amazed: There is room!""She is trying to use the space wisely, so that having more capacity doesn't lead to having more stuff.The traffic on the block is hardly intrusive. ""When I go to work in the morning, I have to be pretty careful crossing the street,"" she said. ""That's all.""Her colleagues envy her proximity to work -- five minutes on foot. To her, though, living so near isn't necessarily an advantage. ""I used to walk home in nice weather, and that longer walk is a little nicer,"" she said. ""I used to window shop or shop shop on the way home.""'"

"'06-01-30,'0','Tailfins were in decline and customers were eager for a fresh approach to replace the longer-lower-wider mantra of 1950's redesigns. The meager headroom of earlier models was remedied by raising the roofline two inches and the trunk was now cavernous.But Chevrolet's biggest change came in performance, with the release of a new 409-cubic-inch V-8 as a midyear option. The Super Sport option package for Impalas was another midyear addition to the line, and together the 409 engine and SS trim proved a combination of the sort that marketers dream about.The 1961 Impala Super Sport was distinguished from everyday Impalas by red SS emblems on the rear fenders and the trunk lid; the dashboard also carried Super Sport emblems applied to a bright aluminum overlay. Hubcaps with three-blade spinners painted red, white and blue were an upgrade over the standard wheel covers.Besides establishing a tradition of distinctive badging -- the ornamentation that designers call a car's jewelry -- the first SS cars staked out a reputation for running gear that was a cut above the standard equipment. Impala Super Sports for 1961 had V-8 engines; power brakes and steering; fade-resistant metallic brake linings; and heavy-duty springs and shock absorbers.Just 456 Super Sports were built that year, but many correct-appearing clones have since been assembled by expert (or dishonest) owners. For a genuine 1961 Impala SS, expect to pay more than $30,000 for a hardtop in very good (not show) condition, and more than $50,000 for a convertible in similar condition.Impalas underwent several styling changes in the 1962-64 model years, and the Super Sport package became a sporty trim option without any bearing on performance. In '62, Super Sports were available with any powertrain, including the six-cylinder engine preferred by thrifty buyers. No suspension upgrades were required.The Impala SS, in theory, could now be a toothless car just for poseurs. Yet enthusiasts kept the faith, buying 99,311 Impala SS coupes and convertibles in '62. Super Sport Impalas of this era now sell in the mid-$20,000 range for good to very good examples, and convertibles are at least $10,000 more.In those days, General Motors was quick to borrow a marketing strategy that worked and share it with other models. The compact Chevy II Nova, introduced in 1962, was only a year old when a Super Sport option was added. At $161, the SS trim cost the same as it did for the Impala, a sum that, incidentally, exceeded the price of a V-8 engine for the car. (When the 283-cubic-inch Turbo-Fire was made available on the 1964 Nova, the price was just $108.)By 1964 a midsize car, the Chevelle, joined the model line, and the Super Sport package was now available in small, medium or large. Arriving just as muscle cars were reaching peak potency, the Chevelle helped to establish a devoted following for Super Sports with options that included big-block V-8's of 450 horsepower. Its size made it a popular choice among singles and young families who needed something bigger than a Chevy II but not the size of an Impala.While Super Sports were a part of the automotive landscape by this point, there may have been a realization at G.M. that their appeal was being stretched thin.In 1967, the introduction of the Camaro gave Chevrolet an answer to the Ford Mustang and an entry in the pony car category. It also served as a revitalization of the Super Sport's original assignment as a performance option.Chevrolet did right by its original concept in offering the Camaro SS only with V-8 power, first a 350-cubic-inch small block and later a 396-inch big block. The option package included SS-specific paint stripes and simulated hood grilles, and could be combined with a Rally Sport option of chrome trim, hidden headlamps and fancier upholstery. SS badges took precedence on cars equipped with both options; today those cars are among the most valuable of all Camaros.A 1967-69 RS-SS coupe with the 350 engine in very good condition is hard to find for less than $50,000; a 396-cubic-inch version brings more than $60,000. Convertibles seem a bargain at about $55,000 with the 350; add $10,000 for a 396.Truck buyers were not left out, as the Chevelle-based El Camino pickups of the 60's offered a Super Sport package. The El Camino was one of the longest-lasting Super Sports, offered as a trim package until production ended in 1987.The era of full-size Super Sports ended -- temporarily, it turned out -- when the Impala SS was canceled after the 1969 run. Upstaged and outsold by the upscale Caprice, it was a sign of the changing times. Performance was giving way to comfort, at least in G.M.'s full-size model line.The Super Sport name continued on as an option for the 1970-71 Monte Carlo; only 3,823 were built for 1970 and just 1,919 the next year. A Monte Carlo SS reappeared in the 1980's with special aerodynamic body panels to make the car eligible for Nascar racing.While sales success seemed unlikely at the time, a reincarnation of the full-size Impala Super Sport in 1994 turned out to be a home run for Chevrolet. Built with parts from the police car package, the '94 Impala Super Sport was available only in black. Despite an enthusiastic reception for the rear-drive sedan, it was gone after the 1996 model year. Today, a '94 or '95 Impala SS can be found in respectable condition in the $12,000 to $14,000 range.'"
"'06-01-30,'0','C. V. Starr, the privately held insurance company controlled by Maurice R.

After the sale, the suit says, A.I.G. sought to harm Starr's insurance business by withholding documents, kicking Starr employees out of offices and telling clients to cease doing business with Mr. Greenberg's company.""The sole aim of A.I.G.'s coordinated and malicious conduct is to steal business from the Starr agencies and prevent the Starr agencies from competing with A.I.G.,"" the suit contends.A.I.G. declined to comment on the lawsuit.

"'06-01-30,'0','""Chasing Daylight"" is a weep waiting to happen: the maudlin possibilities of this story are huge. But Mr. O'Kelly did not take the Mitch Albom route (""Tuesdays With Morrie,"" ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven""): instead, he described his situation with dignified restraint. And he did not become one of the world's great philosophers. But he wound up voicing universal truths not often found in business or how-to tracts. He shared them simply and clearly. And yes, he made a success out of this final mission.Readers may wonder how honest the book is in sustaining its positive tone. (Mr. O'Kelly refers to his grief and rage, but he does not emphasize either.) Then there is the question of how a man losing his faculties could describe these losses so clearly. (Andrew Postman is listed as co-writer. Corinne O'Kelly, the author's widow, helped write part of the book too.) Readers may also note that KPMG had troubles with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Mr. O'Kelly's watch. He chose not to make them part of his memoir.But ""Chasing Daylight"" is far from uniformly flattering. It reveals a chilly, manipulative side to Mr. O'Kelly -- or, as Mrs. O'Kelly puts it, ""a 'cut to the chase' approach that had made him so successful in business but could sometimes come off as abrupt in personal interactions."" When he set out to bid farewell to everyone he knew, one at a time, the meetings were arranged strictly on his terms. But it is the crumbling of this very rigidity that makes the book affecting. The author taught himself new survival strategies when the habits of a lifetime failed him.Mr. O'Kelly described discovering the world around him -- nature, connection with loved ones, living in the moment -- as if he had never seen it before. Possibly he hadn't. But once the bad news came, he searched for ways to savor what was within his grasp without yearning for the impossible. His religious faith was a great help in this -- even if on his first postdiagnosis visit to church, the sermon happened to be the one about the camel, the eye of the needle, the rich man and heaven.The book describes the medical decline that began almost without symptoms, but soon took its toll. Mr. O'Kelly's vision began to dim. His handwriting deteriorated. His ability to complete simple tasks declined, but he remained very much the businessman even in the face of these challenges. Increasingly, needlessly complicated technology infuriated him: ""I just wanted to use my phone to call people. Was that too much to ask?"" From this same narrowing perspective, he discovered the all-but-new experience of doing only one thing at a time.In the course of saying goodbye, he would sometimes invite a friend or acquaintance to take a stroll in the park. This ""was sometimes not only the final time we would take such a leisurely walk together, but also the first time.""In hard-won retrospect, he wondered what it would take to make healthy people slow down and heed his quotation of Jonathan Swift: ""May you live every day of your life."" Mr. O'Kelly did his best to echo that benediction.'"

Starting today, The Journal is expanding its coverage of people and running a comprehensive index of all the people who are mentioned significantly in that day's newspaper. You probably won't see an article about how Jen is coping with the news of the baby Brad and Angelina are expecting, but you may be directed to an article about Alan Greenspan and his new consulting firm.""People like to read about people,"" said Paul E.

""We're going to go with more names and a device that will help people if they or their best friends or worst enemies are somewhere in the paper.""The index to people will appear inside the back cover of the Marketplace section on an expanded ""Who's News"" page with a daily feature on an executive or business leader. (The current index to companies will stay inside the front cover of Marketplace.) Publishing consultants say that readers like such navigational tools, and many newspapers are making increasing use of them, sometimes on their front pages.""There are a lot of people mentioned in our paper every day, and we'll try to get more of them in by paying more attention to executive movements,"" Mr. Steiger said. These will include business people from around the world, not just the United States.The changes are separate from a redesign that The Journal is planning to institute next January when it will be printed on smaller presses, reducing its size from 15 inches wide to 12 inches wide.Mr. Steiger said there were no plans for the smaller paper to carry advertising on its front page. But The Journal is running advertising on the front page of its Money section in its Saturday paper and he said that was an attraction to advertisers.""We found a way to do it on Money where it didn't impair our ability to do navigation or report the news,"" he said.

"'06-01-30,'0','Both times, Beilein said, before the miners had been found, his team members prayed that everyone would have enough oxygen and could find a means of escape.The Mountaineers were, obviously, all business against the Red Storm yesterday, as they took an 18-point lead with just over 11 minutes to play. St. John's cut the deficit to 2 points with 30.2 seconds left, but West Virginia held on for a 66-61 victory.West Virginia (15-4, 6-0) was coming off an upset loss Wednesday to its cross-state rival, Marshall, in Charleston, where a moment of silence for the dead miners had been observed before tip-off.Beilein grew up in rural western New York and went to college in Wheeling, W.Va. Only one of his scholarship players is from West Virginia -- the team's star, Kevin Pittsnogle, who is from the panhandle, not far from Washington. Pittsnogle does not have family or friends who are directly involved in mining.""But everybody in West Virginia feels the tragedies,"" Beilein said. ""We all know how important mining is, how important it is to the welfare of the families, the employment, and we all know the dangers involved and the history of the early unions there, the horrors that have occurred over the years in the mines.""Hoppy Kercheval, a popular West Virginia talk-radio host, said on the air at the time of the Sago calamity: ""We take a lot of ribbing in West Virginia about everybody being related to everyone else, but the truth is, there isn't much separation among West Virginians. We may not have friends or family members in Upshur County, but our state is a small enough community that the pain is shared. Just as the joy of the Mountaineer victory can be shared among the faithful from the state.""The last part was a reference to West Virginia's football victory over Georgia in the Sugar Bowl, but basketball interest is no less rabid.""We felt we as a team had a responsibility to the state, to step up and play good ball,"" said the senior forward Mike Gansey, who is from the Cleveland area. ""It seemed like it was a mining disaster after mining disaster. It was very emotional for us. We wanted to do the best we could for their families.""Gansey scored 15 points yesterday and sealed the victory with four free throws in the waning seconds. Pittsnogle scored 19 to lead the Mountaineers.Before yesterday's game, Beilein said St. John's defense was ""as good as any in the country.""""They've got quick hands and a smart scheme,"" he said. ""That's a potent combination.""The Red Storm (10-8, 3-4) lived up to his estimation.""They put so much defensive pressure on us, it was hard to throw the ball inbounds,"" Gansey said. ""We knew we weren't going to win by 20.""The Mountaineers, with a tradition of great basketball players like Jerry West, Rod Thorn and Hot Rod Hundley, were a Cinderella story in last year's N.C.A.A. tournament. They reached the Round of 8 and missed going to the Final Four only after losing to Louisville in overtime. It was the furthest the Mountaineers had advanced in the tournament since West's team made it to the final in 1959.""Last year's team set the tournament on fire,"" David Karickhoff, a retired engineer, said by telephone last week from his home in Huntington, W.Va. ""We had most of the team back, and I think the whole state was looking forward to this season.""Beilein said: ""There are no Knicks or Nets, no Islanders for Rangers, no Mets or Yankees in West Virginia. So we are essentially the pro team there.""He added, ""You hope that we as a basketball team can be even just a brief distraction -- five minutes, five seconds, anything -- from the grief the family and friends of the lost ones have been going through.""He said he had learned in his four years at West Virginia that miners were fans of the team.""Those miners trapped a week ago Saturday might well have been watching our game against U.C.L.A., if they could have,"" Beilein said. ""At the very least, it gives you perspective. It brings you back to earth.""'"
"'06-01-30,'0','New Orleans waits. While some heroic efforts at rebuilding are taking place, hundreds of thousands of residents have put their lives on hold until they know what the government's next steps will be, leaving the shells of their houses as placeholders. But the Bush administration has now rejected the most broadly supported plan for rebuilding communities while offering nothing to take its place.It has been five months since Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast and for many the norm is still the claustrophobic new reality of tiny trailers and multiple families crammed into single apartments. Louisiana is trying. You can hear jackhammers pounding and buzz saws whirring on Canal Street in New Orleans. Dedicated workers endure a grinding daily commute from points north, like Baton Rouge, as they try to make the city and the region whole again. But the mission is far from complete and the challenge is beyond the scope of a broken city and a poor state.New Orleans's crisis has little relation to anything the nation has faced in modern memory, and traditional solutions will simply not help. Homeowners -- many very poor people whose houses had been in their families for generations -- had varying degrees of insurance before the disaster. When entire neighborhoods are devastated, their mildewed furniture and drywall piled on the roadsides, it's impossible to tell the people who are well insured to rebuild and hope that the houses all around them will somehow be reclaimed somewhere down the line.But the Bush administration refuses to support the plan of Representative Richard Baker, Republican of Louisiana, which would give everyone the capacity to rebuild and which had the backing of the mayor, the governor and the state's Congressional delegation. (To add insult to injury, two days after the White House shot down Mr. Baker's proposal, President Bush suggested at a news conference that Louisiana's problem was the lack of a plan.)Instead of an alternate solution, the president's Katrina czar, Donald Powell, has offered sleight of hand, touting $6.2 billion in development money for Louisiana passed last year by Congress as if it were somehow a substitute. And in an attempt to narrow the scope of the problem, Mr. Powell says the government first needs to care for the roughly 20,000 homeowners without flood insurance who lived outside the federally designated flood plain. The real tally of destroyed or damaged homes in the region is well over 200,000. And the real need is housing for residents, whether they were renters or owners, insured or uninsured, living above the flood plain or trusting the federal government's levees to protect them from storms.Perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on the wreckage of poor, low-lying New Orleans neighborhoods like the Lower Ninth Ward. That has sparked the unproductive, blame-the-victim debate revolving around whether people should have lived there in the first place. The Ninth Ward provides a misleading picture of the city, as do the relatively unscathed tourist areas like the French Quarter and the Garden District. Huge swaths of the city have the empty quality of a ghost town. Stores wait for residents to reopen; residents wait to see if neighbors will return. The city and surrounding parishes will not meet Mr. Powell's neat categories, when renters lived beside owners, insured next to uninsured. He is talking like an actuary when a leader is needed to rescue this region.'"
"'06-01-30,'0','It is not clear to what extent Mr. Negroponte's decision to use free open-source software in the laptop instead of Windows spurred the alternative plan from Microsoft. But Mr. Gates has been privately bitter about it, and Mr. Mundie has been skeptical in public about the project's chance of success.""I love what Nick is trying to do,"" Mr. Mundie said. ""We have a lot of concerns about the sustainability of his approach.""This has not deterred Mr. Negroponte. At a private breakfast meeting on the digital divide at the forum on Saturday, Mr. Negroponte said that he had a commitment from Quanta Computer of Taiwan to manufacture the portable computers, which would initially use a processing chip from Advanced Micro Devices of Sunnyvale, Calif. He also said he had raised $20 million to pay for engineering and was close to a final commitment of $700 million from seven nations -- Thailand, Egypt, Nigeria, India, China, Brazil and Argentina -- to purchase seven million of the laptops.Also on Saturday, Mr. Negroponte's nonprofit group, One Laptop Per Child, signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations Development Program at a news conference here, under which the two will work together to develop technology and learning resources.Mr. Negroponte is showing only a mockup of his laptop, which will have a carrying handle, built-in stereo speakers, a wireless data connection, a hand crank to generate power and a screen that is visible even in bright sunlight. He said that he hoped to be able to hand out working laptops to some participants at the forum in Davos next year.He also acknowledged that months of discussions with Microsoft and Apple Computer about using their operating system software for his computer had been fruitless, and that as a result, the laptops would use a version of Linux, the open-source operating system.According to several people familiar with the discussions, Microsoft had encouraged Mr. Negroponte to consider using the Windows CE version of its software, and Microsoft had been prepared to make an open-source version of the program available.Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, had also offered a free version of his company's OS X operating system, but Mr. Negroponte rejected that idea because the software was largely not open-source, meaning users could not get free access to software and its source code, which they could then modify. Mr. Negroponte said in an interview here that he had resolved to use Linux not because it was free but because of its quality and maintainability.""I chose open-source because it's better,"" he said. ""I have 100 million programmers I can rely on.""At the same time, Mr. Negroponte, who is on the board of the Motorola Corporation, said he was not opposed to the idea of building a low-cost computer using a cellphone. He said his research group at the M.I.T. Media Lab had experimented with the idea of a cellphone that would project a computer display onto a wall and also project the image of a keyboard, sensing the motion of fingers over it. But the researchers decided the idea was less practical than a laptop.Some business and development policy specialists have raised questions about Mr. Negroponte's laptop, pointing to the price of Internet connectivity, which can cost $24 to $50 a month in developing nations. But Mr. Negroponte said networking costs would not be an obstacle because the laptops would be made to connect automatically in a so-called mesh network, making it possible for up to 1,000 computers to wirelessly share just one or two land-based Internet connections.The Media Lab researchers are also planning to approach an upcoming meeting of the international consortium overseeing G.S.M., or global system for mobile communications, for cellular phones about setting up a data standard that would allow low-cost and educational use of wireless network capacity.""We call the concept 'standby bits,' "" Mr. Negroponte said, explaining that the concept was similar to the way standby passengers on airlines can travel when there are empty seats. The laptops would send and receive Internet data only when higher-paying commercial data was not being transmitted.At the Davos meeting, a number of participants raised questions about the wisdom of Mr. Negroponte's plan to persuade governments to underwrite the cost of the laptops.Stuart Gannes, director of the Digital Vision Program at Stanford University, said a better way to bring computers into poor countries would be to put them into the hands of entrepreneurs and make them revenue generators. ""We need to look at technology as a way to bring cash into the poorest communities,"" Mr. Gannes said.Mr. Negroponte said that ""a lot of people were apprehensive"" about the project before he won the backing from Quanta, but that he believed he had put the doubts to rest. Quanta manufactures about one-third of the world's laptop computers, he said.'"

"'06-01-30,'0','There was sad news last week for enthusiasts of the Aibo Entertainment Robot from Sony: the doglike machine, which walks, barks and recognizes speech, is being put to sleep, the company said.The Aibo, which was introduced in 1999, is being discontinued as part of Sony's move to improve its financial position. Last September the company announced that it would eliminate or scale back 15 product categories. In addition to Aibo, Sony has also stopped selling its Qualia line of high-end televisions and audio equipment, plasma TV's and car stereos in Japan, said Rick Clancy, a senior vice president at Sony Electronics.With little marketing or promotion, the Aibo robot garnered a cultlike following around the world. Its programmed actions include barking, pushing a ball and lifting its leg, and it can ""learn,"" becoming more adept at behaviors over time. Using different software stored on memory sticks, Aibo also gives the illusion of development by becoming able to perform different age-appropriate tasks.Aibos from the latest litter speak 1,000 words and can understand more than 100, including some in Spanish. A videocamera in the robot's head can wirelessly relay images to a laptop, allowing owners to see the world from a dog's point of view.Aibos cost about $2,000, and the company will continue to sell them on its Web site (www.sonystyle.com) until its inventory is depleted; it will then supply spare parts for another seven years (or 49 dog years). To date, 150,000 Aibos have been sold throughout the world.Bruce Binder, an electromechanical engineer from Rancho Cordoba, Calif., has spent about $90,000 to acquire 56 Aibos. His love of his pets motivated him to take his only two trips overseas, both to Aibo meetings in England.""I'm disappointed, but it's not a shock,"" Mr. Binder said. ""I think Sony's making a mistake.""Many owners regard their possessions as more than just a piece of plastic coupled to motors and processors.

About 40 business-side employees were notified yesterday that they were losing their jobs, as were 26 editorial employees who are not in the Newspaper Guild.About three dozen other editorial employees who are protected by the Guild are being offered buyouts and will have until Feb. 13 to decide whether to accept them. If not enough Guild-protected people take the buyouts, there will be layoffs, executives said. The company employs about 13,400 people.The company does not plan any other job cuts in the near term, said Dawn Bridges, a spokeswoman.Two of the titles most affected will be Time and Money magazines. But there will be cuts across the board, including at other Time Inc. brand names like Fortune, Sports Illustrated and Real Simple.The cuts come as the company continues the reorganization it began late last year, when it sought to streamline its multilayered management structure. The current round of cuts is largely because of reallocation of resources as the company increases its online presence and consolidates some of its business functions, Ms. Bridges said. And some magazines must cut costs to bring expenses in line with revenues.'"

"'06-01-31,'0','Steve Alexander, an assistant attorney general defending the suit, said the Kansas statute meant that those younger than 16 could not consent to sex, and that those violating the law forfeited any privacy rights.""Illegal sexual activity by minors can lead to S.T.D.'s, unwanted pregnancies, abortion, depression, mental illness,"" Mr. Alexander said. ""To pretend otherwise is foolish."" He said the case was in essence a challenge to the law barring consensual sex between young people of a similar age, which he called ""a policy argument that plaintiffs would be better served making in the Legislature.""Kansas is one of 12 states where sex under a certain age -- 16, 17 or 18 -- is illegal regardless of the age difference between partners, according to a 2004 report prepared by the Lewin Group, a consulting firm, for the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Laws on reporting child sexual abuse also vary, but a third of states require reporting only when statutory rape involves a parent or guardian, the report found.Dr. Robert W. Blum, a Johns Hopkins University professor and an expert in pediatrics and adolescent medicine, who was the plaintiffs' lead witness, testified Monday that only one state, California, had previously tried to require reporting of all under-age sex, and that it reversed course after a year in the early 1990's because the authorities were flooded with ""irrelevant and obstructive"" reports.Among the plaintiffs' arguments is that blanket reporting of sexual activity would be futile because the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services has a policy against investigating cases of consensual teenage sex.Pressed on cross-examination, Dr. Blum said he did consider all sex by children 12 or younger to be ""problematic"" and worthy of reporting, but he said, ""That's distinctly different than a 14-, 15- or 16-year-old in a romantic relationship.""Nationally, studies suggest that about 30 percent of teenagers under 16 have had intercourse, and an additional 20 percent have experimented with oral sex or genital fondling.A federal appeals court on Friday overturned a temporary injunction blocking enactment of Mr. Kline's ruling but provided a two-week window, approximately the expected length of the trial, before the reporting would be required.Among the issues debated Monday was the very definition of sexual activity. Anal and vaginal intercourse and oral sex are mentioned in the law, as is ""lewd fondling or touching"" done with ""the intent to arouse,"" which Ms. Jones said could cover even intense French kissing.Mr. Kline, who is expected to testify Friday, declined to discuss the case. In an e-mail statement, he avoided the central controversy over consensual sex between teenagers of a similar age.""Plaintiffs are arguing that the constitution does not allow the state to require people to report child rape,"" the statement said. ""We differ. Prosecuting and investigating child rapists depends on such laws, and if the plaintiffs believe that adult-child sex should be legal they need to take that debate to the Legislature rather than initiate litigation.""Similarly, Mr. Kline said last year that prosecuting rapists was his goal in seeking access to the medical files of women and girls who had had late-term abortions, which led to a separate lawsuit awaiting a decision by the State Supreme Court.Mr. Kline, elected in 2002, also serves as chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association and has fought against abortion throughout his career. He filed a lawsuit, recently dismissed, to challenge the state's use of Medicaid funds for abortions, and he submitted a brief in a federal case arguing that Roe v. Wade should be overturned.Last year, Mr. Kline successfully lobbied the Legislature to require that abortion providers collect fetal tissue from patients younger than 14 and turn it over to law enforcement.""He's certainly on a crusade to limit or eliminate abortion in Kansas,"" said Peter Brownlie, chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri. ""That's been a clear agenda for a long time."" Mr. Brownlie said Mr. Kline had helped make Kansas a national battlefront in the abortion debate.But the doctors, nurses, counselors and educators suing over Mr. Kline's interpretation of the reporting law say it goes far beyond abortion to include every teenager who requests birth control pills or H.I.V. testing, or who in a group therapy session even discusses ""heavy petting"" with a boyfriend or girlfriend.""If they know what they tell me is reported, they simply won't talk,"" said Beth McGilley, a Wichita therapist who is among the plaintiffs, referring to both teenage clients and adults who often consult her about their children's sexual exploration.""To me, it's violating what, quite essentially, therapy is couched in: confidentiality,"" Ms. McGilley said. ""You have two 15-year-olds mashing in the back seat of the car -- who's the criminal here? Do we really need Big Brother to decide whether or not that needs to be judiciously pursued?""'"
"'06-01-31,'0','The Hilliard Ensemble has lately been exploring the music of the Flemish composer Nicolas Gombert. His music -- in particular, his Missa Media Vita and some of his sacred motets -- is the subject of the ensemble's latest recording for ECM, and on Sunday afternoon the group sang most of the Mass, a few motets, and pieces by Josquin and Dufay as part of the Music Before 1800 series at Corpus Christi Church.Gombert is a fascinating character. He was born around 1495, reportedly studied with Josquin and thrived in the Spanish chapel of Emperor Charles V until 1540, when he was sentenced to shipboard labor for interfering with one of the choirboys. He was apparently pardoned and spent his last years as a canon at Tournai Cathedral.Like Josquin's, his music is seamless and vibrantly contrapuntal, an effect created by staggered vocal entrances and lines that remain entirely independent until a work's final phrase, when they suddenly coalesce in a rich harmony. More than Josquin, though, Gombert preferred dark timbres, and the Hilliard has added a bass-baritone (Robert Macdonald) to capture that shift.On its Gombert CD, the group sings the Mass with motets interposed. They did the same on Sunday, singing all but the Credo of the Mass, and drawing on a somewhat different motet repertory. A group of pieces from a 12th-century manuscript found at the abbey of St. Martial de Limoges revived an early form of polyphony in which the voices remained tethered together rhythmically, and which sounded strikingly primitive beside Gombert's obsessive counterpoint. And although Gombert was meant to be the composer of the day, two Josquin works -- the serene ""Tu solus qui facis mirabilia"" and a shapely, passionate setting of David's lament for Saul and Jonathan, ""Planxit autem David"" -- proved the most memorable performances.The Hilliard Ensemble's sound, as always, was beautifully blended and subtly shaped, and in this church's acoustic, which is drier than some, it was possible to focus on the individual vocal textures within that blend, an instructive experience typically lost in more ambient settings.The next installment of the Music Before 1800 series will be a cello recital by Jaap ter Linden on Feb. 12 at Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street; (212) 666-9266.'"

People who did poorly on memory tests also had a somewhat higher mortality rate.Earlier studies had reached similar conclusions, but the researchers said they were surprised to find that poor reaction times seemed to increase mortality rates even among younger study participants.The study, led by Beverly A. Shipley of the University of Edinburgh, looked at about 7,000 people over 19 years in England, Scotland and Wales.In one test, participants were asked to strike a ""0"" on a keyboard as soon as they saw one appear on a computer screen. In another, they had to quickly choose a key that matched what was shown on the screen.Experts have considered the connection between poor test scores and mortality as a reflection of the deterioration of the aging body. But that would not explain the higher mortality rates for younger people.'"

"'06-01-31,'0','In a filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Icahn said that Mr. Biondi would be paid at least $6 million if the Icahn slate failed to win and at least $10 million if the slate was elected.In the filing Mr. Icahn also responded to a recent article in The Wall Street Journal that was critical of his efforts at Time Warner. Mr. Icahn wrote that his efforts had already resulted in the company's going forward with a $12 billion stock repurchase plan.He also reiterated criticism of Mr. Parsons's management, which he said had failed to maximize shareholder value.Mr. Biondi, 61, is a well-known and well-liked figure in the media industry, though his career has had setbacks.In 1998, he was ousted by Seagram's chief executive, Edgar Bronfman Jr., in part because Universal Studios, the company's film division, had fared poorly.Two years earlier, he was pushed out as chief executive of Viacom. At that time, associates said that Sumner M. Redstone, Viacom's controlling shareholder, was unhappy because in his view Mr. Biondi had not managed the company aggressively enough.Other company executives said that Mr. Redstone simply wanted to take more direct control over the company.""This seems an odd choice,"" said Leo J. Hindery Jr., managing partner of InterMedia Partners, a media private equity firm. ""One of the reasons that Mr. Redstone let him go was because he was not an aggressive enough manager, and Mr. Icahn has stated that that is precisely what he is looking for.""Mr. Biondi did not quite see it that way. ""If you want someone to get up and shout and scream, that is not me,"" Mr. Biondi said in a telephone interview yesterday. ""If you want someone who knows the businesses and knows what can be done with them, that is me.""Since Mr. Biondi left Universal in 1998, he has been one of the partners in WaterView Advisors, a $150 million private equity firm that specializes in the media. He is also on the board of the Cablevision Systems Corporation.Mr. Biondi was brought into the Time Warner fight by his brother, Michael J. Biondi, head of investment banking at Lazard, which is working with Mr. Icahn to draw up a plan for reshaping the company. Mr. Icahn is expected to unveil those plans early next week.Frank Biondi said he had signed on because of ""the chance to work with Mike and with Carl, and it is a fairly worthy case. It is a referendum on a business strategy that has not increased shareholder value. It will correspondingly be a referendum on our proposal to increase it.""Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at Pali Research, an independent research firm, said, ""There is now a face to the Icahn push.""But he added: ""Mr. Biondi has been largely on the sidelines of the entertainment business for the last seven years. He is being positioned to implement the plan now being drawn up by Mr. Icahn and his bankers at Lazard Freres. The plan is far more important than Frank Biondi. The question is whether the plan will have enough meat to generate investor support.""'"
"'06-01-31,'0','Despite the neighbors' watchful eyes, however, something terrible happened in that apartment over the past weekend.In the early hours yesterday, the authorities say, the body of Quachon Browne was removed from the home. A law enforcement official said Ms. Smith told the police that the boy had been struck by a falling television. Ms. Smith and her new live-in boyfriend, Jose Calderon, 18, were taken in for questioning.Yesterday, neighbors described a spirited group of children who had the run of the apartment, which was usually slightly messy but not extremely so, for a large family living in a small space. The children could be often seen leaning out the window over the sidewalk and playing in the hallways; sometimes the little ones had little or no clothing. Ms. Smith welcomed neighbors' help.But last night a neighbor, Ronald Overton, 39, said rotting food could be smelled in the apartment while detectives were inside, scraping vomit and blood from the floor. He said detectives told him Quachon had been found lying in feces and vomit.Just before 10:30 p.m., police carried out bags of evidence, many with orange biohazard stickers, as well as what appeared to be a television set wrapped in brown paper.Community helpfulness seemed to melt when Ms. Smith met Jose Calderon and let him move into her two-bedroom apartment. Manny Brown, the father to three of Ms. Smith's children -- Quachon and two sisters -- has been in jail at Rikers Island for about seven months on a robbery charge.Mr. Calderon was known on the block as P.R., having come from Puerto Rico two years earlier, and was known for having epileptic seizures and for his temper, neighbors said. When he moved in, he brought along his pit bull, Blue.""I told Aleshia, 'You're crazy letting that pit bull in with those babies,' but she said, 'No, it's O.K., it's Jose's,' "" recalled Mr. Overton's wife, Lisa Cashin Overton, 34. ""He set up a section of the apartment with only his stuff and told the children they were forbidden to go near it.""Ms. Cashin Overton described Mr. Calderon as ""very controlling."" Soon, Ms. Smith stopped seeing her friends. Fewer visitors were welcome.""He had a temper, and when he didn't get his way, he'd explode,"" said Ms. Cashin Overton, who no longer allowed her 8-year-old to play with Ms. Smith's children.Mr. Banks called Mr. Calderon extremely strict and overbearing, but not physically abusive.""I warned him, 'They are not your children, and if you don't ease up on them, I'll take care of you myself,' "" he said.But Carmelo Conde, 30, a friend of Mr. Calderon's, said Mr. Calderon was helping to support and care for the children. Mr. Conde said he was eating dinner with Mr. Calderon on Friday night at the family's apartment while Ms. Smith was out shopping.""We heard a boom in the other room and heard Quachon screaming,"" he said. ""We went over there, and I just saw the TV on top of the baby. He seemed O.K., though. He slept for a little while, but was up later running around like nothing happened.""He added: ""I told Jose, 'You got to take him to the hospital and make sure he's all right,' but he said, 'Nah, I'm going to wait till later.' ""Some neighbors recalled an incident in June when Ms. Smith left the children alone, possibly overnight, and the children were taken away in police cars but later returned.""I remember she left them alone and the baby needed changing and the kids were out of diapers,"" said a neighbor, Celia Colon.Correction: February 2, 2006, Thursday Two articles on Tuesday about a 4-year-old Bronx boy who died after suffering a fractured skull and severe lacerations to his liver misspelled his given name. He was Quachaun Browne, not Quachon.'"
"'06-01-31,'0','I never learned the origin of my patient's virulent anti-Semitism -- some of my colleagues have argued that such bigotry is itself a kind of mental illness -- but it was expressed in nearly every letter I received. ""Jews don't live long"" or ""The Jews must pay for killing our Lord"" were typical themes.But my patient was far too clever to make any direct threats against me. He knew that if he did so, we would have grounds to petition the court for an involuntary commitment. No, his threats were allusive, oblique and sometimes baroquely ingenious, along the lines of ""Sic transit piesius Monday."" Thus Pies will die on Monday? Who knew?With each such veiled threat, our clinical staff met to assess the actual danger. We never had enough evidence to fill out a so-called pink paper for involuntary hospitalization. My patient understood this well, and usually presented himself wearing a compressed cat-who-ate-the canary grin.And yet, in our sessions, the man was a model of refined politesse. Our dialogues went something like this:""So tell me, Doctor,"" he would say, removing his glasses for emphasis, ""What do you think of St. Anselm's argument proving the existence of God? Don't you think it is transparently circular?""Because my patient had refused virtually all my medical instructions and recommendations -- including my repeated pleas that he take adequate doses of an antipsychotic medication -- I decided I would engage him on the level he seemed to desire. And since theology has been a longstanding interest of mine, this was not entirely unpleasant.""Well,"" I would reply, ""as far as Anselm goes, it does seem circular to begin by assuming the existence of the very being whose existence is in doubt.""""Ah!"" my patient would exclaim, extending his glasses toward me. ""Just so, Doctor, just so!""The rock-hard facade of his psychosis never opened to reveal any inkling of pain, loneliness or despair, yet I suspected that these currents ran deep in him. Once, when he complained that he missed his old books on theology, I offered to lend him some of mine. He stared at me for a moment with a mixture of astonishment and rage -- how dare I bestow an act of kindness upon him! -- and then said simply, ""That would be acceptable, Doctor.""Over the course of a year, I developed a peculiar fondness for this brilliant and tortured man. I never replied to any of his threatening letters, and he, in turn, never lifted a finger against me. (It is, after all, a myth that psychiatric patients are a dangerous and violent lot.)When his letters were reasonable, and even gracious, I would respond in kind. He got no better, but he grew no worse.Finally, I had to inform my patient that I was leaving the center for another position. He grew very still during this last session, as if drawing a cloak around his vulnerability. On his way out the door, he extended his hand to me for the last time -- a cold and frail bit of bone -- and said, ""I do have a very serious illness, don't I, Doctor?""'"

"'06-01-31,'0','Mr. Lay, speaking to a throng of news media gathered behind a metal barricade, said: ""We are pleased with the outcome. My fate and Mr. Skilling's are in their hands.""Mr. Lay arrived early Monday, walking briskly past a phalanx of cameras, tightly clutching the hand of his wife, Linda, and looking downward. When a journalist yelled from the crowd, asking if this trial would be ""a chance to clear your name,"" he called back, ""It certainly is.""Inside the courtroom, Mr. Lay appeared tired and kept mostly to himself on one end of a table, tapping a pen and flipping through a yellow legal pad, talking little with his lawyers. At another table, Mr. Skilling used a laptop to watch the live feed of the court reporter's transcript of the conferences between the judge and prospective jurors.The rapid jury selection set the stage for the much-anticipated trial of Enron's former top brass to begin Tuesday with opening statements.The trial of Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay, the two men most directly responsible for Enron's meteoric rise from a stodgy pipeline company into an energy-trading powerhouse, is the culmination of four years of investigation by the government's Enron Task Force into the company's spectacular bankruptcy filing in December 2001.Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling are accused of participating in a suspected conspiracy to defraud Enron and mislead investors about the true health of the company's businesses. Mr. Skilling, 52, is charged with 31 counts of conspiracy, fraud and insider trading. Mr. Lay, 63, is charged with seven counts of conspiracy and fraud.Judge Lake held true to his promise, made last week, that he would strive to seat a jury in one day. He made it clear to the full panel of 96 prospective jurors gathered in the morning that the court was ""not looking for people that want to punish anyone or seek vengeance"" against Enron for the company's failure.The 96 jurors had survived from an original pool of 400 jurors selected randomly from among registered voters. Lawyers on both sides had whittled the pool using responses to a 14-page questionnaire sent out in November. Judge Lake questioned the prospective jurors one by one at the bench, out of earshot of reporters and others in the court, including Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling. Lawyers from both sides were allowed to ask prospective jurors follow-up questions. They typically spent less than 10 minutes with each prospective juror.At 4 p.m. Judge Lake announced that the panel had been narrowed to 38 and gave the defense and prosecution 40 minutes to decide on their final strikes. An hour later, the jury had been seated.Legal scholars and jury consultants have expressed surprise that Judge Lake would seek to seat a jury in one day for such a complex trial. The judge himself estimated on Monday that the trial would take four months.""It's unusual, given the projected length of the trial and the obvious complexity as well as the rampant notoriety,"" said Jonathan N. Halpern, a former federal prosecutor who is a partner at the law firm Winston & Strawn. ""But to a certain extent it is to be applauded for efficiency and for moving the trial process along.""The lawyers for Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay, who are reportedly spending more than $20 million on their joint defense, twice tried to move the trial to other cities and fought for more time to question jurors individually. But Judge Lake, 61, a Ronald Reagan appointee known for his blistering efficiency, rejected those requests. He said in court that the detailed nature of the jury questionnaire, which asked jurors 16 specific questions about Enron out of 76 total questions and included queries about the people jurors admired the most and the least, had done much of the work in culling the prospective pool.Still, a number of jurors in the morning told the judge that they knew several of the pastors on the witness list for the defense, and other potential witnesses.Judge Lake did not impose particularly harsh protections on the jurors, who will be reimbursed for ""reasonable"" travel expenses -- ""don't go out and buy a Lexus,"" he jokingly cautioned -- but will not be bused or sequestered. The judge carefully safeguarded the privacy of the jurors, admonishing those who accidentally uttered their names instead of their badge numbers when asked questions.Handling juries has proved a delicate matter for judges in other high-profile cases. In the first trial of L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former Tyco chief executive, in 2004, loose protection of jurors' identities allowed two newspapers to learn the identity of a juror and publish it, leading to a mistrial in the six-month trial. In the trial against Martha Stewart that same year, the judge in the case banned reporters from jury selection, saying it could impede Ms. Stewart's chances of getting a fair trial with an impartial jury.The Enron trial is already attracting a crowd. The federal courthouse was teeming with members of the news media. A line to secure just eight seats reserved for journalists in the courtroom began forming at 6 p.m. Sunday, when two people working for Bloomberg news agency began camping out. Other reporters arrived as early as 3 a.m. By 5 a.m. all 8 spots were gone. Reporters who did not make the cut had to watch the trial on a closed-circuit television.Outside on Monday, the scene took on a carnival-like atmosphere. David Tonsall, who said he worked at Enron from 1997 until its collapse, handed out copies of a rap CD entitled ""Corporate nRun America,"" while a friend played tracks from a boom box. Mr. Tonsall, whose rap name is ""nRun,"" said the CD was about his post-Enron experiences and feelings.Four mounted Houston police hired by the United States Marshals Service flanked Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay as they entered and exited the courthouse. At one point, Mr. Lay looked up at one of the police on horseback and said, ""Thank you.""'"

"'06-01-31,'0','Jim Manley, a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, agreed. ""It was a classic rope-a-dope,"" Mr. Manley said, referring to the boxing tactic of leaning against the ropes to let an opponent exhaust himself punching.Some Republican Senate staff members said they initially worried that Judge Alito might be too nervous to perform well under the pressure of the hearings. In one of his early meetings with a Senate Republican, Judge Alito's hands shook as he compulsively tied and untied the lace of one shoe. Both Republican and Democratic staff members in the Senate spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from their bosses.Judge Alito's political naïveté led to at least one early miscue. Unaccustomed to attention from the news media, Judge Alito looked surprised when White House aides advised him to dispatch a relative to guard his 90-year-old mother from inquiring journalists, one administration official said.The next day, The Associated Press quoted his mother saying, ""Of course, he is against abortion,"" -- the first chink in his supporters' portrait of him as an impartial jurist with no preconceived views. Judge Alito shyly acknowledged that he had not managed to get a relative to her door, the administration official said.But Democrats, expecting a firebrand, came out swinging even before the nomination was announced. As President Bush prepared to announce a nominee three months ago, Mr. Reid vowed a vigorous fight if the president chose Judge Alito.""I think it would create a lot of problems,"" he told CNN the night before Judge Alito was named.But mindful of the need to enlist both moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats in any successful effort to block Judge Alito, liberal groups and Senate Democrats kept pushing for new points of attack other than the divisive subject of abortion rights, a strategy that at times detracted from the coherence of their message.Their most indefatigable strategist was James Flug, a longtime friend of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts who, at 67, was decades older than most of the other legal counsels on the Judiciary Committee staff. Mr. Flug first worked for Mr. Kennedy 35 years ago when they led a liberal minority of senators to block the Supreme Court nominations of Judges G. Harrold Carswell and Clement F. Haynsworth Jr., in both cases by mobilizing a coalition of civil rights groups and unearthing embarrassing aspects of the nominees' records.Among other things, several Democratic aides said, Mr. Flug drove the investigation into Judge Alito's failure to recuse himself, as he had pledged to do during his court of appeals confirmation hearing, from cases involving his mutual fund company, Vanguard. But Mr. Flug met with polite skepticism from many of his colleagues.""You are going to ask more questions about that oversight where Alito made no money?"" a staff member for another Democratic senator said he asked Mr. Flug.""It became clear to us early on,"" the staff member added, ""that the guy may be way too far right for our tastes, but we think the guy is a man of honor.""Mr. Flug also led the investigation into the background of Judge Alito's membership in Concerned Alumni of Princeton, a conservative group that had opposed the university's affirmative action policies and its admission of women. For weeks, he even tried to persuade the staff of Republican senators that the matter could be a serious concern, said Republican Judiciary Committee aides, until in December the Republicans sent a researcher to review the group's records and found no mention of Judge Alito.Still, Mr. Kennedy made Concerned Alumni a major focus of his questioning at the confirmation hearings, even threatening to interrupt the proceedings unless the committee issued a subpoena for another set of the group's records. But the move backfired when the records turned out to be readily available and also did not include any reference to Judge Alito.Laura Capps, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kennedy, said it was wrong to single out any one on his staff. ""Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and Americans across the country -- raised these alarming issues about Judge Alito's record and rightly so,"" Ms. Capps said. ""And we deserved to get the answers that Judge Alito failed to provide.""In an interview over the weekend, Mr. Kennedy acknowledged that the Democrats had invested too much in the Vanguard and alumni group matters at the expense of making a more coherent case against Judge Alito on substantive issues..""Clearly we could have done better,"" Mr. Kennedy said, singling out the judge's record on civil rights.By the afternoon of the second day of Judge Alito's testimony, senior Democratic aides were already conceding privately that their hopes of stopping him were essentially lost.Instead of a fearsome ""Scalito"" whom Democrats had initially expected, Judge Alito appeared timid and bland in the face of the Democratic questions, the aides said. ""Instead of some brash, confrontational figure in the mold of Robert Bork, we got a quiet, studious guy you almost felt sorry for,"" Mr. Manley said.'"
"'06-01-31,'0','Many drug industry issues are on legislative agendas again this year. And this Friday in New York, an association of lawmakers from New York, West Virginia, eight other states and the District of Columbia plan to meet to discuss their plans for pursuing industry regulation.Some of those 600 proposals around the country last year were pro-industry, including efforts to protect manufacturers from product liability claims and expand access to brand-name drugs. But the states also tread on crack-down territory that, in other eras, had been considered federal turf, like measures to regulate the drug industry through cost-cutting, limits on advertising and requirements that the results of clinical trials be disclosed.The drug industry, which has managed to stave off federal price control, has also been successful in defeating many of the toughest state measures. Its best-publicized victory came after it spent an estimated $80 million to help defeat California's Proposition 79, which was modeled after Maine's plan, and to promote its own alternative ballot initiative. Neither was adopted.Despite the industry's successes, several states have passed laws that represent a barely perceptible shift toward regulation -- something that could end up looking like rate-setting for a public utility, in which the needs of users are balanced against the supplier's right to a fair return.It is a trend that elicits fear and loathing among drug makers. Billy Tauzin, the former Republican congressman from Louisiana who runs the industry's big trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, lambastes the idea of price controls every chance he gets. In the industry's view, such control would stifle the innovation needed to develop life-saving drugs.""We're going to continue to aggressively try to defeat what we consider bad legislation,"" said Ken Johnson, senior vice president of the trade group, which is known as PhRMA (pronounced FARM-ah).Some local lawmakers like David Catania, a District of Columbia councilman, describe laws to control pharmaceutical costs as part of a grass-roots movement that will spread and eventually force national price controls.""What we're doing is chipping away at the privilege that the pharmaceutical industry has, day by day,"" said Mr. Catania, who complains that District of Columbia residents pay the fourth- or fifth-highest drug costs in the country.PhRMA recently sued to block a price-control law adopted by the District of Columbia council. A federal judge ruled in late December in the drug organization's favor. The district has not yet said if it will appeal.PhRMA will not disclose how much it is spending to influence state legislation, and Mr. Johnson denies that the industry employs an army of lobbyists. But given signs of the group's expansion, it is likely that its state advocacy budget has grown since 2003, when The New York Times reported that it was $48.7 million. PhRMA has recently opened two regional offices, in Indianapolis and in Baton Rouge, La., adding to eight other such offices around the country. Mr. Johnson likens the field offices to World War II listening posts.""If you have just one office in Washington, D.C., you're so insulated from what's happening in the heartland of America,"" said Mr. Johnson, who says the regional offices help the industry understand issues at the state and local level.""We have ongoing efforts in all 50 states,"" Mr. Johnson said, adding that, at times, some states require extra attention.Take West Virginia. There, nine lobbyists have registered on behalf of PhRMA, while individual pharmaceutical companies employ 24 lobbyists in the state, according to state records. Mr. Johnson said that four of the registered PhRMA lobbyists were local people under retainer, while the others were PhRMA employees who might visit the state only occasionally.In many other ways, West Virginia -- where mountain vistas display a hinterland unmarred by development -- seems stuck in a simpler time. For one thing, the terrorism threat is deemed so low that state lawmakers have never financed X-ray machines or metal detectors at the limestone Capitol building. Visitors may enter at will.But those same lawmakers have decreed that the state, where a relatively old, poor and sick population means high health spending, will be in the vanguard in at least one area: controlling prescription drug costs.Robert S. Kiss, speaker of the House of Delegates, who sponsored the 2004 legislation that set up a state Pharmaceutical Cost Management Council, says that a ""revolution"" is necessary to control costs to state residents. ""The feds have basically punted on the issue of cost containment,"" Mr. Kiss said.Gov. Joe Manchin III appointed Mr. Brown, a pharmacist, last year to the post of pharmaceutical advocate, which functions essentially as an executive director for the council.Mr. Brown, who resigned in November, said the criticism over that round of golf had no effect on his decision to leave only 10 months after taking the job. He is simply more comfortable at a pharmacist's bench than in the political arena, he said.But Mr. Brown was also criticized for the council's slow pace under his leadership. At one point, a local newspaper referred to the council as ""moribund.""The 11-member council, made up of the heads of six state departments and five appointed public members, must accomplish whatever it will before a sunset provision that will put it out of business in 2008. And some members of the council have complained that the pharmaceutical industry -- in contrast to its splashy advertising campaign in California and its tough litigation strategy in Washington -- is trying to kill cost regulation in West Virginia via slow death.""They've been successful in slowing down the process,"" said Dr. Foster, the state senator, who does not serve on the panel but frequently attends its meetings.On a recent Friday afternoon, as the council discussed federal drug pricing and briefly considered a proposal that West Virginia make it easier to import cheaper drugs from Canada, the room was lined with industry lobbyists.But the industry worries even more about a proposed regulation, already adopted in principal but not yet formally written into law, that would force drug makers to disclose details of their marketing activities. Companies would have to disclose their advertising expenses in West Virginia, as well as the number of sales people they have operating in the state, their salary ranges, their minimum requirements for getting the jobs and a listing of the gifts they give to doctors.""The public doesn't realize how much money is spent on selling to doctors, probably two to two and a half times the amount spent on advertising,"" Dr. Foster said. In a letter to the council in November, Marjorie E. Powell, PhRMA's senior assistant general counsel, argued that the marketing disclosure requirement overstepped the council's authority. Her letter also pointed out that the industry had donated more than $55 million in free drugs to West Virginians in the last year.The council approved the disclosure rules in December, but several council members expect the industry to try to get them watered down by a legislative committee before they go into effect in 2007.Mr. Brown, who views the disclosure requirement as the crowning achievement of his tenure as pharmaceutical advocate, said critics of the drug industry viewed marketing and advertising disclosure as an important step in controlling costs. ""They see it as one of the first dominoes,"" he said, ""to get disclosure on the advertising costs.""'"

"'06-01-31,'0','Ali Allawi, the Iraqi finance minister, said in a telephone interview over the weekend, ""I think you're seeing chaos, basically,"" and added, ""No matter how you cut it, it's very poor project design and implementation.""Mr. Allawi said the American administration brought with it a contracting procedure that may have worked in the orderly environment of the United States. ""Once you brought it in the context of Iraq,"" Mr. Allawi said, ""it fell flat on its face.""As an example of the findings, Mr. Meehan cited a contract for a hospital. ""We come across this contract,"" he said, and when he and a team of Iraqis he led checked into the project, ""we find nothing.""""We find no indication of the project being done,"" he said.But he said that in other cases, contractors had carried out the work. ""A lot of times they did, a lot of times they didn't,"" Mr. Meehan said. ""It was definitely in disarray and a mess.""Maj. Gen. John M. Urias, who leads the Joint Contracting Command, which carried out the examination, declined to discuss findings on individual contracts but said the main outcome of the examination was a ""reconciliation"" between the Iraqi money that had been set aside for the contracts and the money that is owed for work actually performed.General Urias said his auditors had determined that there was no justification for paying about $230 million originally committed to the thousands of contracts. He characterized the reconciliation as a routine practice in contracting and said that the outcome of the examination was entirely positive, since the money would now be freed for other purposes. Iraqi oil proceeds are kept in an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Mr. Meehan also characterized the examination as a ""good news story,"" because it effectively involves giving Iraqi money back to Iraqis. But he said that in case after case, the residual money reflected work that had been abandoned, only partly carried out or simply lost in the confusion of a nation at war. ""There was a breakdown in the middle administrative system,"" Mr. Meehan said.By agreement with Mr. Allawi's Finance Ministry, General Urias said, $150 million of that money will now be used for rebuilding projects in areas damaged by fighting, including $75 million in Anbar Province, which includes Falluja, which was heavily damaged in a siege by the United States to root out insurgents.""It's a good story, a good point, that the Iraqis are going to be the beneficiary of new projects using Iraqi money that was residual after the execution of those contracts back in the C.P.A. days,"" the general said, referring to the Coalition Provisional Authority.Mr. Allawi said the Iraqi government had agreed to allow the money to be used for repairing war damage only on condition that the United States match, dollar for dollar, all expenditures made from the residual fund. General Urias did not immediately respond to a written request for further information on the arrangement described by Mr. Allawi.But the general said in an interview that the careful work of assessing the contracts would also allow the United States to turn over responsibility for them to the Iraqi government eventually.Representative Henry A. Waxman, a Democrat from California who is the ranking minority member of the House Committee on Government Reform, said in a statement that the new findings pointed up the need for a wider investigation of how Iraqi money was used to underwrite contracts in Iraq. ""This is far from a complete accounting,"" he said. ""We still don't know how many millions were wasted on contractor overcharges and shoddy work. Congress should conduct a thorough investigation into the administration's use of Iraqi funds.""General Urias said that the examination began in March 2005 with 2,400 contracts totaling $3.3 billion, but that the effort quickly expanded when his team started collecting contracts written in areas outside Iraq. He said the effort started with 13 contracting experts from the Defense Contract Management Agency at the Pentagon and gradually hired and trained 26 local Iraqis.So far, the general said, all but about 100 of the 9,000 known contracts have been looked at, and what he called the residual, or money left over after work was done, worked out.""Sometimes when you finish the work, it didn't cost as much as you thought it would,"" General Urias said. ""It's an estimate.""Mr. Allawi also said that reconciling the amount set aside for the contracts in what he called a ""subaccount"" at the Federal Reserve Bank and the amount that actually needed to be paid amounted to standard practice in the contracting world. But he added that the specific findings in the audit would do little to improve contracting procedures. ""Very little of it filters back into Iraq and very little of it has any impact,"" he said.""It just confirms the general sense that Iraqi government money has been squandered,"" Mr. Allawi said.Mr. Meehan, who said that he led a team of 13 Iraqis in carrying out the work, added that some of the findings baffled his team. In one case, a particular contracting officer from the Pentagon wrote dozens of contracts for roads, bridges and hospitals but little or none of the work was ever performed, Mr. Meehan said.In another development, the Halliburton Company subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root has agreed to cut $9 million from contracts paid for with Iraqi oil money after auditors questioned $208 million in possible overcharges, an international watchdog agency said yesterday.Melissa Norcross, a K.B.R. spokeswoman, said the sums had been questioned because of a lack of supporting documentation and called it ""flat wrong"" to describe them as overcharges, Reuters reported.'"

"'06-01-31,'0','The report said caseworkers had failed to react to warning signs of a ""crisis mounting in the household,"" including Nixzmary's extended absences from school, strange behavior by the girl's mother and an inability to gain access to the child's Brooklyn apartment to check on her. A summary accompanying the report said caseworkers had taken weeks to contact the school guidance counselor who had initially reported Nixzmary's prolonged absence.On Jan. 10, an agency supervisor instructed caseworkers to go to Nixzmary's home that night, but they never went, the report said. Instead, a caseworker went to the apartment the next morning, discovered ambulances and police officers at the scene, ""and was informed that Nixzmary had died.""During testimony before the City Council's General Welfare Committee yesterday, Mr. Mattingly pinpointed ""two lost opportunities,"" in which, he said, ""we were in a position to protect Nixzmary and were not able to get the job done.""The first opportunity, he said, came in May, when a guidance counselor at the girl's school reported that the child had missed 46 days and had sustained a burn to her hand, among other injuries. But after a two extensive reviews, the agency determined that Nixzmary was not suffering educational neglect and that her absences had been due to her mother's inability to get her to school during her pregnancy.""There is no way you can unfound an educational neglect case when a child has missed 46 days of school,"" Mr. Mattingly said yesterday. He said the agency was considering new procedures requiring more aggressive investigation in such cases.The second missed opportunity, Mr. Mattingly said, started with school officials again reporting suspicions of abuse in early December. Mr. Mattingly said during his testimony that caseworkers had moved quickly, but inadequately, to investigate. For one, he said, caseworkers should have been more diligent in pursuing a court order giving them access to Nixzmary's home after Mr. Rodriguez refused to let them in.And the revelations about the police handling of the case came amid simmering tensions between the Police Department and the child welfare agency. While agency workers said that detectives had spoken to Mr. Rodriguez for 15 minutes, City Hall officials appeared to partly back up the Police Department's account, saying that one of the detectives involved in the case may have at one point been in the same room with Mr. Rodriguez during a meeting at her school -- but that it was still unclear how extensively the two had spoken at the time, if at all.During the hearing yesterday, City Council officials called for a protocol requiring high-level attention in cases where child welfare workers are barred from entering homes with suspected child abuse. ""Why wouldn't that immediately send up every red flag there is?"" said the committee's chairman, Bill de Blasio.But Mr. Mattingly pointed to several other problems, as well. He said that upon receiving the new complaint in December, authorities failed to form the sort of emergency response team of police detectives and caseworkers that is required in cases determined to be the most serious. Mr. Mattingly said in his testimony yesterday that appeared to be ""a mutual decision.""Case notes indicate that the child welfare official in charge of initiating such an ""instant response team"" had moved to do so, the report found, ""but this was later contradicted in an interview where she clarified that the discussion with Detective F. concluded the case not to be an I.R.T.,"" the abbreviation for the emergency team. Detective F. is not more fully identified in the report.Speaking with reporters later, Mr. Mattingly said, ""There's no question in my mind that our team and police decided jointly not to make it into a formal I.R.T. case.""City officials said it was clear that protocols had not been followed and that such a decision should not rest with the police anyway -- it should rest with child services officials.But this, too, was part of a litany of lost chances, according to the report, which officials stressed was preliminary and could change in its final incarnation.The report lists several calls from school officials alerting caseworkers in mid- and late December to Nixzmary's continued absences.And, the chronology ends by describing how a manager directed a caseworker return to Nixzmary's home the night of Jan. 10, but in consultation with others, the caseworker decided to go the following morning instead. It was that night when the tumult began that led to her death, discovered in the early morning hours of Jan. 11.'"
